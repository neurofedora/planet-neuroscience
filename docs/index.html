              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21507">Automatic detection of abnormal clinical EEG: comparison of a finetuned foundation model with two deep learning models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.21507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used by physicians for the diagnosis of numerous neurological disorders. Due to the large volume of EEGs requiring interpretation and the specific expertise involved, artificial intelligence-based tools are being developed to assist in their visual analysis. In this paper, we compare two deep learning models (CNN-LSTM and Transformer-based) with BioSerenity-E1, a recently proposed foundation model, in the task of classifying entire EEG recordings as normal or abnormal. The three models were trained or finetuned on 2,500 EEG recordings and their performances were evaluated on two private and one public datasets: a large multicenter dataset annotated by a single specialist (dataset A composed of n = 4,480 recordings), a small multicenter dataset annotated by three specialists (dataset B, n = 198), and the Temple University Abnormal (TUAB) EEG corpus evaluation dataset (n = 276). On dataset A, the three models achieved at least 86% balanced accuracy, with BioSerenity-E1 finetuned achieving the highest balanced accuracy (89.19% [88.36-90.41]). BioSerenity-E1 finetuned also achieved the best performance on dataset B, with 94.63% [92.32-98.12] balanced accuracy. The models were then validated on TUAB evaluation dataset, whose corresponding training set was not used during training, where they achieved at least 76% accuracy. Specifically, BioSerenity-E1 finetuned outperformed the other two models, reaching an accuracy of 82.25% [78.27-87.48]. Our results highlight the usefulness of leveraging pre-trained models for automatic EEG classification: enabling robust and efficient interpretation of EEG data with fewer resources and broader applicability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22047">Organizational Regularities in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that the dynamical regime of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - ranging from oscillatory to chaotic and fixpoint behavior - can be controlled by the global distribution of weights in connection matrices with statistically independent elements. However, it remains unclear how network dynamics respond to organizational regularities in the weight matrix, as often observed in biological neural networks. Here, we investigate three such regularities: (1) monopolar output weights per neuron, in accordance with Dale's principle, (2) reciprocal symmetry between neuron pairs, as in Hopfield networks, and (3) modular structure, where strongly connected blocks are embedded in a background of weaker connectivity. We construct weight matrices in which the strength of each regularity can be continuously tuned via control parameters, and analyze how key dynamical signatures of the RNN evolve as a function of these parameters. Moreover, using the RNN for actual information processing in a reservoir computing framework, we study how each regularity affects performance. We find that Dale monopolarity and modularity significantly enhance task accuracy, while Hopfield reciprocity tends to reduce it by promoting early saturation, limiting reservoir flexibility.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22112">Visual Large Language Models Exhibit Human-Level Cognitive Flexibility in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive flexibility has been extensively studied in human cognition but remains relatively unexplored in the context of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs). This study assesses the cognitive flexibility of state-of-the-art VLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro, and Claude-3.5 Sonnet) using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a classic measure of set-shifting ability. Our results reveal that VLLMs achieve or surpass human-level set-shifting capabilities under chain-of-thought prompting with text-based inputs. However, their abilities are highly influenced by both input modality and prompting strategy. In addition, we find that through role-playing, VLLMs can simulate various functional deficits aligned with patients having impairments in cognitive flexibility, suggesting that VLLMs may possess a cognitive architecture, at least regarding the ability of set-shifting, similar to the brain. This study reveals the fact that VLLMs have already approached the human level on a key component underlying our higher cognition, and highlights the potential to use them to emulate complex brain processes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22146">Flexible Tool Selection through Low-dimensional Attribute Alignment of Vision and Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22373">Synaptic shot-noise triggers fast and slow global oscillations in balanced neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural dynamics is determined by the transmission of discrete synaptic pulses (synaptic shot-noise) among neurons. However, the neural responses are usually obtained within the diffusion approximation modeling synaptic inputs as continuous Gaussian noise. Here, we present a rigorous mean-field theory that encompasses synaptic shot-noise for sparse balanced inhibitory neural networks driven by an excitatory drive. Our theory predicts new dynamical regimes, in agreement with numerical simulations, which are not captured by the classical diffusion approximation. Notably, these regimes feature self-sustained global oscillations emerging at low connectivity (in-degree) via either continuous or hysteretic transitions and characterized by irregular neural activity, as expected for balanced dynamics. For sufficiently weak (strong) excitatory drive (inhibitory feedback) the transition line displays a peculiar re-entrant shape revealing the existence of global oscillations at low and high in-degrees, separated by an asynchronous regime at intermediate levels of connectivity. The mechanisms leading to the emergence of these global oscillations are distinct: drift-driven at high connectivity and cluster activation at low connectivity. The frequency of these two kinds of global oscillations can be varied from slow (around 1 Hz) to fast (around 100 Hz), without altering their microscopic and macroscopic features, by adjusting the excitatory drive and the synaptic inhibition strength in a prescribed way. Furthermore, the cluster-activated oscillations at low in-degrees could correspond to the gamma rhythms reported in mammalian cortex and hippocampus and attributed to ensembles of inhibitory neurons sharing few synaptic connections [G. Buzsaki and X.-J. Wang, Annual Review of Neuroscience 35, 203 (2012)].

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22563">Do Large Language Models Think Like the Brain? Sentence-Level Evidence from fMRI and Hierarchical Embeddings</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain converge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and important question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns observed in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper alignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study focuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models, systematically investigating how hierarchical representations in LLMs align with the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By comparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI data collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative story, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to precisely identify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region activations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the evolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies, particularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at higher semantic abstraction levels.

                arXiv:2306.11965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex presents challenges and raises questions. What are the significant scales--micro, meso, or macroscopic? What are the interactions--pairwise, higher order, or mean-field? And what control parameters are relevant--noisy, dissipative, or emergent?
  We suggest an approach inspired by advances in understanding matter. This involves identifying invariances in neuron ensemble dynamics, searching for order parameters connecting key degrees of freedom and distinguishing macroscopic states, and pinpointing broken symmetries to uncover emergent laws when neurons interact and coordinate.
  Using multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure population-level ensemble Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) balance, differing from the input-level E/I balance of single neurons, to study collective behavior in large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (during wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify pathological broken symmetries that result in states like seizures.

                arXiv:2409.16322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Different from conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Therefore, simplistic binary AD classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class heterogeneity and instance-level imbalance. In this work, we found using a sample score estimator can generate sample-specific soft scores aligning with cognitive scores. We subsequently propose two simple yet effective methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Based on the ADReSS and CU-MARVEL corpora, we demonstrated and analyzed the advantages of the proposed approaches in detection performance. These findings provide insights for developing robust and reliable AD detection models.

                arXiv:2501.15925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging as a brain-inspired alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), prized for their potential energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware. Despite this, SNNs often suffer from accuracy degradation compared to ANNs and face deployment challenges due to fixed inference timesteps, which require retraining for adjustments, limiting operational flexibility. To address these issues, our work considers the spatio-temporal property inherent in SNNs, and proposes a novel distillation framework for deep SNNs that optimizes performance across full-range timesteps without specific retraining, enhancing both efficacy and deployment adaptability. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validations to illustrate that training guarantees the convergence of all implicit models across full-range timesteps. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among distillation-based SNNs training methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Intelli-Chip-Lab/snn\_temporal\_decoupling\_distillation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21901">Symbolically Regressing Fish Biomass Spectral Data: A Linear Genetic Programming Method with Tunable Primitives</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques play an important role in analyzing spectral data. The spectral data of fish biomass is useful in fish production, as it carries many important chemistry properties of fish meat. However, it is challenging for existing machine learning techniques to comprehensively discover hidden patterns from fish biomass spectral data since the spectral data often have a lot of noises while the training data are quite limited. To better analyze fish biomass spectral data, this paper models it as a symbolic regression problem and solves it by a linear genetic programming method with newly proposed tunable primitives. In the symbolic regression problem, linear genetic programming automatically synthesizes regression models based on the given primitives and training data. The tunable primitives further improve the approximation ability of the regression models by tuning their inherent coefficients. Our empirical results over ten fish biomass targets show that the proposed method improves the overall performance of fish biomass composition prediction. The synthesized regression models are compact and have good interpretability, which allow us to highlight useful features over the spectrum. Our further investigation also verifies the good generality of the proposed method across various spectral data treatments and other symbolic regression problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21903">Enhanced Ideal Objective Vector Estimation for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.21903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal objective vector, which comprises the optimal values of the $m$ objective functions in an $m$-objective optimization problem, is an important concept in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Accurate estimation of this vector has consistently been a crucial task, as it is frequently used to guide the search process and normalize the objective space. Prevailing estimation methods all involve utilizing the best value concerning each objective function achieved by the individuals in the current or accumulated population. However, this paper reveals that the population-based estimation method can only work on simple problems but falls short on problems with substantial bias. The biases in multi-objective optimization problems can be divided into three categories, and an analysis is performed to illustrate how each category hinders the estimation of the ideal objective vector. Subsequently, a set of test instances is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the impact of various biases on the ideal objective vector estimation method. Beyond that, a plug-and-play component called enhanced ideal objective vector estimation (EIE) is introduced for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). EIE features adaptive and fine-grained searches over $m$ subproblems defined by the extreme weighted sum method. EIE finally outputs $m$ solutions that can well approximate the ideal objective vector. In the experiments, EIE is integrated into three representative MOEAs. To demonstrate the wide applicability of EIE, algorithms are tested not only on the newly proposed test instances but also on existing ones. The results consistently show that EIE improves the ideal objective vector estimation and enhances the MOEA's performance.

                arXiv:2505.21991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic programming has undergone rapid development in recent years. However, theoretical studies of genetic programming are far behind. One of the major obstacles to theoretical studies is the challenge of developing a model to describe the relationship between fitness values and program genotypes. In this paper, we take linear genetic programming (LGP) as an example to study the fitness-to-genotype relationship. We find that the fitness expectation increases with fitness supremum over instruction editing distance, considering 1) the fitness supremum linearly increases with the instruction editing distance in LGP, 2) the fitness infimum is fixed, and 3) the fitness probabilities over different instruction editing distances are similar. We then extend these findings to explain the bloat effect and the minimum hitting time of LGP based on instruction editing distance. The bloat effect happens because it is more likely to produce better offspring by adding instructions than by removing them, given an instruction editing distance from the optimal program. The analysis of the minimum hitting time suggests that for a basic LGP genetic operator (i.e., freemut), maintaining a necessarily small program size and mutating multiple instructions each time can improve LGP performance. The reported empirical results verify our hypothesis.

                arXiv:2505.22035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal processing is vital for extracting meaningful information from time-varying signals. Recent advancements in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown immense promise in efficiently processing these signals. However, progress in this field has been impeded by the lack of effective and standardized benchmarks, which complicates the consistent measurement of technological advancements and limits the practical applicability of SNNs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Neuromorphic Sequential Arena (NSA), a comprehensive benchmark that offers an effective, versatile, and application-oriented evaluation framework for neuromorphic temporal processing. The NSA includes seven real-world temporal processing tasks from a diverse range of application scenarios, each capturing rich temporal dynamics across multiple timescales. Utilizing NSA, we conduct extensive comparisons of recently introduced spiking neuron models and neural architectures, presenting comprehensive baselines in terms of task performance, training speed, memory usage, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize an urgent need for efficient SNN designs that can consistently deliver high performance across tasks with varying temporal complexities while maintaining low computational costs. NSA enables systematic tracking of advancements in neuromorphic algorithm research and paves the way for developing effective and efficient neuromorphic temporal processing systems.

                arXiv:2505.21717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a \textit{nonlinear} recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

Abstract: Novel techniques in evolutionary optimization, simulation and machine learning allow for a broad analysis of domains like fluid dynamics, in which computation is expensive and flow behavior is complex. Under the term of full domain analysis we understand the ability to efficiently determine the full space of solutions in a problem domain, and analyze the behavior of those solutions in an accessible and interactive manner. The goal of full domain analysis is to deepen our understanding of domains by generating many examples of flow, their diversification, optimization and analysis. We define a formal model for full domain analysis, its current state of the art, and requirements of subcomponents. Finally, an example is given to show what we can learn by using full domain analysis. Full domain analysis, rooted in optimization and machine learning, can be a helpful tool in understanding complex systems in computational physics and beyond.

                arXiv:2501.15081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in language understanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been increasing interests in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as active optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary operators as optimizer and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-generated operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLM outputs. Moreover, we develop a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches. Extensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network optimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent limitations of LLM-based operators. Our findings offer new perspectives on the integration of LLMs into evolutionary computation, providing practical insights for scalable optimization in networked systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a new complex optimization problem in the field of automatic design of advanced industrial systems and proposes a hybrid optimization approach to solve the problem. The problem is multi-objective as it aims at finding solutions that minimize CO2 emissions, transportation time, and costs. The optimization approach combines an evolutionary algorithm and classical mathematical programming to design resilient and sustainable global manufacturing networks. Further, it makes use of the OWL ontology for data consistency and constraint management. The experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in both single and double sourcing scenarios. The proposed methodology, in general, can be applied to any industry case with complex manufacturing and supply chain challenges.

                arXiv:2505.20720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floating hybrid wind-wave systems combine offshore wind platforms with wave energy converters (WECs) to create cost-effective and reliable energy solutions. Adequately designed and tuned WECs are essential to avoid unwanted loads disrupting turbine motion while efficiently harvesting wave energy. These systems diversify energy sources, enhancing energy security and reducing supply risks while providing a more consistent power output by smoothing energy production variability. However, optimising such systems is complex due to the physical and hydrodynamic interactions between components, resulting in a challenging optimisation space. This study uses a 5-MW OC4-DeepCwind semi-submersible platform with three spherical WECs to explore these synergies. To address these challenges, we propose an effective ensemble optimisation (EEA) technique that combines covariance matrix adaptation, novelty search, and discretisation techniques. To evaluate the EEA performance, we used four sea sites located along Australia's southern coast. In this framework, geometry and power take-off parameters are simultaneously optimised to maximise the average power output of the hybrid wind-wave system. Ensemble optimisation methods enhance performance, flexibility, and robustness by identifying the best algorithm or combination of algorithms for a given problem, addressing issues like premature convergence, stagnation, and poor search space exploration. The EEA was benchmarked against 14 advanced optimisation methods, demonstrating superior solution quality and convergence rates. EEA improved total power output by 111%, 95%, and 52% compared to WOA, EO, and AHA, respectively. Additionally, in comparisons with advanced methods, LSHADE, SaNSDE, and SLPSO, EEA achieved absorbed power enhancements of 498%, 638%, and 349% at the Sydney sea site, showcasing its effectiveness in optimising hybrid energy systems.

                <p>How does the brain process 3D motion? We focused on the human motion complex (hMT+), extending insights from monkey studies. Using 3D-motion stimuli containing perspective and/or stereoscopic cues, we investigated the hierarchy within the motion complex in humans of both sexes to understand the neural mechanisms underlying motion perception. On each trial we decoded 3D motion direction (toward/away) based on the BOLD response in primary visual cortex (V1), and regions within hMT+ including the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas, and the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST). We found that 3D-motion direction could be reliably decoded from all four areas but accuracy depended on cue content. MT and FST showed greatest decoding accuracy with perspective and stereoscopic cues, respectively. Decoding of motion direction in V1 and MST could be explained by retinotopic biases in the BOLD response to motion stimuli. MT and FST were less impacted by such biases. We also identified significant behavioral differences between participants: some were proficient at using stereoscopic cues and others performed near chance. Good behavioral performance with stereoscopic cues was accompanied by better decoding performance in FST but not MT. A control experiment that eliminated 3D motion percepts for stereoscopic stimuli, but not perspective stimuli, revealed that unlike MT, decoding accuracy in FST was influenced by perceptual components of 3D motion. Our findings support that MT and FST play distinct roles in the analysis of visual motion and are key in the transformation of retinal input into perceptual report.</p>

                <p>Direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) to the medial frontal cortex (MFC) play crucial roles in memory and emotional regulation. Using anterograde transsynaptic tracing and ex vivo electrophysiology in male mice, we document a previously unexplored pathway that parallels the established vHPC-MFC connectivity. This pathway connects the dorsal&ndash;caudal hippocampus (dcHPC) to specific subregions of the ventral MFC (vMFC), in particular the dorsal peduncular cortex. Notably, this pathway exerts a strong inhibitory influence on vMFC by targeting a substantial proportion of inhibitory neurons. Retrograde transsynaptic tracing in male rats indicated that vMFC subregions project disynaptically back to vHPC. These results, altogether, suggest the existence of a remarkable functional circuit connecting distinct functional areas: the cognition-related dcHPC with the emotion-related vMFC and vHPC. These findings further provide valuable insights in the cognitive and emotional abnormalities associated with the HPC-MFC connectivity in neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>A prosocial response to others in distress is increasingly recognized as a natural behavior for many social species. While prosocial behavior is more frequently observed toward familiar conspecifics, even within the same social context, some individuals are more prone to help than others. In a rat helping behavior test where animals can release a distressed conspecific trapped inside a restrainer, most rats are motivated and consistently release the trapped rat ("openers"), yet ~30% do not open the restrainer ("nonopeners"). To characterize the difference between these populations, behavioral and neural markers were compared between opener and nonopener rats in males and females. Openers showed significantly more social affiliative behavior both before and after door opening compared with nonopeners. Oxytocin receptor mRNA levels were higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not the anterior insula, of openers. Several transcription control pathways were significantly upregulated in openers&rsquo; NAc. Chemogenetically inhibiting paraventricular oxytocin neurons did not significantly impair helping but reduced sociality measures, indicating that helping does not rely solely on oxytocin signaling. Analysis of brain-wide neural activity based on the immediate-early gene c-Fos in males revealed increased activity in openers in prosocial brain regions compared with nonopeners. These include regions associated with empathy in humans (insula, somatosensory, cingulate, and frontal cortices) and motivation and reward regions such as the NAc. These findings indicate that prosocial behavior may be predicted by affiliative behavior and activity in the prosocial neural network and provide targets for the investigation of causal mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior.</p>

                <p>Fear extinction is critical for decreasing fear responses to a stimulus that is no longer threatening. While it is known that the infralimbic (IL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex mediates retrieval of an extinction memory through projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), IL pathways contributing to extinction learning are not well understood. Given the dense projection from the IL to the substantia innominata&ndash;ventral pallidum (SI/VP), an area that processes aversive and appetitive cues, we compared how the IL-&gt;SI/VP functions in extinction compared with the IL-&gt;BLA pathway in male mice. Using retrograde tracing, we demonstrate that IL projections to the SI/VP originate from superficial [Layer (L)2/3] and deep cortical layers (L5) and that they are denser than IL projections to the BLA. Next, combining retrograde tracing with labeling for the immediate early gene cFos, we show increased activity of L5 IL-&gt;SI/VP output during extinction learning and increased activity of L2/3 IL-&gt;BLA output during extinction retrieval. Then, using in vitro recordings, we demonstrate that neurons in the IL-&gt;SI/VP pathway are more excitable during extinction learning than retrieval. Finally, using optogenetics, we inactivate the IL-&gt;SI/VP pathway and show that this increases defensive freezing during extinction learning and re-extinction, without affecting memory. Taken together, we demonstrate that the IL-&gt;SI/VP pathway is active during extinction learning, when it constrains the defensive freezing response. We propose that the IL acts as a switchboard operator, increasing IL L5 communication with the SI/VP during extinction learning and IL L2/3 communication with the BLA during extinction retrieval.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e1139242025?rss=1">Single Neuron Contributions to the Auditory Brainstem EEG</a></h4>

              
                <p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an acoustically evoked EEG potential that is an important diagnostic tool for hearing loss, especially in newborns. The ABR originates from the response sequence of auditory nerve and brainstem nuclei, and a click-evoked ABR typically shows three positive peaks ("waves") within the first six milliseconds. However, an assignment of the waves of the ABR to specific sources is difficult, and a quantification of contributions to the ABR waves is not available. Here, we exploit the large size and physical separation of the barn owl first-order cochlear nucleus magnocellularis (NM) to estimate single-cell contributions to the ABR. We simultaneously recorded NM neurons&rsquo; spikes and the EEG in owls of both sexes, and found that <f></f> spontaneous single-cell spikes are necessary to isolate a significant spike-triggered average (STA) response at the EEG electrode. An average single-neuron contribution to the ABR was predicted by convolving the STA with the cell&rsquo;s peri-stimulus time histogram. Amplitudes of predicted contributions of single NM cells typically reached 32.9 &plusmn; 1.1 nV (mean &plusmn; SE, range: 2.5&ndash;162.7 nV), or <f></f> (median &plusmn; SE; range from 0.01% to 1%) of the ABR amplitude. The time of the predicted peak coincided best with the peak of the ABR wave II, independent of the click sound level. Our results suggest that individual neurons&rsquo; contributions to an EEG can vary widely, and that wave II of the ABR is shaped by NM units.</p>

                <p>Recent research suggests that the detection of preserved cognitive function can assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). This study investigates EEG signals as indicators of neural activity associated with the processing of transitional probabilities during a learning paradigm in patients with DoC. By examining the sensitivity to transitional probabilities across levels of consciousness, we aim to assess the potential value of this indicator in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. We collected EEG recordings from 51 DoC patients (10 female) and 26 healthy controls (9 female). EEG activity was recorded while participants listened to artificial vocabulary speech sequences before and after the learning phase. Intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) was used to examine differences in neural responses in different learning phases. Results showed that minimally conscious patients showed a significant increase in the word-tracking response after the learning phase, similar to healthy controls. Moreover, their learning-mediated word-rate ITPC difference correlated significantly with their Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score and 6&nbsp;month outcome. However, these correlations were absent in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients. Crucially, differences in vocabulary ITPC before and after the learning phase effectively discriminated between healthy controls and patients, as well as between minimally conscious and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients. Combining EEG indicators with clinical performance accurately predicted patients&rsquo; prognosis. In conclusion, the language learning paradigm has the potential to contribute to both diagnosis and prognosis in this challenging population, thereby significantly reducing prognostic uncertainty in medical decision-making and benefiting the rehabilitation of DoC patients.</p>

                <p>Although several studies have demonstrated that perceptual discrimination of complex scenes relies on an extended hippocampal posteromedial system, we currently have limited insight into the specific functional and structural properties of this system in humans. Here, combining electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography) and advanced microstructural (multishell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative magnetization transfer) imaging in healthy human adults (30 females/10 males), we show that both theta power modulation of the hippocampus and fiber restriction/hindrance (reflecting axon packing/myelination) of the fornix (a major input/output pathway of the hippocampus) were independently related to scene, but not face, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Conversely, microstructural features of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (a long-range occipitoanterotemporal tract) correlated with face, but not scene, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Our results provide new mechanistic insight into the neurocognitive systems underpinning complex scene discrimination, providing novel support for the idea of multiple processing streams within the human medial temporal lobe.</p>

                <p>Comprehension of spoken and written language involves a hierarchical sequence of modality-specific and heteromodal processes. While these have been localized to different regions, modality-selective responses extend beyond them, implicating large-scale network organization in language comprehension. Dimensions of whole-brain connectivity, derived from intrinsic activity, have been proposed as a general organizing framework for cognition. Here, we test their utility in accounting for the spatial distribution of task-evoked activity during language comprehension. We investigated brain activity in human males and females in response to psycholinguistic variables linked to input processing and meaning in a sentence comprehension task presented both visually and auditorily. Macroscale patterns of brain activity were similar across modalities for sentence-level and semantic variables, but effects of orthographic and phonological distance were negatively correlated between modalities. The first dimension, separating heteromodal and unimodal cortices, showed no differences across modalities for sentence processing and semantic variables and opposite effects of word length and orthographic/phonological distance for spoken and written words, supporting the notion that higher-order processing requires heteromodal resources different to those linked to input processing. The second dimension, separating auditory&ndash;motor and visual processes, showed an asymmetry in the recruitment of the unimodal systems&mdash;listening to long and semantically dissimilar words involved stronger recruitment of primary auditory&ndash;motor regions and low visual engagement. These findings show that the language system is organized according to large-scale axes of intrinsic connectivity, with psycholinguistic processes varying systematically along whole-brain dimensions. This supports the view that language comprehension reflects general principles of cortical organization.</p>

                <p>To characterize the function of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> current <I>I</I><SUB>Cl(Ca)</SUB> in mammalian rod photoreceptors, we made patch-clamp recordings from retinal slices of mice (<I>Mus musculus</I>) of both sexes that lack Ano2 (TMEM16B). Depolarizing voltage ramps in solutions blocking K<sup>+</sup> currents elicited a large outward current inhibited by the Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> channel blocker niflumic acid; this current was absent in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods. The membrane potential of <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods was 10&ndash;15&nbsp;mV more depolarized in darkness than WT or <I>Cx36<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods, indicating a substantial resting Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> permeability. Rod outer-segment photocurrents were similar in waveform and amplitude in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> and <I>Cx36<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods, but photovoltages in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods were nearly doubled. Measurements of light-response reversal potentials in rods with and without Ano2 suggest that the outer-segment conductance is nearly linear with a reversal potential of &ndash;9&nbsp;mV and that <f></f> increases during the light response. Using these results, we estimated <I>E</I><SUB>Cl</SUB> from permeabilized patch recordings of reversal potentials of <I>Cx36<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods to have a mean value of &ndash;35&nbsp;mV near the rod resting potential, but other evidence suggests that <I>E</I><SUB>Cl</SUB> may be more positive by as much as 10&ndash;15&nbsp;mV. Thus activation of <I>I</I><SUB>Cl(Ca)</SUB> during the light response would be depolarizing. At dim intensities, the photocurrents of downstream rod bipolar cells were larger and about twice as sensitive in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> retinas with reduced nonlinearity. These experiments show that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> currents in mammalian rods have more important roles in photoreceptor physiology than previously appreciated.</p>

                <p>Neuropathic pain is one of the most intractable pain conditions associated with tumor growth compressing and damaging nerves. A troublesome hallmark symptom of neuropathic pain is hypersensitivity to innocuous stimuli, known as "tactile allodynia," which is often refractory to currently available analgesics. Diurnal variations in pain hypersensitivity are common in patients with cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are enigmatic. Herein, we report that spinal expression of lipocalin-2 (LCN2) enhances pain sensitivity of NCTC2472 fibrosarcoma-implanted male mice during specific stages of the diurnal cycle. As the tumor grew, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increased in the spinal cord of the mice. Increased IL-6 levels stimulated LCN2 expression in spinal microglia, but this expression was periodically repressed by the circadian clock components REV-ERB&alpha; and REV-ERB&beta;. Notably, intraspinal dorsal horn injection of lentiviral vectors expressing REV-ERB&alpha; or REV-ERB&beta; in tumor-bearing mice alleviated tactile allodynia. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of SR9009, a synthetic agonist of REV-ERBs, also attenuated cancer-induced pain hypersensitivity, accompanied by suppressing spinal LCN2 expression. These results suggest that temporal elevation of LCN2 expression decreases the threshold of tactile pain hypersensitivity induced by tumor growth. We propose that the circadian clock component of REV-ERBs is an effective target for alleviation of cancer-induced tactile allodynia, identifying a new class of analgesic agents.</p>

                <p>Facilitation of visual search by repeated distractor contexts is typically studied employing distractor configurations that are 100% predictive of the target location. Yet, real-world contexts vary in predictivity. We used electroencephalography (EEG) in human participants of either sex to explore how visual search facilitation arises from two distinct processing modes&mdash;contextual guidance and context suppression&mdash;that depend on the predictivity of distractor contexts, comparing repeated distractor arrangements that were either predictive or nonpredictive of target location against a baseline of nonrepeated arrangements. In Experiment 1, we manipulated context predictivity by shifting repeated contexts from predictive to nonpredictive and vice versa, while in Experiment 2, we restricted repeated contexts to one side of the display to assess lateralized effects of the two processing modes. Both types of contexts behaviorally facilitated visual search, but facilitation was larger with predictive contexts. Making predictive contexts nonpredictive reduced the facilitation while rendering nonpredictive contexts predictive failed to produce gains. Half-display predictive contexts facilitated target detection on both sides, while nonpredictive contexts facilitated same-side target detection only. EEG analyses revealed that predictive contexts triggered an early N1pc (guidance signal), followed by an enhanced N2pc (attentional selection) and an increased contralateral delay activity (CDA, indexing working memory processing of the target) in occipitoparietal regions, indicative of contextual guidance boosting the entire processing chain. In contrast, nonpredictive contexts produced only an increased N2pc accompanied by reduced CDA, consistent with context suppression. These differential patterns demonstrate contextual guidance and context suppression to operate as electrophysiologically distinct processing modes.</p>

                <p>Movement-related dynamics in the beta and gamma bands have been studied in relation to motor execution and learning during unimanual movements, but their roles in complex bimanual tasks remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate how beta and gamma activity differs between unimanual and bimanual movements and how these neural signatures evolve during the learning process. Our motor task incorporated varying levels of bimanual interaction: unimanual, bimanual-equal, and bimanual-unequal. Magnetoencephalography data were recorded in healthy participants (<I>N</I> = 43, 27 females) during task performance, and beta and gamma activity was quantified. As expected, increasing task complexity from unimanual to bimanual-equal and then to bimanual-unequal movements resulted in slower and less accurate performance. Across all conditions, significant beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) and gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed during movement, as well as beta ERS after movement. Bimanual movements exhibited greater beta ERD, beta ERS, and gamma ERS compared with unimanual movements. With practice, participants demonstrated faster and more accurate movements, accompanied by enhanced beta ERS responses. Furthermore, learning-related reductions in errors correlated with increases in beta ERS. These findings suggest the distinct behavioral and neural demands of unimanual versus bimanual movements and highlight the important role of beta activity in motor performance and learning.</p>

                <p>The transfer of retinal signals from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to the primary visual cortex (V1) is modulated by a variety of extraretinal inputs, including extrinsic connections formed by GABAergic neurons in the pretectum (PT) and visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (vTRN), as well as the intrinsic connections of GABAergic dLGN interneurons. In the current study, we determined how GABAergic PT projections to the dLGN and vTRN can influence retinogeniculate transfer using a variety of viral tracing techniques, electron microscopy, in vitro physiological recordings, and optogenetics in male and female mice. We found that the PT provides over 75% of the GABAergic and over 30% of the total synaptic input to the vTRN. Optogenetic activation of PT terminals reduced the firing frequency of vTRN neurons as well as the amplitudes of their postsynaptic responses to V1 input. In the dLGN, synaptic terminals originating from the PT targeted interneurons more frequently than thalamocortical (relay) cells, and optogenetic activation of PT input had a greater impact on interneuron firing frequency compared with relay cells. This cell type-specific impact of PT input to the dLGN resulted in the disinhibition of relay cells and an increase in the amplitude of their postsynaptic responses to retinal input. Taken together, our results indicate that GABAergic PT projections to the visual thalamus serve to boost retinogeniculate transfer via two types of disinhibition, potentially enhancing the flow of visual information to V1 following gaze shifts.</p>

                <p>Past cognitive neuroscience research has demonstrated that thinking about both the self and other activates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a central hub of the default mode network. The mPFC is also implicated in other cognitive processes, such as introspection and autobiographical memory, rendering elusive its exact role during thinking about the self. Specifically, it is unclear whether the same cognitive process explains the common mPFC involvement or distinct processes are responsible for the mPFC activation overlap. In this preregistered functional magnetic resonance imaging study with 35 male and female human participants, we investigated whether and to what extent mPFC activation patterns during self-reference judgment could be explained by activation patterns during the tasks of other-reference judgment, introspection, and autobiographical memory. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that only in the mPFC were neural responses both concurrently different and similar across tasks. Furthermore, multiple regression and variance partitioning analyses indicated that each task (i.e., other-reference, introspection, and memory) uniquely and jointly explained significant variances in mPFC activation during self-reference. These findings suggest that the self-reference task engages multiple cognitive processes shared with other tasks, with the mPFC serving as a crucial hub where essential information is integrated to support judgments based on internally constructed representations.</p>

                <p>Sleep consists of two alternating states&mdash;rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Neurons adjust their firing activity based on brain state, however, the extent to which this modulation varies across neurons and brain regions remains poorly understood. This study analyzed previously acquired 17-h continuous recordings of single-unit activity and local field potentials in the ventral hippocampal CA1 region, prelimbic cortex layer 5, and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala of fear-conditioned rats. The findings indicate that more than half of the neurons fired faster during REM sleep than during NREM sleep, although a notable subset of neurons exhibited the opposite preference, firing preferentially during NREM sleep. During sleep, the overall firing activity of both REM- and NREM-preferring neurons decreased. However, fast network oscillations, including hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), amygdalar high-frequency oscillations, cortical ripples, and cortical spindles, differentially modulated REM- versus NREM-preferring neurons. During wakefulness, REM-preferring neurons fired more slowly but were more intensely activated by SWRs and shock presentations than NREM-preferring neurons. Moreover, during fast network oscillations in sleep, neurons with similar REM/NREM preferences exhibited stronger within- and cross-regional coactivation than those with differing preferences. Conversely, during awake SWRs in fear conditioning sessions, neurons with different REM/NREM preferences showed stronger interregional coactivation than those with similar preferences. These findings suggest that the distinct activity patterns of REM- and NREM-preferring neurons, potentially reflecting different roles in memory, affect local and global networks differently, thereby balancing experience-dependent network modifications with sleep-dependent homeostatic regulation of neuronal excitability.</p>

                <p>From lamprey to monkeys, the organization of the descending control of locomotion is conserved across vertebrates. Reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) form a bottleneck for descending commands, receiving innervation from diencephalic and mesencephalic locomotor centers and providing locomotor drive to spinal motor circuits. Given their optical accessibility in early development, larval zebrafish offer a unique opportunity to study reticulospinal circuitry. In fish, RSNs are few, highly stereotyped, uniquely identifiable, large neurons spanning from the midbrain to the medulla. Classically labeled by tracer dye injections into the spinal cord, recent advances in genetic tools have facilitated the targeted expression of transgenes in diverse brainstem neurons of larval zebrafish. Here, we provide a comparative characterization of four existing and three newly established transgenic lines in larval zebrafish. We determine which identified neurons are consistently labeled and offer projection-specific genetic access to subpopulations of RSNs. We showcase transgenic lines that label most or all RSNs (<I>nefma, adcyap1b</I><sup><I>ccu</I>96<I>Et</I></sup>) or subsets of RSNs, including ipsilateral (<I>vsx2, calca</I><sup><I>ccu</I>75<I>Et</I></sup>), contralateral (<I>pcp4a</I><sup><I>ccu</I>97<I>Tg</I></sup>) or all (<I>tiam2a</I><sup><I>y</I>264<I>Et</I></sup>) components of the Mauthner array, or midbrain-only RSNs (<I>s1171tEt</I>). In addition to RSNs, selected transgenic lines (<I>nefma, s1171tEt, calca</I><sup><I>ccu</I>75<I>Et</I></sup>) labeled other potential neurons of interest in the brainstem. For those, we performed in situ hybridization to show expression patterns of several excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters at larval stages as well as glutamatergic expression patterns in juvenile fish. We provide an overview of transgene expression in the brainstem of larval zebrafish that serves to lay a foundation for future studies in the supraspinal control of locomotion.</p>

                <p>by Cheng Xing, Ronald Xie, Gary D. Bader</p>

Electron microscopy (EM) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular structures at the nanoscale. Accurate image segmentation is required for analyzing EM images. While manual segmentation is reliable, it is labor-intensive, incentivizing the development of automated segmentation methods. Although deep learning-based segmentation has demonstrated expert-level performance, it lacks generalizable performance across diverse EM datasets. Current approaches usually use either convolutional or transformer-based neural networks for image feature extraction. We developed the RETINA method, which combines pre-training on the large, unlabeled CEM500K EM image dataset with a hybrid neural-network model architecture that integrates both local (convolutional layer) and global (transformer layer) image processing to learn from manual image annotations. RETINA outperformed existing models on cellular structure segmentation on five public EM datasets. This improvement works toward automated cellular structure segmentation for the EM community.

                <p>by Dori M. Grijseels, M. Banqueri, Keerthana Iyer, Lee Hanlin, Melanie Ortiz Alvarez de la Campa, David Pagliaccio, Bittu K. Rajaraman, Eitan Schechtman, On behalf of ALBA Network Gender & Sexual Diversity Working Group </p>

Queer people are still underrepresented both as STEM researchers and participants, partially due to a dearth of accurate data on this demographic. The lack of consideration for queer identities in data collection and dissemination causes a vicious cycle of exclusion. To address this invisibility, it is important to collect and report data in an inclusive and accurate manner across all areas of research, including in studies that are not specifically focused on queer populations. However, STEM researchers are often unsure of how to properly collect data in a manner that fairly represents queer people. We have developed a list of Ten Simple rules to aid researchers to perform data collection on queer individuals, focusing on study design and data dissemination. We address several issues in queer data, such as language use, dealing with small populations, and balancing demands. We also discuss how to extend this inclusive practice for studies on animal populations. These rules are aimed at anybody surveying populations which may contain queer individuals, including for example research studies and inclusivity surveys for conferences. By providing practical tips, we hope to alleviate insecurity and confusion around this topic.

                <p>by Teresa W. Lo, Kevin J. Cutler, H. James Choi, Paul A. Wiggins</p>

Time-lapse [-50mm][-4mm]Please expand the first name for author “H. James Choi”.microscopy is a powerful tool to study the biology of bacterial cells. The development of pipelines that facilitate the automated analysis of these datasets is a long-standing goal of the field. In this paper, we describe the <i>OmniSegger</i> pipeline developed as an open-source, modular, and holistic suite of algorithms whose input is raw microscopy images and whose output is a wide range of quantitative cellular analyses, including dynamical cell cytometry data and cellular visualizations. The updated version described in this paper introduces two principal refinements: (i) robustness to cell morphologies and (ii) support for a range of common imaging modalities. To demonstrate robustness to cell morphology, we present an analysis of the proliferation dynamics of <i>Escherchia coli</i> treated with a drug that induces filamentation. To demonstrate extended support for new image modalities, we analyze cells imaged by five distinct modalities: phase-contrast, two brightfield modalities, and cytoplasmic and membrane fluorescence. Together, this pipeline should greatly increase the scope of tractable analyses for bacterial microscopists.

                <p>by Francisco J. Quero, Guy Aidelberg, Hortense Vielfaure, Yann Huon de Kermadec, Severine Cazaux, Amir Pandi, Ana Pascual-Garrigos, Anibal Arce, Samuel Sakyi, Urs Gaudenz, Fernan Federici, Jennifer C. Molloy, Ariel B. Lindner</p>

Access to affordable and reliable scientific instrumentation remains a significant barrier to the democratization of healthcare and scientific research. In the field of biotechnology, in particular, the complexity, cost, and infrastructure requirements of many instruments continue to limit their accessibility, especially in resource-limited environments. Despite the recent increase in the development of open-source tools, driven by advances in digital fabrication and electronic prototyping, few of these projects have reached large-scale implementation or validation in real-world settings. Here, we present qByte, an open-source, 8-tube isothermal fluorimeter designed to overcome these barriers by offering a cost-effective ($60) yet production-ready solution. qByte leverages standard digital manufacturing and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly techniques and is designed to be portable, making it ideal for both laboratory and field use. The device has been benchmarked against commercial real-time thermocyclers and spectrophotometers, showing comparable results across four key applications: nucleic acid amplification and detection, including the on-site diagnosis of human parasites in Ghana, analysis of protein activity and stability, genetic construct characterization, and bacterial viability tests. Taken together, our results proved qByte as flexible and reliable equipment for a variety of biological tests and applications, while its affordability and open-source design simplify further development and allow adaptation to the needs of future users.

                <p>by Jian Zhang, Pengfei Che, Zhuoxuan Yang, Pingrui Zhang, Yuxuan Shui, Xibin Lu, Jiuzhou Xu, Yuanchu She, Yanbo Zhang, Jun Yu, Sheng-Jian Ji</p>

The reversible epitranscriptomic mark, 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) modification, is implicated in numerous cellular processes, but its role in neural development remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discovered high expression of the m<sup>5</sup>C reader Ybx1 in the developing mouse cortex. To elucidate its role in cortical development, <i>Ybx1</i> was ablated in embryonic cortical neural stem cells (NSCs). Interestingly, conditional knockout (cKO) of <i>Ybx1</i> led to perinatal mortality in mice, along with abnormal cortical development. Cortical progenitor cells lacking <i>Ybx1</i> exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation. Multi-omics analysis identified the target mRNAs of Ybx1, which encode the key cell cycle regulatory proteins converging on cyclin D2 (Ccnd2). Ybx1 was found to regulate the stability of its target transcripts. Both knockdown and overexpression of Ybx1 targets via in utero electroporation confirmed that they mediated Ybx1 regulation of proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells. Further analysis showed that the G1 to S phase transition in cortical progenitor cells is delayed in the <i>Ybx1</i> cKO. This study highlights the crucial function of the m<sup>5</sup>C reader protein Ybx1 in promoting cell cycle progression of the embryonic cortical progenitors, essential for proper cortical development.

Viridis (Collard Greens) Used as Ethnomedicine to Treat Male Infertility in Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Medicinal plants play a crucial role in pharmacological research, as many pharmaceutical companies rely on them for raw materials. Collard greens, also known as “Sukuma wiki,” are a member of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis family and are known for their medicinal properties. The point of this study was to find out what bioactive compounds might be in the ethanol extract of Collard green leaves and how well they work as antioxidants and may be responsible for their traditional use in treating male infertility in Uganda. Method The leaves were dried and crushed into fine powder. Ethanol extraction was carried out using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer for the GC-MS analysis. Results Phytochemical analysis of the Ethanol extract from Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard green) leaves revealed the presence of various compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and terpenoids. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 77 bioactive compounds, such as 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, 2, 7-Dimethyl-1, 7-octadien-3-amine, Octadecanoic acid, 9, 12, 15-Octadecatrienoic acid, Pentadecanoic acid, and several phenolic derivatives. Conclusion In conclusion, the phytochemicals identified in Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard greens), including Phytol, Omega-3 fatty acids, phenols, flavonoids, and sterols, demonstrate potential benefits for male reproductive health, particularly through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective effects. Consequently, further research is needed to clarify the effectiveness of these bioactive compounds in clinical settings and to establish concrete guidelines for their use in treating male infertility.

                Macrophages are pivotal in myopic scleral remodeling, yet their precise mechanisms remain elusive. Feng et al. reveal that macrophages contribute to myopic scleral remodeling by releasing METs, and inhibiting METs effectively suppresses myopia progression. Furthermore, they demonstrate that scleral hypoxia and hypoxia-activated platelets stimulate macrophages, inducing MET release following autophagy.

In this issue of Nature Neuroscience, Qian, Burrell et al. show that understanding how dopamine guides learning requires knowledge of how animals interpret tasks — what they believe is happening and when. By carefully manipulating cue–reward contingencies, the authors show that dopamine responses track belief-state reward prediction errors. These findings reaffirm — against recent challenges — that mesolimbic dopamine neurons signal prediction errors in line with the temporal difference learning rule, a core algorithm that bridges neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102301">Evolutionary and functional analyses reveal a role for the RHIM in tuning RIPK3 activity across vertebrates</a></h4>

              
                Receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK) RIPK1 and RIPK3 play important roles in diverse innate immune pathways. Despite this, some RIPK1/3-associated proteins are absent in specific vertebrate lineages, suggesting that some RIPK1/3 functions are conserved, while others are more evolutionarily labile. Here, we perform comparative evolutionary analyses of RIPK1–5 and associated proteins in vertebrates to identify lineage-specific rapid evolution of RIPK3 and RIPK1 and recurrent loss of RIPK3-associated proteins. Despite this, diverse vertebrate RIPK3 proteins are able to activate NF-κB and cell death in human cells. Additional analyses revealed a striking conservation of the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) in RIPK3, as well as other human RHIM-containing proteins. Interestingly, diversity in the RIPK3 RHIM can tune activation of NF-κB while retaining the ability to activate cell death. Altogether, these data suggest that NF-κB activation is a core, conserved function of RIPK3, and the RHIM can tailor RIPK3 function to specific needs within and between species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104914">Quantification of the effect of hemodynamic occlusion in two-photon imaging of mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of tools available to measure neuronal activity using fluorescence imaging (Chen et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2019; Jing et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2021). When performed in vivo, these measurements are invariably contaminated by hemodynamic occlusion artifacts. In widefield calcium imaging, this problem is well recognized. For two-photon imaging, however, the effects of hemodynamic occlusion have only been sparsely characterized. Here, we perform a quantification of hemodynamic occlusion effects using measurements of fluorescence changes observed with GFP expression using both widefield and two-photon imaging in mouse cortex. We find that in many instances the magnitude of signal changes attributable to hemodynamic occlusion is comparable to that observed with activity sensors. Moreover, we find that hemodynamic occlusion effects were spatially heterogeneous, both over cortical regions and across cortical depth, and exhibited a complex relationship with behavior. Thus, hemodynamic occlusion is an important caveat to consider when analyzing and interpreting not just widefield but also two-photon imaging data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95857">Decoupling both local and global abundance from global range size, challenging the abundance-occupancy relationship in birds</a></h4>

              
                In macroecology, a classic empirical observation has been positive relationships between local abundance and species’ range, known as the abundance-occupancy relationships (AORs). The existence of this empirical relationship has informed both theory development and applied questions. Notably, the spatial neutral model of biodiversity predicts AORs. Yet, based on the largest known meta-analysis of 16,562,995 correlations from ~3 billion bird observations, this relationship was indistinguishable from zero. Further, in a phylogenetic comparative analysis, species range had no predictive power over the global mean abundance of 7464 bird species. We suggest that publication and confirmation biases may have created AORs, an illusion of a ‘universal’ pattern. This nullification highlights the need for ecologists to instigate a credibility revolution like psychology, where many classic phenomena have been nullified.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105396">Structural mechanisms of PIP2 activation and SEA0400 inhibition in human cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1</a></h4>

              
                Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers (NCXs) transport Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the plasma membrane in exchange for Na<sup>+</sup> and play a vital role in maintaining cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Our previous structural study of human cardiac NCX1 (HsNCX1) reveals the overall architecture of the eukaryotic exchanger and the formation of the inactivation assembly by the intracellular regulatory domain that underlies the cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of NCX1. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of HsNCX1 in complex with a physiological activator phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), or pharmacological inhibitor SEA0400, that enhances the inactivation of the exchanger. We demonstrate that PIP<sub>2</sub> binding stimulates NCX1 activity by inducing a conformational change at the interface between the transmembrane (TM) and cytosolic domains that destabilizes the inactivation assembly. In contrast, SEA0400 binding in the TM domain of NCX1 stabilizes the exchanger in an inward-facing conformation that facilitates the formation of the inactivation assembly, thereby promoting the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation of NCX1. Thus, this study reveals the structural basis of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation and SEA0400 inhibition of NCX1 and provides some mechanistic understandings of cellular regulation and pharmacology of NCX family proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102335">Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                How consciousness arises from brain activity has been a topic of intense scientific research for decades. But how does one identify the neural basis of something that is intrinsically personal and subjective? A hallmark approach has been to ask human observers to judge stimuli as ‘seen’ (conscious) and ‘unseen’ (unconscious) and use post hoc sorting of neural measurements based these judgments. Unfortunately, cognitive and response biases are known to strongly affect how observers place their criterion for judging stimuli as ‘seen’ versus ‘unseen’, thereby confounding neural measures of consciousness. Surprisingly however, the effect of conservative and liberal criterion placement on neural measures of unconscious and conscious processing has never been explicitly investigated. Here, we use simulations and electrophysiological brain measurements to show that conservative criterion placement has an unintuitive consequence: rather than selectively providing a cautious estimate of conscious processing, it inflates effect sizes in neural measures of both conscious and unconscious processing, while liberal criterion placement does the reverse. After showing this in simulation, we performed decoding analyses on two electroencephalography studies that employ common subjective indicators of conscious awareness, in which we experimentally manipulated the response criterion. The results confirm that the predicted confounding effects of criterion placement on neural measures of unconscious and conscious processing occur in empirical data, while further showing that the most widely used subjective scale, the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS), does not guard against criterion confounds. Follow-up simulations explicate how the experimental context determines whether the relative confounding effect of criterion placement is larger in neural measures of either conscious or unconscious processing. We conclude that criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of conscious and unconscious processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99281">Oxydifficidin, a potent Neisseria gonorrhoeae antibiotic due to DedA-assisted uptake and ribosomal protein RplL sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Gonorrhea, which is caused by <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, is the second most reported sexually transmitted infection worldwide. The increasing appearance of isolates that are resistant to approved therapeutics raises the concern that gonorrhea may become untreatable. Here, we serendipitously identified oxydifficidin as a potent <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> antibiotic through the observation of a <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> contaminant in a lawn of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. Oxydifficidin is active against both wild-type and multidrug-resistant <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. Its potent activity results from a combination of DedA-assisted uptake into the cytoplasm and the presence of an oxydifficidin-sensitive ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL). Our data indicate that oxydifficidin binds to the ribosome at a site that is distinct from other antibiotics and that L7/L12 is uniquely associated with its mode of action. This study opens a potential new avenue for addressing antibiotic resistant gonorrhea and underscores the possibility of identifying overlooked natural products from cultured bacteria, particularly those with activity against previously understudied pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99639">Brochosomes as an antireflective camouflage coating for leafhoppers</a></h4>

              
                In nature, insects face immense predation pressure, where visual cues play a vital role in predators locating them. To counter this threat, insects employ a variety of nano- and microstructures on their cuticular layer to manipulate and interact with light, enhancing antireflective properties and providing camouflage or reducing detectability by predators. Leafhoppers have a unique extracuticular coating called brochosome, yet its antireflective functions and protein composition remain unclear. Our study demonstrates strong antireflective properties of brochosomes, effectively reducing reflectance on the cuticle surface, especially in the ultraviolet spectrum, to improve evasion from visual predators. Furthermore, we identify four novel structural proteins of the brochosome (BSM) for the first time. Inhibiting their synthesis by RNAi alters brochosome morphology, impacting the optical properties of the cuticle surface. Evolutionary origin analysis of BSM suggests that brochosomes likely originated from a process involving duplication–divergence. Our study reveals that leafhoppers employ a unique camouflage strategy by secreting brochosomes as antireflection nanocoatings, enabling them to evade natural predators and contributing to their evolutionary success.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88775">Endogenous oscillatory rhythms and interactive contingencies jointly influence infant attention during early infant-caregiver interaction</a></h4>

              
                Almost all early cognitive development takes place in social contexts. At the moment, however, we know little about the neural and micro-interactive mechanisms that support infants’ attention during social interactions. Recording EEG during naturalistic caregiver-infant interactions (N=66), we compare two different accounts. Traditional, didactic perspectives emphasise the role of the caregiver in structuring the interaction, whilst active learning models focus on motivational factors, endogenous to the infant, that guide their attention. Our results show that, already by 12 months, intrinsic cognitive processes control infants’ attention: fluctuations in endogenous oscillatory neural activity associated with changes in infant attentiveness. In comparison, infant attention was not forwards-predicted by caregiver gaze or vocal behaviours. Instead, caregivers rapidly modulated their behaviours in response to changes in infant attention and cognitive engagement, and greater reactive changes associated with longer infant attention. Our findings suggest that shared attention develops through interactive but asymmetric, infant-led processes that operate across the caregiver-child dyad.

">Amplifying and ameliorating light avoidance in mice with photoreceptor targeting and CGRP sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To determine the photoreceptor basis of light avoidance in mice and assess the effect of CGRP sensitization on this behavior. Background: Prior studies have suggested that photophobia is mediated by a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that contain melanopsin, making them intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These cells also receive extrinsic input from cones, which can also mediate light sensitivity. Here, we examined whether spectral variation targeting melanopsin or specific cone types in mice could effectively model light sensitivity. Also, we assessed whether sensitizing mice with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) could amplify ipRGC-mediated light avoidance. Methods: Light avoidance behavior was observed in a two-zone chamber illuminated by narrow-band LEDs targeting photopic opsins: 365 nm (UV; rodent S-cone), 460 nm (blue; melanopsin), and 630 nm (red; human L-cone). In a non-targeted assay, we assessed the degree of light avoidance in wildtype C57BL/6J mice to varying intensities (5 to 100%) of the blue and red LEDs. In a targeted assay, mice were given a choice to spend time between zones with differing relative contrast levels (0.50, 0.75, or 1.00) for the targeted photoreceptor(s). This was assessed in two transgenic mice with: 1) human red cone knock-in (RCKI), or 2) adult-onset ablation of M1 ipRGCs (Opn4aDTA). Mice were studied without intervention or following priming with either peripheral CGRP or vehicle administration every other day for 9 days. A primary measure (mean {+/-} SEM) was the asymptote value (AV). Results: Wildtype mice showed greater light avoidance with increasing light intensity, demonstrating a parametric response. RCKI mice showed avoidance of the high melanopsin (1.00: 0.52 {+/-} 0.08; n = 18) and L-cone (1.00: 0.30 {+/-} 0.11; n = 15) contrast zones but showed a preference for the higher S-cone (1.00: -0.35 {+/-} 0.06; n = 16) contrast zone. These effects decreased with less relative contrast and, thus, contrast dependent. Adding S-cone contrast opposed avoidance to melanopsin (0.10 {+/-} 0.12; n = 14) or L-cone (-0.19 {+/-} 0.10; n = 15) contrast. Ablation of ipRGCs in Opn4aDTA mice attenuated avoidance of melanopsin and preference for S-cone stimulation compared to control littermates. On day 9, CGRP priming led to significantly increased avoidance of melanopsin stimulation (0.58 {+/-} 0.08, n = 21) as compared to vehicle priming (0.26 {+/-} 0.09, n = 22) (F (1,41) = 5.70, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Our findings further support that ipRGCs play a key role in mediating photophobia. This aversive response to light stems from ipRGCs combining excitatory input from intrinsic melanopsin stimulation and extrinsic L-cone input, which can be opposed by extrinsic inhibitory S-cone input. Chronic exposure to CGRP is likely one of many mechanisms in migraine that can amplify ipRGC signals, leading to photophobia.

">Macroscale Connectivity in the Octopus brain</a></h4>

              
                Comparative studies support the existence of functional analogies between given areas in the octopus and mammalian brains. Despite marked phylogenetic distance, the central nervous system of cephalopod mollusks is characterized by a complex network of anatomically interconnected and interacting neuronal populations. Previous studies provide a thorough description of the octopus neural network through neuronal tracing of axonal projections, offering a unique opportunity to systematically examine the brain network architecture. Here, we chart the topological organization of Octopus vulgaris neural network including information on the macroscale interregional pathways between 32 cortical and subcortical regions as provided by a high-quality historical dataset. We found more than 350 main neural connections (afferent, efferent) encompassing the three masses of octopus brain (supra-, sub-oesophageal masses, optic lobes). The octopus brain network possesses multiple nonrandom features promoting segregation and integration, including near-minimal path length, multiscale community structure, hubs, small-world features, and motif composition. Taken together, these attributes support an association between network architecture and function and are consistent with studies in a range of other species, suggesting the existence of a set of universal organizational principles across phylogeny. These findings expand our understanding of neuronal structures by highlighting brain regions that had previously received less attention.

">GPR88 localization to primary cilia in neurons is cell-type specific.</a></h4>

              
                GPR88 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that regulates dopamine neurotransmission and is a target for neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition to the somatic membrane, GPR88 can localize to the primary cilium, a membrane microdomain known for dynamically enriching receptors and signaling molecules. However, the distribution of GPR88 in neuronal primary cilia remains uncharacterized. Here we characterize GPR88 distribution at primary cilia in two brain areas. We show that in the striatum, GPR88 localizes both to somatodendritic and primary cilia compartments on inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons. In contrast, in the somatosensory cortex, GPR88 localizes to somatodendritic and nuclear compartments of excitatory spiny stellate neurons which possess primary cilia that exclude GPR88. Additionally, we found that cilia formation and length were similar between GPR88 knockout and wild-type animals. Together, we provide key evidence for neuronal cell-type specific regulation of GPR88 localization to primary cilia, suggesting neuron subtype specific regulatory mechanisms govern receptor ciliary targeting in the brain.

">SNCA triplication disrupts proteostasis and extracellular architecture prior to neurodegeneration in human midbrain organoids</a></h4>

              
                Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease, are characterized by alpha-synuclein (SNCA) aggregation and progressive neurodegeneration, yet the early molecular events linking SNCA gene dosage to disrupted proteostasis remain poorly understood. Here, we used human midbrain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) carrying an SNCA triplication (SNCA Trip) and the isogenic corrected line (SNCA Isog) to dissect early pathogenic mechanisms in a 3D human model of synucleinopathy. We combined immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, tandem mass tag proteomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and ribosome profiling to systematically characterize molecular alterations in SNCA Trip organoids at day 50 (D50) and day 100 (D100) of maturation. SNCA Trip organoids exhibited increased SNCA accumulation, neuromelanin deposition, and activation of mTORC1 (p-rpS6), ERK1/2, AKT and p-eIF2alpha signalling pathways by D100. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulation of cytoskeletal, synaptic, and axonal development pathways, alongside significant downregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and upregulation of perineuronal net (PNN) genes. Ribosome profiling showed minimal global translational changes but uncovered selective translational buffering of neuronal and ECM-associated transcripts. Confocal imaging confirmed progressive disorganization of pericellular and interstitial ECM structures around neurons in SNCA Trip organoids. Our findings demonstrate that SNCA triplication induces early proteostatic disruption and extracellular matrix remodelling prior to neurodegeneration and suggest that altered gene expression and ECM homeostasis may contribute to disease initiation and progression. Targeting these early aberrant mechanisms may offer new therapeutic opportunities for synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's Disease.

">Vesicular Rps6 released by astrocytes regulate local translation and enhance synaptic markers in neurons</a></h4>

              
                In neurons, like in any other cell, their function often relies on the fine tuning of their protein levels, which is achieved by the balance between protein synthesis and turnover. Defects in protein homeostasis frequently leads to neuronal dysfunction and neurological disorders. Given their extreme morphological complexity and high compartmentalization, neurons highly depend on the asymmetrical distribution of their proteome. The common belief is that proteins that sustain axonal, dendritic and synaptic functions are synthesized in the soma and then transported to distal neuronal compartments. However, there is a complementary mechanism by which the mRNAs, and not the proteins, are transported to distal subneuronal domains, and once they reach their destination they are locally translated. Although once considered heretical, local translation (or local protein synthesis) is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Nonetheless there is one question that remains largely unexplored in the field and that is whether local translation in dendrites, axons and synapses is fully regulated by the neuron itself or if non-neuronal cells (e.g. glia) can modulate this mechanism in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Here we show that astroglia regulates local protein synthesis and enhances synaptic markers by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing ribosomal protein Rps6. To our knowledge this is the first report that directly demonstrates glial control of local translation in neurons through EV-mediated glia-to-neuron communication.

">Neonatal White Matter Microstructure Predicts Infant Attention Disengagement from Fearful Faces</a></h4>

              
                Infants develop an attentional bias towards faces already at birth, with further specification towards fearful faces emerging at 6 months and diminishing around 11 months of age. However, the neurobiological origins of attentional bias to fear are still poorly understood. To understand the neural structures underlying perception of facial expressions, the current study utilized newborn diffusion magnetic resonance images (N = 86; 41 females;  = 27.15 days) and eye tracking from the same infants at 8-months ( = 8.75 months) as a behavioural measure. An overlap paradigm was used to measure attention disengagement from fearful, happy, and neutral faces. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed that higher white matter (WM) mean diffusivity in widespread regions across the brain was associated with lower attention disengagement from fearful faces. The same association was found with happy faces but was limited to only the splenium of the corpus callosum and sensorimotor pathways. Variance in neonatal WM microstructure may reflect individual differences in growth that is related to attentional bias development later in infancy.

">Optimized feature gains explain and predict successes and failures of human selective listening</a></h4>

              
                Attention facilitates communication by enabling selective listening to sound sources of interest. However, little is known about why attentional selection succeeds in some conditions but fails in others. While neurophysiology implicates multiplicative feature gains in selective attention, it is unclear whether such gains can explain real-world attention-driven behavior. To investigate these issues, we optimized an artificial neural network with stimulus-computable, feature-based gains to recognize a cued talker's speech from binaural audio in "cocktail party" scenarios. Though not trained to mimic humans, the model matched human performance across diverse real-world conditions, exhibiting selection based both on voice qualities and spatial location. It also predicted novel attentional effects that we confirmed in human experiments, and exhibited signatures of "late selection" like those seen in human auditory cortex. The results suggest that human-like attentional strategies naturally arise from optimization of feature gains for selective listening, offering a normative account of the mechanisms - and limitations - of auditory attention.

">Continuous dynamics of cooperation and competition in social foraging</a></h4>

              
                Real-life social interactions often unfold continuously and involve dynamic cooperation and competition, yet most studies rely on discrete games that do not capture the adaptive and graded nature of continuous sensorimotor decisions. To address this gap, we developed the Cooperation-Competition Foraging game --- a novel, ecologically grounded paradigm in which pairs of participants (dyads) navigate a continuous shared space under face-to-face visibility, deciding in real-time to collect rewarded targets either individually or jointly. Dyads spontaneously converged on distinct stable strategies along the cooperation-competition spectrum, forming three similarly sized groups: cooperative, intermediate, and competitive. Despite the behavioral complexity, our computational model, which incorporated travel path minimization, sensorimotor communication, and recent choice history, predicted dyadic decisions with 87% accuracy, and linked prediction certainty with ensuing dynamics of spatiotemporal coordination. Further modeling revealed how sensorimotor factors, such as movement speed and skill, shape distinct strategies and payoffs. Crucially, we quantify the cost of cooperation, demonstrating that in many dyads prosocial tendencies outweigh the individual benefits of exploiting skill advantages. Our versatile framework provides a predictive, mechanistic account of how social and embodied drivers promote the emergence of dynamic cooperation and competition, and offers rigorous metrics for investigating the neural basis of naturalistic social interactions, and for linking personality traits to distinct strategies.

">Contextual inference through flexible integration of environmental features and behavioural outcomes</a></h4>

              
                The ability to use the context we are in to flexibly adjust our decision-making is vital for navigating a complex world. To do this, the brain must i) use environmental features and behavioural outcomes to distinguish between different, often hidden contexts; and ii) learn how to use these inferred contexts to guide behaviour. However, how these two interacting processes can be performed simultaneously remains unclear. Within the brain it is thought that interaction between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) supports contextual inference. We show that models of the HPC using environmental features readily support context-specific behaviour, but struggle to differentiate ambiguous contexts during learning. In contrast, models of the PFC using behavioural outcomes can stably differentiate contexts during periods of learning, but struggle to guide context-specific behaviour. Supporting feature-based with outcome-based strategies during learning overcomes the limitations of both approaches, allowing for the formation of distinct contextual representations that support contextual inference. Moreover, agents using this joint approach reproduce both behavioural- and cellular-level phenomena associated with the interaction between PFC and HPC. Together, these results provide insight into how the brain uses contextual information to guide flexible behaviour.

">Metabolic basis of the astrocyte-synapse interaction governs dopaminergic-motor connection</a></h4>

              
                Perisynaptic astrocyte processes are constitutive attachments of synapses in the central nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms that control perisynaptic astrocyte ensheathment and their implications in the wiring of neural circuits remain unclear. Here, we report that glycolysis controls astrocyte-synapse contact. In the Drosophila larval dopaminergic (DAergic) circuit, blocking astrocyte glycolysis stimulated perisynaptic ensheathment by attenuating astrocyte-to-DAergic neuron neuroligin 2-neurexin 1 signaling. As a result, the larvae executed more reorientation actions during locomotion. At the circuit level, behavioral alterations were found to arise from increased DAergic neuronal synaptogenesis and DAergic-motor connection. Our research uncovers an ancient metabolic basis that determines perisynaptic astrocyte ensheathment abundance through a conserved neuroligin-neurexin signaling pathway and demonstrates the role of astrocyte glycolysis in controlling DAergic-motor circuit assembly and function.

">Microfluidic platforms for probing spontaneous functional recovery in hierarchically modular neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                Inherent capacity to flexibly reorganize after injury is a hallmark of brain networks, and recent studies suggest that functional consequences of focal damage are strongly influenced by the network's nonrandom connectivity. Although many of these insights have been derived from animal models and computational simulations, experimental platforms that enable bottom up investigations of the structure function relationships underlying damage and recovery processes remain limited. In this study, we used polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices to construct hierarchically modular neuronal networks that mimic the architectural features of the mammalian cortex. Laser microdissection was employed to selectively sever intermodular connections, enabling controlled damage to either hub or peripheral connections. Damage to hub connections led to delayed recovery, requiring more than three days for correlations to re-emerge, and by seven days after damage, the overall correlation exceeded the predamage level. In contrast, peripheral damage resulted in faster recovery. Experiments that induced repeated injury to neuronal networks further demonstrated that recovery primarily occurred through the formation of alternative pathways rather than restoration of the original connections. These findings highlight how topological features of neuronal networks shape their response to injury and subsequent reorganization, providing mechanistic insights into the intrinsic self repair capacity of biological systems.

                The comprehensive interpretation of behavior from incomplete data represents a fundamental challenge in computational ethology. Here we present Masked Autoencoder for Transformer-based Estimation and Reconstruction (MATER), a self-supervised learning framework that extracts behaviorally relevant representations from unlabeled rodent pose data by reconstructing strategically masked body keypoints. This approach captures fundamental movement patterns without requiring extensive manual annotation, addressing common experimental challenges including occlusions during social interactions and tracking errors. We evaluate MATER across two-dimensional and three-dimensional rodent pose datasets, demonstrating its robustness under high levels of keypoint masking. The framework achieves high-fidelity reconstructions under these challenging conditions and produces latent representations that support accurate behavioral classification with minimal supervision. Our analyses further reveal that rodent movement exhibits intrinsic spatiotemporal structure, which can be computationally inferred without explicit labeling. Reconstruction performance is tightly linked to the temporal coherence of movement, highlighting the importance of temporal dynamics in behavioral representation. These findings reinforce the emerging view that animal behavior is hierarchically organized and governed by natural temporal dependencies. MATER offers a robust, scalable tool for neuroscientists seeking to analyze complex, naturalistic behaviors across diverse experimental contexts, ultimately advancing our understanding of behavioral architecture and its neural underpinnings.

                Precise neural modulation is an important tool in neuroscience research for intervene of specific neural pathways. Photoacoustic is an emerging technology enabling high precision non-genetic neural stimulation in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, we report a new method to prepare a Candle Soot - Tapered Fiber based Optoacoustic Emitter (CSTFOE) through an in-situ photothermal curing process. The emitter created was found with high spatial resolution and efficiency for neuromodulation. In the meanwhile, the in-situ photothermal curing procedure is highly reproducible and allows for fabricating the photoacoustic coating on the tiny tip of the tapered fiber with a diameter less than 20 "m" . With the high efficiency and reproducibility, we designed an integrated photoacoustic neuromodulation system incorporating the CSTFOE, a nanosecond pulsed laser for photoacoustic generation, and a function generator for synchronization, achieving effective neuromodulation in vitro.

">MitoTracker transfers from astrocytes to neurons independently of mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                The neuroprotective transfer of mitochondria from astrocytes to neurons has been primarily investigated by labelling astrocytic mitochondria with the dye MitoTracker. Here we report that MitoTracker transfers to neurons from both astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned media, independently of mitochondrial transfer. Our observations should prompt an essential re-evaluation of the literature concerning astrocyte-neuron mitochondrial transfer and in other systems in which contact-independent transfer has been observed using mitochondrial dyes.

">Modeling 2D Spatio-Tactile Population Receptive Fields of the Fingertip in Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Tactile fingertip sensations are critical for everyday life. Accordingly, tactile fingertip maps have been extensively studied in human primary somatosensory cortex. However, the fine-grained functional architecture of these maps remains largely unknown. To uncover this architecture, we sought to estimate 2D spatio-tactile population receptive fields (pRFs) of the tip of the index finger in human Brodmann area 3b (BA3b). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7T and submillimeter resolution along with prospective motion correction, we recorded brain responses whilst participants sensed a row of vibrotactile pins sweeping along cardinal axes over a portion of the fingertip. To estimate pRF position and size, we initially fit a 2D Gaussian pRF model to the data, which, however, produced largely implausible pRF estimates. Simulations indicated that this likely occurred because the size of pRFs in BA3b surpasses the portion of the fingertip we stimulated, resulting in an incomplete mapping of pRFs. To address this issue, we constrained the fitting procedure and refined the 2D Gaussian pRF model by keeping pRF size constant. Our results for pRF position then revealed that the ulnar-to-radial axis spanning the fingertip maps onto a superior-to-inferior axis in BA3b. Both the putatively large pRF size (relative to the mapping area) and the pRF position gradient we uncover here appear compatible with receptive field properties quantified in monkeys. Our study provides the first comprehensive investigation into the fine-grained functional architecture of human fingertip maps and brings us one step closer to a thorough understanding thereof.

">Unbiased Quantification of Persistent Postural and Motor Deficits Following Spinal Cord Injury in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes multifaceted postural and motor impairments that are challenging to quantify. Conventional behavioral tests, such as the Basso mouse scale (BMS), rely on qualitative observations, which do not detect subtle yet significant functional deficits. To perform unbiased and quantitative evaluation of motor function and posture after SCI, we employed high-speed video tracking with machine learning-based whole body pose estimation and weight-bearing analyses using the Blackbox system in freely moving mice. We found enduring alterations in posture induced by SCI not captured by conventional metrics. Postural deficits included reduced hindpaw spacing with concomitant increased forepaw spacing, narrowed femur width, and altered hind paw angles, which remained evident beyond 42 days post-injury (dpi). Furthermore, sustained deficits in locomotor activity were identified as decreased distance traveled, decreased exploratory behavior, and disrupted fore-to-hindpaw speed ratio. Additionally, we analyzed behavioral motifs using Keypoint MoSeq software and found frequency changes in unique motor syllables correlating with forward acceleration and turning after SCI. Interestingly, while motor deficits persisted, sensory deficits, such as thermal and mechanical sensitivity, returned to baseline levels by 21 days after injury in C57Bl/6J mice, with no subsequent hypersensitivity. Lastly, we developed a web-based application to assist in visualization and analyses of Blackbox-based kinematic data. Altogether, our study identifies distinct postural and motor deficits pre- and post-SCI using accurate, unbiased, and quantitative behavioral assessments. By tracking the unique features of motor recovery trajectories, researchers can more accurately assess the effectiveness of SCI therapeutic strategies.

">The nucleus accumbens shell regulates hedonic feeding via a rostral hotspot</a></h4>

              
                The medial nucleus accumbens shell (medNAcSh) is increasingly recognized as a key node in the regulation of hedonic feeding, exerting strong control over reward consumption through its projections to downstream structures. Recent studies showed that one of the primary cellular mediators of these effects are dopamine 1 receptor positive striatal projection neurons (D1-SPNs). Specifically, population D1-SPN activity gets inhibited during reward consumption and such inhibition is necessary and sufficient to authorize reward consumption, independent of metabolic need. Anatomically, the medNAcSh spans a 1.5 mm distance along the rostro-caudal axis in mice and previous studies have reported functional gradients along this axis in behavioral control. For instance, classical pharmacological studies have suggested that rostral rather than caudal medNAcSh regulates appetitive behavior. However, the cellular, circuit, and molecular mechanisms underlying this topographical gradient remain unknown. Here we hypothesized that D1-SPNs contribute to this gradient by regulating hedonic feeding via a specific hotspot in the rostral medNAcSh. Using population level calcium monitoring with fiber photometry in mice, we show that rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs demonstrate inhibitory responses during reward consumption, while caudal D1-SPNs do not. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs inhibits consumption, while stimulation of caudal D1-SPNs had minimal effects, confirming the existence of a functional rostro-caudal gradient. Importantly, we observed no differences between rostral and caudal D1-SPNs in their behavioral or activity responses to aversive stimuli, suggesting that the D1-SPN gradient is specific to appetitive contexts. To investigate potential molecular correlates of this functional gradient, we leveraged open-source anatomy datasets and performed fluorescent in situ hybridization, identifying Stard5 and Peg10 as markers enriched in the rostral and caudal medNAcSh, respectively. Finally, we developed a novel Stard5-Flp driver mouse line, which allowed us to target the rostral hotspot selectively. We demonstrated that Stard5+ neurons recapitulate activity patterns of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs. Together, these findings establish a spatially confined rostral subregion of the medNAcSh as a critical regulator of reward consumption and introduce Stard5 as a molecular tool for its manipulation - offering new opportunities for intervention in dysregulated eating beyond classical homeostatic circuits.

                In this study, we developed an optimized optomotor response (OMR) setup for rats based on existing commercial systems and introduced a novel method that integrates DeepLabCut, PsychoPy, and custom algorithms to automate OMR performance evaluation in rats. Our primary findings revealed the optimal spatial frequency (SF) and grating velocity for pigmented Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) and wild-type (WT) rats. The RCS rats, a model for retinal degeneration, displayed normal OMR performance at postnatal days 30 (P30) and 50 (P50), but a significant decline was observed at 3 months. In most rats aged 6 and 12 months, the percentage of correct responses (PoC) was 50%, indicating blindness. The high efficiency and reproducibility of our non-invasive OMR test, along with its suitability for post-surgical and retinal degeneration models, underscores its potential for broad applications in visual performance evaluation.

">Energy Constraints and Neural Strategy Transitions in Alzheimer's: A Game-Theoretic Model</a></h4>

              
                While many mechanisms have been proposed to drive Alzheimer's disease, particularly the accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, emerging evidence suggests that they may be the byproducts of earlier damage rather than initiating events. Instead, metabolic dysfunction and the inability of neural cells to support their energetic demands may be a more plausible trigger for subsequent pathological cascade (the neuron energy crisis hypothesis). Here we highlight how type 2 diabetes (T2D) can contribute to neurodegeneration by impairing brain energy metabolism. We present a game-theoretic framework, where neurons face trade-offs between energy efficiency and information fidelity. We show that under metabolic stress, neural networks can evolve toward smaller group sizes that prioritize energy efficiency over information quality, which may underlie the observed collapse of cognitive capacity during neurodegeneration. We conclude with a discussion of interventions, ranging from antidiabetic drugs to cognitive engagement and sensory stimulation, aimed at reducing metabolic stress and preserving cognitive function.

">ROMO1 loss in cholinergic neurons induces mitochondrial ultrastructural damage and ALS-like neuromuscular degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration. However, it remains obscure whether mitochondrial abnormities are sufficient to drive ALS development. Here, we show that selective depletion of reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (ROMO1), an inner mitochondrial membrane-delimited protein, in cholinergic neurons leads to adult-onset, progressive locomotor deficits in mice that closely resemble ALS pathology. ROMO1 ablation in cholinergic neurons induces ALS-like neuromuscular degeneration, as evidenced by age-dependent motor neuron loss, axon degeneration, disrupted cholinergic transmission, neuromuscular junction denervation, and the resultant muscle atrophy. Notably, ROMO1 loss induces early and progressive mitochondrial cristae deformation in motor neurons, preceding the onset of ALS-like syndromes. Our findings support that mitochondrial impairment in vulnerable motor neurons is a sufficient contributor to ALS etiology, positioning mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target.

">The visual encoding of familiar and unfamiliar tools</a></h4>

              
                How do we extract meaning and understand the action potential of everyday objects? In this eye-tracking study, we show that familiarity with tools modulates the temporal dynamics of their visual exploration. Twenty-five right-handed participants (14 females; mean age = 23.6; SD = 3.34) freely observed images of familiar and unfamiliar tools while their eye movements were recorded over a 1500-millisecond window. All tools were post-hoc segmented into functional and manipulative areas. Participants initially prioritized functional components - particularly for unfamiliar tools. Attention to manipulative features emerged later and remained attenuated throughout viewing. In contrast, familiar tools prompted earlier and sustained visual attention on manipulative regions, suggesting faster access to action-related representations. These results support a sequential semantic-to-sensorimotor model of object perception, in which previous knowledge facilitates the transition from semantic identification to action-related engagement.

">Global metabolic reprogramming and sex-specific impact of caloric restriction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), disproportionally affecting women, is generally regarded as a disease of the brain. Yet, cumulative evidence increasingly supports a more systemic, full-body view on this incurable disorder, with the liver and kidneys playing an important role in amyloid clearance. The latter is likely potentiated by caloric restriction (CR), but its impact on the metabolism of key amyloid-handling tissues is poorly understood. Methods: We examined the sex-specific effects of amyloidosis and CR on oxidative and metabolic processes in APPPS1 mice, expressing mutant amyloidogenic proteins under the neuronal Thy-1 promoter. Wild-type (WT) and APPPS1 mice were either fed ad libitum (AL) or received 70% of their individual AL intake (CR regimen). Results: Compared to age-matched WT controls, the brain, liver, and kidney of 9-month-old AL APPPS1 mice exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress markers along with altered activity of antioxidant enzymes, including higher superoxide dismutase and lower catalase activity. These differences were sex- and tissue-specific, with kidneys showing the largest AD-induced differences between sexes. As for key glycolytic enzymes, APPPS1 mice possessed higher activity of pyruvate kinase than WT mice in all organs and higher hexokinase and phosphofructokinase activities in the brain, with stronger effects observed in males. CR intensified oxidative stress in the liver and the female brain but reduced it in the female kidney. Moreover, it potentiated glycolysis predominantly in females and modulated glutathione-dependent enzymes in a sex-dependent manner. Conclusions: Neuron-driven amyloidosis induces strong and significant metabolic changes in the entire body, encompassing ubiquitous oxidative damage, enhancement of glycolysis, and antioxidant defense. The lower activity of glycolytic enzymes in the female brain and decreased antioxidant defense in the female liver and kidney provide yet another facet to the complex picture of female vulnerability in AD. Females seemed to profit more from CR, but the general CR effect was not very strong.

">Computational characterization of metacognitive ability in subjective decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Metacognition is the process of reflecting on and controlling one's own thoughts and behaviors. Metacognitive ability is often measured through modeling the relationship between confidence reports and choice behavior in tasks where performance can be objectively measured. Previous work has explored whether metacognitive ability is conserved across different types of tasks, and across different domains such as perception and memory. However, it is unclear whether approaches to the assessment of metacognitive ability that have worked in these contexts can be extended to value-based decision-making where objective accuracy cannot be evaluated. Here, we compare metacognitive ability across different tasks spanning perception and valuation, using Bayesian hierarchical estimation of the parameters of a computational process model of confidence. This model captures metacognitive ability as the uncertainty of an individual's own decision uncertainty, and can do so in the space of any decision variable, regardless of whether it indexes external features or internal, subjective states. We find that metacognitive ability can be reliably estimated in both objective and subjective decision-making tasks, and is relatively well conserved across tasks, especially within domains and similar confidence reporting paradigms.

">Event-Related Spatio-Spectral Perturbation (ERSSP): A Scalp-Wide EEG Analysis Framework for Capturing Extralemniscal Thalamocortical Activity, Validated Using a Fragile X Syndrome Model</a></h4>

              
                The extralemniscal thalamocortical pathway regulates large-scale modulation of cortical states but remains inaccessible to traditional EEG analysis due to its diffuse, variable, and asynchronous nature. To address this, we introduce the Event-Related Spatio-Spectral Perturbation (ERSSP) framework, which quantifies spatially distributed time-frequency responses. ERSSP summarizes the number of channels exhibiting significant spectral perturbations, capturing diffuse cortical dynamics from sensor-space EEG. We validated this approach using a passive auditory habituation task in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a condition marked by disrupted thalamocortical modulation. ERSSP revealed enhanced spatial extent of power increases (but not phase-locking) in FXS compared to controls. Results also showed expected gender differences, further supporting biological sensitivity of ERSSP. ERSSP provides a conceptually simple and computationally efficient method for quantifying broadly distributed sensory modulation and may enable new insights into thalamocortical function in both basic and clinical neuroscience.

">Stressed Avoider rats show blunted sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects: Potential contributions of the lateral habenula and lateral hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Avoidance coping following stress exposure predicts heightened alcohol drinking. Similarly, blunted sensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol facilitates increased drinking. However, the relationship between stress exposure, coping mechanism, and sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects is unknown. In rats, predator odor stress increases alcohol intake in animals that show persistent avoidance of stress-paired stimuli, termed Avoiders. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Avoider rats have blunted sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects using an alcohol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. After a single conditioning session, Non-Avoider rats acquired alcohol-induced CTA while Avoiders did not. Male rats across all groups eventually acquired alcohol CTA after four conditioning sessions. However, in females, only Non-Avoiders acquired alcohol-induced CTA. In male Non-Avoider rats, a single CTA-inducing dose of alcohol increased cFos expression in the lateral habenula (LHb), an important nucleus in aversion signaling. In male Avoiders, the same dose of alcohol decreased LHb cFos expression. cFos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which provides glutamatergic inputs to the LHb, was also diminished by alcohol in male Avoider rats. In females, alcohol had no effect on cFos cell counts in the LHb. However, in the LH, alcohol diminished cFos expression in female Non-Avoiders. Collectively, these findings suggest that stressed Avoider rats are hyposensitive to alcohol's aversive effects, which may facilitate their heightened alcohol drinking after stress. Sex- and stress group-specific differences in LH and LHb recruitment highlight these regions as candidates for mediating stress-induced changes in alcohol behaviors.

">Longitudinal Habituation and Novelty Detection neural responses from infancy to early childhood in The Gambia and UK</a></h4>

              
                As infants and young children learn from and respond to their environment, their development is driven by their ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli and respond to salient stimuli. While sources and types of stimuli vary across cultural contexts, research to understand the neural mechanisms of these behaviors have largely focused on relatively homogeneous populations in high income settings. To address this lack of diverse representation the Brain Imaging for Global health project (BRIGHT) collected longitudinal data in The Gambia (N=204) and the UK (N=61). Here we present results of the Habituation and Novelty Detection (HaND) fNIRS neuroimaging task. Gambian infants showed persistent response suppression (Habituation) at all visits (from 5mo to 60mo) while Novelty Detection was only observed once infants reached 18 and 24mo. In the UK, infants only showed persistent habituation from 5-12mo, while the response was not evident at 18 and 24mo. Furthermore, in contrast to The Gambia, alongside the habituation patterns observed Uk infants showed novelty detection from 5-12mo. This is the first longitudinal description of the HaND response in individuals from different contextual backgrounds across such a broad age range and number of time points, revealing different patterns of specialization in The Gambia and UK.

">Unravelling neuromechanical constraints to finger independence</a></h4>

              
                Intentional use of a single finger results in involuntary forces and movements among other fingers. Constraints to finger independence are attributed to both neural and mechanical factors, but the contribution of these factors is debated. We hypothesized that neural factors primarily constrain finger independence during isometric exertions whereas mechanical factors impose larger constraints during movements. We investigated changes in finger independence following a ring finger fatigue protocol. We assumed that with fatigue, the ability to actively transmit forces across fingers through neural pathways will be reduced but force transmission passively through mechanical pathways will remain unaffected. Participants performed isometric finger contractions and flexion-extension movements at baseline and following a ring finger fatigue protocol. At baseline, involuntary ring finger forces ranged from 7.3-16.5% MVC. Consistent with our predictions, involuntary ring finger forces decreased by 2.5-8.9% MVC following fatigue. In contrast, involuntary ring finger movement did not change or surprisingly in several cases, increased by greater than 10-20{degrees} following fatigue relative to baseline across movement tasks. Our findings demonstrate that the neuromechanical control of finger force versus motion are distinct from each other and can alter the constraints to finger independence in a task-dependent way.

                Mutations in PIK3R1, a regulatory subunit of Class I PI3K, are implicated in immune disorders and neurological conditions. We identified a novel heterozygous pathogenic frameshift mutation (c.1710dup) in PIK3R1 in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency who developed slowly progressive Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived motor neurons (iMNs) demonstrated that this mutation resulted in PIK3R1 haploinsufficiency, with downstream activation of AKT, disruption of neuronal electrical function and increased apoptosis in iPSC-derived motor neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes showed apoptosis pathways were upregulated in neuronal clusters from iMNs harboring the PIK3R1c.1710 dup mutation. Mutated iPSC-derived brain organoids were smaller than matched controls. scRNA-seq of brain organoids showed more active apoptosis in neuronal clusters of patient-derived brain organoids. These findings identify a critical and novel role for PIK3R1 haploinsufficiency in neuronal function and survival.

">Impact of Dysbiosis and Antiseizure Medication on Seizure Pathophysiology in a Viral Infection-Induced Epilepsy Model</a></h4>

              
                Viral infections are associated with the development of seizures and epilepsy. Inflammation in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, is thought to play a key role in orchestrating this process. We have previously demonstrated in mice that the gut microbiome influences seizure susceptibility following brain infection with Theiler's virus (TMEV). Further, gut dysbiosis significantly alters the antiseizure activity of carbamazepine (CBZ) in TMEV-infected mice with acute seizures. Thus, we herein sought to define how experimentally evoked intestinal dysbiosis influences hippocampal pathophysiology and neuroinflammation following acute symptomatic seizures in TMEV-infected mice, and whether acute CBZ treatment could further influence this neuropathology. Mice were pretreated with antibiotics or saline, followed by TMEV infection, and CBZ or vehicle administration (days 3-7 post-infection). Histological analyses were then performed on hippocampal tissue to quantify neuronal death, microgliosis, astrogliosis, and cellular proliferation after acute infection. While overall microglial reactivity did not markedly differ between groups, microglial proliferation was significantly increased in CA1 of CBZ-treated versus VEH-treated intact mice. Dysbiosis appeared to blunt this CBZ-induced microglial proliferation. Further, dysbiosis contributed to neuroprotection while also increasing neural proliferation within CA3, which may worsen disease outcomes due to aberrant migration and integration. The gut microbiome may thus prime CNS-specific immune responses in viral infection-induced seizures, opening the opportunity for potential GI-specific therapeutic interventions for seizures.

">Pathogenic variants in autophagy-tethering factor EPG5 drive neurodegeneration through mitochondrial dysfunction and innate immune activation</a></h4>

              
                The autophagy-tethering factor, ectopic P-granule 5 autophagy protein (EPG5), plays a key role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Impaired autophagy associated with pathogenic variants in EPG5 cause a rare devastating multisystem disorder known as Vici syndrome, which includes neurodevelopmental defects, severe progressive neurodegeneration and immunodeficiency. The pathophysiological mechanisms driving disease presentation and progression are not understood. In patient-derived fibroblasts and iPS cells differentiated to cortical neurons, we found that impaired mitophagy leads to mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction. Physiological Ca2+ signals resulted in paradoxical mitochondrial Ca2+ overload attributed to downregulation of MICU1/3. Ca2+ signals caused mitochondrial depolarisation, mtDNA release and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) or of the STING pathway. Thus, we have identified multiple potential therapeutic targets driving disease progression associated with pathogenic EPG5 mutations, including impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, vulnerability to mPTP opening and activation of innate immune signalling.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study explored the origins of creative ideas in groups, validating the triple-pathway model of group creative ideation with behavioral and neuroscientific evidence. A total of 123 college student dyads completed a creative ideation task and a contrast task while their brain activity was simultaneously recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results identified three distinct ideation pathways—flexibility, persistence, and convergence—that collectively drove group creativity, accompanied by three interbrain synchrony states. STATE2, characterized by enhanced prefrontal–temporal interbrain synchrony, positively predicted group creative performance, whereas STATE3, marked by reduced frontal–parietal interbrain synchrony, negatively predicted it. Specifically, STATE2 facilitated group creativity through three mediating pathways: (1) the flexibility pathway alone, (2) combined flexibility–persistence or flexibility–convergence pathways, and (3) a sequential flexibility–persistence–convergence pathway with chain mediation effects. These findings provide neurobehavioral evidence for the triple-pathway model, underscoring the pivotal role of prefrontal–temporal interbrain synchrony in group creativity. They further demonstrate the dynamic, multi-pathway nature of group creative ideation, showing that a single cohort can flexibly employ three interchangeable pathways to generate novel ideas collaboratively.</span>

                <p>Pavlovian conditioning tasks have been used to identify the neural systems involved with learning cue&ndash;outcome relationships. In delay conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (CS) overlaps or co-terminates with the unconditioned stimulus (US). Prior studies demonstrate that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates behavioral responding during delay conditioning. Furthermore, the dopamine response to the CS reflects the relative value of the upcoming reward in these tasks. In contrast to delay conditioning, trace conditioning involves a "trace" period separating the end of the CS and the US delivery. While dopamine has been implicated in trace conditioning, no studies have examined how NAc dopamine responds to reward-related stimuli in these tasks. Here, we developed a within-subject trace conditioning task where distinct CSs signaled either a short trace period (5&nbsp;s) or a long trace period (55&nbsp;s) prior to food reward delivery. Male rats exhibited greater conditioned responding and a faster response latency to the Short Trace CS relative to the Long Trace CS. Voltammetry recordings in the NAc found that the CS-evoked dopamine response increased on Short Trace trials but decreased on Long Trace trials. Conversely, US-evoked dopamine responses were greater on Long Trace trials relative to Short Trace trials. The CS dopamine response correlated with the response latency and not with conditioned responding. Furthermore, the relationship between CS dopamine and latency was best explained by an exponential function. Our results collectively illustrate that the trace period is encoded by the bidirectional NAc dopamine response to the CS during pavlovian conditioning.</p>

                <p>Cell shape is crucial to cell function, particularly in neurons. The cross-sectional diameter, also known as caliber, of axons and dendrites is an important parameter of neuron shape, best appreciated for its influence on the speed of action potential propagation. Many studies of axon caliber focus on cell-wide regulation and assume that caliber is static. Here, we have characterized local variation and dynamics of axon caliber in vivo using the peripheral axons of zebrafish touch-sensing neurons at embryonic stages, prior to sex determination. To obtain absolute measurements of caliber in vivo, we paired sparse membrane labeling with super-resolution microscopy of neurons in live fish. We observed that axon segments had varicose or "pearled" morphologies and thus vary in caliber along their length, consistent with reports from mammalian systems. Sister axon segments originating from the most proximal branch point in the axon arbor had average calibers that were uncorrelated with each other. Axon caliber also tapered across the branch point. Varicosities and caliber, overall, were dynamic on the timescale of minutes, and dynamicity changed over the course of development. By measuring the caliber of axons adjacent to dividing epithelial cells, we found that skin cell division is one aspect of the cellular microenvironment that may drive local differences and dynamics in axon caliber. Our findings support the possibility that spatial and temporal variation in axon caliber could significantly influence neuronal physiology.</p>
