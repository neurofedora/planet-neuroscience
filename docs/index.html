              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05792">Events in Noise-Driven Oscillators: Markov Renewal Processes and the "Unruly" Breakdown of Phase-Reduction Theory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the standard reduction of oscillatory systems to a single phase variable. The standard reduction is often insufficient, particularly when the oscillations have variable amplitude and the magnitude of each oscillatory excursion plays a defining role in the impact of that oscillator on other systems, i.e. on its output. For instance, large excursions in bursting or mixed-mode neural oscillators may constitute events like action potentials, which trigger output to other neurons, while smaller, sub-threshold oscillations generate no output and therefore induce no coupling between neurons. Noise induces diffusion-like dynamics of the oscillator phase on top of its otherwise constant rate-of-change, resulting in the irregular occurrence of these output events. We model the events as corresponding to distinguished crossings of a Poincare section. Using a linearization of the noisy Poincare map and its description under phase-isostable coordinates, we determine the diffusion coefficient for the occurrence and timing of the events using Markov renewal theory. We show that for many oscillator models the corresponding point process can exhibit "unruly" diffusion: with increasing input noise strength the diffusion coefficient vastly increases compared to the standard phase reduction analysis, and, strikingly, it also decreases when the input noise strength is increased further. We provide a thorough analysis in the case of planar oscillators, which exhibit unruliness in a finite region of the natural parameter space. Our results in part explain the surprising synchronization behavior obtained in pulse-coupled, mixed-mode oscillators as they arise, e.g., in neural systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05800">Review of a Heaviside step sequence function and the recursive Heaviside step sequence function for modeling human mental state</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a novel recursive Heaviside step sequence function and demonstrate its applicability to modeling human mental states such as thought processes, memory recall, and forgetfulness. By extending the traditional Heaviside step function, which typically represents binary transitions, into a recursive sequence framework, we introduce a dynamic model that better captures the complexities of cognitive states. Furthermore, the recursive Heaviside step sequence function approximates solutions to a multidimensional inviscid advection equation, offering a unique mathematical perspective on the evolution of mental states over time. This continuous model, combined with the recursive delta sequence function, provides a comprehensive approach to exploring how memories and thoughts emerge, evolve, and fade. Through this approach, we propose that mental states can be expressed as time series functions, and the selection of the parameter N reflects individual variability in mental processing, influenced by external environments and internal experiences. We also discuss the implications of this framework for understanding human cognition and potential limitations due to modern technological constraints in replicating such processes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05809">Is it me, or is A larger than B: Uncovering the determinants of relational cognitive dissonance resolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the computational mechanisms underlying the resolution of cognitive dissonances. We focus on scenarios in which an observation violates the expected relationship between objects. For instance, an agent expects object A to be smaller than B in some feature space but observes the opposite. One solution is to adjust the expected relationship according to the new observation and change the expectation to A being larger than B. An alternative solution would be to adapt the representation of A and B in the feature space such that in the new representation, the relationship that A is smaller than B is maintained. While both pathways resolve the dissonance, they generalize differently to different tasks. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning, we demonstrate the existence of these two pathways and show that the chosen pathway depends on the dissonance magnitude. Large dissonances alter the representation of the objects, while small dissonances lead to adjustments in the expected relationships. We show that this effect arises from the inherently different learning dynamics of relationships and representations and study the implications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05811">Neurophysiological Analysis in Motor and Sensory Cortices for Improving Motor Imagination</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and external devices by decoding neural signals, offering potential solutions for individuals with motor impairments. This study explores the neural signatures of motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) tasks using EEG signals, focusing on four conditions categorized as sense-related (hot and cold) and motor-related (pull and push) conditions. We conducted scalp topography analysis to examine activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, revealing distinct regional differences: sense--related conditions primarily activated the posterior region of the sensorimotor cortex, while motor--related conditions activated the anterior region of the sensorimotor cortex. These spatial distinctions align with neurophysiological principles, suggesting condition-specific functional subdivisions within the sensorimotor cortex. We further evaluated the performances of three neural network models-EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet-demonstrating that ME tasks achieved higher classification accuracies compared to MI tasks. Specifically, in sense-related conditions, the highest accuracy was observed in the cold condition. In motor-related conditions, the pull condition showed the highest performance, with DeepConvNet yielding the highest results. These findings provide insights into optimizing BCI applications by leveraging specific condition-induced neural activations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05812">Low-Rank + Sparse Decomposition (LR+SD) for EEG Artifact Removal</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings are advantageous over serial recordings, as they offer the ability to explore the relationship between both signals without the compounded effects of nonstationarity in the brain. Nonetheless, analysis of simultaneous recordings is challenging given that a number of noise sources are introduced into the EEG signal even after MR gradient artifact removal with balistocardiogram artifact being highly prominent. Here, we present an algorithm for automatically removing residual noise sources from the EEG signal in a single process using low rank + sparse decomposition (LR+SD). We apply this method to both experimental and simulated EEG data, where in the latter case the true EEG signature is known. The experimental data consisted of EEG data collected concurrently with fMRI (EEG-fMRI) as well as alone outside the scanning environment while subjects viewed Gabor flashes, a perceptual task known to produce event related power diminutions in the alpha spectral band. On the simulated data, the LR+SD method was able to recover the pure EEG signal and separate it from artifact with up to three EEG sources. On the experimental data, LR+SD was able to recover the diminution in alpha spectral power that follows light flashes in concurrent EEG-fMRI data, which was not detectable prior to artifact removal. At the group level, we found that the signal-to-noise ratio was increased ~34\% following LR+SD cleaning, as compared independent component analysis (ICA) in concurrently collected EEG-fMRI data. We anticipate that this method will be highly useful for analyzing simultaneously collected EEG-fMRI data, and downstream for exploring the coupling between these two modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05825">SurfGNN: A robust surface-based prediction model with interpretability for coactivation maps of spatial and cortical features</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current brain surface-based prediction models often overlook the variability of regional attributes at the cortical feature level. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing regional differences, they encounter challenges when dealing with complex, high-density graph structures. In this work, we consider the cortical surface mesh as a sparse graph and propose an interpretable prediction model-Surface Graph Neural Network (SurfGNN). SurfGNN employs topology-sampling learning (TSL) and region-specific learning (RSL) structures to manage individual cortical features at both lower and higher scales of the surface mesh, effectively tackling the challenges posed by the overly abundant mesh nodes and addressing the issue of heterogeneity in cortical regions. Building on this, a novel score-weighted fusion (SWF) method is implemented to merge nodal representations associated with each cortical feature for prediction. We apply our model to a neonatal brain age prediction task using a dataset of harmonized MR images from 481 subjects (503 scans). SurfGNN outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating an improvement of at least 9.0% and achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.827+0.056 in postmenstrual weeks. Furthermore, it generates feature-level activation maps, indicating its capability to identify robust regional variations in different morphometric contributions for prediction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05849">Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hopfield model provides a mathematically idealized yet insightful framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain. This model has inspired four decades of extensive research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories. Notably, the role and impact of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model. This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying highly mixed inputs. Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures, using this connection to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process. Finally, we embed both the classic and the new model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.

                arXiv:2411.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The individual variabilities of electroencephalogram signals pose great challenges to cross-subject motor imagery (MI) classification, especially for the data-scarce single-source to single-target (STS) scenario. The multi-scale spatial data distribution differences can not be fully eliminated in MI experiments for the topological structure and connection are the inherent properties of the human brain. Overall, no literature investigates the multi-scale spatial data distribution problem in STS cross-subject MI classification task, neither intra-subject nor inter-subject scenarios. In this paper, a novel multi-scale spatial domain adaptation network (MSSDAN) consists of both multi-scale spatial feature extractor (MSSFE) and deep domain adaptation method called multi-scale spatial domain adaptation (MSSDA) is proposed and verified, our goal is to integrate the principles of multi-scale brain topological structures in order to solve the multi-scale spatial data distribution difference problem.

Abstract: Expansion Microscopy is a super-resolution technique in which physically enlarging samples in an isotropic manner increases inter-molecular distances such that nano-scale structures can be resolved using light microscopy. This is particularly useful in neuroscience as many important structures are smaller than the diffraction limit. Since its invention in 2015, a variety of Expansion Microscopy protocols have been generated and applied to advance knowledge in many prominent organisms in neuroscience, including zebrafish, mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans. Here we review the last decade of Expansion Microscopy-enabled advances with a focus on neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06359">Evaluating tDCS Intervention Effectiveness via Functional Connectivity Network on Resting-State EEG Data in Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

Abstract: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet its effects on neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the impact of tDCS in individuals with MDD using resting-state EEG data and network neuroscience to analyze functional connectivity. We examined power spectral density (PSD) changes and functional connectivity (FC) patterns across theta, alpha, and beta bands before and after tDCS intervention. A notable aspect of this research involves the modification of the binarizing threshold algorithm to assess functional connectivity networks, facilitating a meaningful comparison at the group level. Our analysis using optimal threshold binarization techniques revealed significant modifications in network topology, particularly evident in the beta band, indicative of reduced randomization or enhanced small-worldness after tDCS. Furthermore, the hubness analysis identified specific brain regions, notably the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions across all frequency bands, exhibiting increased functional connectivity, suggesting their involvement in the antidepressant effects of tDCS. Notably, tDCS intervention transformed the dispersed high connectivity into localized connectivity and increased left-sided asymmetry across all frequency bands. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of tDCS on neural mechanisms in MDD, offering a potential direction for further research and therapeutic development in the field of neuromodulation for mental health disorders.

Abstract: The Psycho Frame, a sophisticated system primarily used in Universal Century (U.C.) series mobile suits for NEWTYPE pilots, has evolved as an integral component in harnessing the latent potential of mental energy. Its ability to amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control, creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based weaponry. This paper presents the development of a novel robotic control system inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep learning for real-time control of robotic systems. By capturing and interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive commands to robotic actions, reflecting the seamless synchronization of thought and machine, much like the Psyco Frame's integration with a Newtype pilot's mental faculties. This research demonstrates how modern AI techniques can expand the limits of human-machine interaction, potentially transcending traditional input methods and enabling a deeper, more intuitive control of complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Sequential sampling models (SSMs) are a widely used framework describing decision-making as a stochastic, dynamic process of evidence accumulation. SSMs popularity across cognitive science has driven the development of various software packages that lower the barrier for simulating, estimating, and comparing existing SSMs. Here, we present a software tool, SequentialSamplingModels.jl (SSM.jl), designed to make SSM simulations more accessible to Julia users, and to integrate with the Julia ecosystem. We demonstrate the basic use of SSM.jl for simulation, plotting, and Bayesian inference.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06608">Estimating the contribution of early and late noise in vision from psychophysical data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2012.06608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many psychophysical detection and discrimination tasks human performance is thought to be limited by internal or inner noise when neuronal activity is converted into an overt behavioural response. It is unclear, however, to what extent the behaviourally limiting inner noise arises from early noise in the photoreceptors and the retina, or from late noise in cortex at or immediately prior to the decision stage. Presumably, the behaviourally limiting inner noise is a non-trivial combination of both early and late noises. Here we propose a method to quantify the contributions of early and late noise purely from psychophysical data. Our analysis generalizes classical results for linear systems (Burgess and Colborne, 1988) by combining the theory of noise propagation through a nonlinear network (Ahumada, 1987) with the expressions to obtain the perceptual metric along the nonlinear network (Malo and Simoncelli, 2006; Laparra et al., 2010). We show that from threshold-only data the relative contribution of early and late noise can only be determined if the experiments include substantial external noise in some of the stimuli used during experiments. If experimenters collected full psychometric functions, however, then early and late noise sources can be quantified even in the absence of external noise. Our psychophysical estimate of the magnitude of the early noise assuming a standard cascade of linear and nonlinear model stages is substantially lower than the noise in cone photocurrents computed via an accurate model of retinal physiology (Brainard and Wandell, 2020, ISETBIO). This is consistent with the idea that one of the fundamental tasks of early vision is to reduce the comparatively large retinal noise.

                arXiv:2305.14360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the need for a new dynamical paradigm in the modeling of brain function and evolution. Specifically, these models should incorporate non-constant and asymmetric synaptic weights \(T_{ij}\) in the neuron-neuron interaction matrix, moving beyond the classical Hopfield framework. Krotov and Hopfield proposed a non-constant yet symmetric model, resulting in a vector field that describes gradient-type dynamics, which includes a Lyapunov-like energy function. Firstly, we will outline the general conditions for generating a Hopfield-like vector field of gradient type, recovering the Krotov-Hopfield condition as a particular case. Secondly, we address the issue of symmetry, which we abandon for two key physiological reasons: (1) actual neural connections have a distinctly directional character (axons and dendrites), and (2) the gradient structure derived from symmetry forces the dynamics towards stationary points, leading to the recognition of every pattern. We propose a novel model that incorporates a set of limited but variable controls \(|\xi_{ij}|\leq K\), which are used to adjust an initially constant interaction matrix, \(T_{ij}=A_{ij}+\xi_{ij}\). Additionally, we introduce a reasonable controlled variational functional for optimization. This allows us to simulate three potential outcomes when a pattern is submitted to the learning system: (1) if the dynamics converges to an existing stationary point without activating controls, the system has \emph{recognized} an existing pattern; (2) if a new stationary point is reached through control activation, the system has \emph{learned} a new pattern; and (3) if the dynamics \emph{wanders} without reaching any stationary point, the system is unable to recognize or learn the submitted pattern. An additional feature (4) models the processes of \emph{forgetting and restoring} memory.

                arXiv:2407.04525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from neuroscience, particularly with the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). This has significantly enhanced the replication of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and natural language processing. Despite these advances, ANNs struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency - capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, ANNs often overlook the functional and morphological diversity of the brain, hindering their computational capabilities. Furthermore, incorporating cell-type specific neuromodulatory effects into ANNs with neuronal heterogeneity could enable learning at two spatial scales: spiking behavior at the neuronal level, and synaptic plasticity at the circuit level, thereby potentially enhancing their learning abilities. In this article, we summarize recent bio-inspired models, learning rules and architectures and propose a biologically-informed framework for enhancing ANNs. Our proposed dual-framework approach highlights the potential of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for emulating diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartments to simulate morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how the proposed approach integrates brain-inspired compartmental models and task-driven SNNs, balances bioinspiration and complexity, and provides scalable solutions for pressing AI challenges, such as continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency.

                arXiv:2411.05673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When observing the surface patterns of objects delimited by smooth surfaces, the projections of the surface patterns to the image domain will be subject to substantial variabilities, as induced by variabilities in the geometric viewing conditions, and as generated by either monocular or binocular imaging conditions, or by relative motions between the object and the observer over time. To first order of approximation, the image deformations of such projected surface patterns can be modelled as local linearizations in terms of local 2-D spatial affine transformations.
  This paper presents a theoretical analysis of relationships between the degrees of freedom in 2-D spatial affine image transformations and the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. For this purpose, we first describe a canonical decomposition of 2-D affine transformations on a product form, closely related to a singular value decomposition, while in closed form, and which reveals the degrees of freedom in terms of (i) uniform scaling transformations, (ii) an overall amount of global rotation, (iii) a complementary non-uniform scaling transformation and (iv) a relative normalization to a preferred symmetry orientation in the image domain. Then, we show how these degrees of freedom relate to the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model.
  Finally, we use these theoretical results to consider whether we could regard the biological receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals as being able to span the degrees of freedom of 2-D spatial affine transformations, based on interpretations of existing neurophysiological experimental results.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study focused on disentangling hippocampal shape variations from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets within the context of neurological disorders. Leveraging a Mesh Variational Autoencoder (VAE) enhanced with Supervised Contrastive Learning, our approach aims to improve interpretability by disentangling two distinct latent variables corresponding to age and the presence of diseases. In our ablation study, we investigate a range of VAE architectures and contrastive loss functions, showcasing the enhanced disentanglement capabilities of our approach. This evaluation uses synthetic 3D torus mesh data and real 3D hippocampal mesh datasets derived from the DTI hippocampal dataset. Our supervised disentanglement model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like attribute and guided VAEs in terms of disentanglement scores. Our model distinguishes between age groups and disease status in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using the hippocampus data. Our Mesh VAE with Supervised Contrastive Learning shows the volume changes of the hippocampus of MS populations at different ages, and the result is consistent with the current neuroimaging literature. This research provides valuable insights into the relationship between neurological disorder and hippocampal shape changes in different age groups of MS populations using a Mesh VAE with Supervised Contrastive loss.

                arXiv:2411.06802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.

Abstract: Optimization plays an important role in tackling public health problems. Animal instincts can be used effectively to solve complex public health management issues by providing optimal or approximately optimal solutions to complicated optimization problems common in public health. BAT algorithm is an exemplary member of a class of nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms and designed to outperform existing metaheuristic algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy. It's inspiration comes from the foraging behavior of group of microbats that use echolocation to find their target in the surrounding environment. In recent years, BAT algorithm has been extensively used by researchers in the area of optimization, and various variants of BAT algorithm have been developed to improve its performance and extend its application to diverse disciplines. This paper first reviews the basic BAT algorithm and its variants, including their applications in various fields. As a specific application, we apply the BAT algorithm to a biostatistical estimation problem and show it has some clear advantages over existing algorithms.

                arXiv:2411.05798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Capacity Fixed-Charge Network Flow (MC-FCNF) problem, a generalization of the Fixed-Charge Network Flow problem, aims to assign capacities to edges in a flow network such that a target amount of flow can be hosted at minimum cost. The cost model for both problems dictates that the fixed cost of an edge is incurred for any non-zero amount of flow hosted by that edge. This problem naturally arises in many areas including infrastructure design, transportation, telecommunications, and supply chain management. The MC-FCNF problem is NP-Hard, so solving large instances using exact techniques is impractical. This paper presents a genetic algorithm designed to quickly find high-quality flow solutions to the MC-FCNF problem. The genetic algorithm uses a novel solution representation scheme that eliminates the need to repair invalid flow solutions, which is an issue common to many other genetic algorithms for the MC-FCNF problem. The genetic algorithm's efficiency is displayed with an evaluation using real-world CO2 capture and storage infrastructure design data. The evaluation results highlight the genetic algorithm's potential for solving large-scale network design problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05802">Similarity-based context aware continual learning for spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological brains have the capability to adaptively coordinate relevant neuronal populations based on the task context to learn continuously changing tasks in real-world environments. However, existing spiking neural network-based continual learning algorithms treat each task equally, ignoring the guiding role of different task similarity associations for network learning, which limits knowledge utilization efficiency. Inspired by the context-dependent plasticity mechanism of the brain, we propose a Similarity-based Context Aware Spiking Neural Network (SCA-SNN) continual learning algorithm to efficiently accomplish task incremental learning and class incremental learning. Based on contextual similarity across tasks, the SCA-SNN model can adaptively reuse neurons from previous tasks that are beneficial for new tasks (the more similar, the more neurons are reused) and flexibly expand new neurons for the new task (the more similar, the fewer neurons are expanded). Selective reuse and discriminative expansion significantly improve the utilization of previous knowledge and reduce energy consumption. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR100, ImageNet generalized datasets, and FMNIST-MNIST, SVHN-CIFAR100 mixed datasets show that our SCA-SNN model achieves superior performance compared to both SNN-based and DNN-based continual learning algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm has the capability to adaptively select similar groups of neurons for related tasks, offering a promising approach to enhancing the biological interpretability of efficient continual learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05806">SkipSNN: Efficiently Classifying Spike Trains with Event-attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike train classification has recently become an important topic in the machine learning community, where each spike train is a binary event sequence with \emph{temporal-sparsity of signals of interest} and \emph{temporal-noise} properties. A promising model for it should follow the design principle of performing intensive computation only when signals of interest appear. So such tasks use mainly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to their consideration of temporal-sparsity of spike trains. However, the basic mechanism of SNNs ignore the temporal-noise issue, which makes them computationally expensive and thus high power consumption for analyzing spike trains on resource-constrained platforms. As an event-driven model, an SNN neuron makes a reaction given any input signals, making it difficult to quickly find signals of interest. In this paper, we introduce an event-attention mechanism that enables SNNs to dynamically highlight useful signals of the original spike trains. To this end, we propose SkipSNN, which extends existing SNN models by learning to mask out noise by skipping membrane potential updates and shortening the effective size of the computational graph. This process is analogous to how people choose to open and close their eyes to filter the information they see. We evaluate SkipSNN on various neuromorphic tasks and demonstrate that it achieves significantly better computational efficiency and classification accuracy than other state-of-the-art SNNs.

                arXiv:2411.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural network model architecture, Reverse Quaternion Neural Network which utilizes the non-commutative nature of quaternion products, and to clarify its learning characteristics. While quaternion neural networks have been used in various fields, there has been no research report on the characteristics of multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural networks where weights are applied in the reverse direction. This paper investigates the learning characteristics of the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network from two perspectives: the learning speed and the generalization on rotation. As a result, it is found that the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network has a learning speed comparable to existing models and can obtain a different rotation representation from the existing models.

                arXiv:2411.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary computation, it is commonly assumed that a search algorithm acquires knowledge about a problem instance by sampling solutions from the search space and evaluating them with a fitness function. This is necessarily inefficient because fitness reveals very little about solutions -- yet they contain more information that can be potentially exploited. To address this observation in genetic programming, we propose EvoNUDGE, which uses a graph neural network to elicit additional knowledge from symbolic regression problems. The network is queried on the problem before an evolutionary run to produce a library of subprograms, which is subsequently used to seed the initial population and bias the actions of search operators. In an extensive experiment on a large number of problem instances, EvoNUDGE is shown to significantly outperform multiple baselines, including the conventional tree-based genetic programming and the purely neural variant of the method.

                arXiv:2411.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing strong AI could provide a powerful tool for addressing social and scientific challenges. Neural networks (NNs), inspired by biological systems, have the potential to achieve this. However, weight optimization techniques using error backpropagation are not observed in biological systems, raising doubts about current NNs approaches. In this context, Itoh (2024) solved the MNIST classification problem without using objective functions or backpropagation. However, weight updates were not used, so it does not qualify as machine learning AI. In this study, I develop a machine learning method that mimics biological neural systems by implementing Hebbian learning in NNs without backpropagation and optimization method to solve the MNIST classification problem and analyze its output. Development proceeded in three stages. In the first stage, I applied the Hebbian learning rule to the MNIST character recognition algorithm by Itoh (2024), resulting in lower accuracy than non-Hebbian NNs, highlighting the limitations of conventional training procedures for Hebbian learning. In the second stage, I examined the properties of individually trained NNs using norm-based cognition, showing that NNs trained on a specific label respond powerfully to that label. In the third stage, I created an MNIST character recognition program using vector norm magnitude as the criterion, achieving an accuracy of approximately 75%. This demonstrates that the Hebbian learning NNs can recognize handwritten characters without objective functions, backpropagation, or optimization processes. Based on these results, developing a mechanism based on norm-based cognition as a fundamental unit and then increasing complexity to achieve indirect similarity cognition should help mimic biological neural systems and contribute to realizing strong AI.

                arXiv:2411.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opposition-based learning (OBL) is an effective approach to improve the performance of metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which are commonly used for solving complex engineering problems. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of opposition strategies in metaheuristic optimization algorithms, discussing the benefits and limitations of this approach. An overview of the opposition strategy concept, its various implementations, and its impact on the performance of metaheuristic algorithms are presented. Furthermore, case studies on the application of opposition strategies in engineering problems are provided, including the optimum locating of control systems in tall building. A shear frame with Magnetorheological (MR) fluid damper is considered as a case study. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of opposition strategies in metaheuristic algorithms significantly enhances the quality and speed of the optimization process. This chapter aims to provide a clear understanding of the opposition strategy in metaheuristic optimization algorithms and its engineering applications, with the ultimate goal of facilitating its adoption in real-world engineering problems.

                arXiv:2411.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An improved bilinear fuzzy genetic algorithm (BFGA) is introduced in this chapter for the design optimization of steel structures with semi-rigid connections. Semi-rigid connections provide a compromise between the stiffness of fully rigid connections and the flexibility of fully pinned connections. However, designing such structures is challenging due to the nonlinear behavior of semi-rigid connections. The BFGA is a robust optimization method that combines the strengths of fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm to handle the complexity and uncertainties of structural design problems. The BFGA, compared to standard GA, demonstrated to generate high-quality solutions in a reasonable time. The application of the BFGA is demonstrated through the optimization of steel structures with semirigid connections, considering the weight and performance criteria. The results show that the proposed BFGA is capable of finding optimal designs that satisfy all the design requirements and constraints. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for the optimization of complex structures with nonlinear behavior.

                arXiv:2411.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to proactively identify software defects, especially where project-specific data is scarce. However, developing a robust ML pipeline with optimal hyperparameters that effectively use cross-project information and yield satisfactory performance remains challenging. In this paper, we resolve this bottleneck by formulating CPDP as a multi-objective bilevel optimization (MBLO) method, dubbed MBL-CPDP. It comprises two nested problems: the upper-level, a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, enhances robustness and efficiency in optimizing ML pipelines, while the lower-level problem is an expensive optimization problem that focuses on tuning their optimal hyperparameters. Due to the high-dimensional search space characterized by feature redundancy and inconsistent data distributions, the upper-level problem combines feature selection, transfer learning, and classification to leverage limited and heterogeneous historical data. Meanwhile, an ensemble learning method is proposed to capture differences in cross-project distribution and generalize across diverse datasets. Finally, a MBLO algorithm is presented to solve this problem while achieving high adaptability effectively. To evaluate the performance of MBL-CPDP, we compare it with five automated ML tools and $50$ CPDP techniques across $20$ projects. Extensive empirical results show that MBL-CPDPoutperforms the comparison methods, demonstrating its superior adaptability and comprehensive performance evaluation capability.

                arXiv:2411.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By exploiting discrete signal processing and simulating brain neuron communication, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a low-energy alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNN models, still face high computational costs due to the numerous time steps as well as network depth and scale. The tens of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses in the human brain are developed from only 20,000 genes, which inspires us to design an efficient genetic encoding strategy that dynamic evolves to regulate large-scale deep SNNs at low cost. Therefore, we first propose a genetically scaled SNN encoding scheme that incorporates globally shared genetic interactions to indirectly optimize neuronal encoding instead of weight, which obviously brings about reductions in parameters and energy consumption. Then, a spatio-temporal evolutionary framework is designed to optimize the inherently initial wiring rules. Two dynamic regularization operators in the fitness function evolve the neuronal encoding to a suitable distribution and enhance information quality of the genetic interaction respectively, substantially accelerating evolutionary speed and improving efficiency. Experiments show that our approach compresses parameters by approximately 50\% to 80\%, while outperforming models on the same architectures by 0.21\% to 4.38\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. In summary, the consistent trends of the proposed genetically encoded spatio-temporal evolution across different datasets and architectures highlight its significant enhancements in terms of efficiency, broad scalability and robustness, demonstrating the advantages of the brain-inspired evolutionary genetic coding for SNN optimization.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a promising approach in machine learning, combining the hierarchical learning capabilities of deep neural networks with the energy efficiency of spike-based computations. Traditional end-to-end training of SNNs is often based on back-propagation, where weight updates are derived from gradients computed through the chain rule. However, this method encounters challenges due to its limited biological plausibility and inefficiencies on neuromorphic hardware. In this study, we introduce an alternative training approach for SNNs. Instead of using back-propagation, we leverage weight perturbation methods within a forward-mode gradient framework. Specifically, we perturb the weight matrix with a small noise term and estimate gradients by observing the changes in the network output. Experimental results on regression tasks, including solving various PDEs, show that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, suggesting its suitability for neuromorphic systems and potential hardware compatibility.

                arXiv:2411.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular method for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is based on growing networks via small local changes to the network's architecture called network morphisms. These methods start with a small seed network and progressively grow the network by adding new neurons in an automated way. However, it remains a challenge to efficiently determine which parts of the network are best to grow. Here we propose a NAS method for growing a network by using a Gauss-Newton approximation of the loss function to efficiently learn and evaluate candidate network morphisms. We compare our method with state of the art NAS methods for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks, and conclude our method learns similar quality or better architectures at a smaller computational cost.

Abstract: Back propagation (BP) is the default solution for gradient computation in neural network training. However, implementing BP-based training on various edge devices such as FPGA, microcontrollers (MCUs), and analog computing platforms face multiple major challenges, such as the lack of hardware resources, long time-to-market, and dramatic errors in a low-precision setting. This paper presents a simple BP-free training scheme on an MCU, which makes edge training hardware design as easy as inference hardware design. We adopt a quantized zeroth-order method to estimate the gradients of quantized model parameters, which can overcome the error of a straight-through estimator in a low-precision BP scheme. We further employ a few dimension reduction methods (e.g., node perturbation, sparse training) to improve the convergence of zeroth-order training. Experiment results show that our BP-free training achieves comparable performance as BP-based training on adapting a pre-trained image classifier to various corrupted data on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., an MCU with 1024-KB SRAM for dense full-model training, or an MCU with 256-KB SRAM for sparse training). This method is most suitable for application scenarios where memory cost and time-to-market are the major concerns, but longer latency can be tolerated.

                arXiv:2411.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional economic and socio-behavioural models assume perfect symmetric access to information and rational behaviour among interacting agents in a social system. However, real-world events and observations appear to contradict such assumptions, leading to the possibility of other, more complex interaction rules existing between such agents. We investigate this possibility by creating two different models for a doctor-patient system. One retains the established assumptions, while the other incorporates principles of reflexivity theory and cognitive social structures. In addition, we utilize a microbial genetic algorithm to optimize the behaviour of the physician and patient agents in both models. The differences in results for the two models suggest that social systems may not always exhibit the behaviour or even accomplish the purpose for which they were designed and that modelling the social and cognitive influences in a social system may capture various ways a social agent balances complementary and competing information signals in making choices.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of a binarized neuromorphic network leveraging polariton dyads, optically excited pairs of interfering polariton condensates within a microcavity to function as binary logic gate neurons. Employing numerical simulations, we explore various neuron configurations, both linear (NAND, NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR), to assess their effectiveness in image classification tasks. We demonstrate that structural nonlinearity, derived from the network's layout, plays a crucial role in facilitating complex computational tasks, effectively reducing the reliance on the inherent nonlinearity of individual neurons. Our findings suggest that the network's configuration and the interaction among its elements can emulate the benefits of nonlinearity, thus potentially simplifying the design and manufacturing of neuromorphic systems and enhancing their scalability. This shift in focus from individual neuron properties to network architecture could lead to significant advancements in the efficiency and applicability of neuromorphic computing.

                arXiv:2411.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.

                arXiv:2411.06315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical brain imaging relies heavily on image registration to accurately curate structural boundaries of brain features for various healthcare applications. Deep learning models have shown remarkable performance in image registration in recent years. Still, they often struggle to handle the diversity of 3D brain volumes, challenged by their structural and contrastive variations and their imaging domains. In this work, we present NeuReg, a Neuro-inspired 3D image registration architecture with the feature of domain invariance. NeuReg generates domain-agnostic representations of imaging features and incorporates a shifting window-based Swin Transformer block as the encoder. This enables our model to capture the variations across brain imaging modalities and species. We demonstrate a new benchmark in multi-domain publicly available datasets comprising human and mouse 3D brain volumes. Extensive experiments reveal that our model (NeuReg) outperforms the existing baseline deep learning-based image registration models and provides a high-performance boost on cross-domain datasets, where models are trained on 'source-only' domain and tested on completely 'unseen' target domains. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art for domain-agnostic 3D brain image registration, underpinned by Neuro-inspired Transformer-based architecture.

                arXiv:2411.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural additive model (NAM) is a recently proposed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method that utilizes neural network-based architectures. Given the advantages of neural networks, NAMs provide intuitive explanations for their predictions with high model performance. In this paper, we analyze a critical yet overlooked phenomenon: NAMs often produce inconsistent explanations, even when using the same architecture and dataset. Traditionally, such inconsistencies have been viewed as issues to be resolved. However, we argue instead that these inconsistencies can provide valuable explanations within the given data model. Through a simple theoretical framework, we demonstrate that these inconsistencies are not mere artifacts but emerge naturally in datasets with multiple important features. To effectively leverage this information, we introduce a novel framework, Bayesian Neural Additive Model (BayesNAM), which integrates Bayesian neural networks and feature dropout, with theoretical proof demonstrating that feature dropout effectively captures model inconsistencies. Our experiments demonstrate that BayesNAM effectively reveals potential problems such as insufficient data or structural limitations of the model, providing more reliable explanations and potential remedies.

                arXiv:2411.06613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are becoming mainstream, especially in sensitive application areas, the risk of data leakage has become a growing concern. Attacks like membership inference (MIA) have shown that trained models can reveal sensitive data, jeopardizing confidentiality. While traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) dominate ML applications, neuromorphic architectures, specifically Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), are emerging as promising alternatives due to their low power consumption and event-driven processing, akin to biological neurons. Privacy in ANNs is well-studied; however, little work has explored the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs. This paper examines whether SNNs inherently offer better privacy. Using MIAs, we assess the privacy resilience of SNNs versus ANNs across diverse datasets. We analyze the impact of learning algorithms (surrogate gradient and evolutionary), frameworks (snnTorch, TENNLab, LAVA), and parameters on SNN privacy. Our findings show that SNNs consistently outperform ANNs in privacy preservation, with evolutionary algorithms offering additional resilience. For instance, on CIFAR-10, SNNs achieve an AUC of 0.59, significantly lower than ANNs' 0.82, and on CIFAR-100, SNNs maintain an AUC of 0.58 compared to ANNs' 0.88. Additionally, we explore the privacy-utility trade-off with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD), finding that SNNs sustain less accuracy loss than ANNs under similar privacy constraints.

                arXiv:2411.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network with one hidden layer or a two-layer network (regardless of the input layer) is the simplest feedforward neural network, whose mechanism may be the basis of more general network architectures. However, even to this type of simple architecture, it is also a ``black box''; that is, it remains unclear how to interpret the mechanism of its solutions obtained by the back-propagation algorithm and how to control the training process through a deterministic way. This paper systematically studies the first problem by constructing universal function-approximation solutions. It is shown that, both theoretically and experimentally, the training solution for the one-dimensional input could be completely understood, and that for a higher-dimensional input can also be well interpreted to some extent. Those results pave the way for thoroughly revealing the black box of two-layer ReLU networks and advance the understanding of deep ReLU networks.

                arXiv:2411.07120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two complementary techniques for efficient adaptive optimization that reduce memory requirements while accelerating training of large-scale neural networks. The first technique, Subset-Norm adaptive step size, generalizes AdaGrad-Norm and AdaGrad(-Coordinate) by reducing the second moment term's memory footprint from $O(d)$ to $O(\sqrt{d})$ through step-size sharing, where $d$ is the model size. For non-convex smooth objectives under coordinate-wise sub-gaussian gradient noise, we prove a noise-adapted high-probability convergence guarantee showing improved dimensional dependence over existing methods. Our second technique, Subspace-Momentum, reduces the momentum state's memory footprint by operating in a low-dimensional subspace while applying standard SGD in the orthogonal complement. We establish high-probability convergence rates under similar relaxed assumptions. Empirical evaluation on LLaMA models from 60M to 1B parameters demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods, where combining subset-norm with subspace-momentum achieves Adam's validation perplexity in approximately half the training tokens (6.8B vs 13.1B) while using only 20% of the Adam's optimizer-states memory footprint and requiring minimal additional hyperparameter tuning.

                arXiv:2310.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely recognized for their proficiency in modeling temporal dependencies, making them highly prevalent in sequential data processing applications. Nevertheless, vanilla RNNs are confronted with the well-known issue of gradient vanishing and exploding, posing a significant challenge for learning and establishing long-range dependencies. Additionally, gated RNNs tend to be over-parameterized, resulting in poor computational efficiency and network generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Delayed Memory Unit (DMU). The DMU incorporates a delay line structure along with delay gates into vanilla RNN, thereby enhancing temporal interaction and facilitating temporal credit assignment. Specifically, the DMU is designed to directly distribute the input information to the optimal time instant in the future, rather than aggregating and redistributing it over time through intricate network dynamics. Our proposed DMU demonstrates superior temporal modeling capabilities across a broad range of sequential modeling tasks, utilizing considerably fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art gated RNN models in applications such as speech recognition, radar gesture recognition, ECG waveform segmentation, and permuted sequential image classification.

Abstract: A traditional approach to assessing emerging intelligence in the theory of intelligent systems is based on the similarity, "imitation" of human-like actions and behaviors, benchmarking the performance of intelligent systems on the scale of human cognitive skills. In this work we attempt to outline the shortcomings of this line of thought, which is based on the implicit presumption of the equivalence and compatibility of the originating and emergent intelligences. We provide arguments to the point that under some natural assumptions, developing intelligent systems will be able to form their own intents and objectives. Then, the difference in the rate of progress of natural and artificial systems that was noted on multiple occasions in the discourse on artificial intelligence can lead to the scenario of a progressive divergence of the intelligences, in their cognitive abilities, functions and resources, values, ethical frameworks, worldviews, intents and existential objectives: the scenario of the AGI evolutionary gap. We discuss evolutionary processes that can guide the development of emergent intelligent systems and attempt to identify the starting point of the progressive divergence scenario.

Abstract: Previous research in the scientific field has utilized statistical empirical models and machine learning to address fitting challenges. While empirical models have the advantage of numerical generalization, they often sacrifice accuracy. However, conventional machine learning methods can achieve high precision but may lack the desired generalization. The article introduces a Regression-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Reg-PINNs), which embeds physics-inspired empirical models into the neural network's loss function, thereby combining the benefits of generalization and high accuracy. The study validates the proposed method using the magnetopause boundary location as the target and explores the feasibility of methods including Shue et al. [1998], a data overfitting model, a fully-connected networks, Reg-PINNs with Shue's model, and Reg-PINNs with the overfitting model. Compared to Shue's model, this technique achieves approximately a 30% reduction in RMSE, presenting a proof-of-concept improved solution for the scientific community.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07232">Polariton lattices as binarized neuromorphic networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2401.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of exciton-polariton condensates, intricately interconnected and energized through non-resonant optical pumping. The network employs a binary framework, where each neuron, facilitated by the spatial coherence of pairwise coupled condensates, performs binary operations. This coherence, emerging from the ballistic propagation of polaritons, ensures efficient, network-wide communication. The binary neuron switching mechanism, driven by the nonlinear repulsion through the excitonic component of polaritons, offers computational efficiency and scalability advantages over continuous weight neural networks. Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems. The system's performance was evaluated using diverse datasets, including the MNIST dataset for image recognition and the Speech Commands dataset for voice recognition tasks. In both scenarios, the proposed system demonstrates the potential to outperform existing polaritonic neuromorphic systems. For image recognition, this is evidenced by an impressive predicted classification accuracy of up to 97.5%. In voice recognition, the system achieved a classification accuracy of about 68\% for the ten-class subset, surpassing the performance of conventional benchmark, the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model.

                arXiv:2402.00236v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reports an unintuitive finding that positional encoding enhances learning of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Positional encoding is a high-dimensional representation of time indices on input data. Most famously, positional encoding complements the capabilities of Transformer neural networks, which lack an inherent mechanism for representing the data order. By contrast, RNNs can encode the temporal information of data points on their own, rendering their use of positional encoding seemingly redundant/unnecessary. Nonetheless, investigations through synthetic benchmarks reveal an advantage of coupling positional encoding and RNNs, especially for handling a large vocabulary that yields low-frequency tokens. Further scrutinization unveils that these low-frequency tokens destabilizes the gradients of vanilla RNNs, and the positional encoding resolves this instability. These results shed a new light on the utility of positional encoding beyond its canonical role as a timekeeper for Transformers.

                arXiv:2408.11979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that performs iterative inference over network activities before updating weights. Recent work suggests that PC can converge in fewer learning steps than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning is not theoretically well understood. Here, we study the geometry of the PC energy landscape at the inference equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we first show that the equilibrated energy is simply a rescaled mean squared error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Our theory is validated by experiments on both linear and non-linear networks. Based on these and other results, we conjecture that all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work suggests that PC inference makes the loss landscape more benign and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the fundamental challenge of scaling PC to deeper models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09461">TX-Gen: Multi-Objective Optimization for Sparse Counterfactual Explanations for Time-Series Classification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In time-series classification, understanding model decisions is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19277">In-Simulation Testing of Deep Learning Vision Models in Autonomous Robotic Manipulators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing autonomous robotic manipulators is challenging due to the complex software interactions between vision and control components. A crucial element of modern robotic manipulators is the deep learning based object detection model. The creation and assessment of this model requires real world data, which can be hard to label and collect, especially when the hardware setup is not available. The current techniques primarily focus on using synthetic data to train deep neural networks (DDNs) and identifying failures through offline or online simulation-based testing. However, the process of exploiting the identified failures to uncover design flaws early on, and leveraging the optimized DNN within the simulation to accelerate the engineering of the DNN for real-world tasks remains unclear. To address these challenges, we propose the MARTENS (Manipulator Robot Testing and Enhancement in Simulation) framework, which integrates a photorealistic NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulator with evolutionary search to identify critical scenarios aiming at improving the deep learning vision model and uncovering system design flaws. Evaluation of two industrial case studies demonstrated that MARTENS effectively reveals robotic manipulator system failures, detecting 25 % to 50 % more failures with greater diversity compared to random test generation. The model trained and repaired using the MARTENS approach achieved mean average precision (mAP) scores of 0.91 and 0.82 on real-world images with no prior retraining. Further fine-tuning on real-world images for a few epochs (less than 10) increased the mAP to 0.95 and 0.89 for the first and second use cases, respectively. In contrast, a model trained solely on real-world data achieved mAPs of 0.8 and 0.75 for use case 1 and use case 2 after more than 25 epochs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89724">Complete suspension culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells supplemented with suppressors of spontaneous differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising resources for producing various types of tissues in regenerative medicine; however, the improvement in a scalable culture system that can precisely control the cellular status of hiPSCs is needed. Utilizing suspension culture without microcarriers or special materials allows for massive production, automation, cost-effectiveness, and safety assurance in industrialized regenerative medicine. Here, we found that hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with continuous agitation without microcarriers or extracellular matrix components were more prone to spontaneous differentiation than those cultured in conventional adherent conditions. Adding PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors in the suspension conditions suppressed the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs into ectoderm and mesendoderm, respectively. In these conditions, we successfully completed the culture processes of hiPSCs, including the generation of hiPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the expansion of bulk population and single-cell sorted clones, long-term culture with robust self-renewal characteristics, single-cell cloning, direct cryopreservation from suspension culture and their successful recovery, and efficient mass production of a clinical-grade hiPSC line. Our results demonstrate that precise control of the cellular status in suspension culture conditions paves the way for their stable and automated clinical application.

	<p>Objectives. Brain&amp;amp;ndash;behavior connections are a new means to evaluate sports performance. This electroencephalogram (EEG) study aims to estimate endurance exercise performance by investigating eigenvalue trends and comparing their sensitivity and linearity. Methods. Twenty-three cross-country skiers completed endurance cycling tasks. Twenty-four-channel full-brain EEG signals were recorded in the motor phase and recovery phase continuously. Eighteen EEG eigenvalues calculation methods were collected, commonly used in previous research. Time-frequency, band power, and nonlinear analyses were used to calculate the EEG eigenvalues. Their regression coefficients and correlation coefficients were calculated and compared, with the linear regression method. Results. The time-frequency eigenvalues shift slightly throughout the test. The power eigenvalues changed significantly before and after motor and recovery, but the linearity was not satisfactory. The sensitivity and linearity of the nonlinear eigenvalues were stronger than the other eigenvalues. Of all eigenvalues, Shannon entropy showed completely non-overlapping distribution intervals in the regression coefficients of the two phases, which were &amp;amp;minus;0.1474 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.0806 s&amp;amp;minus;1 in the motor phase and 0.2560 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.1365 s&amp;amp;minus;1 in the recovery phase. Shannon entropy amplitude decreased more in the F region of the brain than in the other regions. Additionally, the higher the level of sport, the slower the decline in Shannon entropy of the athlete. Conclusions. The Shannon entropy method provided more accurate estimations for endurance exercise performance compared to other eigenvalues.</p>

                Spigelian hernia is an uncommon form of ventral hernia, with an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 2%. This case report describes a 72-year-old female who presented with an obstructed right Spigelian hernia, a left Spigelian hernia, and an uncomplicated Meckel’s diverticulum, along with the management approach. The patient had experienced intermittent tenderness in the right iliac fossa for the last two months, which had worsened to severe pain over the previous two days, accompanied by a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an obstructed right Spigelian hernia containing dilated proximal small bowel, and a left uncomplicated spigelian hernia. The patient experienced worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. Emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing a right Spigelian hernia with viable small bowel loops, a non-complicated Meckel’s diverticulum located 20 cm from the ileocecal valve, and a small left Spigelian hernia. The right Spigelian hernia was repaired using intraperitoneal sublay mesh, while the left hernia was treated with primary repair. No bowel resection was performed at the site of the Meckel’s diverticulum, as it was non-inflamed, to prevent contamination of the mesh with bowel flora. Bilateral Spigelian hernias accompanied by Meckel’s diverticulum present a challenging clinical scenario. Although rare, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain due to the potential for serious complications.

                <p>This study aims to elucidate the methodology and compare the accuracy of different blood biomarkers for diagnosing ischemic stroke (IS). We reviewed 29 articles retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text. Among these, 23 articles involving 3,494 participants were suitable for meta-analysis. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) of all studies for meta-analysis was 0.89. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 (0.74&ndash;0.78) and 0.84 (0.83&ndash;0.86), respectively. Blood biomarkers from noninpatient settings demonstrated better diagnostic performance than those in inpatient settings (AUC 0.91 vs 0.88). Smaller sample sizes (&lt;100) showed better performance than larger ones (&ge;100; AUC 0.92 vs 0.86). Blood biomarkers from acute IS (AIS) patients showed higher diagnostic values than those from IS and other stroke types (AUC 0.91 vs 0.87). The diagnostic performance of multiple blood biomarkers was superior to that of a single biomarker (AUC 0.91 vs 0.88). The diagnostic value of blood biomarkers from Caucasians was higher than that from Asians and Africans (AUC 0.90 vs 0.89, 0.75). Blood biomarkers from those with comorbidities (AUC 0.92) showed a better diagnostic performance than those not reporting comorbidities (AUC 0.84). All the subgroups analyzed, including setting, sample size, target IS population, blood biomarker profiling, ethnicity, and comorbidities could lead to heterogeneity. Blood biomarkers have demonstrated sufficient diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing IS and hold promise for integration into routine clinical practice. However, further research is recommended to refine the optimal model for utilizing blood biomarkers in IS diagnosis.</p>

                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background Technology enhances teaching and learning quality, yet when educators lack tech proficiency, it hinders effective education and leads to frustration, lower confidence, and self-doubt. This study aims to investigate the experiences of university faculty members in relation to the impact of technology on their mental well-being. Methods Using a qualitative approach (grounded theory), ten university faculty members were selected for in-depth interviews based on criteria such as teaching experience, tenure, specific courses or subjects taught, and active engagement during the research period. The guiding research question, “What are the experiences and perceptions of university faculty members concerning techno-stress?” directed the study’s focus. The instrument (interview guide) that measured techno-stress consisted of 12 items and was administered virtually. Data were analyzed thematically to uncover common stressors, adaptive strategies, and institutional challenges faced by faculty in adapting to technology’s demands and work overload. Additionally, the study identified four subcategories: work overload, social and emotional interaction, adaption to new technologies, and expectations and teaching quality. Results Techno-stress is a composite of emotional and physical reactions triggered by the improper use of technology. Faculty members’ encounters with techno-stress have substantial implications for their quality of life. Conclusions This research highlights technology’s positive impact on higher education but notes faculty struggles with techno-stress, emphasizing the need for training, support, and boundaries to maintain work-life balance and enhance educational quality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-958/v3?src=rss">The macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries: A panel data analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Background Fenugreek, or Trigonella foenum-graecum L, is an edible and medicinal plant of the Fabaceae family. Fenugreek seeds contain a variety of phytochemicals, including proteins, lipids, amino acids, vitamins, flavonoids, steroidal saponins, coumarin, and alkaloids. Trigonelline TG is a bioactive plant alkaloid initially extracted from fenugreek seeds. A substantial portion of fenugreek’s health benefits may rely on the presence of TG. This study addresses the research gap for a fast, green, and economical method for quantifying trigonelline (TG) in fenugreek. Methods Fenugreek seeds from various origins were extracted using three green solvents: acetone (ACt), ethanol (EtOH), and water (H2O). The UPLCMSMS method was developed and validated using a green mobile phase of H2O: EtOH, and an r2-value of 0.999 in the linearity range of 0.1-500 ppb was adopted. The method was validated with an accuracy of 98.6% for trace analysis of TG using a small amount (10 mg) of fenugreek samples from five different origins. Results The average extract yield (±SD) was 5.36±6.3, with the highest extract yield observed in H2O. The ESI (+ve) of the UPLCMSMS resulted in the fragmentation pattern (m/z) 138→94.10→92.05→78.20. The TG quantification revealed an average TG concentration of 181.4, with the highest amount of TG in H2O extract (392.7±132.4 ppb), followed by EtOH (91.9±83.3 ppb) and ACt (59.5±30.9 ppb). The TG amount observed in the validation step substantiated the efficiency and reproducibility of the developed method. Conclusions The method may be used as an effective tool for a green, rapid, economical, and eco-friendly extraction and quantification of TG in diverse matrices of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, herbal, and food products.

Mitochondria and plastids import thousands of proteins. Their experimental localisation remains a frequent task, but can be resource-intensive and sometimes impossible. Hence, hundreds of studies make use of algorithms that predict a localisation based on a protein’s sequence. Their reliability across evolutionary diverse species is unknown. Here, we evaluate the performance of common algorithms (TargetP, Localizer and WoLFPSORT) for four photosynthetic eukaryotes (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Zea mays</i>, <i>Physcomitrium patens</i>, and <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) for which experimental plastid and mitochondrial proteome data is available, and 171 eukaryotes using orthology inferences. The match between predictions and experimental data ranges from 75% to as low as 2%. Results worsen as the evolutionary distance between training and query species increases, especially for plant mitochondria for which performance borders on random sampling. Specificity, sensitivity and precision analyses highlight cross-organelle errors and uncover the evolutionary divergence of organelles as the main driver of current performance issues. The results encourage to train the next generation of neural networks on an evolutionary more diverse set of organelle proteins for optimizing performance and reliability.

Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles. Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells, but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. We introduce CytoSummaryNet: a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30–68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework, providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies. Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets.

                <p>by Andrew J. Anderson, Chris Davis, Edmund C. Lalor</p>

To transform continuous speech into words, the human brain must resolve variability across utterances in intonation, speech rate, volume, accents and so on. A promising approach to explaining this process has been to model electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain responses to speech. Contemporary models typically invoke context invariant speech categories (e.g. phonemes) as an intermediary representational stage between sounds and words. However, such models may not capture the complete picture because they do not model the brain mechanism that categorizes sounds and consequently may overlook associated neural representations. By providing end-to-end accounts of speech-to-text transformation, new deep-learning systems could enable more complete brain models. We model EEG recordings of audiobook comprehension with the deep-learning speech recognition system Whisper. We find that (1) Whisper provides a self-contained EEG model of an intermediary representational stage that reflects elements of prelexical and lexical representation and prediction; (2) EEG modeling is more accurate when informed by 5-10s of speech context, which traditional context invariant categorical models do not encode; (3) Deep Whisper layers encoding linguistic structure were more accurate EEG models of selectively attended speech in two-speaker “cocktail party” listening conditions than early layers encoding acoustics. No such layer depth advantage was observed for unattended speech, consistent with a more superficial level of linguistic processing in the brain.

                <p>by Toshihito Umegaki, Hisashi Moriizumi, Fumiko Ogushi, Mutsuhiro Takekawa, Takashi Suzuki</p>

The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition (contact inhibition) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics (MD) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The source codes are freely available.

                <p>by Ciara Judge, Timothy Vaughan, Timothy Russell, Sam Abbott, Louis du Plessis, Tanja Stadler, Oliver Brady, Sarah Hill</p>

Accurately estimating the effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) of a circulating pathogen is a fundamental challenge in the study of infectious disease. The fields of epidemiology and pathogen phylodynamics both share this goal, but to date, methodologies and data employed by each remain largely distinct. Here we present EpiFusion: a joint approach that can be used to harness the complementary strengths of each field to improve estimation of outbreak dynamics for large and poorly sampled epidemics, such as arboviral or respiratory virus outbreaks, and validate it for retrospective analysis. We propose a model of R<sub>t</sub> that estimates outbreak trajectories conditional upon both phylodynamic (time-scaled trees estimated from genetic sequences) and epidemiological (case incidence) data. We simulate stochastic outbreak trajectories that are weighted according to epidemiological and phylodynamic observation models and fit using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. To assess performance, we test EpiFusion on simulated outbreaks in which transmission and/or surveillance rapidly changes and find that using EpiFusion to combine epidemiological and phylodynamic data maintains accuracy and increases certainty in trajectory and R<sub>t</sub> estimates, compared to when each data type is used alone. We benchmark EpiFusion’s performance against existing methods to estimate R<sub>t</sub> and demonstrate advances in speed and accuracy. Importantly, our approach scales efficiently with dataset size. Finally, we apply our model to estimate R<sub>t</sub> during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. EpiFusion is designed to accommodate future extensions that will improve its utility, such as explicitly modelling population structure, accommodations for phylogenetic uncertainty, and the ability to weight the contributions of genomic or case incidence to the inference.

Modeling the network topology of the human brain within the mesoscale has become an increasing focus within the neuroscientific community due to its variation across diverse cognitive processes, in the presence of neuropsychiatric disease or injury, and over the lifespan. Much research has been done on the creation of algorithms to detect these mesoscopic structures, called communities or modules, but less has been done to conduct inference on these structures. The literature on analysis of these community detection algorithms has focused on comparing them within the same subject. These approaches, however, either do not accomodate a more general association between community structure and an outcome or cannot accommodate additional covariates that may confound the association of interest. We propose a semiparametric kernel machine regression model for either a continuous or binary outcome, where covariate effects are modeled parametrically and brain connectivity measures are measured nonparametrically. By incorporating notions of similarity between network community structures into a kernel distance function, the high-dimensional feature space of brain networks, defined on input pairs, can be generalized to non-linear spaces, allowing for a wider class of distance-based algorithms. We evaluate our proposed methodology on both simulated and real datasets.

Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction is a highly challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Low reactivity rates in called neoantigens result in a difficult prediction scenario with limited training datasets. Here we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach to immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes. ImmugenX comprises of a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. Compared with state-of-the-art models for each task, ImmugenX’s encoding module performs comparably or better on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction and stability tasks. ImmugenX outperforms all compared models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.619, average precision: 0.514), with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction with the integration of TCR context information. ImmugenX performance is further analysed for interpretability, which locates areas of weakness found across existing immunogenicity models and highlight possible biases in public datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012079">A computational algorithm for optimal design of a bioartificial organ scaffold architecture</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Martina Bukač, Sunčica Čanić, Boris Muha, Yifan Wang</p>

We develop a computational algorithm based on a diffuse interface approach to study the design of bioartificial organ scaffold architectures. These scaffolds, composed of poroelastic hydrogels housing transplanted cells, are linked to the patient’s blood circulation via an anastomosis graft. Before entering the scaffold, the blood flow passes through a filter, and the resulting filtered blood plasma transports oxygen and nutrients to sustain the viability of transplanted cells over the long term. A key issue in maintaining cell viability is the design of ultrafiltrate channels within the hydrogel scaffold to facilitate advection-enhanced oxygen supply ensuring oxygen levels remain above a critical threshold to prevent hypoxia. In this manuscript, we develop a computational algorithm to analyze the plasma flow and oxygen concentration within hydrogels featuring various channel geometries. Our objective is to identify the optimal hydrogel channel architecture that sustains oxygen concentration throughout the scaffold above the critical hypoxic threshold.
The computational algorithm we introduce here employs a diffuse interface approach to solve a multi-physics problem. The corresponding model couples the time-dependent Stokes equations, governing blood plasma flow through the channel network, with the time-dependent Biot equations, characterizing Darcy velocity, pressure, and displacement within the poroelastic hydrogel containing the transplanted cells. Subsequently, the calculated plasma velocity is utilized to determine oxygen concentration within the scaffold using a diffuse interface advection-reaction-diffusion model. Our investigation yields a scaffold architecture featuring a hexagonal network geometry that meets the desired oxygen concentration criteria. Unlike classical sharp interface approaches, the diffuse interface approach we employ is particularly adept at addressing problems with intricate interface geometries, such as those encountered in bioartificial organ scaffold design. This study is significant because recent developments in hydrogel fabrication make it now possible to control hydrogel rheology and utilize computational results to generate optimized scaffold architectures.

                <p>by Christian Jarvers, Heiko Neumann</p>

Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system. One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture. While this problem has been widely documented, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We design simple, artificial image datasets in which shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features. We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision.

                <p>by Jyoti Tanwar, Kriti Ahuja, Akshay Sharma, Paras Sehgal, Gyan Ranjan, Farina Sultan, Anushka Agrawal, Donato D’Angelo, Anshu Priya, Vamsi K. Yenamandra, Archana Singh, Anna Raffaello, Muniswamy Madesh, Rosario Rizzuto, Sridhar Sivasubbu, Rajender K. Motiani</p>

Mitochondria regulate several physiological functions through mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. However, role of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in melanosome biology remains unknown. Here, we show that pigmentation requires mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. In vitro gain and loss of function studies demonstrate that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) is crucial for melanogenesis while MCU rheostat, MCUb negatively control melanogenesis. Zebrafish, MCU<sup>+/-</sup> and MCUb<sup>-/-</sup> mice models show that MCU complex drives pigmentation in vivo. Mechanistically, MCU silencing activates transcription factor NFAT2 to induce expression of keratin (5, 7, and 8) filaments. Interestingly, keratin5 in turn augments mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and potentiates melanogenesis by regulating melanosome biogenesis and maturation. Hence this signaling module acts as a negative feedback loop that fine-tunes both mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and pigmentation. Notably, mitoxantrone, an FDA approved drug that inhibits MCU, reduces pigmentation thereby highlighting therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake for clinical management of pigmentary disorders. Taken together, we reveal an MCU-NFAT2-Keratin5 driven signaling axis that acts as a critical determinant of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and pigmentation. Given the vital role of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and keratin filaments in cellular physiology, this feedback loop could be operational in a variety of other patho-physiological processes.

                <p>by Chelsea A. Simpson, Zach R. Celentano, Nicholas W. Haas, James B. McKinlay, Carey D. Nadell, Julia C. van Kessel</p>

Bacteria sense population density via the cell–cell communication system called quorum sensing (QS). The evolution of QS and its maintenance or loss in mixed bacterial communities is highly relevant to understanding how cell–cell signaling impacts bacterial fitness and competition, particularly under varying environmental conditions such as nutrient availability. We uncovered a phenomenon in which <i>Vibrio</i> cells grown in minimal medium optimize expression of the methionine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthesis genes via QS. Strains that are genetically “locked” at high cell density grow slowly in minimal glucose media and suppressor mutants accumulate via inactivating-mutations in <i>metF</i> (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) and <i>luxR</i> (the master QS transcriptional regulator). In mixed cultures, QS mutant strains initially coexist with wild type, but as glucose is depleted, wild type outcompetes the QS mutants. Thus, QS regulation of methionine/THF synthesis is a fitness benefit that links nutrient availability and cell density, preventing accumulation of QS-defective mutants.

                <p>by David Richter, Tim C. Kietzmann, Floris P. de Lange</p>

Perception is shaped by both incoming sensory input and expectations derived from our prior knowledge. Numerous studies have shown stronger neural activity for surprising inputs, suggestive of predictive processing. However, it is largely unclear what predictions are made across the cortical hierarchy, and therefore what kind of surprise drives this up-regulation of activity. Here, we leveraged fMRI in human volunteers and deep neural network (DNN) models to arbitrate between 2 hypotheses: prediction errors may signal a local mismatch between input and expectation at each level of the cortical hierarchy, or prediction errors may be computed at higher levels and the resulting surprise signal is broadcast to earlier areas in the cortical hierarchy. Our results align with the latter hypothesis. Prediction errors in both low- and high-level visual cortex responded to high-level, but not low-level, visual surprise. This scaling with high-level surprise in early visual cortex strongly diverged from feedforward tuning. Combined, our results suggest that high-level predictions constrain sensory processing in earlier areas, thereby aiding perceptual inference.

                Background A holistic architectural education is the culmination of learning knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values, which eventually reflects in the quality of graduates. Even though different schools of thought have made various kinds of qualitative contributions towards the evolution of architectural education in India, it has largely been dominated by the quantitative and technical aspects of its regulating framework. Architects engage with the demanding contradictions between responsibilities of an ethical nature, the dynamic challenges of practice, and the intricacies of architectural imagination. The aesthetical and imaginative foundations of the field make it incumbent upon the architects to possess a balance of ecumenical proficiencies for accountability and personalization. The purpose of the study is to identify relevant attributes of Competency Based Education (CBE) that can be adopted for architectural education in India. Methods This research follows a narrative review approach and a descriptive-analytic method to broadly understand the attributes of CBE and its potential relevance to architectural education in India. 323 articles were searched on various search strings based on their relevance to the inquiry. 76 documents written in English language were included and appraised through the Scale of the Assessment for Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tool to avoid any risk of bias. The PRISMA 2020 checklist and flow diagram has been used to report the findings of this narrative review. Result The study identifies eight critical parameters of CBE with respect to its definitions, origins, transitions, regulatory environment, characteristics, approaches and implications on teaching-learning, frameworks and models of assessment; and challenges, which makes a case for the relevance of CBE for architectural education in India, which hasn’t been explored yet. Conclusion The broader expectations of ‘being competent’ can be addressed through a conscious adoption of strategies of relevant attributes of CBE which can encourage building attitudes and temperament for life-long learning.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Background Ethiopia’s potato seed system is currently hindered by a disjointed regulatory framework, insufficient quality assurance processes, and a lack of collaboration among stakeholders, which collectively impede agricultural productivity and food security. The regulatory environment is characterized by inconsistent seed certification practices and a dependence on informal seed sources, negatively affecting the quality of potato seeds available to farmers. Although potatoes play a crucial role in global food security by providing high yields compared to other staple crops, the sector grapples with significant challenges due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, limited technical expertise, and the widespread presence of counterfeit seeds throughout the value chain. Methods To tackle these challenges, this mini-review outlines potential improvements, stressing the necessity for a unified regulatory framework tailored to the unique issues of vegetatively propagated crops. For this reason, we have used different literature source from web of science, Pubmed, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and other scientific websites. We have documented the most relevant information focusing on potato seed system, regulatory frameworks, quality assurance bottlenecks and pathways for improvement across the seed value chain. Results our paper highlights key recommendations that includes enhancing training for regulatory staff, investing in research for disease-resistant varieties, and bolstering public-private partnerships to encourage innovation and resource sharing. Furthermore, improving traceability in the seed supply chain is essential for maintaining seed quality and integrity. Conclusions This review calls for a comprehensive strategy that fosters stakeholder engagement and promotes sustainable practices to rejuvenate Ethiopia’s potato seed system, thereby supporting the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and strengthening national food security through integrated seed sector development and capacity improvement of the seed regulatory body as well as smallholder farmers.

                Background Current health recommender systems lack interactivity that relates to the current situation. Methods We designed and implemented an intervention study for obese patients that incorporates context information obtained from smartphone and smartwatch sensors, gamification, as well as joint goal management of patients and health coaches. We developed a health behaviour recommendation system comprising of a smartphone application, cloud platform for data management, and a data dashboard for coaches. Results We conducted a three months long study and analysed data from eight patients, focusing on system function, patient adherence, satisfaction and overall impact of the proposed system on changing health-related habits. Along with data analysis, we also provide patient feedback collected during interview round after the end of the study. Conclusion Patients could successfully implement the goals using the EghiFit app. Challenges regarding the data collection, recommendation synthesis, and patient engagement persist. Furthermore, reliable sensor data processing on current smartphone platforms is difficult due to system restrictions. Future research should further integrate sensor data, gaming, and health behaviour intervention design using smart devices.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials and Gen Z”. Narcissism refers to a personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behavior, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of assessing correlations between perceived health, perceived oral health, selfie-taking behavior, narcissism and oral health behavior in an adolescent population. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque using DMFT index and Plaque index. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form. Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1346/v1?src=rss">A Bioconductor/R Workflow for the Detection and Visualization of Differential Chromatin Loops [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Chromatin loops play a critical role in gene regulation by connecting regulatory loci and gene promoters. The identification of changes in chromatin looping between cell types or biological conditions is an important task for understanding gene regulation; however, the manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization of data sets describing 3D chromatin structure is challenging due to the large and complex nature of the relevant data sets. Methods Here, we describe a workflow for identifying and visualizing differential chromatin loops from Hi-C data from two biological conditions using the ‘mariner’, ‘DESeq2’ and ‘plotgardener’ Bioconductor/R packages. The workflow assumes that Hi-C data has been processed into ‘.hic’ or ‘.cool’ files and that loops have been identified using an existing loop-calling algorithm. Results First, the ‘mariner’ package is used to merge redundant loop calls and extract interaction frequency counts. Next, ‘DESeq2’ is used to identify loops that exhibit differential contact frequencies between conditions. Finally, ‘plotgardener’ is used to visualize differential loops. Conclusion Chromatin interaction data is an important modality for understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. The workflow presented here outlines the use of ‘mariner’ as a tool to manipulate, extract, and aggregate chromatin interaction data, ‘DESeq2’ to perform differential analysis of these data across conditions, samples, and replicates, and ‘plotgardener’ to explore and visualize the results.

                Across species, social behaviors are shaped and maintained through positive reinforcement of affiliative social interactions. As with nonsocial rewards, the reinforcing properties of social interactions have been shown to involve interplay between various brain regions and the mesolimbic reward system. In this review, we summarize findings from rodent research on the neural circuits that encode and mediate different components of social reward-seeking behavior. We explore methods to parse and study social reward-related behaviors using available behavioral paradigms. We also compare the neural mechanisms that support social versus nonsocial reward-seeking. Finally, we discuss how internal state and neuromodulatory systems affect reward-seeking behavior and the neural circuits that underlie social reward.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95595">Large-scale characterization of drug mechanism of action using proteome-wide thermal shift assays</a></h4>

              
                In response to an ever-increasing demand of new small molecules therapeutics, numerous chemical and genetic tools have been developed to interrogate compound mechanism of action. Owing to its ability to approximate compound-dependent changes in thermal stability, the proteome-wide thermal shift assay has emerged as a powerful tool in this arsenal. The most recent iterations have drastically improved the overall efficiency of these assays, providing an opportunity to screen compounds at a previously unprecedented rate. Taking advantage of this advance, we quantified more than one million thermal stability measurements in response to multiple classes of therapeutic and tool compounds (96 compounds in living cells and 70 compounds in lysates). When interrogating the dataset as a whole, approximately 80% of compounds (with quantifiable targets) caused a significant change in the thermal stability of an annotated target. There was also a wealth of evidence portending off-target engagement despite the extensive use of the compounds in the laboratory and/or clinic. Finally, the combined application of cell- and lysate-based assays, aided in the classification of primary (direct ligand binding) and secondary (indirect) changes in thermal stability. Overall, this study highlights the value of these assays in the drug development process by affording an unbiased and reliable assessment of compound mechanism of action.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98169">Derivation and internal validation of prediction models for pulmonary hypertension risk assessment in a cohort inhabiting Tibet, China</a></h4>

              
                Individuals residing in plateau regions are susceptible to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and there is an urgent need for a prediction nomogram to assess the risk of PH in this population. A total of 6603 subjects were randomly divided into a derivation set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Optimal predictive features were identified through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression technique, and nomograms were constructed using multivariate logistic regression. The performance of these nomograms was evaluated and validated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis. Comparisons between nomograms were conducted using the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) indices. Nomogram<sup>I</sup> was established based on independent risk factors, including gender, Tibetan ethnicity, age, incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB), atrial fibrillation (AF), sinus tachycardia (ST), and T wave changes (TC). The AUCs for Nomogram<sup>I</sup> were 0.716 in the derivation set and 0.718 in the validation set. Nomogram<sup>II</sup> was established based on independent risk factors, including Tibetan ethnicity, age, right axis deviation, high voltage in the right ventricle, IRBBB, AF, pulmonary P waves, ST, and TC. The AUCs for Nomogram<sup>II</sup> were 0.844 in the derivation set and 0.801 in the validation set. Both nomograms demonstrated satisfactory clinical consistency. The IDI and NRI indices confirmed that Nomogram<sup>II</sup> outperformed Nomogram<sup>I</sup>. Therefore, the online dynamic Nomogram<sup>II</sup> was established to predict the risks of PH in the plateau population.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96470">Exposure to live saprophytic Leptospira before challenge with a pathogenic serovar prevents severe leptospirosis and promotes kidney homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies demonstrated that <i>Leptospira biflexa</i>, a saprophytic species, triggers innate immune responses in the host during early infection. This raised the question of whether these responses could suppress a subsequent challenge with pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i>. We inoculated C3H/HeJ mice with a single or a double dose of <i>L. biflexa</i> before challenge with a pathogenic serovar, <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> serovar Copenhageni FioCruz (LIC). Pre-challenge exposure to <i>L. biflexa</i> did not prevent LIC dissemination and colonization of the kidney. However, it rescued weight loss and mouse survival thereby mitigating disease severity. Unexpectedly, there was correlation between rescue of overall health (weight gain, higher survival, lower kidney fibrosis marker ColA1) and higher shedding of LIC in urine. This stood in contrast to the <i>L. biflexa</i> unexposed LIC challenged control. Immune responses were dominated by increased frequency of effector T helper (CD4+) cells in spleen, as well as significant increases in serologic IgG2a. Our findings suggest that exposure to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> primes the host to develop Th1 biased immune responses that prevent severe disease induced by a subsequent challenge with a pathogenic species. Thus, mice exposed to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> before facing a pathogenic serovar may withstand infection with far better outcomes. Furthermore, a status of homeostasis may have been reached after kidney colonization that helps LIC complete its enzootic cycle.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94657">The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF220 maintains hindbrain Hox expression patterns through regulation of WDR5 stability</a></h4>

              
                The spatial and temporal linear expression of <i>Hox</i> genes establishes a regional <i>Hox</i> code, which is crucial for the antero-posterior (A-P) patterning, segmentation, and neuronal circuit development of the hindbrain. RNF220, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is widely involved in neural development via targeting of multiple substrates. Here, we found that the expression of <i>Hox</i> genes in the pons was markedly up-regulated at the late developmental stage (post-embryonic day E15.5) in <i>Rnf220<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mouse embryos. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed different <i>Hox</i> de-repression profiles in different groups of neurons, including the pontine nuclei (PN). The <i>Hox</i> pattern was disrupted and the neural circuits were affected in the PN of <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. We showed that this phenomenon was mediated by WDR5, a key component of the TrxG complex, which can be polyubiquitinated and degraded by RNF220. Intrauterine injection of WDR5 inhibitor (WDR5-IN-4) and genetic ablation of <i>Wdr5</i> in <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice largely recovered the de-repressed <i>Hox</i> expression pattern in the hindbrain. In P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, the retinoic acid-induced <i>Hox</i> expression was further stimulated by <i>Rnf220</i> knockdown, which can also be rescued by <i>Wdr5</i> knockdown. In short, our data suggest a new role of RNF220/WDR5 in <i>Hox</i> pattern maintenance and pons development in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95764">Shortcutting from self-motion signals reveals a cognitive map in mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals navigate by learning the spatial layout of their environment. We investigated spatial learning of mice in an open maze where food was hidden in one of a hundred holes. Mice leaving from a stable entrance learned to efficiently navigate to the food without the need for landmarks. We developed a quantitative framework to reveal how the mice estimate the food location based on analyses of trajectories and active hole checks. After learning, the computed ‘target estimation vector’ (TEV) closely approximated the mice’s route and its hole check distribution. The TEV required learning both the direction and distance of the start to food vector, and our data suggests that different learning dynamics underlie these estimates. We propose that the TEV can be precisely connected to the properties of hippocampal place cells. Finally, we provide the first demonstration that, after learning the location of two food sites, the mice took a shortcut between the sites, demonstrating that they had generated a cognitive map.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88933">Body mass and growth rates predict protein intake across animals</a></h4>

              
                Organisms require dietary macronutrients in specific ratios to maximize performance, and variation in macronutrient requirements plays a central role in niche determination. Although it is well recognized that development and body size can have strong and predictable effects on many aspects of organismal function, we lack a predictive understanding of ontogenetic or scaling effects on macronutrient intake. We determined protein and carbohydrate intake throughout development on lab populations of locusts and compared to late instars of field populations. Self-selected protein:carbohydrate targets declined dramatically through ontogeny, due primarily to declines in mass-specific protein consumption rates which were highly correlated with declines in specific growth rates. Lab results for protein consumption rates partly matched results from field-collected locusts. However, field locusts consumed nearly double the carbohydrate, likely due to higher activity and metabolic rates. Combining our results with the available data for animals, both across species and during ontogeny, protein consumption scaled predictably and hypometrically, demonstrating a new scaling rule key for understanding nutritional ecology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96962">Functional identification of soluble uric acid as an endogenous inhibitor of CD38</a></h4>

              
                Excessive elevation or reduction of soluble uric acid (sUA) levels has been linked to some of pathological states, raising another subject that sUA at physiological levels may be essential for the maintenance of health. Yet, the fundamental physiological functions and molecular targets of sUA remain largely unknown. Using enzyme assays and in vitro and in vivo metabolic assays, we demonstrate that sUA directly inhibits the hydrolase and cyclase activities of CD38 via a reversible non-competitive mechanism, thereby limiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) degradation. CD38 inhibition is restricted to sUA in purine metabolism, and a structural comparison using methyl analogs of sUA such as caffeine metabolites shows that 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one is the main functional group. Moreover, sUA at physiological levels prevents crude lipopolysaccharide (cLPS)-induced systemic inflammation and monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced peritonitis in mice by interacting with CD38. Together, this study unveils an unexpected physiological role for sUA in controlling NAD<sup>+</sup> availability and innate immunity through CD38 inhibition, providing a new perspective on sUA homeostasis and purine metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90191">Hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons modulate sevoflurane anesthesia and the post-anesthesia stress responses</a></h4>

              
                General anesthesia (GA) is an indispensable procedure necessary for safely and compassionately administering a significant number of surgical procedures and invasive diagnostic tests. However, the undesired stress response associated with GA causes delayed recovery and even increased morbidity in the clinic. Here, a core hypothalamic ensemble, corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), is discovered to play a role in regulating sevoflurane GA. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons delay the induction of and accelerated emergence from sevoflurane GA, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons accelerates induction and delays awakening. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons induce rapid cortical activation during both the steady and deep sevoflurane GA state with burst-suppression oscillations. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons relieve the sevoflurane GA-elicited stress response (e.g., excessive self-grooming and elevated corticosterone level). These ﬁndings identify PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons modulate states of anesthesia in sevoflurane GA, being a part of anesthesia regulatory network of sevoflurane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87962">A distributed brain response predicting the facial expression of acute nociceptive pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is a private experience observable through various verbal and non-verbal behavioural manifestations, each of which may relate to different pain-related functions. Despite the importance of understanding the cerebral mechanisms underlying those manifestations, there is currently limited knowledge of the neural correlates of the facial expression of pain. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, noxious heat stimulation was applied in healthy volunteers and we tested if previously published brain signatures of pain were sensitive to pain expression. We then applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the fMRI data to predict the facial expression of pain. Results revealed the inability of previously developed pain neurosignatures to predict the facial expression of pain. We thus propose a facial expression of pain signature (FEPS) conveying distinctive information about the brain response to nociceptive stimulations with minimal or no overlap with other pain-relevant brain signatures associated with nociception, pain ratings, thermal pain aversiveness, or pain valuation. The FEPS may provide a distinctive functional characterization of the distributed cerebral response to nociceptive pain associated with the socio-communicative role of non-verbal pain expression. This underscores the complexity of pain phenomenology by reinforcing the view that neurosignatures conceived as biomarkers must be interpreted in relation to the specific pain manifestation(s) predicted and their underlying function(s). Future studies should explore other pain-relevant manifestations and assess the specificity of the FEPS against simulated pain expressions and other types of aversive or emotional states.

">Excitatory Cortical Neurons from CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder Patient-Derived Organoids Show Early Hyperexcitability Not Identified in Neurogenin2 Induced Neurons</a></h4>

              
                CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathy resulting from variants in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) that lead to impaired kinase activity or loss of function. CDD is one of the most common genetic etiologies identified in epilepsy cohorts. To study how CDKL5 variants impact human neuronal activity, gene expression and morphology, CDD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and their isogenic controls were differentiated into excitatory neurons using either an NGN2 induction protocol or a guided cortical organoid differentiation. Patient-derived neurons from both differentiation paradigms had decreased phosphorylated EB2, a known molecular target of CDKL5. Induced neurons showed no detectable differences between cases and isogenic controls in network activity using a multielectrode array, or in MAP2+ neurite length, and only two genes were differentially expressed. However, patient-derived neurons from the organoid differentiation showed increased synchrony and weighted mean firing rate on the multielectrode array within the first month of network maturation. CDD patient-derived cortical neurons had lower expression of CDKL5 and HS3ST1, which may change the extracellular matrix around the synapse and contribute to hyperexcitability. Similar to the induced neurons, there were no differences in neurite length across or within patient-control cell lines. Induced neurons have poor cortical specification while the organoid derived neurons expressed cortical markers, suggesting that the changes in neuronal excitability and gene expression are specific to cortical excitatory neurons. Examining molecular mechanisms of early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons is a promising avenue for identification of CDD therapeutics.

">Asymmetric neuromodulation in the respiratory network contributes to rhythm and pattern generation</a></h4>

              
                Like other brain circuits, the brainstem respiratory network is continually modulated by neurotransmitters that activate slow metabotropic receptors. In many cases, activation of these receptors only subtly modulates the respiratory motor pattern. However, activation of some receptor types evokes the arrest of the respiratory motor pattern as can occur following the activation of mu-opioid receptors. We propose that the varied effects of neuromodulation on the respiratory motor pattern depend on the pattern of neuromodulator receptor expression and their influence on the excitability of their post-synaptic targets. Because a comprehensive characterization of these cellular properties across the respiratory network remains challenging, we test our hypothesis by combining computational modelling with ensemble electrophysiologic recording in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) using high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Our computational model encapsulates the hypothesis that neuromodulatory transmission is organized asymmetrically across the respiratory network to promote rhythm and pattern generation. To test this hypothesis, we increased the strength of neuromodulatory connections in the model and used selective agonists in situ while monitoring pre-BotC ensemble activities. The model predictions of increasing slow inhibition were consistent with experiments examining the effect of systemic administration of the 5HT1aR agonist 8-OH-DPAT. Similarly, the predicted effects of increasing slow excitation in the model were experimentally confirmed in pre-BotC ensemble activities before and after systemic administration of the mu-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. We conclude that asymmetric neuromodulation can contribute to respiratory rhythm and pattern generation and accounts for its varied effects on breathing.

                The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the connection between anxiety brought on by social stressors and the negative impact on relationship formation have remained elusive. In order to address this question, we used the social defeat model in the socially monogamous prairie vole to investigate the impact of this stress on pair bond formation. Social defeat experience inhibited partner preference formation in males but promoted preference in females. Furthermore, pair bonding increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in male prairie voles, while defeat experience increased BNST CRH expression in females. Chemogenetic excitation of BNST CRH neurons during a short cohabitation with a new partner promoted a partner preference in stress-naive prairie voles. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of BNST CRH neurons during cohabitation with a new partner blocked partner preference in stress-naive males but promoted preference in defeated males. Inhibition of BNST CRH neurons also blocked partner preference in stress-naive females but did not alter preference behavior in defeated females. This study revealed sexual dimorphism in not only the impact of social defeat on pair bond formation, but also in the role BNST CRHergic neurons play in regulating changes in pair bonding following social conflict.

">Hunger modulates exploration through suppression of dopamine signaling in the tail of striatum</a></h4>

              
                Caloric depletion leads to behavioral changes that help an animal find food and restore its homeostatic balance. Hunger increases exploration and risk-taking behavior, allowing an animal to forage for food despite risks; however, the neural circuitry underlying this change is unknown. Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animal's spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative "hunger neurons" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These AgRP neurons are poly-synaptically connected to TOS-projecting dopaminergic neurons through the lateral hypothalamus, the central amygdala, and the periaqueductal grey. We thus delineate a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that coordinates changes in exploration behavior in the hungry state.

                Astrocyte morphology in vivo is heterogeneous across different subtypes and dynamically changes in response to various stimuli. However, several questions on the mechanistic links between shape and function remain unanswered. Here, we developed an efficient protocol to generate pure populations of morphologically distinct human astrocytes in vitro, which we used for a systematic analysis of shape-function relationships. We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with in vivo astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we show that the observed morphological differences are correlated with changes in key cytoskeletal proteins, which offers a potential link to the observed functional differences. Finally, we demonstrated that different morphological subtypes of astrocytes have distinct reactivity responses to a common stimulus. This study offers a glimpse into the shape-function dynamics of human astrocytes, highlighting potential mechanistic links between cytoskeletal usage and astrocyte function, while also providing tools and datasets that will be useful for further studies into human glial biology in health and disease.

                The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a major health issue after nearly 7 millions of death toll in the last four years. As the world is recovering with improving vaccines and antiviral treatments, the alarming rate of long-COVID, or Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), calls for further investigations. Among a list of symptoms associated with multi-organ dysfunctions, the neurological complications are particularly intriguing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.

">Polystyrene nanoplastics promote neurodegeneration by catalyzing TDP43 hyperphosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                The ubiquity of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in our environment raises substantial concerns about their potential impact on human health. Recent studies have shown that PS-NPs cross the blood-brain-barrier and accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS), raising the concerns on the causal role of PS-NP exposure and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we utilized human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to examine the effects of PS-NPs on neuronal function and health. Our results revealed that PS-NPs penetrate neuronal cells in a size-dependent manner, and are bound by various cellular proteins, including TDP43, a key protein implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interestingly, CK1 and GSK3beta kinases that are known to phosphorylate TDP-43 were found to be associated with PS-NPs. This observation suggests that PS-NPs may play a role in facilitating conditions that lead to TDP43 phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that exposure to healthy motor neurons with PS-NPs resulted in ALS-like phenotypes, characterized by hyperphosphorylated TDP-43, disrupted neuronal morphology, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and accelerated motor neuron death. These findings suggest that PS-NPs contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and highlight the urgent need for strategies to limit human exposure to nanoplastics.

">Continuous sensorimotor transformation enhances robustness of neural dynamics to perturbation in macaque motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the motor cortex dynamically evolves to plan and generate movement. How motor cortex adapts to dynamic environments or perturbations remains to be fully explored. In this study, we investigated whether dynamic nature of targets in a reach task requires distinct preparatory dynamics in motor cortex and result in varying levels of robustness against disruptions. Two monkeys were trained to perform delayed center-out reaches either to a static target (static condition) or a rotating target that needed to be intercepted (moving condition). Despite nearly identical hand kinematics in both two conditions, responses to the perturbation of intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) differed. In the static condition, ICMS led to prolonged reaction times, particularly when delivered shortly before movement onset and at anterior sites in PMd, aligning with previous findings. Unexpectedly, ICMS reduced reaction times in the moving condition. Furthermore, neural firing rates differed between the static and the moving conditions, with population activity in the latter exhibiting more rapid changes post-perturbation. Spatio-temporal sensorimotor transformation dominated throughout the preparation in the moving condition, while the static condition showed less stable motor intention representation, particularly during the late delay period. An input-driven model replicated the differences in RT-prolonging effect by assuming distinct input control strategy for the static and the moving condition. These findings suggest that input from a moving target to motor cortex can counteract ICMS effects, enabling the motor network to generate appropriate commands more quickly. Lastly, we propose that ICMS may facilitate go cue recognition, providing a potential explanation for the shortened reaction times in the moving condition.

">More with less: Simulation-based inference enables accurate diffusion-weighted MRI with minimal acquisition time</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dw-MRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging, providing non-invasive insights into brain microstructure. However, obtaining reproducible and accurate maps requires lengthy acquisition due to the need to massively oversample the parameter space. This means that tensor-based dw-MRI accessibility is still relatively low in daily practice, and more advanced approaches with increased sensitivity and specificity to microstructure are seldom applied in research and clinical contexts. Motivated by recent advances in simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, this work uses neural networks to model the posterior distribution of key diffusion parameters when provided experimental data, allowing accurate estimation with fewer measurements and without the need to train on real data. We find that SBI outperforms standard non-linear least squares fitting under noisy and sparse data conditions in both diffusion tensor and kurtosis imaging, reducing imaging time by 90% while maintaining high accuracy and robustness. Demonstrated on simulated and real data in healthy and pathological brains, this approach can substantially impact radiology by: i) increasing dw-MRI access to more patients, including those unable to undergo long exams; ii) promoting advanced dw-MRI protocols for greater microstructure sensitivity; and iii) rescuing older data where noise hindered analysis. Combining SBI with dw-MRI could greatly improve clinical MRI workflows by reducing patient discomfort, enhancing scan efficiency, and enabling advanced imaging approaches in a data and privacy friendly way.

">Oscillatory coupling between thalamus, cerebellum and motor cortex in essential tremor</a></h4>

              
                Background Essential tremor is hypothesized to emerge from synchronized oscillatory activity within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. However, this hypothesis has not yet been tested using local field potentials directly recorded from the thalamus alongside signals from both the cortex and cerebellum, leaving a gap in the understanding of essential tremor. Objectives To clarify the importance of cerebello-thalamo-cortical oscillatory coupling for essential tremor. Methods We investigated oscillatory coupling between thalamic local field potentials and simultaneously recorded magnetoencephalography in 19 essential tremor patients with externalized deep brain stimulation electrodes. Brain activity was measured while patients repeatedly adopted a tremor-provoking posture and while pouring rice from one cup to another. In a whole-brain analysis of coherence between the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus and cortex, we contrasted epochs containing tremor and epochs lacking tremor. Results Both postural and kinetic tremor were associated with an increase of thalamic power and thalamo-cortex coherence at individual tremor frequency in the bilateral cerebellum and primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to tremor. These areas also exhibited an increase in corticomuscular coherence in the presence of tremor. The coupling of motor cortex to both thalamus and muscle correlated with tremor amplitude during postural tremor. Conclusions These results demonstrate that essential tremor is indeed associated with increased oscillatory coupling at tremor frequency within a cerebello-thalamo-cortical network, with coupling strength directly reflecting tremor severity.

                The FDA approved personalized resting-state functional connectivity for precise target localization in rTMS. However, objective methods for pinpointing optimal connectivity clusters have remained limited. This study proposed a watershed-based approach with a graphical user interface, offering threshold-independent segmentation that outperformed traditional threshold-based methods. Demonstrated in the context of Alzheimer's disease, this approach enabled precise targeting within the default mode network, specifically the posterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule. By facilitating more accurate and individualized localization, this method holds promise for refining the precision of personalized rTMS treatment.

">Spatially mismatched cerebral blood flow and neuronal activity by intracortical microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                Intracortial microstimulation (ICMS) is widely used in brain-machine interface for neuroprosthetics, particularly with aims of restoring lost sensory and motor functions. However, it remains poorly understood whether neuronal and blood flow responses by ICMS are spatially and temporally matched, as well as their underlying mechanism. Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the process by which neuronal activity regulates blood flow in the brain to meet local metabolic demands. A hypothetically suboptimal NVC by ICMS may exacerbate the neuronal survival near electrode, contributing to neurodegeneration. In this study, we used wide-field imaging, laser speckle imaging and two-photon imaging in transgenic mice expressing calcium fluorescent indicators in neurons or vascular mural cells to examine this hypothesis. Our results showed blood flow responses are delayed at peak time and prolonged in duration compared with neuronal responses. By varying the stimulation amplitudes, we found that low stimulation intensity lower than 50A preserved NVC. In contrast, high intensity stimulation caused spatially mismatched NVC, i.e. in the adjacent range within 200~400 m from electrode tip, elicited blood flow compromises but neuronal activities increase. Ca2+ is the key regulator of contractile tone of vascular mural cells. Our results showed that Ca2+ sensitivity at vascular mural cells, i.e. vessel diameter change per unit of Ca2+ change, was decreased in the adjacent region of electrode, which partially explained the compromised and mismatched NVC, and which likely further lead to ischemia and neurodegeneration. This study offers a new insight into ICMS-associated neuronal and vascular physiology, and provides an important implication towards optimal design of ICMS: low intensities is more neuroprotective than high intensities by preserving NVC and preventing ischemia. Our discoveries pave the way for new research consideration and contribute to the development of more advanced brain-machine interface.

                Letter processing plays a key role in visual word recognition. However, word recognition models typically overlook or greatly simplify early perceptual processes of letter recognition. We suggest that optimal transport theory may provide a computational framework for describing letter shape processing. We use representational similarity analysis to show that optimal transport cost (Wasserstein distance) between pairs of letters aligns with neural activity elicited by visually presented letters <225 ms after stimulus onset, outperforming an existing approach based on shape overlap. We additionally show that optimal transport can capture the emergence of geometric invariances (e.g., to position or size) observed in letter perception. Finally, we demonstrate that Wasserstein distance predicts neural activity similarly well to features from artificial networks trained to classify images and letters. However, whereas representations in artificial neural networks emerge in a computationally unconstrained manner, our proposal provides a computationally explicit route to modeling the earliest orthographic processes.

">Free water elimination tractometry for aging brains</a></h4>

              
                Tractometry of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) non-invasively quantifies tissue properties of brain connections. It is widely used in aging studies but could be less reliable in aging brains due to increased white matter free water. We demonstrate that computational free water elimination (FWE) increases reliability and accuracy of tractometry in a large (n = 339) cohort of older adults (66 - 103 y.o.). We found substantial (up to ~37%) improvements in reliability in a split-half comparison at every stage of the pipeline: estimation of voxel-level fiber orientation distribution functions, delineation of major pathway trajectories, and assessment of tissue properties along the pathways. FWE also improves inferences from tractometry, producing more accurate cross-validated predictions of clinician Fazekas scores. By sub-sampling a multi-b-value dataset, we demonstrated that these findings generalize to both single-b-value data, which is important for many datasets where only one b-value may be available. Overall, the results highlight the importance of accounting for free water in tractometry studies, especially in aging brains. We provide open-source software for free-water elimination that can be applied to a wide range of clinical and research datasets (https://github.com/nrdg/fwe)

                Long-read RNA sequencing has transformed transcriptome analysis by enabling comprehensive mapping of full-length transcripts, providing an unprecedented resolution of transcript diversity, alternative splicing, and transcript-specific regulation. In this study, we employed nanopore long-read RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of human fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells, and stem cell-derived cortical neurons, identifying extensive transcript diversity with 15,072 transcripts in stem cell-derived cortical neurons, 13,048 in fibroblasts, and 12,759 in induced pluripotent stem cells. Our analyses uncovered 35,519 differential transcript expression events and 5,135 differential transcript usage events, underscoring the complexity of transcriptomic regulation across these cell types. Importantly, by integrating differential transcript expression and usage analyses, we gained deeper insights into transcript dynamics that are not captured by gene-level expression analysis alone. Notably, differential transcript usage analysis highlighted transcript-specific changes in disease-relevant genes such as APP, KIF2A, and BSCL2, associated with Alzheimer's disease, neuronal migration disorders, and degenerative axonopathies, respectively. This added resolution emphasizes the significance of transcript-level variations that often remain hidden in traditional differential gene expression analyses. Overall, our work provides a framework for understanding transcript diversity in both pluripotent and specialized cell types, which can be used to investigate transcriptomic changes in disease states. Additionally, this study underscores the utility of differential transcript usage analysis in advancing our understanding of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, paving the way for identifying transcript-specific therapeutic targets.

">Processing reliant on granule cells is essential for motor learning but dispensable for many cerebellar-dependent behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar dysfunction leads to motor, learning, emotional, and social deficits. It is assumed that these deficits arise from impaired processing of mossy fiber inputs that activate granule cells (GCs) that in turn excite Purkinje cells (PCs). However, high-frequency spontaneous PC firing might also influence behaviors. To clarify how the cerebellum regulates behaviors, we compared the effects of disrupting either GC signaling, which selectively perturbs cerebellar processing, or PC signaling, which disrupts cerebellar processing and spontaneous PC firing. We find that both GC and PC signaling are required for eyeblink conditioning and vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) learning. However, disrupting PC signaling impairs baseline VOR, anxiety, and social behaviors, but abolishing GC signaling does not. This establishes that cerebellar processing is essential for motor learning, but is not required for many cerebellum-dependent behaviors. This suggests that such behaviors could be rescued by elevating firing in downstream targets, as shown previously for social deficits.

">Synchronous processing of temporal information across the hippocampus, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Information processing for interval timing is supported by several brain regions, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and frontal cortical areas. However, little is known about the mechanism by which temporal information is processed cooperatively in the distributed brain network. Here, we investigated the neuronal processing of temporal information in the hippocampal CA1, dorsal striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex by simultaneously recording neuronal activity during a temporal bisection task. We found time cells representing elapsed time during the interval period across all three regions. Seeking a potential mechanism for the correlative representation of time, we found that theta oscillations were dominant in these areas and modulated the activity of these time cells. Moreover, the synchronization of the time cell pairs across the areas was also regulated by theta oscillations. Taken together, these results demonstrated the presence of synchronous activity of time cells across the three areas on a fine time scale, which was supported by theta oscillations. In addition, decoding analysis revealed that the activity of the time cells in these areas correlated with the rats' decisions based on their internal time estimation, with the decoded time also showing correlations across the three regions. Thus, the cooperative activity of time-cell assemblies in the three regions reflected the recognition of elapsed time in the rats. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the pivotal role of neuronal synchronization of time cells in supporting temporal processing in the distributed brain network.

">Stroke and Motor Recovery are Associated with Regional and Age-Specific Changes in Periodic and Aperiodic Cortical Activity</a></h4>

              
                Normal aging is associated with widespread changes in neuronal structure, function, and activity. The consequences of focal brain injury on global neuronal activity in aged individuals are poorly understood. Historically, stroke and aging have been associated with changes in narrow-band periodic neuronal activity, however recent work has highlighted the importance of broad-band aperiodic activity. Aperiodic activity is represented by the 1/f slope of power spectral density generated by cortical activity. Abnormalities in aperiodic activity have been identified in psychiatric disorders and stroke, are associated with cognitive dysfunction in aging, and have been hypothesized to reflect changes in excitation/inhibition balance. Here we sought to further explore changes in both periodic and aperiodic cortical activity in neurotypical intact young and aged healthy individuals and individuals with stroke. We compared resting state electroencephalograms from all participants after applying the specparam algorithm, which decomposes the power spectrum into aperiodic and periodic components. We also correlated stroke outcomes using previously obtained tests of motor outcome (box and block) to average whole cortex spectral slopes within the stroke group. Consistent with prior work we found a significant flattening (decrease in exponent) of power spectral slope with normal aging. We also found that both aging and stroke were associated with fewer periodic peaks within the power spectrum. Interestingly, we found that stroke was associated with a significant increase in spectral slope, but age moderated this effect. Younger stroke patients showed minimal difference in slope while older stroke patients had significantly steeper slopes (opposite to the direction in normal aging). Using MRIs from stroke participants we investigated the lesion locations most associated with changes in slope. Interestingly deep lesions were observed to have the greatest influence on cortical spectral slope. Finally, slope in the stroke group was correlated with performance on a test of manual dexterity, however this correlation was much more significant in aged individuals. Our data suggest that stroke in the aged brain has unique effects on aperiodic activity possibly reflecting unique influence of injury on cerebral excitation/inhibition balance in aged individuals and that the degree of these changes may be related to stroke outcomes.

">Reprogramming the neuronal secretory and metabolic machinery using correctors for Alzheimer therapy</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and personality changes, leading to dementia. The primary cause of the cognitive decline that characterizes AD is the loss of neurons, hypothesized as being due to secretory defects in neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. There is growing evidence that in Alzheimer there is impaired neuronal metabolism due to an increase in free radicals and mitochondrial fission, leading to loss in ATP synthesis required for neurotransmission. Therefore, impaired metabolism in neurons may lead to the observed defects in neurotransmitter release, resulting in the loss of neuronal function and connections in regions of the brain involved in memory and reasoning. In our earlier studies, peptide inhibitor targeting oligomeric ATAD3A, a protein essential for mitochondrial fission and bioenergetics, were found to partially rescue from AD, both in AD neurons and AD mice. In the current study in AD neurons, neuronal porosome reconstitution combined with either a linear or circular peptide inhibitor of ATAD3A oligomers, was able to restore AD neurons to near normal levels of viability and greatly reduce oxidative stress in mitochondria. Additionally, the peptide and a small molecule considered safe by the FDA and used as a food additive, were also able to greatly increase viability in AD neurons and provide reduction to near normal levels of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Collectively, these results demonstrate great promise as secretory and metabolic correctors for AD therapy.

">Grin2a Hypofunction Disrupts Hippocampal Network Oscillations and E/I Balance Contributing to Cognitive Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Background: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, particularly those containing the GluN2A subunit, play a critical role in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. The GluN2A subunit, encoded by the Grin2a gene, is essential for maintaining cognitive function, including working memory. In this study, we explore how Grin2a mutations impair working memory and disrupt hippocampal network oscillations and E/I balance.Methods: Grin2a mutant mice were assessed for spatial working memory deficits using the 8-arm radial maze. We utilized multi-electrode arrays and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to evaluate network oscillation and synaptic inputs to pyramidal cells in ex vivo hippocampal slices. We performed an immunohistochemical analysis of hippocampal slices to evaluate changes in the abundance of GABAergic neurons. Results: Our results demonstrate that Grin2a deficiency impairs spatial working memory and disrupts coupling of theta-gamma oscillations in the hippocampus. Moreover, Grin2a mutants express an overabundance of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons that integrate into hippocampal circuits and destabilize excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) input to CA1 pyramidal neurons. Conclusion: This study highlights the critical role of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors in maintaining hippocampal network synchrony. Impairments in network synchrony and E/I balance within the hippocampus may drive the cognitive deficits observed in Grin2a-related disorders such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and intellectual disability.

">Temporal cohort number, neural composition, and connectivity vary along the Drosophila larval body axis</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits are the fundamental computational units of the nervous system, and neural stem cell lineages are the fundamental developmental units of the nervous system. How these units map onto each other is a critical constraint on CNS function. The developing Drosophila nerve cord has emerged as a powerful model to study lineage-based circuit assembly. Here, lineages are organized into temporal cohorts, which are sets of similar neurons born within a tight time window, and connectomic analysis shows that neurons of a temporal cohort have similar circuit-level connectivity. A major limitation has been the focus on a single representative segment, which is problematic because the body and nervous system comprise multiple segments organized into axially diverse regions, each with distinctive behaviors and circuits. How variation in stem cell lineage development impacts circuit configuration is unknown. Here, using the Drosophila NB3-3 lineage at different axial levels as a model we determine the variation in cell biological decisions made by the lineage and examine its impact on temporal cohorts. We combined lineage tracing, manipulation of cell death pathways, marker gene analysis, and anterograde circuit tracing from somatosensory neurons. Depending on region, temporal cohort number is modulated by stem cell proliferation. The number and molecular identities of neurons within a temporal cohort are tuned by various cell biological mechanisms, all acting post-mitotically. Temporal cohorts can be mapped into similar or different circuits. Overall, this study provides new fundamental insight into how diverse circuits emerge from a constrained pool of stem cells in vivo.

">Direct comparison of EEG resting state and task functional connectivity patterns for predicting working memory performance using connectome-based predictive modeling</a></h4>

              
                The use of machine learning techniques combined with advanced neuroimaging methods to reveal a complex relationship between patterns of neuronal activity and behavioral characteristics is an actively developing area in modern neuroscience. Investigating brain activity data non-invasively recorded in resting-state conditions has substantially enhanced our understanding of the neuronal foundations of cognitive functions. However, results of more recent studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging suggest that task-based paradigms may outperform resting state ones in predicting cognitive outcomes. To date, no studies have tested this hypothesis using EEG data. The aim of this study was to experimentally compare, for the first time, the predictive power of models built on high-density EEG data acquired during rest and an auditory working memory task execution, while utilizing different data processing pipelines to ensure the robustness and reliability of the findings. In accordance with previous studies, we found that modeling performance was slightly better for task EEG data compared to resting state recordings, except for high working memory load, where resting state data was superior to task-based functional connectivity in terms of predictive capacity. In general, models derived from both conditions showed overall high modeling accuracy, reaching up to R2 = 0.31. Functional connectivity in the alpha frequency band was the most efficient predictor of working memory scores, followed by that of theta and beta bands. Finally, we demonstrated that the choice of parcellation atlas and functional connectivity method significantly impacted the ultimate results, which should be taken into consideration when designing future experiments.

">Modeling brain signaling as Markovian helps explain its structure-function relationship</a></h4>

              
                Structure determines function. However, this universal theme in biology has been surprisingly difficult to observe in human brain neuroimaging data. Here, we link structure to function by hypothesizing that brain signals propagate as a Markovian process on an underlying structure. We focus on a metric called the commute time: the average number of steps for a random walker to go from region A to B and then back to A. Commute times based on white matter tracts from diffusion MRI exhibit an average {+/-} standard deviation Spearman correlation of -0.26 {+/-} 0.08 with functional MRI connectivity data across 434 UK Biobank individuals and -0.24 {+/-} 0.06 across 400 HCP Young Adult brain scans. These seemingly weak correlations are stronger by a factor of 1.5 compared to communication measures such as search information and communicability for the UK Biobank individuals. The difference further widens to a factor of 5 when commute times are correlated to the principal mode of functional connectivity from its singular value decomposition. We simulate brain function and demonstrate the utility of commute time as a metric accounting for polysynaptic (indirect) connectivity to better link structure with function.

">Optogenetic Central Amygdala Stimulation is Highly Reinforcing and Strongly Outcompetes Fentanyl Self-Administration in Male, but not Female, Rats</a></h4>

              
                The central nucleus of the amygdala plays a key role in many aspects of substance use disorders, in particular biasing behaviors toward one drug or natural reward over another, yet the role of this region in opioid self-administration remains unclear. Here, we report that pharmacological inactivation of the central amygdala reduces fentanyl self-administration, while intra-central amygdala opioid receptor antagonism dose-dependently increases fentanyl self-administration. We tested whether optogenetic activation of the central amygdala would increase motivation for fentanyl in rats with a long fentanyl self-administration history. While pairing fentanyl delivery with optogenetic central amygdala activation increased fentanyl self-administration, optoactivation itself was highly reinforcing and, in choice settings, was pursued over fentanyl despite mounting effort requirements, delays, and sporadic reward availability. Of note, under free response conditions, these effects were limited to male rats; while female rats avidly responded for optogenetic activation of the central amygdala, this activation was less effective in enhancing fentanyl intake, and it was not preferred over fentanyl. In contrast, under discrete trial choice which precluded independent regulation of intake of the two options, both females and males preferred optoactivation to fentanyl. These results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation of neural activity within the anterior central amygdala does not appear to potentiate the reinforcing effects of fentanyl, but is itself highly reinforcing regardless of sex, and, in male rats can robustly outcompete fentanyl. In contrast, in females, fentanyl intake is relatively insensitive to competing opportunities for optoactivation, except when opportunities to obtain drug or optoactivation are sparse.

	<p>Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a therapeutic assessment protocol for the Screening and Support of Youth (SASY). SASY provides brief but comprehensive community-based screening and support for diverse youth in the community. Methods: SASY screening evaluates symptoms, functioning and clinical risk. The Kiddie Computerized Adaptive Test was used to evaluate seven different diagnoses and symptom severity. The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Self was used to measure functional impairment. Measures were scored according to nationally developed norms. An algorithm was developed to aggregate symptom and function ratings into an overall score for clinical risk. The results are discussed with participants in a motivational interview designed to promote insight, followed by the opportunity for the participant to engage in an online intervention. Protocol changes necessitated by social distancing during the pandemic led to innovative methods including the use of a QR code for recruitment, integration of both online and offline participation, and expansion from in-person recruitment within the schools to virtual engagement with youth throughout the community. The final sample included disproportionately more Black or African American and Hispanic youth as compared to school and community statistics, suggesting that optimization of online and offline methods in research may facilitate the recruitment of diverse populations. Qualitative interviews indicated that the screening and feedback raised youth awareness of their wellbeing and/or distress, its impact on their functioning, and engagement with options for improved wellbeing. Conclusions: The emergence of innovative methods optimizing the advantages of both online and offline methods, developed as a necessity during the pandemic, proved advantageous to the feasibility and acceptability of community-based recruitment of at-risk, minoritized youth.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Unlike enriched environments for rodents, human-built environments often hinder neuroplasticity through sedentary lifestyles, to which exercise can merely overcome its adverse effects. This paper introduces &amp;quot;environmental affordance for physical activity&amp;quot; to quantify the potential of spatial layout designs to stimulate activity and sustain neuroplasticity, mainly hippocampal neurogenesis. Methods: A novel framework links metabolic equivalents (METs) that can be afforded by the spatial layout of the built environment to its role in increasing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)&amp;amp;mdash;a biomarker that promotes and sustains adult hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Equations are developed to assess the built environment&amp;amp;rsquo;s affordance for physical activity through BDNF changes measurable after brief exposure to the built environment for 20&amp;amp;ndash;35 min. Results: The developed equations are evidenced to be feasible to cause BDNF release through low- to moderate-intensity physical activity. This model provides a feasible assessment tool to test the built environment&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness towards neurosustainability. Conclusions: By sustaining neurogenesis, the environmental affordance for physical activity holds promise for improving mental health and preventing cognitive decline.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation is thought to reduce ataxia severity in individuals with hereditary cerebellar ataxia (HCA). This multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial aimed to examine the efficacy of a 30-week goal-directed rehabilitation program compared with 30 weeks of standard care on function, ataxia, health-related quality of life, and balance in individuals with an HCA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with an autosomal dominant or recessive ataxia (aged ≥15 years) were enrolled at 5 sites in Australia. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive rehabilitation (6 weeks of outpatient physiotherapy followed by a 24-week home exercise program) (n = 39) or continued their usual activity (n = 37). The primary outcome measure was the motor domain of the Functional Independence Measure (mFIM) at 7 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the SF-36v2, assessed at 7, 18, and 30 weeks. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seventy-one participants (rehabilitation, 37; standard-care, 34) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At 7 weeks, mFIM (mean difference 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 to 4.26, <i>p</i> = 0.028) and SARA (−1.21, 95% CI: −2.32 to −0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.032) scores improved after rehabilitation compared with standard care. Compared with standard care, rehabilitation improved SARA scores at 30 weeks (mean difference −1.51, 95% CI: −2.76 to −0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.017), but not mFIM scores (1.74, 95% CI: −0.32 to 3.81, <i>p</i> = 0.098). Frequent adverse events in both groups were fatigue, pain, and falls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Goal-directed rehabilitation improved function at 7 weeks, with improvement in ataxia and health-related quality of life maintained at 30 weeks in individuals with HCA, beyond that of standard care. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

">A Neural Network Model of Visual Attention Integrating Biased Competition and Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                We present a neural network model of visual attention (NNMVA) that integrates biased competition and reinforcement learning to capture key aspects of attentional behavior. The model combines self-attention mechanisms from Vision Transformers (ViTs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for working memory, and an actor critic reinforcement learning framework to map visual inputs to behavioral outputs. The self-attention mechanism simulates biased competition among artificial neural representations, determining their influence on working memory, which in turn provides top-down feedback to guide attention. Trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using reward feedback paralleling learning processes in non-human primates the NNMVA replicates key behavioral signatures of attention, such as improved performance and faster reaction times for cued stimuli. Manipulating the model's attention mechanisms affects performance in ways analogous to experimental manipulations in primate frontal eye fields and superior colliculus. Additionally, artificially inducing attentional biases alters value estimates and temporal difference (TD) errors, offering predictions about how attention may interact with dopamine related learning signals in the brain. Our findings suggest that reward-driven behavior alone can account for several key correlates of attention, providing a computational framework to explore the interplay between attention and reinforcement learning in both biological and artificial systems.

">Neural Context Reinstatement of Recurring Events</a></h4>

              
                Episodic recollection involves retrieving context information bound to specific events. However, autobiographical memory largely comprises recurrent, similar experiences that become integrated into joint representations. In the current study, we extracted a neural signature of temporal context from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether recalling a recurring event accompanies the reinstatement of one or multiple instances of its occurrence. We asked 52 young adults to study and recall lists of words that included both once-presented and repeated items. Participants recalled repeated items in association with neighboring list items from each occurrence, but with stronger clustering around the repetition's initial occurrence. Furthermore, multivariate spectral EEG analyses revealed that neural activity from just prior to the recall of these words resembled patterns of activity observed near the item's first occurrence, but not its second. Together, these results suggest that the initial occurrence of an event carries stronger temporal context associations than later repetitions.

">Medial prefrontal cortical neurotransmitters reactive to relapse-promoting and relapse-suppressing cues in rats trained to self-administer cocaine or alcohol</a></h4>

              
                Environmental cues conditioned to signal drug availability (S+) or omission (S-) activate specific neurons (neuronal ensembles/engram cells) within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to promote and suppress drug relapse in rats. However, the neurochemical source of such cue-specific activation remains unknown. In this study, we determined extracellular neurotransmitter fluctuations reactive to S+ vs. S- in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices of male rats trained to lever-press for cocaine or alcohol self-administration. In cocaine- or alcohol-trained rats exposed to S+, no significant neurotransmitter fluctuations were observed in IL or PL. In cocaine-trained rats exposed to S-, glutamate, serotonin, taurine and adenosine were increased in PL but not in IL. In alcohol-trained rats exposed to S-, glutamate was increased, while dopamine and GABA were decreased, in IL but not in PL. Although S+ reactive neurotransmitters driving neuronal activation in mPFC remains to be elucidated, glutamate is likely the source of such activation by S- in rats trained to self-administer cocaine or alcohol. While drugs used for self-administration and cue-conditioning appear to dictate the type and anatomical specificity of S- evoked neurotransmission within mPFC, glutamate may serve as a common therapeutic target to mimic relapse-suppression by S- across cocaine and alcohol use disorders (CUD and AUD). In contrast, serotonin, taurine and adenosine may serve as the targets in CUD, while dopamine and GABA may serve as the targets in AUD.

">Retrospective Attention Can Trigger Visual Perception Without Dependence on Either Cue Awareness or Target Reporting</a></h4>

              
                Retrospective attention, guided by cues after stimulus offset, enhances perception of threshold-level Gabor patches. The neural mechanisms underlying this effect, and its dependence on cue awareness and target reporting, remain unclear. Using EEG in report and no-report paradigms with visible and invisible post-cues, we found that orientation discrimination improved with retro-cues regardless of cue visibility. Compared to visible conditions, under invisible conditions, retro-cueing effects were weaker, limited to stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 66.67 ms, and linked to N2pc component. Visible retro-cueing effects persisted at SOAs of 100 ms, evoking strong P3b in report condition and weak VAN in no-report condition. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that in report conditions, neural processing of cued targets was earlier, stronger, and more generalized in the frontoparietal region; in no-report conditions, only cued targets were decoded in the parieto-occipital region. Our findings indicate that retrospective attention can trigger visual perception independently of cue awareness and the target reporting, thus contributing to current discussions on theories of consciousness.

">Sex differences in central amygdala glutamate responses to calcitonin gene-related peptide</a></h4>

              
                Women are disproportionately affected by chronic pain compared to men. While societal and environmental factors contribute to this disparity, sex-based biological differences in the processing of pain are also believed to play significant roles. The central lateral nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) is a key region for the emotional-affective dimension of pain, and a prime target for exploring sex differences in pain processing since a recent study demonstrated sex differences in CGRP actions in this region. Inputs to CeLC from the parabrachial nucleus (PB) play a causal role in aversive processing, and release both glutamate and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is thought to play a crucial role in chronic pain by potentiating glutamatergic signaling in CeLC. However, it is not known if this CGRP-mediated synaptic plasticity occurs similarly in males and females. Here, we tested the hypothesis that female CeLC neurons experience greater potentiation of glutamatergic signaling than males following endogenous CGRP exposure. Using trains of optical stimuli to evoke transient CGRP release from PB terminals in CeLC, we find that subsequent glutamatergic responses are preferentially potentiated in CeLC neurons from female mice. This potentiation was CGRP-dependent and involved a postsynaptic mechanism. This sex difference in CGRP sensitivity may explain sex differences in affective pain processing.

">Anterior cingulate neurons display subregion-specific interaction with frontal eye fields as revealed by combined antidromic stimulation and resting state imaging</a></h4>

              
                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to exert cognitive control over saccade generation in the frontal eye fields (FEF), but the nature of this interaction remains unclear. Although prior imaging studies have suggested ACC interacts with FEF, few studies have confirmed this by electrophysiological recordings. This study aimed to characterize the functional connectivity between ACC and medial and lateral FEF during cognitive saccade tasks. We combined resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) with single-unit electrophysiology in two macaque monkeys performing memory-guided saccade and pro-/anti-saccade tasks. Anti- and ortho-dromic stimulation was used to electrophysiologically identify ACC neurons mono- and polysynaptically connected to FEF. We analyzed ACC neuronal selectivity for different task aspects and correlated these properties with both positive and negative rs-fMRI functional connectivity between ACC and FEF subregions. Anti- and ortho-dromically identified ACC neurons were predominantly connected to medial FEF, which showed stronger positive functional connectivity with ACC compared to lateral FEF. Sites with higher proportions of task-selective neurons yielded stronger functional connectivity with FEF. This stronger functional connectivity was particularly related to the delay and saccadic periods of different cognitive saccade tasks. Using combined imaging and electrophysiology, our findings provide converging evidence for functional interactions between ACC and FEF, predominantly medial FEF regions which encode large amplitude saccades. The correlation between functional connectivity and task-related neuronal selectivity supports ACC's interaction with FEF in the modulation of saccade generation and cognitive control. Additionally, we report suggestive evidence that mono- and poly-synaptic connections may be related to positive functional connectivity, but we found no such relationship for negative functional connectivity (anticorrelations). These results advance our understanding of prefrontal cortical interactions in oculomotor control and the electrophysiological mechanisms of positive and negative resting-state functional connectivity.

	<p>TDP-43 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that plays a central role in neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as TDP-43 proteinopathies. Under physiological conditions, TDP-43 is primarily localized to the nucleus, but in its pathological form it aggregates in the cytoplasm, contributing to neuronal death. Given its association with numerous diseases, particularly ALS and FTLD, the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 aggregation and its impact on neuronal function have been extensively investigated. However, little is still known about the spreading of this pathology from cell to cell. Recent research has unveiled the possibility that TDP-43 may possess prion-like properties. Specifically, misfolded TDP-43 aggregates can act as templates inducing conformational changes in native TDP-43 molecules and propagating the misfolded state across neural networks. This review summarizes the mounting and most recent evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies supporting the prion-like hypothesis and its underlying mechanisms. The prion-like behavior of TDP-43 has significant implications for diagnostics and therapeutics. Importantly, emerging strategies such as small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies, and gene therapies targeting TDP-43 propagation offer promising avenues for developing effective treatments. By elucidating the mechanisms of TDP-43 spreading, we therefore aim to pave the way for novel therapies for TDP-43-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <p>Successful behavior depends on the attentional state and other factors related to decision-making, which may modulate neuronal activity differently. Here, we investigated whether attentional state and behavioral outcome (i.e., whether a target is detected or missed) are distinguishable using the power and phase of local field potential recorded bilaterally from area V4 of two male rhesus monkeys performing a cued visual attention task. To link each trial's outcome to pairwise measures of attention that are typically averaged across trials, we used several methods to obtain single-trial estimates of spike count correlation and phase consistency. Surprisingly, while attentional location was best discriminated using gamma and high-gamma power, behavioral outcome was best discriminated by alpha power and steady-state visually evoked potential. Power outperformed absolute phase in attentional/behavioral discriminability, although single-trial gamma phase consistency provided reasonably high attentional discriminability. Our results suggest a dissociation between the neuronal mechanisms that regulate attentional focus and behavioral outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/11/ENEURO.0512-23.2024?rss=1">A Stochastic Dynamic Operator Framework That Improves the Precision of Analysis and Prediction Relative to the Classical Spike-Triggered Average Method, Extending the Toolkit</a></h4>

              
                <p>Here we test the stochastic dynamic operator (SDO) as a new framework for describing physiological signal dynamics relative to spiking or stimulus events. The SDO is a natural extension of existing spike-triggered average (STA) or stimulus-triggered average techniques currently used in neural analysis. It extends the classic STA to cover state-dependent and probabilistic responses where STA may fail. In simulated data, SDO methods were more sensitive and specific than the STA for identifying state-dependent relationships. We have tested SDO analysis for interactions between electrophysiological recordings of spinal interneurons, single motor units, and aggregate muscle electromyograms (EMG) of major muscles in the spinal frog hindlimb. When predicting target signal behavior relative to spiking events, the SDO framework outperformed or matched classical spike-triggered averaging methods. SDO analysis permits more complicated spike&ndash;signal relationships to be captured, analyzed, and interpreted visually and intuitively. SDO methods can be applied at different scales of interest where spike-triggered averaging methods are currently employed, and beyond, from single neurons to gross motor behaviors. SDOs may be readily generated and analyzed using the provided <I>SDO Analysis Toolkit</I>. We anticipate this method will be broadly useful for describing dynamical signal behavior and uncovering state-dependent relationships of stochastic signals relative to discrete event times.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1344/v1?src=rss">Migration, Urbanism and Health: Moving Toward Systems-Informed Policy and Practice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Migration and displacement are pivotal determinants of urban health, influencing both direct and indirect health outcomes. Migrants may face unique health risks, often exacerbated by economic, social, and environmental factors encountered during transit or upon resettlement. As migration patterns shift due to geopolitical, climatic, and economic pressures, they reshape the global and urban policy landscapes in unpredictable ways, presenting challenges that will continue to evolve in the coming decades. Current legal frameworks, in many cases, do not adequately account for migrant populations, hindering policy responses and complicating the protection of migrant health. Therefore, effective urban health interventions must be inclusive of migrant populations and expand beyond healthcare services. A systems-thinking approach that recognizes the broader determinants of health—including housing, employment, social services, and urban infrastructure—is essential to address the intersecting challenges migrants face. Despite these challenges, migration remains crucial to the functioning of urban environments. Migrant workers consistently contribute to the healthy operation of cities, underpinning key infrastructure and services. However, to optimize policy responses and improve urban health outcomes, more robust data and evidence on the health risks and outcomes of migrants, as well as the structural drivers of migration, are needed. Moreover, macro factors such as climate change, future pandemics, and geopolitical shifts are likely to influence both migration dynamics and migrant health. To anticipate and respond to these evolving challenges, a systems-informed and holistic vision of urban health is required—one that integrates migration into the broader urban policy and planning frameworks to foster healthier, more resilient cities.

                Background This study aimed to determine the relationships between hematological parameters- hemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Counts (TLC), platelet counts, Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII), Neutrophil Monocyte Ratio (NMR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and the severity of COVID-19 disease and their use in predicting severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods and Material This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of 573 symptomatic adult inpatients of COVID 19 admitted to our tertiary care center. Statistical analysis used The above-mentioned hematological parameter levels were noted and compared between the two categories of COVID-19 disease, namely non-severe and severe COVID-19 using logistic regression methods. Their cut-off values were detected using the ROC curve. Results The median TLC, ANC, NLR, SII, NMR, PLR were notably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that NMR (OR=1.029, p=0.006) and ALC (OR=0.999, p=0.002) were statistically significant independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Conclusions The hematological parameters mentioned, can be used for predicting severe COVID-19 disease at admission. ALC and NMR levels could be used as hematological markers to predict severity of COVID-19 in adult patients with their cut off values being < 1105 cells/cubic millimeter and > 10.434 respectively.

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data (secondary dataset) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011–2012 and NHANES 2013–2014 cycles, relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.’s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates (demographical characteristics) impacting periodontal disease were considered, and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health’s impact on periodontal disease. Results Among the 2764 Participants, more than a quarter (29.1%) were aged over 60 years, 52% were females. Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried Participants affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between Participants with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Our findings suggest trends in periodontal disease prevalence linked to mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance. However, the absence of statistically significant findings calls for caution in interpreting these relationships. We recommend that future studies further investigate these potential associations to provide a clearer understanding.

                Introduction The social media landscape has undergone radical changes and has revolutionized consumer perspectives, purchasing habits, and behaviors. Amidst this emerging trend is the rise of influencer marketing and its impact on the purchase intentions of followers. The objective is to explore the characteristics of influencers that contribute to their credibility. This research aims to explore the role of consumers’ attitude toward brands on their intention to adopt brands endorsed by influencers. Methods This cross-sectional research was undertaken among GenZ in the urban landscape of India. Data collected was analyzed using SmartPLS4 software. Findings Trust, expertise, and similarity were the significant antecedents of the formation of influencer credibility. Attractiveness did not have a significant influence on influencer credibility. A complementary partial mediation of Attitude towards a brand is observed in the association between influencer credibility and the purchase intention of followers. Attitude towards the video also had a significant positive influence on purchase intention. Conclusion The study found that Gen Z places little importance on an influencer’s attractiveness, as it has no significant impact on credibility. However, attitude toward the brand strongly influenced purchase intention and partially mediated the relationship between influencer credibility and purchase intention.

Autism is a developmental disability. Research demonstrated that children with autism benefit from early diagnosis and early intervention. Genetic factors are considered major contributors to the development of autism. Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), has been evaluated in phenotype prediction, but this method has been limited in its application to autism. We developed a DL model, the Separate Translated Autism Research Neural Network (STAR-NN) model to predict autism status. The model was trained and tested using whole exome sequencing data from 43,203 individuals (16,809 individuals with autism and 26,394 non-autistic controls). Polygenic scores from common variants and the aggregated count of rare variants on genes were used as input. In STAR-NN, protein truncating variants, possibly damaging missense variants and mild effect missense variants on the same gene were separated at the input level and merged to one gene node. In this way, rare variants with different level of pathogenic effects were treated separately. We further validated the performance of STAR-NN using an independent dataset, including 13,827 individuals with autism and 14,052 non-autistic controls. STAR-NN achieved a modest ROC-AUC of 0.7319 on the testing dataset and 0.7302 on the independent dataset. STAR-NN outperformed other traditional ML models. Gene Ontology analysis on the selected gene features showed an enrichment for potentially informative pathways including potassium ion transport.

Shoot stem cells, harbored in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), play key roles during post-embryonic development of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and function as the origin of plant aerial tissues. Multiple transcription factors are involved in the sophisticated transcriptional regulation of stem cell homeostasis, with the <i>WUSCHEL</i> (<i>WUS</i>)/<i>CLAVATA3</i> (<i>CLV3</i>) negative feedback loop playing a central role. WUS acts as a master regulator in maintaining stem cells through its transcriptional regulatory activity including repressive and activating abilities. Although the interaction between WUS and TOPLESS confers the repressive activity of WUS in transcriptional control, the mechanism by which WUS activates gene expression remains elusive. Here, we showed that DORNRÖSCHEN competitively interacts with WUS and disturbs the WUS homodimer, which recruits BRAHMA to activate <i>CLV3</i> expression via nucleosome depletion for maintaining the stem cell pool.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dopamine (DA) signaling is evoked by both food and drugs that humans come to abuse. Moreover, physiological state (e.g., hunger versus satiety) can modulate the response. However, there is great heterogeneity among DA neurons. Limited studies have been performed that could resolve the interaction between physiological state and drug responsivity across groups of DA neurons. Here, we measured the activity of neurons in transgenic Tg (th2:GCaMP7s) zebrafish larva that expresses a calcium indicator (GCaMP7s) in A11 (posterior tuberculum) and a part of A14 (caudal hypothalamus and intermediate hypothalamus) DA populations located in the hypothalamus of the larval zebrafish. Fish were recorded in one of two physiological states: ad-libitum fed (AL) and food deprived (FD) and before and after acute exposure to different doses of the stimulant drug amphetamine (0, 0.7, and 1.5 μM). We quantified fluorescence change, activity duration, peak rise/fall time, and latency in the calcium spikes of the DA neurons. Our results show that baseline DA neuron activity amplitude, spike duration, and correlation between inter- and intra-DA neurons were higher in the FD than in the AL state. Dose-dependent AMPH treatment further increased the intensity of these parameters in the neuron spikes but only in the FD state. The DA activity correlation relatively increased in AL state post-AMPH treatment. Given that hunger increases drug reactivity and the probability of relapse to drug seeking, the results support populations of DA neurons as potential critical mediators of the interaction between physiological state and drug reinforcement.</p>

                Background Projects enable the resolution of problems and alter societal realities, assuming they represent the optimal choices to modify living conditions positively. If projects are deemed intelligent solutions to problems, why do they fail? This question will be addressed in this article through bibliometric analysis. Methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted on the success or failure factors influencing social investment projects, through a descriptive study with search equations, utilizing a comparative matrix to analyze 32 articles from Scopus and 22 from Web of Science. Results As a result, the number of publications, the themes addressed, and their origins between 2018 and 2023 were identified. The VOSviewer software allowed for identifying keywords and their relationships; with this input, a review of scientific production was conducted to subsequently identify the factors influencing projects and how they have been addressed within their contexts. Conclusions In conclusion, it was found that both the factors influencing success or failure in projects are permeated by the environment and the impact of political, social, and economic factors, in addition to the interaction of elements related to soft and hard skills.

                Endometriosis is a common chronic non curable neuro-inflammatory condition, which can cause endometriosis-related pelvic pain (ERPP). Sufferers may struggle with side effects and/or risks from conventional medical and surgical treatments, or not get pain relief. Increasing numbers of endometriosis patients wish to explore holistic management with fewer side effects, however it is important that medical professionals maintain an evidence-based practice for recommended treatments. We present up-to-date evidence of holistic strategies used for managing ERPP including nutrition, body and mind therapies, acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the use of adjunct devices such as phallus length reducers and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Recent findings: Nutrition: Gluten-free, low-nickel and high intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids diets improve ERPP. Low FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols), plant-based diet and antioxidant vitamin supplementation is helpful including those with concurrent irritable bowel syndrome. Body and Mind: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is beneficial in postoperative pain reduction, whilst mindfulness has been shown to reduce pain scores and dyschezia. Progressive muscle relaxation therapy and regular yoga sessions improve ERPP and Quality of life. Acupuncture: Acupuncture and moxibustion show improved pain scores compared to conventional therapies alone. Adjunct devices: TENS improves deep dyspareunia and reduces the number of days pain is experienced. Summary: Holistic management strategies for ERPP should be incorporated into routine counselling when discussing conservative, medical and or surgical treatments for endometriosis. The growing evidence presented for the use of holistic management strategies gives hope to those patients who cannot have, or don’t respond to conventional approaches and as an adjunct alongside standard treatments. These findings should be incorporated into the routine counselling when seeing patients in the gynaecology outpatient setting presenting with chronic pelvic pain.

                The psychosocial well-being of every individual is as important as the well-being of long-distance voyages, especially that they have to spend longer hours and days travelling to their destinations with all the experiences of adventure and adversities characterizing the journey. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the psychosocial well-being of long-distance seafarers on board shipping vessels to gain an understanding of their psychological and social well-being with the objective of ameliorating the adversities associated with these travels. A systematic review will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (2020) statement. The databases to be searched for the data will be limited to Scopus, Web of Science, and Advanced Google Scholar using keywords selected by the reviewers. Meta-analysis, narrative synthesis, or both will be used depending on the extent of heterogeneity across eligible observational studies included in the review. Some specific countries will be selected for data extraction, and only data published in English will be included. It is expected that the findings from this review will bring to bear if these categories of seafarers are prone to risks that affect their psychosocial wellbeing and if so discovered. This protocol was registered with the PROSPERO. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024517277(08/03/2024)

                Background Humanity faces dual existential crises of biodiversity loss and global warming. Acknowledging the environmental impact of sports, the United Nations is calling on the sports sector to take the lead in fighting climate change and adopting climate-neutral practices. Research on the greenhouse gas emissions of amateur league play is evolving but to date there are few studies that have described the travel patterns for large samples of teams and explored ways to reduce travel. Methods Travel distances for the 2022/23 season were calculated for 339 amateur football and handball teams playing in different leagues in Bavaria. The program Gurobi was utilised to optimise the grouping of teams in order to reduce travel by car. Results The study showed that playing in a higher amateur league most often resulted in longer travel distances for both women’s and men’s sports. Some amateur teams had to travel up to 2,958 kilometres for one season of play. All 339 teams combined travelled a total of 474,231 km (1398.9 per team in average) for away matches in the 2022/23 season of play. Optimising the groups in which teams play can reduce total travel distances by up to 19.7% while keeping the number of games played constant. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel distances in amateur football and handball, despite being shorter than those of professional teams, contribute significantly to carbon emissions. Due to the greater number of amateur teams and the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is crucial to explore ways of reducing travel in amateur sports. This touches on ethical issues regarding how much travel that causes greenhouse gas emissions is justified in amateur play. Algorithm based optimisation of which teams play against each other appears to be a straightforward, cost-effective, and scalable method for reducing travel emissions in amateur sports.

                Objective The shift to online learning during COVID-19 led to increased musculoskeletal discomforts and impacted students’ quality of life. Neck pain (NP), once a minor issue, has become more prevalent due to prolonged electronic device use in new learning methods. This study aims to measure the prevalence of NP among University of Sharjah (UOS) students during the COVID-19 online learning period and to investigate the factors that provoked it. Methods This study focused on young adult students aged 17-26 and did not consider gender or athletic status due to the university’s demographics and pandemic restrictions. Demographic data, Neck Disability Index (NDI) assessments, and pain management information were gathered and analyzed using SPSS 24 through univariate and bivariate methods. Results The prevalence of NP during COVID-19, among 325 UOS students was found to be 62.7%, 64.41% of which had NP at the time of doing the survey. NDI scores were found to be skewed. The median was 16% which indicates mild NP while the interquartile range was 19.11. Most participants reported experiencing posterior neck pain (38.77%), primarily attributed to prolonged sitting (81.23%). Factors such as lifting, personal care, and emotional well-being were found to have a significant impact on NDI. Participants who did not seek medical attention exhibited significantly higher levels of neck pain disability, as measured by the NDI. The median NDI score for this group was 20, with an interquartile range of 16.89 while, those who sought medical attention had a higher median NDI score of 34 with interquartile range of 22. Conclusion This study highlights the prevalence of neck pain among UOS students, emphasizing the need for postural improvements and further research on prevention strategies in the UAE.

                Passive acoustic monitoring of soundscapes and biodiversity produces vast amounts of audio recordings, but the management and analyses of these raw data present technical challenges. A multitude of software solutions exist, but none can fulfil all purposes required for the management, processing, navigation, and analysis of acoustic data. The field of ecoacoustics needs a software tool that is free, evolving, and accessible. We take a step in that direction and present ecoSound-web: an open-source, online platform for ecoacoustics designed and built by ecologists and software engineers. ecoSound-web can be used for storing, re-sampling, organising, analysing, and sharing soundscape recording or metadata projects. Specifically, it allows manual annotation of soniferous animals and soundscape components, automatic annotation with deep-learning models for all birds and for UK bat species, peer-reviewing annotations, analysing audio in time and frequency dimensions, computing alpha acoustic indices, and providing reference sound libraries for different taxa. We present ecoSound-web’s structure and features, and describe its operation for typical use cases such as sampling bird and bat communities, using a primate call library, and the analysis of soundscape components and acoustic indices. ecoSound-web is available from: https://github.com/ecomontec/ecoSound-web

                Background Nanoparticles (NPs) hold promise as alternatives to antibiotics in the fight against multi-drug-resistant bacteria. However, concerns about their cytotoxicity, particularly their effects on mammalian cells, must be thoroughly addressed to ensure therapeutic safety. Amphiphilic Janus NPs, which have segregated hydrophobic and polycationic ligands on two hemispheres, have previously been shown to exhibit potent antibacterial activity. Methods In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of amphiphilic Janus NPs in immune and cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity assays were performed to assess the effects of Janus NPs on cell viability and membrane integrity, with a particular focus on how internalization of the nanoparticles influenced cellular responses. Results The results revealed that both immune and cancer cells exhibited negligible cytotoxic effects when exposed to Janus NPs. However, phagocytic immune cells demonstrated greater susceptibility to membrane damage and viability loss, suggesting that internalization plays a significant role in nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusions Amphiphilic Janus NPs show great potential as highly effective antibacterial agents with minimal cytotoxicity. While immune cells may be more vulnerable to nanoparticle-induced damage due to their internalization capacity, these findings support the further investigation of Janus NPs for clinical applications.

     alt="Enhancement of Glutamate Uptake as Novel Antiseizure Approach: Preclinical Proof of Concept"/>
<p>Allosteric activation of glutamate uptake as novel antiseizure approach.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b>, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on GLT-1 expression in mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, our results show that <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90695">Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia integrate into mouse retina and recapitulate features of endogenous microglia</a></h4>

              
                Microglia exhibit both maladaptive and adaptive roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and have emerged as a cellular target for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including those affecting the retina. Replacing maladaptive microglia, such as those impacted by aging or over-activation, with exogenous microglia that can enable adaptive functions has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate microglia replacement as an approach for retinal diseases, we first employed a protocol to efficiently generate human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia in quantities sufficient for in vivo transplantation. These cells demonstrated expression of microglia-enriched genes and showed typical microglial functions such as LPS-induced responses and phagocytosis. We then performed xenotransplantation of these hiPSC-derived microglia into the subretinal space of adult mice whose endogenous retinal microglia have been pharmacologically depleted. Long-term analysis post-transplantation demonstrated that transplanted hiPSC-derived microglia successfully integrated into the neuroretina as ramified cells, occupying positions previously filled by the endogenous microglia and expressed microglia homeostatic markers such as P2ry12 and Tmem119. Furthermore, these cells were found juxtaposed alongside residual endogenous murine microglia for up to 8 months in the retina, indicating their ability to establish a stable homeostatic state in vivo. Following retinal pigment epithelial cell injury, transplanted microglia demonstrated responses typical of endogenous microglia, including migration, proliferation, and phagocytosis. Our findings indicate the feasibility of microglial transplantation and integration in the retina and suggest that modulating microglia through replacement may be a therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative retinal diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89815">Archaic introgression contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and cardiovascular traits in human high-altitude populations from the Himalayas</a></h4>

              
                It is well established that several <i>Homo sapiens</i> populations experienced admixture with extinct human species during their evolutionary history. Sometimes, such a gene flow could have played a role in modulating their capability to cope with a variety of selective pressures, thus resulting in archaic adaptive introgression events. A paradigmatic example of this evolutionary mechanism is offered by the <i>EPAS1</i> gene, whose most frequent haplotype in Himalayan highlanders was proved to reduce their susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness and to be introduced in the gene pool of their ancestors by admixture with Denisovans. In this study, we aimed at further expanding the investigation of the impact of archaic introgression on more complex adaptive responses to hypobaric hypoxia evolved by populations of Tibetan/Sherpa ancestry, which have been plausibly mediated by soft selective sweeps and/or polygenic adaptations rather than by hard selective sweeps. For this purpose, we used a combination of composite-likelihood and gene network-based methods to detect adaptive loci in introgressed chromosomal segments from Tibetan WGS data and to shortlist those presenting Denisovan-like derived alleles that participate to the same functional pathways and are absent in populations of African ancestry, which are supposed to do not have experienced Denisovan admixture. According to this approach, we identified multiple genes putatively involved in archaic introgression events and that, especially as regards <i>TBC1D1</i>, <i>RASGRF2</i>, <i>PRKAG2</i>, and <i>KRAS</i>, have plausibly contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and of certain cardiovascular traits in high-altitude Himalayan peoples. These findings provided unprecedented evidence about the complexity of the adaptive phenotype evolved by these human groups to cope with challenges imposed by hypobaric hypoxia, offering new insights into the tangled interplay of genetic determinants that mediates the physiological adjustments crucial for human adaptation to the high-altitude environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99000">Heparan sulphate binding controls in vivo half-life of the HpARI protein family</a></h4>

              
                The parasitic nematode <i>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</i> secretes the HpARI family, which bind to IL-33, either suppressing (HpARI1 and HpARI2) or enhancing (HpARI3) responses to the cytokine. We previously showed that HpARI2 also bound to DNA via its first complement control protein (CCP1) domain. Here, we find that HpARI1 can also bind DNA, while HpARI3 cannot. Through the production of HpARI2/HpARI3 CCP1 domain-swapped chimeras, DNA-binding ability can be transferred, and correlates with in vivo half-life of administered proteins. We found that HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) also binds to the extracellular matrix component heparan sulphate (HS), and structural modelling showed a basic charged patch in the CCP1 domain of HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) which could facilitate these interactions. Finally, a mutant of HpARI2 was produced which lacked DNA and HS binding, and was also shown to have a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, we propose that during infection the suppressive HpARI1 and HpARI2 proteins have long-lasting effects at the site of deposition due to DNA and/or extracellular matrix interactions, while HpARI3 has a shorter half-life due to a lack of these interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87668">Foxtrot migration and dynamic over-wintering range of an Arctic raptor</a></h4>

              
                Advances in tracking technologies have revealed the diverse migration patterns of birds, which are critical for range mapping and population estimation. Population trends are usually estimated in breeding ranges where birds remain stationary, but for species that breed in remote areas like the Arctic, these trends are often assessed in over-wintering ranges. Assessing population trends during the wintering season is challenging due to the extensive movements of birds in these ranges, which requires a deep understanding of the movement dynamics. However, these movements remain understudied, particularly in the mid-latitudes, where many Arctic breeders overwinter, increasing uncertainty in their ranges and numbers. Here, we show that the Arctic breeding raptor Rough-legged buzzard, which overwinters in the mid-latitudes, has a specific wintering strategy. After migrating ca. 1500 km from the Arctic to mid-latitudes, the birds continue to move throughout the entire over-wintering period, traveling another 1000 km southwest and then back northeast as the snowline advances. This continuous movement makes their wintering range dynamic throughout the season. In essence, this movement represents an extension of the quick migration process, albeit at a slower pace, and we have termed this migration pattern ‘foxtrot migration’, drawing an analogy to the alternating fast and slow movements of the foxtrot dance. These results highlight the potential errors in range mapping from single mid-winter surveys and emphasize the importance of this migration pattern in assessing the conservation status of bird species. Understanding this migration pattern could help to correctly estimate bird populations in over-wintering ranges, which is especially important for species that nest in hard-to-reach regions such as the Arctic.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97298">Neuropeptide Bursicon and its receptor-mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form of Cacopsylla chinensis</a></h4>

              
                Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. <i>Cacopsylla chinensis</i> exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor <i>CcTRPM</i> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <i>C. chinensis</i> by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <i>C. chinensis</i>. Firstly, we identified <i>CcBurs-α</i> and <i>CcBurs-β</i> as two typical subunits of Bursicon in <i>C. chinensis</i>, which were regulated by low temperature (10 °C) and <i>CcTRPM</i>. Subsequently, <i>CcBurs-α</i> and <i>CcBurs-β</i> formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>CcBurs-R</i> acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets <i>CcBurs-R</i>, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <i>C. chinensis</i>. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101221">FABP4-mediated lipid accumulation and lipolysis in tumor-associated macrophages promote breast cancer metastasis</a></h4>

              
                A high density of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with poorer prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients. Recent studies have shown that lipid accumulation in TAMs can promote tumor growth and metastasis in various models. However, the specific molecular mechanisms that drive lipid accumulation and tumor progression in TAMs remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), unlike saturated ones, are more likely to form lipid droplets in murine macrophages. Specifically, unsaturated FAs, including linoleic acids (LA), activate the FABP4/CEBPα pathway, leading to triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet formation. Furthermore, FABP4 enhances lipolysis and FA utilization by breast cancer cell lines, which promotes cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Notably, a deficiency of FABP4 in murine macrophages significantly reduces LA-induced lipid metabolism. Therefore, our findings suggest FABP4 as a crucial lipid messenger that facilitates unsaturated FA-mediated lipid accumulation and lipolysis in TAMs, thus contributing to the metastasis of breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101652">Bilateral regulation of EGFR activity and local PI(4,5)P2 dynamics in mammalian cells observed with superresolution microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood, as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we visualized both EGFR and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The EGFR and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Artificial reduction in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97033">Visualization of endogenous G proteins on endosomes and other organelles</a></h4>

              
                Classical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling takes place in response to extracellular stimuli and involves receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins located at the plasma membrane. It has recently been established that GPCR signaling can also take place from intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes that contain internalized receptors and ligands. While the mechanisms of GPCR endocytosis are well understood, it is not clear how well internalized receptors are supplied with G proteins. To address this gap, we use gene editing, confocal microscopy, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to study the distribution and trafficking of endogenous G proteins. We show here that constitutive endocytosis is sufficient to supply newly internalized endocytic vesicles with 20–30% of the G protein density found at the plasma membrane. We find that G proteins are present on early, late, and recycling endosomes, are abundant on lysosomes, but are virtually undetectable on the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the medial-trans Golgi apparatus. Receptor activation does not change heterotrimer abundance on endosomes. Our findings provide a subcellular map of endogenous G protein distribution, suggest that G proteins may be partially excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles, and are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes and other intracellular compartments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98366">Unveiling the influence of tumor and immune signatures on immune checkpoint therapy in advanced lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the variability among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in their responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Recognizing that patients with advanced-stage NSCLC rarely qualify for surgical interventions, it becomes crucial to identify biomarkers that influence responses to ICI therapy. We conducted an analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from 33 lung cancer biopsy samples, with a particular focus on 14 core samples taken before the initiation of palliative ICI treatment. Our objective was to link tumor and immune cell profiles with patient responses to ICI. We discovered that ICI non-responders exhibited a higher presence of CD4+ regulatory T cells, resident memory T cells, and TH17 cells. This contrasts with the diverse activated CD8+ T cells found in responders. Furthermore, tumor cells in non-responders frequently showed heightened transcriptional activity in the NF-kB and STAT3 pathways, suggesting a potential inherent resistance to ICI therapy. Through the integration of immune cell profiles and tumor molecular signatures, we achieved an discriminative power (area under the curve [AUC]) exceeding 95% in identifying patient responses to ICI treatment. These results underscore the crucial importance of the interplay between tumor and immune microenvironment, including within metastatic sites, in affecting the effectiveness of ICIs in NSCLC.

	<p>The vestibular function is in synergism with the oculomotor vergence. Vertigo may be related to vergence disorders and conversely, vestibular pathologies may affect vergence. To consolidate this hypothesis, we conducted a study at the vestibular orthoptic clinic of the Bastogne Hospital. Fourteen patients with vertigo history appearing 2 weeks to 8 years ago, aged 30 to 65 years were studied; at the moment of the eye movement study, no patient had acute attack of vertigo. The origin of vertigo varied (Meniere&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, organic pathology, sensitivity to visual movement). An assessment with objective measurement of vergence (single-step protocol) was carried out with the REMOBI technology coupled with binocular video-oculography in sitting and standing positions. Four neuro-rehabilitation sessions of vergence eye movements were performed with the double-step in-depth protocol, alternating sitting and standing positions to involve different postural and vestibular functions. An assessment of vergence was done again 1 to 2 months later. The initial assessment revealed problems of magnitude and/or speed or variability of vergence for 11 of the patients relative to controls (published by the group in previous studies). After neuro-rehabilitation, an improvement was observed in eight patients. Patients reported a clear improvement of their self confidence in moving in the space. Posture measures done before rehabilitation comparing eyes fixating or closed or while making near&amp;amp;ndash;far vergence eye movements indicated lower medio-lateral acceleration when doing vergence eye movements in patients with vertigo history of functional origin. The results are in favor of the hypothesis of a symbiosis between vergence and vestibular function and the interest of diagnosis and rehabilitation of the vergence disorder in patients with vertigo history in the absence of acute vertigo attack.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Musical pleasure is considered to be induced by prediction errors (surprise), as suggested in neuroimaging studies. However, the role of temporal changes in musical features in reward processing remains unclear. Utilizing the Information Dynamics of Music (IDyOM) model, a statistical model that calculates musical surprise based on prediction errors in melody and harmony, we investigated whether brain activities associated with musical pleasure, particularly in the &amp;amp;theta;, &amp;amp;beta;, and &amp;amp;gamma; bands, are induced by prediction errors, similar to those observed during monetary rewards. Methods: We used the IDyOM model to calculate the information content (IC) of surprise for melody and harmony in 70 musical pieces across six genres; eight pieces with varying IC values were selected. Electroencephalographic data were recorded during listening to the pieces, continuously evaluating the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; subjective pleasure on a 1&amp;amp;ndash;4 scale. Time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency analysis of electroencephalographic data was conducted, followed by general linear model analysis to fit the power-value time course in each frequency band to the time courses of subjective pleasure and IC for melody and harmony. Results: Significant positive fits were observed in the &amp;amp;beta; and &amp;amp;gamma; bands in the frontal region with both subjective pleasure and IC for melody and harmony. No significant fit was observed in the &amp;amp;theta; band. Both subjective pleasure and IC are associated with increased &amp;amp;beta; and &amp;amp;gamma; band power in the frontal regions. Conclusions: &amp;amp;beta; and &amp;amp;gamma; oscillatory activities in the frontal regions are strongly associated with musical rewards induced by prediction errors, similar to brain activity observed during monetary rewards.</p>

	<p>Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as a self-reported perception of cognitive decline that occurs without clear objective signs of cognitive impairment. There is still uncertainty in the literature about the reliability of SCD as an accurate indicator of the early stages of major neurocognitive disorders. Furthermore, objectifying cognitive impairment in SCD is difficult, mainly due to the insensitivity of the assessment instruments. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential contribution of the face-name associative recognition test (FNART) to the objective identification of memory impairment in SCD. Method: A research sample of 69 adults with SCD and 69 healthy controls (HCs) recruited in the community were administered in the FNART, which included 32 photographs of neutral faces associated with 32 first names. Results: The total score of the HC group in the FNART was significantly better than that of the SCD group. Moreover, analyses based on the serial position of the stimuli showed that the SCD group performed significantly worse than the HC group only for the middle items (stimuli placed at the beginning or end of learning lists are more likely to be recalled than those presented in the middle), while no primacy and recency effects were found in the HCs. Conclusions: These findings indicate that associative episodic memory is more vulnerable in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) compared to those without cognitive complaints. Additionally, they suggest that the FNART may be effective in identifying cognitive decline in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In this narrative review, we have surveyed results obtained from a research program dealing with the role of semantic memory disorders as a predictor of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Objectives: In this research program, we have taken into account many different putative markers, provided of a different complexity in the study of the semantic network. These markers ranged from the number of words produced on a semantic fluency task to the following: (a) the discrepancy between scores obtained on semantic vs. phonemic word fluency tests; (b) the presence, at the single-word level, of features (such as a loss of low typical words on a category verbal fluency task) typical of a degraded semantic system; or (c) the presence of more complex phenomena (such as the semantic distance between consecutively produced word pairs) concerning the organization of the semantic network. In the present review, all these studies have been presented, providing separate subsections for (a) methods, (b) results, and (c) a short discussion. Some tentative general conclusions have been drawn at the end of the review. We found that at baseline all these markers are impaired in MCI patients who will later convert to AD, but also that they do not necessarily show a linear worsening during the progression to AD and allow one to make different predictions about the time of development of AD. Our conclusions were that, rather than searching for the best marker of conversion, we should use a range of different markers allowing us to obtain the information most appropriate to the goal of our investigation.</p>

	<p>Background: Helminth infections are associated with cognitive deficits, especially in school-age children. Deworming treatment in heavily infected children improves their short- and long-term memory recall. In mice, intraperitoneal helminth infection with Taenia crassiceps (T. crassiceps) shows sexual dimorphism in terms of the parasite load, immune response, hormone levels, and behavioral changes. We have previously shown poorer short-term memory performance and changes in the concentrations of cytokines and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, which were replicated in this study. The molecular changes in other brain structures, such as those related to reproduction, are unknown. Methods: Male and female Balb/cAnN mice were chronically infected with T. crassiceps larvae. We determined the peritoneal parasite load and established the presence of cytokines and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus. Results: The parasite load was higher in female than male infected mice, as expected. In the hippocampus, the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin increased in males but decreased in females. In contrast, in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus, the neurotransmitters assessed showed no statistical differences. The cytokine profiles were different in each brain structure. The TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; levels in the olfactory bulb and the IL-4 levels in the hippocampus of infected mice were dimorphic; IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; was augmented in both male and female infected animals, although the increase was higher in infected males. Conclusions: The brain responds to peripheral infection with cytokine levels that vary from structure to structure. This could be a partial explanation for the dimorphic behavioral alterations associated with infection, it also demonstrates the synergic interaction between the immune, the endocrine, and the nervous systems.</p>
