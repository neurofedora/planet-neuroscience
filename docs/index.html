">Sub-type specific connectivity between CA3 pyramidal neurons may underlie their sequential activation during sharp waves</a></h4>

              
                The CA3 region of the hippocampus is the major site of sharp wave initiation, a form a network activity involved in learning and memory. Highly recurrent connectivity within its excitatory network is thought to underlie processes involved in memory formation. Recent work has indicated that distinct subpopulations of pyramidal neurons within this region may contribute differently to network activity, including sharp waves, in CA3. Exactly how these contributions may arise is not yet known. Here, we disentangle the local connectivity between two distinct CA3 cell types: thorny and athorny pyramidal cells. We find an asymmetry in the connectivity between these two populations, with athorny cells receiving strong input from both athorny and thorny cells. Conversely, the thorny cell population receives very little input from the athorny population. Computational modelling suggests that this connectivity scheme may determine the sequential activation of these cell types during large network events such as sharp waves.

">Importin α4 deficiency induces psychiatric disorder-related behavioral deficits and neuroinflammation in mice.</a></h4>

              
                Importin 4, which is encoded by the Kpna4 gene, is a well characterized nuclear-cytoplasmic transport factor known to mediate transport of transcription factors including NF-{kappa}B. Here, we report that Kpna4 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit psychiatric disorder-related behavioral abnormalities such as anxiety-related behaviors, deceased social interaction and sensorimotor gating deficits. Contrary to a previous study predicting attenuated NF-{kappa}B activity as a result of Kpna4 deficiency, we observed a significant increase in expression levels of NF-{kappa}B genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, Il1{beta} or Il-6 in the Prefrontal Cortex or Basolateral Amygdala of the KO mice. Moreover, examination of inflammatory responses in primary cells revealed that Kpna4 deficient cells have an increased inflammatory response, which was rescued by addition of not only full-length, but also a nuclear transport deficient truncation mutant of importin 4, suggesting contribution of its non-transport functions. Furthermore, RNAseq of sorted adult Microglia and Astrocytes and subsequent transcription factor analysis suggested increases in Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) activity in Kpna4 KO cells. Taken together, importin 4 deficiency induces psychiatric disorder-related behavioral deficits in mice, along with an increased inflammatory response and possible alteration of PRC2 activity in glial cells.

">Dependence of Contextual Modulation in Macaque V1 on Interlaminar Signal Flow</a></h4>

              
                In visual cortex, neural correlates of subjective perception can be generated by modulation of activity from beyond the classical receptive field (CRF). In macaque V1, activity generated by nonclassical receptive field (nCRF) stimulation involves different intracortical circuitry than activity generated by CRF stimulation, suggesting that interactions between neurons across V1 layers differ under CRF and nCRF stimulus conditions. We measured border ownership modulation within large populations of V1 neurons. We found that neurons in single columns preferred the same side of objects located outside of the CRF. In addition, we found that interactions between pairs of neurons situated across feedback/horizontal and input layers differed between CRF and nCRF stimulation. Furthermore, the magnitude of border ownership modulation was predicted by greater information flow from feedback/horizontal to input layers. These results demonstrate that the flow of signals between layers covaries with the degree to which neurons integrate information from beyond the CRF.

">A Libra in the Brain: Neural Correlates of Error Awareness Predict Moral Wrongness and Guilt Proneness</a></h4>

              
                Error awareness is a fundamental mechanism in humans. Through traditional psychological tasks, certain neural activities that represent errors in objective manners have been identified. However, there is limited knowledge on how humans subjectively determine right from wrong in moral contexts. In this study, participants (N=39) mentally simulated themselves as the agents of moral and immoral behaviors, while viewing a series of actions with EEG recording and MRI scanning, respectively. A significant difference in error-related negativity (ERN) was observed among morally wrong scenarios, accompanied by higher wrongfulness ratings. Additionally, individual differences in guilt-proneness could predict the subjects' ERN amplitude. The ERN amplitude was correlated with the BOLD activity in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex and anterior insula to immoral scenarios, reflecting error awareness toward moral wrongfulness. The late potential component displayed greater negativity to immoral scenarios and was correlated with BOLD activities in the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction, indicating cognitive and affective evaluation in moral judgment. In line with the moral dynamic framework, our results demonstrated individual variability in moral judgments, as indicated by dispersed and overlapping cognitive neural networks. This suggests that subjective evaluations of wrongfulness are underpinned by neural mechanisms, associated with those involved in objective error awareness.

">DOES EXPERIENCE MODULATE AUTOMATIC IMITATION? A NEW LOOK</a></h4>

              
                Automatic imitation is a stimulus-response compatibility effect wherein observing an action automatically influences motor performance. However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains controversial. Associative Sequence Learning suggests that automatic imitation arises from contingent visual and motor activity associations. Prior studies have shown that exposure to counter-imitative training can alter these visuomotor associations, suggesting that automatic imitation can be modulated by experience. Here, we aim to bring new insight into how this modulation occurs by exploring the time course of automatic imitation before and after counter-imitative training. If automatic imitation is merely a result of contingent associations, as previously suggested, the effect should consistently be modulated following such training. However, if this is not the case, automatic imitation is not, or not only, a matter of contingent association, at least not as currently understood.

">Expected reward value and reward prediction errors reinforce but also interfere with human time perception.</a></h4>

              
                Time perception is often investigated in animal models and in humans using instrumental paradigms where reinforcement learning (RL) and associated dopaminergic processes have modulatory effects. For example, interval timing, which includes the judgment of relatively short intervals of time (ranging from milliseconds to minutes), has been shown to be modulated by manipulations of striatal dopamine. The expected value of reward (EV) and reward prediction errors (RPEs) are key variables described in RL-theory that explain dopaminergic signals during reward processing during instrumental learning. Notably, the underlying connection between RL-processes and time perception in humans is relatively underexplored. Herein, we investigated the impact of EV and RPEs on interval timing in humans. We tested the hypotheses that EV and RPEs modulate the experience of short time intervals. We demonstrate that expectations of monetary gains or losses increases the initial performance error for 1000ms intervals. Temporal learning over repeated trials is observed with accelerated learning of non-reinforced 1000ms intervals; however, RPEs, specifically about rewards and not punishments, appear to reinforce performance errors, which effectively interferes with the rate at which (reinforced) 1000ms intervals were learned. These effects were not significant for 3000ms and 5000ms intervals. Our results demonstrate that EV and RPEs influence human behavior about 1000ms time intervals. We discuss our results considering model-free temporal difference RL-theory, which suggests the hypothesis that interval timing may be mediated by dopaminergic signals that reinforce the learning and prediction of dynamic state- transitions which could be encoded without an explicit reference to "time" intervals.

">What and where in electromagnetic brain imaging</a></h4>

              
                To understand the brain, we need to observe both the nature and dynamics of its activity (the "what"), and the location or distribution of its sources (the "where"). This paper proposes a new approach based on standard data-driven linear analysis, in which these two elements are derived in parallel from separate columns of the analysis matrix. A subset of columns enhances the activity of interest, and its complement defines spatial filters that suppress that activity (null filters). Each null filter is combined with an anatomy-dependent source model to estimate a subset of the sources space (zero set) in which the source might reside, and the final estimate is derived from the intersection of zero sets. There is no theoretical limit to the accuracy with which the location of a source can be estimated, but practical limits may arise from noise in the data, imperfect calibration, or an incomplete or inaccurate source model.

">Elevated DNA Damage without signs of aging in the short-sleeping Mexican Cavefish</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation of sleep has widespread health consequences and represents an enormous health burden. Short-sleeping individuals are predisposed to the effects of neurodegeneration, suggesting a critical role for sleep in the maintenance of neuronal health. While the effects of sleep on cellular function are not completely understood, growing evidence has identified an association between sleep loss and DNA damage, raising the possibility that sleep facilitates efficient DNA repair. The Mexican tetra fish, Astyanax mexicanus provides a model to investigate the evolutionary basis for changes in sleep and the consequences of sleep loss. Multiple cave-adapted populations of these fish have evolved to sleep for substantially less time compared to surface populations of the same species without identifiable impacts on healthspan or longevity. To investigate whether the evolved sleep loss is associated with DNA damage and cellular stress, we compared the DNA Damage Response (DDR) and oxidative stress levels between A. mexicanus populations. We measured markers of chronic sleep loss and discovered elevated levels of the DNA damage marker gammaH2AX in the brain, and increased oxidative stress in the gut of cavefish, consistent with chronic sleep deprivation. Notably, we found that acute UV-induced DNA damage elicited an increase in sleep in surface fish but not in cavefish. On a transcriptional level, only the surface fish activated the photoreactivation repair pathway following UV damage. These findings suggest a reduction of the DDR in cavefish compared to surface fish that coincides with elevated DNA damage in cavefish. To examine DDR pathways at a cellular level, we created an embryonic fibroblast cell line from the two populations of A. mexicanus. We observed that both the DDR and DNA repair were diminished in the cavefish cells, corroborating the in vivo findings and suggesting that the acute response to DNA damage is lost in cavefish. To investigate the long-term impact of these changes, we compared the transcriptome in the brain and gut of aged surface fish and cavefish. Strikingly, many genes that are differentially expressed between young and old surface fish do not transcriptionally vary by age in cavefish. Taken together, these findings suggest that have developed resilience to sleep loss, despite possessing cellular hallmarks of chronic sleep deprivation.

">Neural and computational mechanisms of effort under the pressure of a deadline</a></h4>

              
                Deadlines fundamentally shape the motivation for effort. Research examining effort-based choices finds high effort is an avoided cost. However, this work overlooks the fact that effort can be valuable when it makes progress on long-term goals before deadlines. We test a new framework where motivation depends on deadline pressure (work remaining / time remaining). Across three studies we use computational modelling on novel tasks examining effort-based decisions when effort makes progress on goals with deadlines. In support of hypotheses, deadline pressure significantly impacts decision-making, shifting people from avoiding effort, to seeking and valuing it. Using ultra-high-field fMRI, we show that functionally connected putamen and midcingulate cortex (MCC) sub-regions process and update estimates of deadline pressure, with distinct anterior cingulate and putamen sub-regions processing the costs or added value of effort. We show the neurocomputational mechanisms for how deadline pressure shapes motivation, and that keep us "on track" for our goals.

">Pinging the Hidden Attentional Priority Map: Suppression Needs Attention</a></h4>

              
                Attentional capture by an irrelevant salient distractor is attenuated when the distractor is presented more frequently in one location compared to other locations, suggesting that people learn to suppress an irrelevant salient location. However, to date it is unclear whether this suppression is proactive, applied before attention has been directed to the distractor location, or reactive, occurring after attention has been directed to that specific location. The aim of the present study is to investigate how suppression is accomplished by using the pinging technique which allows one to probe how attention is distributed across the visual field prior to the presentation of the search display. In an EEG experiment, participants performed a visual search task wherein they were tasked with identifying a shape singleton in the presence of an irrelevant color singleton. Compared to all other locations, this color singleton appeared more frequently at a specific location, which was termed the high-probability location. Prior to the search task, we introduced a continuous recall spatial memory task to reveal the hidden attentional priority map. Participants had to memorize the location of a memory cue continuously and report this location after the visual search task. Critically, after the presentation of the memory cue but before the onset of the search display, a neutral placeholder display was presented to probe how hidden priority map is reconfigured by the learned distractor suppression. Behaviorally, there was clear evidence that the high-probability location was suppressed, as search was more efficient when the distractor appeared at this location. To examine the priority map prior to search, we adopted an inverted encoding approach to reconstruct the tuning profile of the memorized position in the spatial memory task. Inverted modeling resulted in reliable tuning profiles during memory maintenance that gradually decayed and that were revived again by the onset of a neutral placeholder display preceding search. After the onset of the placeholders, the tuning profile observed was characterized by a spatial gradient centered over the high-probability location, with tuning being most pronounced at the-to-be suppressed location. This finding suggests that while learned suppression is initiated prior to search display onset, it is preceded by an initial phase of spatial selection, which is in line with a reactive suppression account. Together these results further our understanding of the mechanism of spatial distractor suppression.

">BNST GluN2D-containing NMDARs contribute to ethanol intake but not negative affective behaviors in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease, highly comorbid with anxiety and depression. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and Crh+ neurons in this region are thought to play a key role in chronic ethanol-induced increases in volitional ethanol intake. This role has been hypothesized to be driven by emergent BNST-dependent negative affective behaviors. Indeed, we report here that in female mice undergoing a home cage chronic drinking forced abstinence model (CDFA), excitatory transmission undergoes time-dependent upregulation in BNST Crh+ cells. Excitatory NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are a major target of ethanol, and chronic ethanol exposure has been shown to regulate NMDAR function and expression. GluN2D subunit-containing NMDARs have emerged as a target of interest due to their limited distribution and potential roles in affective behavior. We find that knockdown of dorsal BNST (dBNST) GluN2D expression significantly decreases ethanol intake in female, but not male, mice. While BNST Grin2b expression was significantly increased in protracted abstinence following CDFA, no differences in Grin2d expression were observed in dBNST or specifically in dBNST Crh+ neurons. Finally, to determine the impact of GluN2D expression on negative affective behaviors, open field, elevated zero maze, and forced swim tasks were used to measure anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in constitutive and conditional BNST GluN2D knockout mice. Surprisingly, we find that deletion of GluN2D fails to alter negative affect in ethanol-naive female mice. Together, these data suggest a role for BNST GluN2D-containing NMDARs in ethanol drinking behaviors but not abstinence from ethanol, highlighting potential sex differences and behavioral specificity in the context of AUD behaviors. Overall, these data further suggest roles for BNST synaptic signaling in volitional ethanol intake that are partially independent of actions on affective behavior.

	<p>The finger tapping test (FTT) is a tool to evaluate the motor performance of the hand and fingers and eye-hand coordination with applicability in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the TappingPro&amp;amp;reg; mobile app and the construct validity between this app and validated clinical scales for motor performance in healthy subjects and pwMS. 42 healthy subjects (mean age 25.05) and 13 pwMS (mean age 51.69, EDSS between 3 and 7.5E) participated. FTT was performed with the TappingPro&amp;amp;reg; mobile app. All participants were examined twice, with a one-week interval between the two appointments. For the analysis of construct validity, the Jamar&amp;amp;reg; hydraulic hand dynamometer, Box and Blocks Test (BBT), and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) were used. The intra-rater reliability showed a good correlation (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, ICC &amp;amp;gt; 0.787) for both upper limbs and both times of FTT for healthy subjects, and an excellent correlation (ICC &amp;amp;gt; 0.956) for upper limbs and both times of FTT for pwMS. The ICC for the inter-rater reliability was good (ICC = 0.869) for the non-dominant upper limb in the FTT 10 s of the healthy subjects, and excellent (ICC &amp;amp;gt; 0.904) for all the other measurements of the healthy subjects and pwMS. However, the Bland&amp;amp;ndash;Altman plots showed disagreement between observers and measurements that should be considered in the interpretation of clinical evaluations. The correlation analysis for healthy subjects showed poor associations between all variables, except for the association between hand grip strength and the FTT 60 s in the non-dominant upper limb, which had a moderate coefficient. For pwMS, there were moderate to excellent associations between BBT and the NHPT and FTT for both upper limbs. The correlations between hand grip strength and FFT were poor. This mobile app could be a useful and low-cost assessment tool in pwMS, allowing a simple evaluation and follow-up that has excellent correlation with clinical scales validated in this pathology.</p>

	<p>Background: Standard methods for deriving Centiloid scales from amyloid PET images are time-consuming and require considerable expert knowledge. We aimed to develop a deep learning method of automating Centiloid scale calculations from amyloid PET images with 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) tracer and assess its applicability to 18F-labeled tracers without retraining. Methods: We trained models on 231 11C-PiB amyloid PET images using a 50-layer 3D ResNet architecture. The models predicted the Centiloid scale, and accuracy was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), linear regression analysis, and Bland&amp;amp;ndash;Altman plots. Results: The MAEs for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and young controls (YC) were 8.54 and 2.61, respectively, using 11C-PiB, and 8.66 and 3.56, respectively, using 18F-NAV4694. The MAEs for AD and YC were higher with 18F-florbetaben (39.8 and 7.13, respectively) and 18F-florbetapir (40.5 and 12.4, respectively), and the error rate was moderate for 18F-flutemetamol (21.3 and 4.03, respectively). Linear regression yielded a slope of 1.00, intercept of 1.26, and R2 of 0.956, with a mean bias of &amp;amp;minus;1.31 in the Centiloid scale prediction. Conclusions: We propose a deep learning means of directly predicting the Centiloid scale from amyloid PET images in a native space. Transferring the model trained on 11C-PiB directly to 18F-NAV4694 without retraining was feasible.</p>

">Connectomes, simultaneous EEG-fMRI resting-state data and brain simulation results from 50 healthy subjects</a></h4>

              
                We present raw and processed multimodal empirical data as well as simulation results from a study with The Virtual Brain (TVB). Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting-state data, diffusion-weighted MRI, and structural MRI were acquired for 50 healthy adult subjects (18 - 80 years of age) at the Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany. We constructed personalized models from this multimodal data with TVB by optimizing parameters on an individual basis that predict multiple empirical features in fMRI and EEG, e.g. dynamic functional connectivity and bimodality in the alpha band power. We annotated this large comprehensive empirical and simulated data set according to the openMINDS meta data schema and structured it following Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standards for EEG and MRI as well as the BIDS Extension Proposal for computational modeling data. This dataset provides ready-to-use data for future research at various levels of processing including the thereof inferred brain simulation results for a large data set of healthy subjects with a wide age range.

">Activity based proteome profiling of serum serinehydrolases: application in pediatric abusive head trauma</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Traumatic brain injury (TBI), including pediatric abusive head trauma (AHT), is the leading cause of death and disability in children and young adults worldwide. The current understanding of trauma-induced molecular changes in the brain of human subjects with intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) remains inadequate and requires further investigation to improve the outcome and management of TBI in the clinic. Calcium-mediated damage at the site of brain injury has been shown to activate several catalytic enzymes. Experimental design: Serine hydrolases (SHs) are major catalytic enzymes involved in the biochemical pathways of blood coagulation, systemic inflammation and neuronal signaling. Here we investigated activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) by measuring the activity status of SH enzymes in the serum of infants with severe ICH as a consequence of AHT or atraumatic infants who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Results: Our proof-of-principle study revealed significantly reduced physiological activity of dozens of metabolic SHs in the serum of infants with severe AHT compared to the SIDS group, with some of the enzymes being related to neurodevelopment and basic brain metabolism Conclusions and clinical relevance: To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the ABPP of the SHs enzyme family to detect changes in their physiological activity in blood serum in severe TBI. We used antemortem (AM) serum from infants under the age of 2 years who were victims of AHT with a severe form of ICH. The analytical approach used in the proof-of-principle study shows reduced activities of serum serine lipases in AHT cases and could be further investigated in mild forms of AHT, which currently show 30% of misdiagnosed cases in clinics.

">Multiscale modelling of neuronal dynamics in hippocampus CA1</a></h4>

              
                The development of biologically realistic models of brain microcircuits and regions is currently a very relevant topic in computational neuroscience. From basic research to clinical applications, there is an increasing demand for accurate models that incorporate local cellular and network specificities, able to capture a broad range of dynamics and functions associated with given brain regions. One of the main challenges of these models is the passage between different scales, going from the microscale (cellular) to the meso (microcircuit) and macroscale (region or whole-brain level), while keeping at the same time a constraint on the demand of computational resources. One novel approach to this problem is the use of mean-field models of neuronal activity to build large-scale simulations. This provides an effective solution to the passage between scales with relatively low computational demands, which is achieved by a drastic reduction in the dimensionality of the system. In this paper we introduce a multiscale modelling framework for the hippocampal CA1, a region of the brain that plays a key role in functions such as learning, memory consolidation and navigation. Our modelling framework goes from the single cell level to the macroscale and makes use of a novel mean-field model of CA1, introduced in this paper, to bridge the gap between the micro and macro scales. To develop the mean-field model we make use of a recently introduced formalism based on a bottom-up approach that is easily applicable to different neuronal models and cell types. We test and validate the model by analyzing the response of the system to the main brain rhythms observed in the hippocampus and comparing our results with the ones of the corresponding spiking network model of CA1. In addition, we show an example of the implementation of our model to study a stimulus propagation at the macro-scale, and we compare the results obtained from our model with the corresponding spiking network model of the whole CA1 area.

">Neurophysiological Patterns of Attention and Distraction during Realistic Virtual-Reality Classroom Learning in Adults with and without ADHD</a></h4>

              
                Many people, and particularly those diagnosed with ADHD, report difficulties maintaining attention and proneness to distraction during classroom learning. However, the behavioral, neural and physiological basis of attention in realistic learning contexts is not well understood, since current clinical and scientific tools used for evaluating and quantifying the constructs of "distractibility" and "inattention", are removed from the real-life experience in organic classrooms. Here we introduce a novel Virtual Reality (VR) platform for studying students' brain activity and physiological responses as they immerse in realistic frontal classroom learning. Using this approach, we studied whether adults with and without ADHD (N=49) exhibit differences in neurophysiological metrics associated with sustained attention, such as speech-tracking of the teacher's voice, power of alpha-oscillations and levels of arousal, as well as responses to potential disturbances by background sound-events in the classroom. Under these ecological conditions, we find that adults with ADHD exhibit higher auditory neural response to background sounds relative to their control-peers, which also contributed to explaining variance in the severity of ADHD symptoms, together with higher power of alpha-oscillations and more frequent gaze-shifts around the classroom. These results are in-line with higher sensitivity to irrelevant stimuli in the environment and increased mind-wandering/boredom. At the same time, both groups exhibited similar learning outcomes and showed similar neural tracking of the teacher's speech. This suggests that in this context, attention may not operate as a zero-sum game and that allocating some resources to irrelevant stimuli does not always detract from performing the task at hand. Given the dire need for more objective, dimensional and ecologically-valid measures of attention and its real-life deficits, this work provides new insights into the neurophysiological manifestations of attention and distraction experienced in real-life contexts, while challenging some prevalent notions regarding the nature of attentional challenges experienced by those with ADHD.

">Impact of Pathogenic Variants of the Ras-MAPK Pathway on Major White Matter Tracts in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Noonan syndrome (NS) and Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) are genetic conditions linked to pathogenic variants in genes of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway. Both conditions hyperactivate signaling of the Ras pathway and exhibit a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, animal models of NS and NF1 and human imaging studies show white-matter abnormalities in both conditions. While these findings suggest Ras pathway hyper-activation effects on white-matter, it is unknown whether these effects are syndrome-specific or pathway-specific. To characterize the effect of NS and NF1 on human white-matter microstructural integrity and discern potential syndrome-specific influences on microstructural integrity of individual tracts, we collected diffusion-weighted imaging data from children with NS (n=24), NF1 (n=28), and age and sex-matched controls (n=31). We contrasted the clinical groups (NS or NF1) and controls using voxel-wise, tract-based, and along-tract analyses. Outcomes included voxel-wise, tract-based and along-tract fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD). NS and NF1 showed similar patterns of reduced FA and increased AD, RD, and MD on white-matter relative to controls and different spatial patterns. NS presented a more extensive spatial effect than NF1 on white-matter integrity as measured by FA. Tract-based analysis also demonstrated differences in effect magnitude with overall lower FA in NS compared to NF1 (d=0.4). At the tract-level, NS specific-effects on FA were detected in association tracts (superior longitudinal, uncinate and arcuate fasciculi; p's<0.012) and NF1 specific-effects were detected in the corpus callosum (p's<0.037) compared to controls. Results from along-tract analyses aligned with results from tract-based analyses and indicated that effects are pervasive along the affected tracts. In conclusion, we find that pathogenic variants in the Ras-MAPK pathway are associated with white-matter abnormalities as measured by diffusion in the developing brain. Overall NS and NF1 show common effects on FA and diffusion scalars, as well as specific unique effects, namely on temporoparietal-frontal tracts (intra-hemispheric) in NS and on the corpus callosum (inter-hemispheric) in NF1. The observed specific effects not only confirm prior observations from independent cohorts of NS and NF1 but also inform on syndrome-specific susceptibility of individual tracts. Thus, these findings suggest potential targets for precise, brain-focused outcome measures for existing medications, such as MEK inhibitors, that act on the Ras pathway.

">Dynamic spatiotemporal activation of a pervasive neurogenic competence in striatal astrocytes supports continuous neurogenesis following injury</a></h4>

              
                Adult brain neural stem cells (NSCs) are conventionally regarded as rare cells restricted to two niches: the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone. Parenchymal astrocytes can also contribute to neurogenesis after injury, however the prevalence, distribution, and behaviour of these latent NSCs remained elusive. To tackle these issues, we reconstructed the spatiotemporal pattern of striatal astrocytes neurogenic activation after excitotoxic lesion in mice. Our results indicate that a neurogenic potential is broadly distributed throughout the striatum but is focally activated at the lesion border. In this region, similarly to canonical niches, steady state neurogenesis is ensured by the continuous stochastic activation of local astrocytes. Activated astrocytes quickly return to quiescence, while their progeny locally proliferate for about 10 days following a stochastic behaviour that features an acceleration in differentiation propensity. Notably, striatal astrocytes activation rate matches that of SVZ astrocytes indicating a comparable prevalence of NSC potential.

">A 3D atlas of sexually dimorphic lumbosacral motor neurons that control and integrate pelvic visceral and somatic functions in rats</a></h4>

              
                The lumbosacral spinal motor system comprises somatic motor neurons (SMNs) that target striated muscle and visceral motor neurons (VMNs; autonomic preganglionic neurons) that target peripheral ganglia. The brain coordinates these pathways to mediate functions such as continence, voiding and sexual function by ensuring appropriate changes of organ state with striated muscle activity (e.g., sphincter opening, relevant postural changes). These spinal circuits are important therapeutic targets for bioelectronic medicine yet are poorly defined in comparison with limb SMNs. We aimed to define the structural features and relationships between SMNs and VMNs relevant to pelvic function in male and female rats, by building 3D maps of lumbosacral spinal cord. We achieved this by applying large-volume immunostaining (choline acetyltransferase), with tissue clearing and advanced whole mount microscopy (light sheet and ribbon scanning confocal microscopy). We identified VMNs specific to pelvic organ function by microinjecting cholera toxin (beta-subunit) into the major pelvic ganglia (MPG). These VMNS are primarily located in segments L1-L2 (dorsal commissural nucleus) and L6-S1 (intermediolateral nucleus). Unexpectedly, small groups of SMNs in the urethral rhabdosphincter, cremaster and levator ani motor pools also projected through the MPG. Motor neuron counts and analysis of dendritic fields detected sexual dimorphism in both SMNs and VMNs. Their colocation of dendritic bundles suggested a mechanism of coordinating activity. This study has provided the first multiscale 3D atlas of rat lumbosacral cord. This will be shared as a resource on an open science platform (sparc.science) to allow further exploration and modeling of network features and cellular morphology.

">Bridging the Gap: Multi-Omics Profiling of Brain Tissue in Alzheimer's Disease and Older Controls in Multi-Ethnic Populations</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Multi-omics studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed many potential disease pathways and therapeutic targets. Despite their promise of precision medicine, these studies lacked African Americans (AA) and Latin Americans (LA), who are disproportionately affected by AD. METHODS: To bridge this gap, Accelerating Medicines Partnership in AD (AMP-AD) expanded brain multi-omics profiling to multi-ethnic donors. RESULTS: We generated multi-omics data and curated and harmonized phenotypic data from AA (n=306), LA (n=326), or AA and LA (n=4) brain donors plus Non-Hispanic White (n=252) and other (n=20) ethnic groups, to establish a foundational dataset enriched for AA and LA participants. This study describes the data available to the research community, including transcriptome from three brain regions, whole genome sequence, and proteome measures. DISCUSSION: Inclusion of traditionally underrepresented groups in multi-omics studies is essential to discover the full spectrum of precision medicine targets that will be pertinent to all populations affected with AD.

">Neurophysiological and Autonomic Dynamics of Threat Processing During Sustained Social Fear Generalization</a></h4>

              
                Survival in rapidly changing environments requires that organisms learn to predict noxious outcomes based on situational cues. One key facet of successful threat prediction is generalization from a specific predictive cue to similar cues, ensuring that a cue-outcome contingency is applied beyond the original learning environment. Generalization has also been observed in laboratory studies of human aversive conditioning: Most behavioral and physiological processes generalize responses from a stimulus paired with threat, (the CS+), to unpaired stimuli, with response magnitudes varying as a function of stimulus similarity. In contrast, work focusing on sensory responses in visual cortex has found a sharpening pattern, in which responses to stimuli closely resembling the CS+ are maximally suppressed, potentially reflecting lateral inhibitory interactions with the CS+ representation. Originally demonstrated with simple visual cues, changes in visuocortical tuning have also been observed in threat generalization learning across facial identity cues. It is however unclear to what extent these visuocortical changes represent transient or sustained effects and if generalization learning requires prior conditioning to the CS+. The present study addressed these questions using EEG and pupillometry in a paradigm involving several hundreds of trials of aversive generalization learning along a gradient of facial identities. Visuocortical ssVEP sharpening occurred after dozens of trials of generalization learning without prior differential conditioning, but diminished as learning progressed further. By contrast, generalization of EEG alpha power suppression, pupil dilation, and self-reported valence and arousal ratings was seen throughout the experimental session. Findings are consistent with models of threat processing emphasizing the role of changing visucocortical and attention dynamics in the formation, curation, and shaping of fear memories as observers continue learning about stimulus-outcome contingencies.

">Rostral Pedunculopontine Nucleus Infusion of M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator VU0467154 Augments L-DOPA Effects in Hemiparkinsonian Rats</a></h4>

              
                Standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) is dopamine replacement therapy with L-DOPA. However, chronic treatment often results in abnormal involuntary movements called L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Prior evidence indicates that heightened striatal cholinergic tone may contribute to LID. Restoring cholinergic inhibition by targeting the inhibitory M4 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (M4) reduces LID in preclinical models. Although intrinsic striatal sources of ACh have been considered for their role in LID, extrinsic sources of ACh such as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) have not been well investigated for their role in LID. Therefore, the current study employed hemiparkinsonian Long-Evans rats with a PPN-targeted cannula ipsilateral to 6-OHDA lesion. Following chronic treatment with L-DOPA, we examined the effect of local unilateral PPN infusion of M4 PAM VU0467154 on LID, motor performance, and c-fos expression within the PPN. It was expected that PPN infusion of VU0467154 would reduce LID, reduce L-DOPA's motor benefit, and globally reduce c-fos expression in the PPN. Contrary to our expectations, PPN infusion of M4 PAM did not significantly affect LID severity. Furthermore, the group receiving M4 PAM showed slightly elevated motor improvement compared to L-DOPA, and decreased c-fos expression specifically in PPN cholinergic neurons. These results suggest that local PPN ACh dynamics differ from those of the striatum. Specifically, our results suggest that PPN cholinergic neurons may be a promising therapeutic target for augmenting L-DOPA-mediated motor benefit without increasing LID.

">Regional Glymphatic Dysfunction is linked to Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) involves neuroinflammation and imbalance between production and clearance of proteins which affects the glymphatic system, the lymphatic-like, fluid-transport system in the brain. However, it is unclear whether SCA3 is related to impairments in glymphatic function. Using multimodal imaging data, 34 SCA3 patients and 36 age-, sex- and educational matched healthy controls (HCs) were compared using multiple glymphatic measurements, including choroid plexus (CP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular (DTI-ALPS) index, and coupling relationship between blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals and CSF flow (BOLD-CSF coupling). Then, we evaluated regional glymphatic function by dividing DTI-ALPS and BOLD-CSF coupling into anterior, middle, posterior, and cerebellum regions, thereby identifying the spatial variation of glymphatic function in the two groups. We demonstrated that compared with HCs, larger CP and CSF volumes were found in SCA3 patients. More importantly, for DTI-ALPS index and BOLD-CSF coupling, these surrogate markers for glymphatic clearance were weaker in SCA3 patients. Furthermore, altered regional glymphatic functions were most prominent in midbrain, cerebellum and middle regions. Crucially, the altered midbrain, cerebellum, middle and global glymphatic functions were accompanied by the severity of ataxia and other SCA3 symptoms. Similar to other neurodegenerative disorders, the association between multiple glymphatic indexes and SCA3 symptoms suggested that waste clearance is disrupted in SCA3 patients, which shed light on the pathogenesis of this disease from a glymphatic lens. Our findings highlighted the dysregulated glymphatic function as a novel diagnostic marker for SCA3.

">A new Opn4cre recombinase mouse line to target intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) play a crucial role in several physiological light responses. In this study we generate a new Opn4cre knock-in allele (Opn4cre(DSO)), in which cre is placed immediately downstream of the Opn4 start codon. This approach aims to faithfully reproduce endogenous Opn4 expression and improve compatibility with widely used reporters. We evaluated the efficacy and sensitivity of Opn4cre(DSO) for labeling in retina and brain, and provide an in-depth comparison with the extensively utilized Opn4cre(Saha) line. Through this characterization, Opn4cre(DSO) demonstrated higher specificity in labeling ipRGCs, with minimal recombination escape. Leveraging a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, and morphological analyses, we confirmed its sensitivity in detecting all ipRGC types (M1-M6). Using this new tool, we describe the topographical distributions of ipRGC types across the retinal landscape, uncovering distinct ventronasal biases for M5 and M6 types, setting them apart from their M1-M4 counterparts. In the brain, we find vastly different labeling patterns between lines, with Opn4cre(DSO) only labeling ipRGC axonal projections to their targets. The combination of off-target effects of Opn4cre(Saha) across the retina and brain, coupled with diminished efficiencies of both Cre lines when coupled to less sensitive reporters, underscores the need for careful consideration in experimental design and validation with any Opn4cre driver. Overall, the Opn4cre(DSO) mouse line represents an improved tool for studying ipRGC function and distribution, offering a means to selectively target these cells to study light-regulated behaviors and physiology.

">Effects of Repetitive Mild Traumatic Brain Injury on Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Modulation of Lateral Habenula Excitability and Motivated Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a significant health burden due to mTBI-related chronic debilitating cognitive and psychiatric morbidities. Recent evidence from our laboratory suggests a possible dysregulation within reward/motivational circuit function at the level of a subcortical structure, the lateral habenula (LHb), where we demonstrated a causal role for hyperactive LHb in mTBI-induced motivational deficits in self-care grooming behavior in young adult male mice when exposed to mTBI injury during late adolescence (at ~8 weeks old). Here we extended this observation by further characterizing neurobehavioral effects of this repetitive closed head injury model of mTBI in both young adult male and female mice on LHb excitability, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) modulation of LHb activity, and behavioral responses of motivation to self-care behavior, and approach versus avoidance behavior in the presence of a social- or threat-related stimulus. We show that mTBI increases LHb spontaneous tonic activity in female mice similar to what we previously observed in male mice as well as promoting LHb neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperpolarization-induced LHb bursting in both male and female mice. Interestingly, mTBI only increases LHb intrinsic excitability in male mice coincident with higher levels of the hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (HCN/Ih) and reduces levels of the M-type potassium currents while potentiating M-currents without altering intrinsic excitability in LHb neurons of female mice. Since persistent dysregulation of brain CRF systems is suggested to contribute to chronic psychiatric morbidities and that LHb neurons are highly responsive to CRF, we then tested whether LHb CRF subsystem becomes engaged following mTBI. We found that in vitro inhibition of CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1) within the LHb normalizes mTBI-induced enhancement of LHb tonic activity and hyperexcitability in both sexes, suggesting that an augmented intra-LHb CRF-CRFR1-mediated signaling contributes to the overall LHb hyperactivity following mTBI. Behaviorally, mTBI diminishes motivation for self-care grooming in female mice as in male mice. mTBI also alters defensive behaviors in the looming shadow task by shifting the innate defensive behaviors towards more passive action-locking rather than escape behaviors in response to an aerial threat in both male and female mice as well as prolonging the latency to escape responses in female mice. While, this model of mTBI reduces social preference in male mice, it induces higher social novelty seeking during the novel social encounters in both male and female mice. Overall, our study provides further translational validity for the use of this preclinical model of mTBI for investigation of mTBI-related reward circuit dysfunction and mood/motivation-related behavioral deficits in both sexes while uncovering a few sexually dimorphic neurobehavioral effects of this model that may differentially affect young males and females when exposed to this type of mTBI injury during late adolescence.

">CA1 Engram Cell Dynamics Before and After Learning</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental question in neuroscience is how memory formation shapes brain activity at the level of populations of neurons. Recent studies of hippocampal engram cells, identified by immediate-early genes (IEGs) induced by learning, propose that these populations act as a neuronal substrate for memory storage. The current framework for engram formation proposes that cells join ensembles based on increased intrinsic excitability, and that after initial learning, they co-activate to support memory retrieval. However, direct evidence of how engram population dynamics evolve across learning is limited. Here we combined activity-dependent genetic tagging and two-photon calcium imaging to characterize CA1 engram population activity before and after learning. We observed that spontaneous activity two days before learning predicted genetic tagging, consistent with a model in which spontaneous fluctuations bias cells into forming engram assemblies. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect increased spontaneous activity rates or pairwise correlations amongst tagged CA1 neurons after learning. These results were consistent with computational network models that incorporate strong and specific inhibitory connections, supporting the idea that excitatory/inhibitory balance in CA1 may play a key role in engram dynamics. Together these results highlight a potential role for slow time scale excitability fluctuations in driving engram formation and suggest that excitatory-inhibitory balance may regulate engram cell co-activation

">Eigenmodes of the brain: revisiting connectomics and geometry</a></h4>

              
                Eigenmodes can be derived from various structural brain properties, including cortical surface geometry and interareal axonal connections comprising an organism's connectome. Pang and colleagues map geometric and connectome eigenmodes to spatial patterns of human brain activity, assessing whether brain connectivity or geometry provide greater explanatory power of brain function. The authors find that geometric eigenmodes are superior predictors of cortical activity compared to connectome eigenmodes. They conclude that this supports the predictions of neural field theory (NFT), in that "brain activity is best represented in terms of eigenmodes derived directly from the shape of the cortex, thus emphasizing a fundamental role of geometry in constraining dynamics". The experimental comparisons favoring geometric eigenmodes over connectome eigenmodes, in conjunction with specific statements regarding the relative efficacy of geometry in representing brain activity, have been widely interpreted to mean that geometry imposes stronger constraints on cortical dynamics than connectivity. Here, we reconsider the comparative experimental evidence focusing on the impact of connectome mapping methodology. Utilizing established methods to mitigate connectome construction limitations, we map new connectomes for the same dataset, finding that eigenmodes derived from these connectomes reach comparable accuracy in explaining brain activity to that of geometric eigenmodes. We conclude that the evidence presented to support the comparative proposition that "eigenmodes derived from brain geometry represent a more fundamental anatomical constraint on dynamics than the connectome" may require reconsideration in light of our findings. Pang and colleagues present compelling evidence for the important role of geometric constraints on brain function, but their findings should not be interpreted to mean that geometry has superior explanatory power over the connectome.

                The mammalian cerebral cortex is composed of a rich diversity of cell types. Cortical cells are organized into networks that rely on their functional diversity to ultimately carry out a variety of sophisticated cognitive functions. To investigate the breadth of transcriptionally diverse cell types in the cortex, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) in the auditory cortex of the adult rat. A variety of unique excitatory and inhibitory neuron types were identified. In addition, we report for the first time a diversity of astrocytes in the auditory cortex that may represent functionally unique subtypes. Together, these results pave the way for building models of how neurons in the sensory cortex work in concert with astrocytes at synapses to fulfill high-cognitive functions like learning and memory.

                The rise of large neuroimaging datasets and multi-dataset mega-analyses brings the power to study interindividual differences in brain structure and function on a heretofore unseen scale. However, unknown and poorly characterized intra-individual variability continues to undermine the detection of robust brain-behavior associations and, ultimately, our understanding of the brain on the whole. Women's and reproductive health underlie variability in more than half of the population, but have long been overlooked in the study of both inter- and intra-individual differences in the brain. To this end, the Dense Investigation of Variability in Affect (DIVA) Study was designed to study intra-individual variability in the brain and behavior across the menstrual cycle in a small cohort of premenopausal female participants. The DIVA Study acquired weekly actigraphy, self-report, biospecimen, and both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data with concurrent peripheral physiological recordings. These data facilitate the study of several common sources of variability in the brain and behavior: the menstrual cycle and ovarian hormones, sleep, stress, exercise, and exogenous sources of hemodynamic variability.

">Dissociable memory modulation mechanisms facilitate fear amnesia at different timescales</a></h4>

              
                Memory reactivation renders consolidated memory fragile and preludes memory reconsolidation. However, whether memory retrieval facilitates update mechanisms other than memory reconsolidation remains unclear. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments with healthy human participants. First, we demonstrate that memory reactivation prevents the return of fear shortly after extinction training in contrast to the memory reconsolidation effect which takes several hours to emerge and such a short-term amnesia effect is cue independent (Study 1, N = 57 adults). Furthermore, memory reactivation also triggers fear memory reconsolidation and produces cue-specific amnesia at a longer and separable timescale (Study 2, N = 79 adults). Finally, using continuous theta-burst stimulation (Study 3, N = 75 adults), we directly manipulated brain activities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found that both memory retrieval and intact prefrontal cortex functions were necessary for the short-term fear amnesia. The temporal scale and cue-specificity results of the short-term fear amnesia are clearly dissociable from the amnesia related to memory reconsolidation, and suggest that memory retrieval and extinction training trigger distinct underlying memory update mechanisms. These findings raise the possibility of concerted memory modulation processes related to memory retrieval and shed light to clinical treatment of persistent maladaptive memory.

                Schizophrenia is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder with unknown genetic pathogenic mechanisms. Here, we selected 11 schizophrenia risk genes and generated single-gene-knockout-precise-dorsal/ventral-forebrain-organoids (SKOPOS) via CRISPR-Cas9 system. 90 bulk and 249,430 single-cell RNA-sequencing of SKOPOS revealed that knockout of 11 risk genes lead to different levels of deficits in dorsal/ventral forebrain organoids. Among them, calneuron 1 (CALN1) acts as a pivotal pathogenic gene of schizophrenia via severe disruption of gene expression network, interaction with about 32% (34/106) known schizophrenia risk genes, delayed maturation and impaired spontaneous neural circuit in human developing forebrain. Furtherly, including the spontaneous abrupt burst spiking in cortical neurons and the defects of spatial memory, cognition and social ability, Caln1 KO mice surprisingly displayed spontaneous startle behavior and head-twitch response correlated with hallucination-like behavior, which could be inhibited by antipsychotic drug SEP-363856. In summary, CALN1 is identified as a pivotal pathogenic gene of schizophrenia in forebrain development.

	<p>The acquisition of skills, such as learning to play a musical instrument, involves various phases that make specific demands on the learner. Knowledge of the cognitive and motor contributions during learning phases can be helpful in developing effective and targeted interventions for healthy aging. Eighty-six healthy older participants underwent an extensive cognitive, motoric, and musical test battery. Within one session, one piano-related and one music-independent movement sequence were both learned. We tested the associations between skill performance and cognito-motor abilities with Bayesian mixed models accounting for individual learning rates. Results showed that performance was positively associated with all cognito-motor abilities. Learning a piano-related task was characterized by relatively strong initial associations between performance and abilities. These associations then weakened considerably before increasing exponentially from the second trial onwards, approaching a plateau. Similar performance&amp;amp;ndash;ability relationships were detected in the course of learning a music-unrelated motor task. Positive performance&amp;amp;ndash;ability associations emphasize the potential of learning new skills to produce positive cognitive and motor transfer effects. Consistent high-performance tasks that demand maximum effort from the participants could be very effective. However, interventions should be sufficiently long so that the transfer potential can be fully exploited.</p>

	<p>Being able to represent and remember verbally-encoded information about spatial environments from different perspectives is important for numerous daily activities. The present study examined how frequently individuals spontaneously engage in visual mental imagery and verbal rehearsal strategies in memory recall of spatial descriptions, and whether using certain strategies is associated with better recall performance. Memory recall for route (person-centred) and survey (object-centred) spatial descriptions was examined in a sample of 105 neurotypical individuals, who also reported to what extent they used route- and survey-based mental imagery and verbal rehearsal strategies in each description. Results showed that participants favoured a path visualisation strategy to recall the route description and a map visualisation strategy to recall the survey description. Regression models further showed that employing both imagery and verbal strategies was associated with better recall for both route and survey descriptions, although imagery strategies held a higher predictive power. The present findings highlight the fact that the spontaneous use of internal strategies in the form of visual imagery and verbal rehearsal is ubiquitous when recalling spatial descriptions and a core part of efficient spatial memory functioning.</p>

	<p>Movement and muscle control are crucial for the survival of all free-living organisms. This study aimed to explore differential patterns of cortical and subcortical activation across different stages of muscle control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An event-related design was employed. In each trial, participants (n = 10) were instructed to gently press a button with their right index finger, hold it naturally for several seconds, and then relax the finger. Neural activation in these temporally separated stages was analyzed using a General Linear Model. Our findings revealed that a widely distributed cortical network, including the supplementary motor area and insula, was implicated not only in the pressing stage, but also in the relaxation stage, while only parts of the network were involved in the steady holding stage. Moreover, supporting the direct/indirect pathway model of the subcortical basal ganglia, their substructures played distinct roles in different stages of muscle control. The caudate nucleus exhibited greater involvement in muscle contraction, whereas the putamen demonstrated a stronger association with muscle relaxation; both structures were implicated in the pressing stage. Furthermore, the subthalamic nucleus was exclusively engaged during the muscle relaxation stage. We conclude that even the control of simple muscle movements involves intricate automatic higher sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor integration at a neural level, particularly when coordinating relative muscle movements, including both muscle contraction and muscle relaxation; the cortical and subcortical regions assume distinct yet coordinated roles across different stages of muscle control.</p>

	<p>The relationship between cerebral rhythms and early sensorimotor development is not clear. In recent decades, evidence revealed a rhythmic modulation involving sensorimotor processing. A widely corroborated functional role of oscillatory activity is to coordinate the information flow across sensorimotor networks. Their activity is coordinated by event-related synchronisation and desynchronisation in different sensorimotor rhythms, which indicate parallel processes may be occurring in the neuronal network during movement. To date, the dynamics of these brain oscillations and early sensorimotor development are unexplored. Our study investigates the relationship between the cerebral rhythms using EEG and a typical rhythmic movement of infants, the non-nutritive sucking (NNS) behaviour. NNS is an endogenous behaviour that originates from the suck central pattern generator in the brainstem. We find, in 17 infants, that sucking frequency correlates with beta synchronisation within the sensorimotor area in two phases: one strongly anticipating (~3 s) and the other encompassing the start of the motion. These findings suggest that a beta synchronisation of the sensorimotor cortex may influence the sensorimotor dynamics of NNS activity. Our results reveal the importance of rapid brain oscillations in infants and the role of beta synchronisation and their possible role in the communication between cortical and deep generators.</p>

                <p>by Alejandro Tlaie, Katharine Shapcott, Thijs L. van der Plas, James Rowland, Robert Lees, Joshua Keeling, Adam Packer, Paul Tiesinga, Marieke L. Schölvinck, Martha N. Havenith</p>

Trial-averaged metrics, e.g. tuning curves or population response vectors, are a ubiquitous way of characterizing neuronal activity. But how relevant are such trial-averaged responses to neuronal computation itself? Here we present a simple test to estimate whether average responses reflect aspects of neuronal activity that contribute to neuronal processing. The test probes two assumptions implicitly made whenever average metrics are treated as meaningful representations of neuronal activity:


Reliability: Neuronal responses repeat consistently enough across trials that they convey a recognizable reflection of the average response to downstream regions.


Behavioural relevance: If a single-trial response is more similar to the average template, it is more likely to evoke correct behavioural responses.


We apply this test to two data sets: (1) Two-photon recordings in primary somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2) of mice trained to detect optogenetic stimulation in S1; and (2) Electrophysiological recordings from 71 brain areas in mice performing a contrast discrimination task. Under the highly controlled settings of Data set 1, both assumptions were largely fulfilled. In contrast, the less restrictive paradigm of Data set 2 met neither assumption. Simulations predict that the larger diversity of neuronal response preferences, rather than higher cross-trial reliability, drives the better performance of Data set 1. We conclude that when behaviour is less tightly restricted, average responses do not seem particularly relevant to neuronal computation, potentially because information is encoded more dynamically. Most importantly, we encourage researchers to apply this simple test of computational relevance whenever using trial-averaged neuronal metrics, in order to gauge how representative cross-trial averages are in a given context.

                Background The zoonotic infection caused by tapeworms Echinococcus is a neglected tropical disease in poor regions with limited access to suitable sanitary conditions. Hydatid cysts produced by Echinococcus granulosus use fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABP) to obtain the fatty acids and cholesterol necessary for their survival from the host. In this work, we analyzed the behaviour of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids against EgFABP1. Methods We used computational biology and chemistry techniques and binding free energy estimations by molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA). Results This research has enabled us to clarify the EgFABP1 isoforms identified in the database, suggesting their potential involvement in diverse cellular activities of Echinococcus granulosus. Conversely, examining the global and local chemical reactivity of 14 fatty acids revealed that liposolubility is contingent upon the degree of unsaturation in the FAs. Additionally, FAs exhibited acceptable levels of oral absorption and bioavailability. The binding of EgFABP1 with FAs analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation showed us that these are highly stable, where the best affinity was with docosahexaenoic acid. Conclusions Our results suggest that the action of fatty acids could play an interesting role in detecting early Echinococcus granulosus.

                The plastic related research has been an epicentre in recent times. The presence and spread of micro (nano) plastics (MNPs) are well-known in the terrestrial and aquatic environment. However, the focus on the fate and remediation of MNP in soil and groundwater is limited. The fate and bioaccumulation of ingested MNPs remain unknown within the digestive tract of animals. There is also a significant knowledge gap in understanding the ubiquitous organic environmental pollutants with MNPs in biological systems. Reducing plastic consumption, improving waste management practices, and developing environmentally friendly alternatives are some of the key steps needed to address MNP pollution. For better handling and to protect the environment from these invisible substances, policymakers and researchers urgently need to monitor and map MNP contamination in soil and groundwater.

                Background Today, the tourism sector in particular is becoming increasingly competitive, forcing companies to adopt innovative approaches to attract the attention of consumers. In this context, a virtual reality application is presented with the aim of strengthening brand loyalty through immersive experiences in tourism companies. Methods The development was divided into three phases: planning, implementation and operation, which emphasized close collaboration with stakeholders to adapt to changing requirements; implementation, which focused on a simple design with emphasis on creating a scalable and secure backend architecture; and finally, in the operation phase, two iterations were carried out. The first focused on creating an immersive virtual environment with intuitive interfaces and basic interactive elements. The second iteration enhanced these basic features and incorporated advanced features such as greater interactivity with virtual objects for a more realistic experience. Results A 66.36% increase in brand loyalty was achieved, demonstrating increased customer engagement and sustainable revenue generation. There was also a 65.48% increase in customer retention, indicating a continued willingness to purchase services from this brand. In addition, 78.15% of participants expressed a high level of satisfaction with the virtual reality experience. Conclusions This research contributes to the process of inclusive and sustainable industrialization by improving infrastructure and making industries more sustainable. This will be achieved by making more efficient use of resources and promoting the adoption of technologies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-301/v1?src=rss">Proposal of a domain model for 3D representation of buildings in Ecuador. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The accelerated urban sprawl of cities around the world presents major challenges for urban planning and land resource management. In this context, it is crucial to have a detailed 3D representation of buildings enriched with accurate alphanumeric information. A distinctive aspect of this proposal is its specific focus on the spatial unit corresponding to buildings. In order to propose a domain model for the 3D representation of buildings, the national standard of Ecuador and the international standard (ISO 19152:2012 LADM) were considered. The proposal includes a detailed specification of attributes, both for the general subclass of buildings and for their infrastructure. The application of the domain model proposal was crucial in a study area located in the Riobamba canton, due to the characteristics of the buildings in that area. For this purpose, a geodatabase was created in pgAdmin4 with official information, taking into account the structure of the proposed model and linking it with geospatial data for an adequate management and 3D representation of the buildings in an open-source Geographic Information System. This application improves cadastral management in the study region and has wider implications. This model is intended to serve as a benchmark for other countries facing similar challenges in cadastral management and 3D representation of buildings, promote efficient urban development and contribute to global sustainable development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-300/v1?src=rss">A prospective randomized comparative study to evaluate efficacy of intrathecal dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine added as adjuvant to bupivacaine in pregnant patients posted for elective LSCS [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Any individual undergoing surgery is concerned about postoperative discomfort. It modifies the body’s physiological reaction and impacts an individual’s psychological state. A physician can meet early mobilization goals by effectively managing postoperative pain and preventing related co-morbidities. Targeting different phases of the pain pathway, from perception to central modulation, is successfully accomplished through the use of different drug combinations and regional anesthetic block techniques. Local anaesthetics injected intrathecally in a single injection create a superb surgical field and can even make a patient pain-free two to three hours following surgery. By adding certain adjuncts, this period can be prolonged, and there will be long-term benefits in terms of decreasing the dosage of opioid analgesics. Because of its faster start of the action and low side effects, spinal anaesthesia is the procedure most frequently used for caesarean sections. Many intrathecal additives have been explored since it has a limited role in postoperative pain control. Adjuvants such as opioids, clonidine, adrenaline, and phenylephrine have been explored recently. These chemicals have been linked to several problems, including tachycardia, respiratory depression with opioids, hypertension with adrenaline and clonidine, and excessive sedation. In this study, our primary objective is to compare the duration of postoperative analgesia between Dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine, as Dexamethasone is an anti-inflammatory drug and dexmedetomidine is an alpha-two agonist that binds with a G protein-coupled receptor. our secondary objectives include comparing intraoperative hemodynamics, intraoperative sedation, and intraoperative shivering between Dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1322/v2?src=rss">Acrylamide in starchy foods subjected to deep-frying, 20 years after its discovery (2002-2022): a patent review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the discovery of acrylamide in food, an analysis of patents related to the mitigation of this compound in food products obtained through immersion frying was carried out. For this purpose, a comprehensive search, compilation, and information analysis were conducted using free online databases such as Google Patents, Patenscope, and Lens. The search yielded a total of 79 patents within the considered time period (2002-2022). The countries with the highest number of granted patents were the United States, the European Union, and South Korea. The patents were classified into four main approaches: raw material modification (49%), application of pre-treatments (27%), process modification (16%), and measurement techniques (8%). Among the results, Frito-Lay, an American company, stands out as the food industry company with the highest number of granted patents, totaling 15. Based on this review, it is concluded that while a significant number of patents have been granted in recent years, there is still a lag in developing countries. Furthermore, more studies are needed to determine acrylamide in starchy food matrices subjected to immersion frying different from potatoes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92574">Haplotype function score improves biological interpretation and cross-ancestry polygenic prediction of human complex traits</a></h4>

              
                We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies: at each locus, a deep learning model (in this study, Sei) is used to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual. This score, defined as the Haplotype Function Score (HFS), replaces the original genotype in association studies. Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank, we identified 3619 independent HFS–trait associations with a significance of p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway–trait associations and 153 tissue–trait associations with strong biological interpretability, including ‘circadian pathway-chronotype’ and ‘arachidonic acid-intelligence’. Lastly, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores, which showed an improvement of 16.1–39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93759">X-ray structure and enzymatic study of a bacterial NADPH oxidase highlight the activation mechanism of eukaryotic NOX</a></h4>

              
                NADPH oxidases (NOX) are transmembrane proteins, widely spread in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Eukaryotes use the ROS products for innate immune defense and signaling in critical (patho)physiological processes. Despite the recent structures of human NOX isoforms, the activation of electron transfer remains incompletely understood. SpNOX, a homolog from <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, can serves as a robust model for exploring electron transfers in the NOX family thanks to its constitutive activity. Crystal structures of SpNOX full-length and dehydrogenase (DH) domain constructs are revealed here. The isolated DH domain acts as a flavin reductase, and both constructs use either NADPH or NADH as substrate. Our findings suggest that hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD is the rate-limiting step in electron transfer. We identify significance of F397 in nicotinamide access to flavin isoalloxazine and confirm flavin binding contributions from both DH and Transmembrane (TM) domains. Comparison with related enzymes suggests that distal access to heme may influence the final electron acceptor, while the relative position of DH and TM does not necessarily correlate with activity, contrary to previous suggestions. It rather suggests requirement of an internal rearrangement, within the DH domain, to switch from a resting to an active state. Thus, SpNOX appears to be a good model of active NOX2, which allows us to propose an explanation for NOX2’s requirement for activation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86354">MEMO1 binds iron and modulates iron homeostasis in cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Mediator of ERBB2-driven Cell Motility 1 (MEMO1) is an evolutionary conserved protein implicated in many biological processes; however, its primary molecular function remains unknown. Importantly, MEMO1 is overexpressed in many types of cancer and was shown to modulate breast cancer metastasis through altered cell motility. To better understand the function of MEMO1 in cancer cells, we analyzed genetic interactions of MEMO1 using gene essentiality data from 1028 cancer cell lines and found multiple iron-related genes exhibiting genetic relationships with MEMO1. We experimentally confirmed several interactions between MEMO1 and iron-related proteins in living cells, most notably, transferrin receptor 2 (<i>TFR</i>2), mitoferrin-2 (<i>SLC25A28</i>), and the global iron response regulator IRP1 (<i>ACO1</i>). These interactions indicate that cells with high MEMO1 expression levels are hypersensitive to the disruptions in iron distribution. Our data also indicate that MEMO1 is involved in ferroptosis and is linked to iron supply to mitochondria. We have found that purified MEMO1 binds iron with high affinity under redox conditions mimicking intracellular environment and solved MEMO1 structures in complex with iron and copper. Our work reveals that the iron coordination mode in MEMO1 is very similar to that of iron-containing extradiol dioxygenases, which also display a similar structural fold. We conclude that MEMO1 is an iron-binding protein that modulates iron homeostasis in cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88225">The CD4 transmembrane GGXXG and juxtamembrane (C/F)CV+C motifs mediate pMHCII-specific signaling independently of CD4-LCK interactions</a></h4>

              
                CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation is driven by five-module receptor complexes. The T cell receptor (TCR) is the receptor module that binds composite surfaces of peptide antigens embedded within MHCII molecules (pMHCII). It associates with three signaling modules (CD3γε, CD3δε, and CD3ζζ) to form TCR-CD3 complexes. CD4 is the coreceptor module. It reciprocally associates with TCR-CD3-pMHCII assemblies on the outside of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and with the Src kinase, LCK, on the inside. Previously, we reported that the CD4 transmembrane GGXXG and cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (C/F)CV+C motifs found in eutherian (placental mammal) CD4 have constituent residues that evolved under purifying selection (Lee et al., 2022). Expressing mutants of these motifs together in T cell hybridomas increased CD4-LCK association but reduced CD3ζ, ZAP70, and PLCγ1 phosphorylation levels, as well as IL-2 production, in response to agonist pMHCII. Because these mutants preferentially localized CD4-LCK pairs to non-raft membrane fractions, one explanation for our results was that they impaired proximal signaling by sequestering LCK away from TCR-CD3. An alternative hypothesis is that the mutations directly impacted signaling because the motifs normally play an LCK-independent role in signaling. The goal of this study was to discriminate between these possibilities. Using T cell hybridomas, our results indicate that: intracellular CD4-LCK interactions are not necessary for pMHCII-specific signal initiation; the GGXXG and (C/F)CV+C motifs are key determinants of CD4-mediated pMHCII-specific signal amplification; the GGXXG and (C/F)CV+C motifs exert their functions independently of direct CD4-LCK association. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for why residues within these motifs are under purifying selection in jawed vertebrates. The results are also important to consider for biomimetic engineering of synthetic receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90203">The rapidly evolving X-linked MIR-506 family fine-tunes spermatogenesis to enhance sperm competition</a></h4>

              
                Despite rapid evolution across eutherian mammals, the X-linked <i>MIR-506</i> family miRNAs are located in a region flanked by two highly conserved protein-coding genes (<i>SLITRK2</i> and <i>FMR1</i>) on the X chromosome. Intriguingly, these miRNAs are predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a potential role in spermatogenesis and male fertility. Here, we report that the X-linked <i>MIR-506</i> family miRNAs were derived from the MER91C DNA transposons. Selective inactivation of individual miRNAs or clusters caused no discernible defects, but simultaneous ablation of five clusters containing 19 members of the <i>MIR-506</i> family led to reduced male fertility in mice. Despite normal sperm counts, motility, and morphology, the KO sperm were less competitive than wild-type sperm when subjected to a polyandrous mating scheme. Transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses revealed that these X-linked <i>MIR-506</i> family miRNAs, in addition to targeting a set of conserved genes, have more targets that are critical for spermatogenesis and embryonic development during evolution. Our data suggest that the <i>MIR-506</i> family miRNAs function to enhance sperm competitiveness and reproductive fitness of the male by finetuning gene expression during spermatogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85579">Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and PBP4 bind to the conformationally dynamic N-terminal domain of GpsB</a></h4>

              
                In the Firmicutes phylum, GpsB is a membrane associated protein that coordinates peptidoglycan synthesis with cell growth and division. Although GpsB has been studied in several bacteria, the structure, function, and interactome of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> GpsB is largely uncharacterized. To address this knowledge gap, we solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of <i>S. aureus</i> GpsB, which adopts an atypical, asymmetric dimer, and demonstrates major conformational flexibility that can be mapped to a hinge region formed by a three-residue insertion exclusive to<i> Staphylococci</i>. When this three-residue insertion is excised, its thermal stability increases, and the mutant no longer produces a previously reported lethal phenotype when overexpressed in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. In <i>S. aureus</i>, we show that these hinge mutants are less functional and speculate that the conformational flexibility imparted by the hinge region may serve as a dynamic switch to finetune the function of the GpsB complex and/or to promote interaction with its various partners. Furthermore, we provide the first biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic evidence that the N-terminal domain of GpsB binds not only PBP4, but also FtsZ, through a conserved recognition motif located on their C-termini, thus coupling peptidoglycan synthesis to cell division. Taken together, the unique structure of <i>S. aureus</i> GpsB and its direct interaction with FtsZ/PBP4 provide deeper insight into the central role of GpsB in <i>S. aureus</i> cell division.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89157">A modified BCG with depletion of enzymes associated with peptidoglycan amidation induces enhanced protection against tuberculosis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms by which <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) evades pathogen recognition receptor activation during infection may offer insights for the development of improved tuberculosis (TB) vaccines. Whilst Mtb elicits NOD-2 activation through host recognition of its peptidoglycan-derived muramyl dipeptide (MDP), it masks the endogenous NOD-1 ligand through amidation of glutamate at the second position in peptidoglycan side-chains. As the current BCG vaccine is derived from pathogenic mycobacteria, a similar situation prevails. To alleviate this masking ability and to potentially improve efficacy of the BCG vaccine, we used CRISPRi to inhibit expression of the essential enzyme pair, MurT-GatD, implicated in amidation of peptidoglycan side-chains. We demonstrate that depletion of these enzymes results in reduced growth, cell wall defects, increased susceptibility to antibiotics, altered spatial localization of new peptidoglycan and increased NOD-1 expression in macrophages. In cell culture experiments, training of a human monocyte cell line with this recombinant BCG yielded improved control of Mtb growth. In the murine model of TB infection, we demonstrate that depletion of MurT-GatD in BCG, which is expected to unmask the D-glutamate diaminopimelate (iE-DAP) NOD-1 ligand, yields superior prevention of TB disease compared to the standard BCG vaccine. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments in this study demonstrate the feasibility of gene regulation platforms such as CRISPRi to alter antigen presentation in BCG in a bespoke manner that tunes immunity towards more effective protection against TB disease.

	<p>The morphology of the brain undergoes changes throughout the aging process, and accurately predicting a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain age and gender using brain morphology features can aid in detecting atypical brain patterns. Neuroimaging-based estimation of brain age is commonly used to assess an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain health relative to a typical aging trajectory, while accurately classifying gender from neuroimaging data offers valuable insights into the inherent neurological differences between males and females. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of classical machine learning models with that of a quantum machine learning method called a variational quantum circuit in estimating brain age and predicting gender based on structural magnetic resonance imaging data. We evaluated six classical machine learning models alongside a quantum machine learning model using both combined and sub-datasets, which included data from both in-house collections and public sources. The total number of participants was 1157, ranging from ages 14 to 89, with a gender distribution of 607 males and 550 females. Performance evaluation was conducted within each dataset using training and testing sets. The variational quantum circuit model generally demonstrated superior performance in estimating brain age and gender classification compared to classical machine learning algorithms when using the combined dataset. Additionally, in benchmark sub-datasets, our approach exhibited better performance compared to previous studies that utilized the same dataset for brain age prediction. Thus, our results suggest that variational quantum algorithms demonstrate comparable effectiveness to classical machine learning algorithms for both brain age and gender prediction, potentially offering reduced error and improved accuracy.</p>

	<p>This study employs event-related potential (ERP) to examine the impact of empathic concern on prosocial decision-making with costs in both gain and loss contexts. In this experiment, participants can choose between two types of lottery tickets and pay lottery money to help the target person gain more money or lose less money. The behavioral results showed that regardless of the context of the decision (financial loss or gain), participants tended to help individuals who had induced high empathic concern. ERP results show that compared to the low-empathic-concern condition, the high-empathic-concern condition induced greater P3 amplitude in the gain context. However, this change in P3 amplitude caused by empathic concern did not occur in the context of loss. These findings indicate that empathic concern has different psychological mechanisms that moderate prosocial behavior in gain and loss contexts.</p>

	<p>Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. The narrow therapeutic window (within 4.5 h) and severe hemorrhagic potential limits therapeutic efficacy of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) intravenous thrombolysis for patients. Xingnao Kaiqiao (XNKQ) acupuncture is an integral part of traditional Chinese medicine, specifically designed to address acute ischemic stroke by targeting key acupoints such as Shuigou (GV26) and Neiguan (PC6). In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of XNKQ acupuncture in extending the time window for thrombolysis and interrogated the molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect. Methods: The effect of extending the thrombolysis window by acupuncture was evaluated via TTC staining, neuronal score evaluation, hemorrhagic transformation assay, and H&amp;amp;amp;E staining. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology was performed to identify the therapeutic targets and intervention mechanisms of acupuncture. Evans blue staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to assess blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to evaluate the level of autophagy and apoptosis and validate their interactions with BBB endothelial cells. Results: Acupuncture alleviated infarction and neurological deficits and extended the thrombolysis window to 6 h. The RNA-seq revealed 16 potential therapeutic predictors for acupuncture intervention, which related to suppressing inflammation and restoring the function of BBB and blood vessels. Furthermore, acupuncture suppressed BBB leakage and preserved tight junction protein expression. The protective effect was associated with regulation of the autophagy&amp;amp;ndash;apoptosis balance in BBB endothelial cells. Acupuncture intervention dissociated the Beclin1/Bcl-2 complex, thereby promoting autophagy and reducing apoptosis. Conclusion: XNKQ acupuncture could serve as an adjunctive therapy for rt-PA thrombolysis, aiming to extend the therapeutic time window and mitigate ischemia&amp;amp;ndash;reperfusion injury. Acupuncture suppressed BBB disruption by regulating the autophagy&amp;amp;ndash;apoptosis balance, which in turn extended the therapeutic window of rt-PA in IS. These findings provide a rationale for further exploration of acupuncture as a complementary candidate co-administered with rt-PA.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability. TBI is associated with neuroinflammation, but temporal changes in immune and inflammatory signaling following TBI have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, there have been no previous studies on changes in immune cell populations following TBI via the Closed Head Injury Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA). The current study aimed to determine the time course changes to inflammatory marker mRNA expression in the acute period following TBI in juvenile rats and to determine acute changes to brain and circulating immune cell populations. For this study, post-natal day (PND)-30 male Long Evans rats sustained a TBI or Sham TBI and were euthanized at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, or 96 h post-injury. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus samples were used to determine mRNA expression changes of inflammatory factors. The mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; was significantly elevated at 6 h post-injury in both regions evaluated. To evaluate immune cell populations, male Long Evans rats were euthanized at 48 h post-injury, and brain and blood samples were used for cell sorting by marker-specific antibodies. In the peripheral blood, there was an elevation in CD3+ total T cells, CD45R+ total B cells, and CD3+CD4+ helper T cells in the TBI subjects. However, there were no changes to natural killer cells or CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cell populations. In the brain, there was a reduction in CD11b/c+ monocytes/macrophages, but no changes in other immune cell populations. At 48 h post-injury, the TBI subjects also demonstrated expansion of the thymic medulla. These changes in the cerebral and blood immune cell populations and thymic medulla expansion may implicate the subacute recovery timeframe as a vulnerable window for the immune system in the pediatric population.</p>

	<p>Fatigue is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but even so, it may still be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed in current practice due to its non-specific manifestations. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in PD patients compared to healthy controls and to identify the main characteristics and associations of fatigue with other non-motor symptoms and the impact of fatigue on sleep disturbances in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Materials and methods: case&amp;amp;ndash;control study in which 131 PD patients and 131 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Main characteristics of fatigue, sleep, and other non-motor symptoms were assessed using specific validated questionnaires. Results: According to the Chalder fatigue scale, fatigue is more prevalent in PD patients (38.16%) compared to healthy controls (26.71%). Fatigue was identified in 46.54% of the PD patients using the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fatigue Scale (PFS-16). PD patients with fatigue presented a worse motor status, more sleep disturbances (insomnia, daytime sleepiness), a broader spectrum of non-motor symptoms (pain, anxiety, urinary disturbances), worse cognitive performances, a lower level of happiness, and worse quality of life compared to PD patients without fatigue. Conclusion: Fatigue is a common symptom of PD and needs to be assessed, considering its consequences on quality of life. Sleep disturbances have a great influence over fatigue in PD patients.</p>

	<p>In the past few years, significant advancements in microscopic imaging technology have led to the production of numerous high-resolution images capturing brain neurons at the micrometer scale. The reconstructed structure of neurons from neuronal images can serve as a valuable reference for research in brain diseases and neuroscience. Currently, there lacks an accurate and efficient method for neuron reconstruction. Manual reconstruction remains the primary approach, offering high accuracy but requiring significant time investment. While some automatic reconstruction methods are faster, they often sacrifice accuracy and cannot be directly relied upon. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to develop a neuron reconstruction tool that is both efficient and accurate. The tool aids users in reconstructing complete neurons by calculating the confidence of branches during the reconstruction process. The method models the neuron reconstruction as multiple Markov chains, and calculates the confidence of the connections between branches by simulating the reconstruction artifacts in the results. Users iteratively modify low-confidence branches to ensure precise and efficient neuron reconstruction. Experiments on both the publicly accessible BigNeuron dataset and a self-created Whole-Brain dataset demonstrate that the tool achieves high accuracy similar to manual reconstruction, while significantly reducing reconstruction time.</p>

                Background The objective of this study was to perform morphometry of the gracilis muscle and understand the topographical basis of the entry of its pedicles. Methods We studied forty-four cadaveric lower extremities fixed in formalin. The length and width of the gracilis were measured at three locations: the origin, midpoint, and musculotendinous junction. The topographic location of the gracilis pedicles was also studied. Results The gracilis muscle’s length was 369.9±34.1 mm and 359.6±29.6 mm over the right and left sides. The width of right gracilis was 25±8.4 mm, 20.4±6.2 mm and 10.6±5.6 mm at the origin, midpoint and at the musculotendinous junction. The same over the left side were 26.7±8.6 mm, 20.6±9.1 mm and 10.4±6.4 mm respectively. The number of gracilis ranged from one to three. The location of first pedicle was 93.6±35.6 mm and 68.9±35.8 mm away from the pubic tubercle on the right and left sides, respectively. The second and third pedicles were entering at a distance of 153.1±38.8 mm and 101.3±20.8 mm, 214.6±86.8 mm and 145.3±124.4 mm over the right side and left side. The accessory head of the origin of the gracilis was observed in only one cadaver (2.3%), which originated from the adductor longus. Conclusions It is believed that the morphological data of the gracilis and its neurovascular pedicles will be enlightening to the operating surgeon. They will guide the procedures for reconstructive plastic surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-297/v1?src=rss">Determinants of immediate postpartum long acting reversible contraceptive utilization among women who gave birth in public health facilities in northwest Ethiopia: unmatched case-control study design [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The aftermath of childbirth plays a vital role in addressing unmet family planning requirements and is instrumental in mitigating the risks associated with pregnancies that are closely spaced. Recognizing factors that indicate immediate postpartum utilization of long-acting reversible contraceptives is essential for crafting focused initiatives. This helps meet unaddressed family planning needs and contributes to the reduction of maternal and child mortality rates in the country. Therefore, this research aimed to pinpoint factors influencing the utilization of long-acting reversible contraceptives immediately after childbirth among women delivering in public health facilities in northwest Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based unmatched case-control study was carried out, involving 342 postpartum women (comprising 108 cases and 216 controls) who delivered in public health facilities in northwest Ethiopia. Data collection involved employing a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, and binary logistic regression analysis was conducted. The statistically significant association between independent factors and the outcome variable was assessed using the adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval, considering a p-value less than 0.05. Result The educational status of women at secondary level and above (AOR=2.314, 95% CI=1.645-5.043), adherence to ANC follow-up (AOR=2.930, 95% CI=1.829-4.769), lack of desire to have a child (AOR=1.421, 95% CI=1.026-2.006), receiving counseling (AOR=3.029, 95% CI=2.085-5.988), and possessing knowledge (AOR=1.642, 95% CI=1.086-3.186) were identified as significantly correlated with immediate postpartum LARC utilization at p <0.05. Conclusion In this investigation, the utilization of immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) was significantly linked to women’s educational attainment, attendance at antenatal care (ANC), their desire for additional children, counseling, and knowledge about immediate postpartum LARC. To promote family planning in the postnatal phase, it is recommended to prioritize maternal education, offer comprehensive counseling and health education, and enhance adherence to targeted ANC services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-371/v2?src=rss">Atopic biomarker changes after exposure to Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide: a small experimental study in Wistar rats [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background IgE and IgG4 are implicated in atopic development and clinically utilized as major biomarkers. Atopic responses following certain pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), are currently an area of interest for further research. The aim of this study is to measure the level of IgE, IgG4, and IgG4/IgE ratio periodically after exposure of periodontal pathogen Pg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods We used 16 Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) randomly subdivided into four groups: Group 1,  injected with placebo; Group 2, injected with 0.3 µg/mL of Pg LPS; Group 3, injected with 1 µg/mL of Pg LPS; and Group 4, injected with 3 µg/mL of Pg LPS. Sera from all groups were taken from retro-orbital plexus before and after exposure. Results Levels of IgE and IgG4 increased significantly following exposure of Pg LPS at day-4 and day-11. Greater increase of IgE rather than IgG4 contributed to rapid decline of IgG4/IgE ratio, detected in the peripheral blood at day-4 and day-11. Conclusion Modulation of atopic responses following exposure to Pg is reflected by a decrease in IgG4/IgE ratio that accompanies an increase of IgE. Therefore, Pg, a keystone pathogen during periodontal disease, may have a tendency to disrupt atopic biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-296/v1?src=rss">Pulmonary function in Thai patients with systemic sclerosis; a single center 6-year retrospective study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Interstitial lung fibrosis is a major cause of internal organ involvement and the leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). This study aimed to demonstrate the characteristics of pulmonary function (PF) in Thai patients with SSc and the association between PF and body mass index (BMI) and anti-topoisomerase (anti-Scl70). Methods All patients diagnosed with SSc in our tertiary care teaching hospital database between 2016 and 2021 were reviewed. Clinical characteristics and PF were recorded and analyzed. Results Of 211 SSc patients, 128 patients who underwent the PF test were enrolled; 102 (79.7%) were female. The mean (SD) age was 54.0 (12.5) years. The mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.8 (0.1). The mean (SD) % predicted values of FEV1, FVC, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were 76.3 (16.3), 69.1 (15.8), and 75.5 (22.8), respectively. A restrictive spirometry pattern (RSP), defined as FVC < 80% predicted, was found in 78.8% of the patients. DLCO had a moderate positive linear correlation with FVC (r=0.50, p <0.001) and a moderate negative linear correlation with BMI (r=-0.36, p <0.001). However, there was no correlation between FVC and BMI. There was no statistical difference in demographic data or the presence of anti-Scl70 among patients with or without RSP. Conclusions RSP is common among Thai patients with SSc. Spirometry is a cost-effective screening tool for detecting SSc-related pulmonary involvement in resource-limited settings. However, the power of using demographic data and the presence of anti-Scl70 to determine the probability of pulmonary complications remains limited.

                Background The association between anemia and severity of infection as well as mortality rates among patients infected with COVID-19 has scarcely been studied. This is the first study UAE aimed to assess the influence of anemia on COVID-19 severity, ICU admission, and mortality rate. Methods A retro-prospective chart review of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted in a large COVID-19 referral hospital in UAE. The study included adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data, severity of the disease, ICU admissions, and mortality rates were analyzed and correlated to the presence of anemia among the patients. Results A total of 3092 patients were included. 362 patients (11.7%) were anemic and most of the cases were between asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 (77.4%, n=2393). Among patients with anemia, 30.1% (n=109) had moderate to severe COVID-19. Statistically, anemia was associated significantly with a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcome compared to nonanemic patients (AOR:1.59, 95% CI:1.24-2.04, p<0.001). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was almost 3 times higher among anemic patients compared to nonanemic (AOR:2.83,95% CI:1.89-4.25, p<0.001). In addition, the overall mortality rate of 2.8% (n=87) was 2.5-fold higher in anemic than nonanemic patients (OR:2.56, CI: 1.49-4.06, p<0.001). Moreover, older age (≥48-year-old) and male gender were independent predictors for severe illness (Age: OR=1.26, CI:1.07-1.51, p=0.006; Gender: OR:1.43,CI:1.15-1.78, p<0.001)) and ICU admission (Age: OR:2.08, CI:1.47-2.94, p<0.001; Gender: OR: 1.83, CI:1.12-3.00, p=0.008) whereas only age ≥48 years old contributed to higher mortality rate (OR:1.60, CI:1.04-2.46, p=0.034). Conclusion Anemia was a major risk factor for severe COVID-19, ICU admission and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Thus, healthcare providers should be aware of monitoring the hematological parameters among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and anemia to reduce the risk of disease complications and mortality. This association should also be considered in other infectious diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-429/v4?src=rss">A systematic investigation of detectors for low signal-to-noise ratio EMG signals [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Active participation of stroke survivors during robot-assisted movement therapy is essential for sensorimotor recovery. Robot-assisted therapy contingent on movement intention is an effective way to encourage patients’ active engagement. For severely impaired stroke patients with no residual movements, a surface electromyogram (EMG) has been shown to be a viable option for detecting movement intention. Although numerous algorithms for EMG detection exist, the detector with the highest accuracy and lowest latency for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) remains unknown. Methods This study, therefore, investigates the performance of 13 existing EMG detection algorithms on simulated low SNR (0dB and -3dB) EMG signals generated using three different EMG signal models: Gaussian, Laplacian, and biophysical model. The detector performance was quantified using the false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR), and detection latency. Any detector that consistently showed FPR and FNR of no more than 20%, and latency of no more than 50ms, was considered an appropriate detector for use in robot-assisted therapy. Results The results indicate that the Modified Hodges detector – a simplified version of the threshold-based Hodges detector introduced in the current study – was the most consistent detector across the different signal models and SNRs. It consistently performed for ~90% and ~40% of the tested trials for 0dB and -3dB SNR, respectively. The two statistical detectors (Gaussian and Laplacian Approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio) and the Fuzzy Entropy detectors have a slightly lower performance than Modified Hodges. Conclusions Overall, the Modified Hodges, Gaussian and Laplacian Approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio, and the Fuzzy Entropy detectors were identified as the potential candidates that warrant further investigation with real surface EMG data since they had consistent detection performance on low SNR EMG data.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, making the development of non-invasive and simple-to-use tools that bring insights into the state of the cardiovascular system of utmost importance. We investigated the possibility of using peripheral pulse wave recordings to estimate stroke volume (SV) and subject-specific parameters describing the selected properties of the cardiovascular system. Peripheral pressure waveforms were recorded in the radial artery using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor) in 35 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 14 healthy subjects. The pressure waveforms were then used to estimate subject-specific parameters of a mathematical model of pulse wave propagation coupled with the elastance-based model of the left ventricle. Bioimpedance cardiography measurements (PhysioFlow) were performed to validate the model-estimated SV. Mean absolute percentage error between the simulated and measured pressure waveforms was 4.0% and 2.8% for the HD and control group, respectively. We obtained a moderate correlation between the model-estimated and bioimpedance-based SV (r = 0.57, p<0.05, and r = 0.58, p<0.001, for the control group and HD patients, respectively). We also observed a correlation between the estimated end-systolic elastance of the left ventricle and the peripheral systolic pressure in both HD patients (r = 0.84, p<0.001) and the control group (r = 0.70, p<0.01). These preliminary results suggest that, after additional validation and possibly further refinement to increase accuracy, the proposed methodology could support non-invasive assessment of stroke volume and selected heart function parameters and vascular properties. Importantly, the proposed method could be potentially implemented in the existing devices measuring peripheral pressure waveforms.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011974">Mathematical analysis of left ventricular elastance with respect to afterload change during ejection phase</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shiro Kato, Yukiko Himeno, Akira Amano</p>

Since the left ventricle (LV) has pressure (<i>P</i><sub>lv</sub>) and volume (<i>V</i><sub>lv</sub>), we can define LV elastance from the ratio between <i>P</i><sub>lv</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>lv</sub>, termed as “instantaneous elastance.” On the other hand, end-systolic elastance (<i>E</i><sub>max</sub>) is known to be a good index of LV contractility, which is measured by the slope of several end-systolic <i>P</i><sub>lv</sub>—<i>V</i><sub>lv</sub> points obtained by using different loads. The word <i>E</i><sub>max</sub> originates from the assumption that LV elastance increases during the ejection phase and attains its maximum at the end-systole. From this concept, we can define another elastance determined by the slope of isochronous <i>P</i><sub>lv</sub>—<i>V</i><sub>lv</sub> points, that is <i>P</i><sub>lv</sub>—<i>V</i><sub>lv</sub> points at a certain time after the ejection onset time by using different loads. We refer to this elastance as “load-dependent elastance.”
To reveal the relation between these two elastances, we used a hemodynamic model that included a detailed ventricular myocyte contraction model. From the simulation results, we found that the isochronous <i>P</i><sub>lv</sub>—<i>V</i><sub>lv</sub> points lay in one line and that the line slope corresponding to the load-dependent elastance slightly decreased during the ejection phase, which is quite different from the instantaneous elastance.
Subsequently, we analyzed the mechanism determining these elastances from the model equations. We found that instantaneous elastance is directly related to contraction force generated by the ventricular myocyte, but the load-dependent elastance is determined by two factors: one is the transient characteristics of the cardiac cell, i.e., the velocity–dependent force drops characteristics in instantaneous shortening. The other is the force–velocity relation of the cardiac cell. We also found that the linear isochronous pressure–volume relation is based on the approximately linear relation between the time derivative of the cellular contraction force and the cellular shortening velocity that results from the combined characteristics of LV and aortic compliances.

                <p>by Anastasis Oulas, Kyriaki Savva, Nestoras Karathanasis, George M. Spyrou</p>

Prioritization or ranking of different cell types in a Single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) framework can be performed in a variety of ways, some of these include: i) obtaining an indication of the proportion of cell types between the different conditions under study, ii) counting the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cell types and conditions in the experiment or, iii) prioritizing cell types based on prior knowledge about the conditions under study (i.e., a specific disease). These methods have drawbacks and limitations thus novel methods for improving cell ranking are required. Here we present a novel methodology that exploits prior knowledge in combination with expert-user information to accentuate cell types from a scRNA-seq analysis that yield the most biologically meaningful results with respect to a disease under study. Our methodology allows for ranking and prioritization of cell-types based on how well their expression profiles relate to the molecular mechanisms and drugs associated with a disease. Molecular mechanisms, as well as drugs, are incorporated as prior knowledge in a standardized, structured manner. Cell-types are then ranked/prioritized based on how well results from data-driven analysis of scRNA-seq data match the predefined prior knowledge. In additional cell-cell communication perturbations between disease and control networks are used to further prioritize/rank cell-types. Our methodology has substantial advantages to more traditional cell ranking techniques and provides an informative complementary methodology that utilizes prior knowledge in a rapid and automated manner, that has previously not been attempted by other studies. The current methodology is also implemented as an R package entitled Single Cell Ranking Analysis Toolkit (scRANK) and is available for download and installation via GitHub (https://#hub.com/aoulas/scRANK)

                Background Mental health issues are becoming increasingly prevalent among elite athletes, and during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, this issue became a pressing concern. In particular, several athletes complained about their mental health in relation to the highly demanding demands of their sport. High-performance swimming exposes athletes to a variety of stressors due to the physical, technical and mental demands of the sport. The study has carried out a narrative review of the main variables related to mental health, their dimensions and evaluations in competitive swimmers. Methods Clearly planned and ordered potential studies were identified using combined search methods. The search was carried out in different bibliographic databases (Dialnet, Web of Science and Scopus) between 1990 and 2023. Google Scholar was used to manually search the reference lists of the retrieved studies to identify potentially eligible studies that were not included in the electronic searches. The studies were examined from three different perspectives. Firstly, the methodology, sample, swimming categories and their relationship with mental health were analysed. Secondly, the variables related to mental health symptoms and disorders. Finally, the main mental health analysis tools and the conclusions of the studies. Results The concept of mental health in competitive swimmers needs to be clarified in the scientific literature, as different variables have been analysed and multiple instruments have been used with small samples of swimmers, without any intervention and prevention protocol. In addition, the bodies and institutions involved should work in an interdisciplinary and collaborative manner, establishing specific programmes to ensure effective prevention and care. Conclusions Studies are needed to fill this gap and it is necessary to work under the same consensus and in collaboration with specified technical teams. In order to monitor, evaluate and provide services through detection tests and support to swimmers in their training and competitions.

                Background In Jordan, the number of single mothers is rising, constituting a distinct and neglected population sector. Single women encounter several obstacles as primary carers for their children. Since it is a complicated experience that may affect woman's resilience, influenced by social self-efficacy (SSE) and perceived social support (PSS), this study aims to determine how SSE and PSS influence resilience among single mothers. Methods This research employs a quantitative method. A volunteer group of 534 women in Jordan selected. Three scales were developed to meet the study objectives: PSS, SSE, and resilience. Results The study results indicate that PSS and SSE have a bearing on the resilience of single mothers, that there are no differences in PSS and resilience levels by social status, and that there is a difference in SSE levels by social class, favoring widows. Conclusions The PSS and SSE influence the resiliency of single women, which offers us the key to assisting them in reintegrating with the community following a family break. These women are also impacted by psychological and physical stress.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To report an autoimmune paraneoplastic encephalitis characterized by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody targeting synaptic protein calmodulin kinase-like vesicle-associated (CAMKV).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples harboring unclassified antibodies on murine brain-based indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were screened by human protein microarray. In 5 patients with identical cerebral IFA staining, CAMKV was identified as top-ranking candidate antigen. Western blots, confocal microscopy, immune-absorption, and mass spectrometry were performed to substantiate CAMKV specificity. Recombinant CAMKV-specific assays (cell-based [fixed and live] and Western blot) provided additional confirmation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 5 CAMKV-IgG positive patients, 3 were women (median symptom-onset age was 59 years; range, 53–74). Encephalitis-onset was subacute (4) or acute (1) and manifested with: altered mental status (all), seizures (4), hyperkinetic movements (4), psychiatric features (3), memory loss (2), and insomnia (2). Paraclinical testing revealed CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (all 4 tested), electrographic seizures (3 of 4 tested), and striking MRI abnormalities in all (mesial temporal lobe T2 hyperintensities [all patients], caudate head T2 hyperintensities [3], and cortical diffusion weighted hyperintensities [2]). None had post-gadolinium enhancement. Cancers were uterine adenocarcinoma (3 patients: poorly differentiated or neuroendocrine-differentiated in 2, both demonstrated CAMKV immunoreactivity), bladder urothelial carcinoma (1), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1). Two patients developed encephalitis following immune checkpoint inhibitor cancer therapy (atezolizumab [1], pembrolizumab [1]). All treated patients (4) demonstrated an initial response to immunotherapy (corticosteroids [4], IVIG [2]), though 3 died from cancer.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CAMKV-IgG is a biomarker of immunotherapy-responsive paraneoplastic encephalitis with temporal and extratemporal features and uterine cancer as a prominent oncologic association. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

     alt="Folding of the cerebellar cortex is clade-specific in form but universal in degree"/>
<p>York et al. show that the folding of the cerebellar cortex, likethe cerebral cortex, has recognizable, clade-specific spatial patterns acrossclades, but scales universally in degree depending on its combination ofsurface area and thickness, as predicted from the physics of an expanding,self-avoiding surface. Folding therefore is a physical property of both braincortices, and not an “evolved biological feature”.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Like the cerebralcortex, the surface of the cerebellum is repeatedly folded. Unlike the cerebralcortex, however, cerebellar folds are much thinner and more numerous; repeatthemselves largely along a single direction, forming accordion-like folds transverseto the mid-sagittal plane; and occur in all but the smallest cerebella. We haveshown previously that while the location of folds in mammalian cerebral cortex isclade-specific, the overall degree of folding strictly follows a universalpower law relating cortical thickness and the exposed and total surface areas predictedfrom the minimization of the effective free energy of an expanding, self-avoidingsurface of a certain thickness. Here we show that this scaling law extends tothe folding of the mid-sagittal sections of the cerebellum of 53 speciesbelonging to six mammalian clades. Simultaneously, we show that each clade hasa previously unsuspected distinctive spatial pattern of folding evident at themid-sagittal surface of the cerebellum. We note, however, that the mammaliancerebellum folds as a multi-fractal object, because of the difference betweenthe outside-in development of the cerebellar cortex around a preexisting coreof already connected white matter, compared to the inside-out development ofthe cerebral cortex with a white matter volume that develops as the cerebralcortex itself gains neurons. We conclude that repeated folding, one of the mostrecognizable features of biology, can arise simply from the interplay betweenthe universal applicability of the physics of self-organization and biological,phylogenetical clade-specific contingency, without the need for invokingselective pressures in evolution.</p>

                Urine microscopy for detecting pus cells is a common investigation ordered in hospitalized general medical patients as part of routine care. A few previous studies have shown that sterile pyuria is not uncommon in this population. We studied the prevalence of pyuria among patients hospitalized with non-urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis in the medical wards. We excluded patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Pyuria was quantified in uncentrifuged urine using the chamber counting method, and ≥ 10 pus cells per mm3 was considered significant. We also compared this method with the commonly used but less accurate method of counting pus cells/high power field using centrifuged urine (routine method). We studied 196 patients; 113 (57.7%) were males. Most (175[89.3%]) patients were hospitalized for an infection. We found that 18.4% of the study group had sterile pyuria, and it was strongly associated with the presence of concomitant microscopic hematuria (unadjusted odds ratio, 3.74 [1.65 to 8.50]; P=0.002). We found no association of pyuria with female gender, diabetes, acute kidney injury, or current antibiotic use. By routine method, 56 (28.6 %) patients had significant pyuria. In comparison to the chamber counting method, the routine method was 69.4(63—75.8) % sensitive and 80.6(75.1—86.2) % specific. The positive and negative predictive values were 44.6 (37.7— 51.6) % and 92.1 (88.4 — 95.9) %. We concluded that sterile pyuria and microscopic hematuria could be present in a proportion of hospitalized general medical patients without UTI or ASB. Clinical judgment is essential in interpreting the significance of abnormal urinalysis reports.

                Background The Elekta Apex micro-multileaf collimator (mMLC) for planning stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) provides excellent dose distribution; however, it offers disadvantages such as prolonged treatment duration and technical errors in terms of mMLC and gantry calibration, which adds to the total treatment duration. Hence, we aimed to compare the treatment planning performed with the 2.5 mm Apex mMLC and 5 mm MLC (Elekta Agility) for brain and lung targets treated with SRS and SBRT in Elekta Versa high definition (HD). Methods The study included 10 patients, five each with brain and lung targets. Two treatment plans were performed for each case using Elekta’s Monaco (5.11.03) treatment planning system (TPS) with 2.5 mm and 5 mm MLC. An X-ray photon beam of energy 6FFF was used for planning purposes with various gantry, couch, and collimator combinations. These two plans were compared using target coverage (TC), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), and organ at risk (OAR) doses. Results No significant differences were found in the target coverage, CI, HI, or OAR doses in either MLC design. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with a 5 mm MLC provided equivalent tumor coverage with an additional number of monitor units. OAR doses were comparable in both MLC widths for brain targets, whereas for lung targets, OAR doses were slightly lower with 2.5 mm mMLC. GI was superior in the 2.5 mm mMLC compared to the 5 mm MLC giving a steep falloff in the dose distributions (p = 0.158). Conclusions The TC, CI, HI, and OAR doses were similar in both 2.5 and 5 mm based VMAT plans. The gradient index was better in the 2.5 mm mMLC resulting in steep dose gradients, which further reduced the isodose volumes. Therefore, a 5 mm MLC (agility) can also be used for SRS/SBRT treatment planning, with a further reduction in the gradient index. However, the study must be extended further with more samples and multiple comparison parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-289/v1?src=rss">A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Timing of Vasopressor Therapy in Patients with Septic Shock: Assessing Clinical Outcomes and Implication [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Septic shock, is associated with a high mortality rate and increased expenses. Currently, the first-line therapy for septic shock entails administering resuscitation fluids followed by infusing vasopressors when the blood pressure goal is not achieved. The recommended first-line vasopressor is norepinephrine, followed by vasopressin, epinephrine, angiotensin II, and dopamine. There is still a controversy on when each vasopressor should be administered. Therefore, we conducted this review to determine the impact and implications of vasopressor timing in septic shock patients. Methods PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were comprehensively searched for potential studies until October 2023. The methodological quality and bias assessment of valid records was examined with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane’s risk of bias tool. Additionally, all the meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager software. Results Twelve articles were eligible for review and analysis. Pooled analyses of data from 7 of these studies demonstrated lower incidence of mortality and shorter duration to achieve target mean arterial pressure in the early vs. late epinephrine groups (OR:0.44; 95%CI: 0.35–0.55; p<0.00001 and MD:-1.17; 95%CI:-2.00– -0.34; p=0.0006). However, the length of ICU stay didn’t differ between the early and late norepinephrine group (MD:0.55; 95%CI: -0.52–1.62; p=0.31). The subgroup analyses show that early vasopressin is associated with a decreased mortality than late administration (OR:0.60; 95%CI:0.41–0.90; p=0.01). Similarly, the pooled analysis has shown that early concomitant administration of vasopressin and norepinephrine is associated with a shorter duration to achieve target MAP than norepinephrine alone (MD:-3.15; 95%CI:-4.40– -1.90;p<0.00001). Conclusion Early administration of norepinephrine has a mortality benefit and improves the duration taken to attain and sustain the goal MAP. Furthermore, early vasopressin possesses the potential to lower the fatality rate in individuals experiencing septic shock. However, further research is required to validate this finding.

                Abstract* In 2020, the Government of Japan declared 2050 “carbon neutral” and launched a long-term strategy to create a “virtuous cycle of economy and environment.” Japanese corporations possess many technologies that contribute to decarbonization, which is important for expanding investments in green transformation technology inventory (GXTI) development. Patent data are the most reliable measure of business performance for applied research and development activities when investigating knowledge domains or technological evolution. Our paper describes a Japanese patent dataset of Japanese corporations’ green transformation (GX) patent applications on the Japan Platform for Patent Information, using a search method of bombinating International Patent Classification (IPC) codes and keywords. The dataset contains 37,476 GX patent applications from 298 corporations during the period 1999–2022.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Brain activity may manifest itself as oscillations which are repetitive rhythms of neuronal firing. These local field potentials can be measured via intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). This review focuses on iEEG used to map human brain structures involved in olfaction. After presenting the methodology of the review, a summary of the brain structures involved in olfaction is given, followed by a review of the literature on human olfactory oscillations in different contexts. A single case is provided as an illustration of the olfactory oscillations. Overall, the timing and sequence of oscillations found in the different structures of the olfactory system seem to play an important role for olfactory perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88463">Tools and methods for high-throughput single-cell imaging with the mother machine</a></h4>

              
                Despite much progress, image processing remains a significant bottleneck for high-throughput analysis of microscopy data. One popular platform for single-cell time-lapse imaging is the mother machine, which enables long-term tracking of microbial cells under precisely controlled growth conditions. While several mother machine image analysis pipelines have been developed in the past several years, adoption by a non-expert audience remains a challenge. To fill this gap, we implemented our own software, MM3, as a plugin for the multidimensional image viewer napari. napari-MM3 is a complete and modular image analysis pipeline for mother machine data, which takes advantage of the high-level interactivity of napari. Here, we give an overview of napari-MM3 and test it against several well-designed and widely used image analysis pipelines, including BACMMAN and DeLTA. Researchers often analyze mother machine data with custom scripts using varied image analysis methods, but a quantitative comparison of the output of different pipelines has been lacking. To this end, we show that key single-cell physiological parameter correlations and distributions are robust to the choice of analysis method. However, we also find that small changes in thresholding parameters can systematically alter parameters extracted from single-cell imaging experiments. Moreover, we explicitly show that in deep learning-based segmentation, ‘what you put is what you get’ (WYPIWYG) – that is, pixel-level variation in training data for cell segmentation can propagate to the model output and bias spatial and temporal measurements. Finally, while the primary purpose of this work is to introduce the image analysis software that we have developed over the last decade in our lab, we also provide information for those who want to implement mother machine-based high-throughput imaging and analysis methods in their research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93272">Lesions in a songbird vocal circuit increase variability in song syntax</a></h4>

              
                Complex skills like speech and dance are composed of ordered sequences of simpler elements, but the neuronal basis for the syntactic ordering of actions is poorly understood. Birdsong is a learned vocal behavior composed of syntactically ordered syllables, controlled in part by the songbird premotor nucleus HVC (proper name). Here, we test whether one of HVC’s recurrent inputs, mMAN (medial magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium), contributes to sequencing in adult male Bengalese finches (<i>Lonchura striata domestica</i>). Bengalese finch song includes several patterns: (1) <i>chunks,</i> comprising stereotyped syllable sequences; (2) <i>branch points</i>, where a given syllable can be followed probabilistically by multiple syllables; and (3) <i>repeat phrases</i>, where individual syllables are repeated variable numbers of times. We found that following bilateral lesions of mMAN, acoustic structure of syllables remained largely intact, but sequencing became more variable, as evidenced by ‘breaks’ in previously stereotyped chunks, increased uncertainty at branch points, and increased variability in repeat numbers. Our results show that mMAN contributes to the variable sequencing of vocal elements in Bengalese finch song and demonstrate the influence of recurrent projections to HVC. Furthermore, they highlight the utility of species with complex syntax in investigating neuronal control of ordered sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87602">Somatotopic organization among parallel sensory pathways that promote a grooming sequence in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensory neurons located across the body surface respond to tactile stimuli and elicit diverse behavioral responses, from relatively simple stimulus location-aimed movements to complex movement sequences. How mechanosensory neurons and their postsynaptic circuits influence such diverse behaviors remains unclear. We previously discovered that <i>Drosophila</i> perform a body location-prioritized grooming sequence when mechanosensory neurons at different locations on the head and body are simultaneously stimulated by dust (Hampel et al., 2017; Seeds et al., 2014). Here, we identify nearly all mechanosensory neurons on the <i>Drosophila</i> head that individually elicit aimed grooming of specific head locations, while collectively eliciting a whole head grooming sequence. Different tracing methods were used to reconstruct the projections of these neurons from different locations on the head to their distinct arborizations in the brain. This provides the first synaptic resolution somatotopic map of a head, and defines the parallel-projecting mechanosensory pathways that elicit head grooming.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91037">Transposable elements regulate thymus development and function</a></h4>

              
                Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive sequences representing ~45% of the human and mouse genomes and are highly expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). In this study, we investigated the role of TEs on T-cell development in the thymus. We performed multiomic analyses of TEs in human and mouse thymic cells to elucidate their role in T-cell development. We report that TE expression in the human thymus is high and shows extensive age- and cell lineage-related variations. TE expression correlates with multiple transcription factors in all cell types of the human thymus. Two cell types express particularly broad TE repertoires: mTECs and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). In mTECs, transcriptomic data suggest that TEs interact with transcription factors essential for mTEC development and function (e.g., PAX1 and REL), and immunopeptidomic data showed that TEs generate MHC-I-associated peptides implicated in thymocyte education. Notably, AIRE, FEZF2, and CHD4 regulate small yet non-redundant sets of TEs in murine mTECs. Human thymic pDCs homogenously express large numbers of TEs that likely form dsRNA, which can activate innate immune receptors, potentially explaining why thymic pDCs constitutively secrete IFN ɑ/β. This study highlights the diversity of interactions between TEs and the adaptive immune system. TEs are genetic parasites, and the two thymic cell types most affected by TEs (mTEcs and pDCs) are essential to establishing central T-cell tolerance. Therefore, we propose that orchestrating TE expression in thymic cells is critical to prevent autoimmunity in vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91864">Inhibition of the serine protease HtrA1 by SerpinE2 suggests an extracellular proteolytic pathway in the control of neural crest migration</a></h4>

              
                We previously showed that SerpinE2 and the serine protease HtrA1 modulate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in germ layer specification and head-to-tail development of <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Here, we present an extracellular proteolytic mechanism involving this serpin-protease system in the developing neural crest (NC). Knockdown of SerpinE2 by injected antisense morpholino oligonucleotides did not affect the specification of NC progenitors but instead inhibited the migration of NC cells, causing defects in dorsal fin, melanocyte, and craniofacial cartilage formation. Similarly, overexpression of the HtrA1 protease impaired NC cell migration and the formation of NC-derived structures. The phenotype of SerpinE2 knockdown was overcome by concomitant downregulation of HtrA1, indicating that SerpinE2 stimulates NC migration by inhibiting endogenous HtrA1 activity. SerpinE2 binds to HtrA1, and the HtrA1 protease triggers degradation of the cell surface proteoglycan Syndecan-4 (Sdc4). Microinjection of <i>Sdc4</i> mRNA partially rescued NC migration defects induced by both HtrA1 upregulation and SerpinE2 downregulation. These epistatic experiments suggest a proteolytic pathway by a double inhibition mechanism:

                Cortical folding is an important feature of primate brains that plays a crucial role in various cognitive and behavioral processes. Extensive research has revealed both similarities and differences in folding morphology and brain function among primates including macaque and human. The folding morphology is the basis of brain function, making cross-species studies on folding morphology important for understanding brain function and species evolution. However, prior studies on cross-species folding morphology mainly focused on partial regions of the cortex instead of the entire brain. Previously, our research defined a whole-brain landmark based on folding morphology: the gyral peak. It was found to exist stably across individuals and ages in both human and macaque brains. Shared and unique gyral peaks in human and macaque are identified in this study, and their similarities and differences in spatial distribution, anatomical morphology, and functional connectivity were also dicussed.

This study recruited 80 glioma patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype and high vascular endothelial growth factor expression levels, and 102 patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and low vascular endothelial growth factor expression levels. Virtual brain grafting, combined with Freesurfer, was used to compute morphologic features including cortical thickness, LGI, and subcortical volume in glioma patient. Radiomics features were extracted from multiregional tumor. Pycaret was used to construct the machine learning pipeline. Among the radiomics models, the whole tumor model achieved the best performance (accuracy 0.80, Area Under the Curve 0.86), while, after incorporating whole brain morphologic features, the model had a superior predictive performance (accuracy 0.82, Area Under the Curve 0.88). The features contributed most in predicting model including the right caudate volume, left middle temporal cortical thickness, first-order statistics, shape, and gray-level cooccurrence matrix. Pycaret, based on morphologic features, combined with radiomics, yielded highest accuracy in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and vascular endothelial growth factor levels, indicating that morphologic abnormalities induced by glioma were associated with tumor biology.</span>

Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded using electroencephalography. One early-, two mid-, and two late-latency neurophysiological components were identified for both fingers: P50, P1, N125, P200, and N250. D1 and D5 showed different cortical activation patterns: compared with baseline, the crossing condition showed significant clustering at P1 for D1, and at P50 and N125 for D5; the change in posture showed a significant cluster at N125 for D5. Clusters predominated at centro-parietal electrodes.

	<p>The present meta-analysis summarizes brain activation for social cognition and emotion-processing tasks in borderline personality disorder (BPD). We carried out two meta-analyses to elaborate on commonalities and potential differences between the two types of tasks. In the first meta-analysis, we implemented a more liberal strategy for task selection (including social and emotional content). The results confirmed previously reported hyperactivations in patients with BPD in the bilateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex and hypoactivations in bilateral inferior frontal gyri. When applying a stricter approach to task selection, focusing narrowly on social cognition tasks, we only found activation in prefrontal areas, particularly in the anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We review the role of these areas in social cognition in healthy adults, suggesting that the observed BPD hyperactivations may reflect an overreliance on self-related thought in social cognition.</p>

	<p>Racial and socioeconomic health disparities are well documented in the literature. This study examined patient demographics, including socioeconomic status (SES), among individuals presenting with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) to identify factors associated with aSAH presentation. A retrospective assessment was conducted of all patients with aSAH and UIA who presented to a large-volume cerebrovascular center and underwent microsurgical treatment from January 2014 through July 2019. Race and ethnicity, insurance type, and SES data were collected for each patient. Comparative analysis of the aSAH and UIA groups was conducted. Logistic regression models were also employed to predict the likelihood of aSAH presentation based on demographic and socioeconomic factors. A total of 640 patients were included (aSAH group, 251; UIA group, 389). Significant associations were observed between race and ethnicity, SES, insurance type, and aneurysm rupture. Non-White race or ethnicity, lower SES, and having public or no insurance were associated with increased odds of aSAH presentation. The aSAH group had poorer functional outcomes and higher mortality rates than the UIA group. Patients who are non-White, have low SES, and have public or no insurance were disproportionately affected by aSAH, which is historically associated with poorer functional outcomes.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To study sociodemographic and clinical variables, including psychiatric co-morbidities, in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Methods: A total of 158 patients attending a medical gastroenterology clinic in a tertiary care center in Northern India were screened, from whom 100 were selected for the study. Rome IV criteria were used to diagnose IBS, and the severity of symptoms was assessed by the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS). Psychiatric co-morbidities were screened via clinical evaluation, and if present, a diagnosis was made as per DSM-5. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8) were used to assess depression, anxiety, stress, and somatic symptoms. Result: The mean age of cases was 35.6 years&amp;amp;rsquo; old, and the majority of cases (i.e., 38.0%) were between 18 and 29 years&amp;amp;rsquo; old. Males comprised 62.0% of the sample and females 38.0%. Moderate IBS was present in 61.0% of the cases. Evaluation via DASS-21 revealed that 53.0% were in the moderate category of depression, 43.0% had moderate anxiety, and 36.0% had moderate stress. The somatic symptom scale revealed that 48.0% patients were in the high category. Psychiatric co-morbidities were present in 29.0% of cases. Depressive disorders were the most common psychiatric co-morbidity. Conclusions: Patients with IBS presenting to a tertiary care center in Northern India were primarily young males living in semi-urban areas who belonged to the Hindu religion, were married, and had a nuclear family. Patients with IBS commonly have associated psychiatric disorders; anxiety disorders and depression are most common.</p>

	<p>Decades of research has revealed a relationship between childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and brain development at the structural and functional levels. Of particular note is the distinction between income and maternal education, two highly correlated factors which seem to influence brain development through distinct pathways. Specifically, while a families&amp;amp;rsquo; income-to-needs ratio is linked with physiological stress and household chaos, caregiver education influences the day-to-day language environment a child is exposed to. Variability in either one of these environmental experiences is related to subsequent brain development. While this work has the potential to inform public policies in a way that benefits children, it can also oversimplify complex factors, unjustly blame low-SES parents, and perpetuate a harmful deficit perspective. To counteract these shortcomings, researchers must consider sociodemographic differences in the broader cultural context that underlie SES-based differences in brain development. This review aims to address these issues by (a) identifying how sociodemographic mechanisms associated with SES influence the day-to-day experiences of children, in turn, impacting brain development, while (b) considering the broader cultural contexts that may differentially impact this relationship.</p>

                <p>Perception is an intricate interplay between feedforward visual input and internally generated feedback signals that comprise concurrent contextual and time-distant mnemonic (episodic and semantic) information. Yet, an unresolved question is how the composition of feedback signals changes across the lifespan and to what extent feedback signals undergo age-related dedifferentiation, that is, a decline in neural specificity. Previous research on this topic has focused on feedforward perceptual representation and episodic memory reinstatement, suggesting reduced fidelity of neural representations at the item and category levels. In this fMRI study, we combined an occlusion paradigm that filters feedforward input to the visual cortex and multivariate analysis techniques to investigate the information content in cortical feedback, focusing on age-related differences in its composition. We further asked to what extent differentiation in feedback signals (in the occluded region) is correlated to differentiation in feedforward signals. Comparing younger (18&ndash;30 years) and older female and male adults (65&ndash;75 years), we found that contextual but not mnemonic feedback was prone to age-related dedifferentiation. Semantic feedback signals were even better differentiated in older adults, highlighting the growing importance of generalized knowledge across ages. We also found that differentiation in feedforward signals was correlated with differentiation in episodic but not semantic feedback signals. Our results provide evidence for age-related adjustments in the composition of feedback signals and underscore the importance of examining dedifferentiation in aging for both feedforward and feedback processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/16/e0617232024?rss=1">Intracerebral Dynamics of Sleep Arousals: A Combined Scalp-Intracranial EEG Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>As an intrinsic component of sleep architecture, sleep arousals represent an intermediate state between sleep and wakefulness and are important for sleep&ndash;wake regulation. They are defined in an all-or-none manner, whereas they actually present a wide range of scalp-electroencephalography (EEG) activity patterns. It is poorly understood how these arousals differ in their mechanisms. Stereo-EEG (SEEG) provides the unique opportunity to record intracranial activities in superficial and deep structures in humans. Using combined polysomnography and SEEG, we quantitatively categorized arousals during nonrapid eye movement sleep into slow wave (SW) and non-SW arousals based on whether they co-occurred with a scalp-EEG SW event. We then investigated their intracranial correlates in up to 26 brain regions from 26 patients (12 females). Across both arousal types, intracranial theta, alpha, sigma, and beta activities increased in up to 25 regions (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05; <I>d</I> = 0.06&ndash;0.63), while gamma and high-frequency (HF) activities decreased in up to 18 regions across the five brain lobes (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05; <I>d</I> = 0.06&ndash;0.44). Intracranial delta power widely increased across five lobes during SW arousals (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05 in 22 regions; <I>d</I> = 0.10&ndash;0.39), while it widely decreased during non-SW arousals (<I>p</I>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05 in 19 regions; <I>d</I> = 0.10&ndash;0.30). Despite these main patterns, unique activities were observed locally in some regions such as the hippocampus and middle cingulate cortex, indicating spatial heterogeneity of arousal responses. Our results suggest that non-SW arousals correspond to a higher level of brain activation than SW arousals. The decrease in HF activities could potentially explain the absence of awareness and recollection during arousals.</p>

                <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of electroencephalographic endophenotypes for alcohol use disorder (AUD) has identified noncoding polymorphisms within the <I>KCNJ6</I> gene. <I>KCNJ6</I> encodes GIRK2, a subunit of a G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel that regulates neuronal excitability. We studied the effect of upregulating <I>KCNJ6</I> using an isogenic approach with human glutamatergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (male and female donors). Using multielectrode arrays, population calcium imaging, single-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, and mitochondrial stress tests, we find that elevated GIRK2 acts in concert with 7&ndash;21&nbsp;d of ethanol exposure to inhibit neuronal activity, to counteract ethanol-induced increases in glutamate response, and to promote an increase intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, elevated GIRK2 prevented ethanol-induced changes in basal and activity-dependent mitochondrial respiration. These data support a role for GIRK2 in mitigating the effects of ethanol and a previously unknown connection to mitochondrial function in human glutamatergic neurons.</p>

                <p>Pure-tone audiograms often poorly predict elderly humans&rsquo; ability to communicate in everyday complex acoustic scenes. Binaural processing is crucial for discriminating sound sources in such complex acoustic scenes. The compromised perception of communication signals presented above hearing threshold has been linked to both peripheral and central age-related changes in the auditory system. Investigating young and old Mongolian gerbils of both sexes, an established model for human hearing, we demonstrate age-related supra-threshold deficits in binaural hearing using behavioral, electrophysiological, anatomical, and imaging methods. Binaural processing ability was measured as the binaural masking level difference (BMLD), an established measure in human psychophysics. We tested gerbils behaviorally with "virtual headphones," recorded single-unit responses in the auditory midbrain and evaluated gross midbrain and cortical responses using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Furthermore, we obtained additional measures of auditory function based on auditory brainstem responses, auditory-nerve synapse counts, and evidence for central inhibitory processing revealed by PET. BMLD deteriorates already in middle-aged animals having normal audiometric thresholds and is even worse in old animals with hearing loss. The magnitude of auditory brainstem response measures related to auditory-nerve function and binaural processing in the auditory brainstem also deteriorate. Furthermore, central GABAergic inhibition is affected by age. Because the number of synapses in the apical turn of the inner ear was not reduced in middle-aged animals, we conclude that peripheral synaptopathy contributes little to binaural processing deficits. Exploratory analyses suggest increased hearing thresholds, altered binaural processing in the brainstem and changed central GABAergic inhibition as potential contributors.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are highly comorbid, and patients with chronic pain are more likely to meet the criteria for AUD. Evidence suggests that both conditions alter similar brain pathways, yet this relationship remains poorly understood. Prior work shows that the anterior insular cortex (AIC) is involved in both chronic pain and AUD. However, circuit-specific changes elicited by the combination of pain and alcohol use remain understudied. The goal of this work was to elucidate the converging effects of binge alcohol consumption and chronic pain on AIC neurons that send projections to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Here, we used the Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) paradigm to model binge-like alcohol drinking in mice that underwent spared nerve injury (SNI), after which whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed in acute brain slices to measure intrinsic and synaptic properties of AIC-&gt;DLS neurons. In male, but not female, mice, we found that SNI mice with no prior alcohol exposure consumed less alcohol compared with sham mice. Electrophysiological analyses showed that AIC-&gt;DLS neurons from SNI&ndash;alcohol male mice displayed increased neuronal excitability and increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. However, mice exposed to alcohol prior to SNI consumed similar amounts of alcohol compared with sham mice following SNI. Together, our data suggest that the interaction of chronic pain and alcohol drinking have a direct effect on both intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission onto AIC-&gt;DLS neurons in mice, which may be critical in understanding how chronic pain alters motivated behaviors associated with alcohol.</p>

                <p>Categorization is an essential cognitive and perceptual process, which happens spontaneously. However, earlier research often neglected the spontaneous nature of this process by mainly adopting explicit tasks in behavioral or neuroimaging paradigms. Here, we use frequency-tagging (FT) during electroencephalography (EEG) in 22 healthy human participants (both male and female) as a direct approach to pinpoint spontaneous visual categorical processing. Starting from schematic natural visual stimuli, we created morph sequences comprising 11 equal steps. Mirroring a behavioral categorical perception discrimination paradigm, we administered a FT-EEG oddball paradigm, assessing neural sensitivity for equally sized differences within and between stimulus categories. Likewise, mirroring a behavioral category classification paradigm, we administered a sweep FT-EEG oddball paradigm, sweeping from one end of the morph sequence to the other, thereby allowing us to objectively pinpoint the neural category boundary. We found that FT-EEG can implicitly measure categorical processing and discrimination. More specifically, we could derive an objective neural index of the required level to differentiate between the two categories, and this neural index showed the typical marker of categorical perception (i.e., stronger discrimination across as compared with within categories). The neural findings of the implicit paradigms were also validated using an explicit behavioral task. These results provide evidence that FT-EEG can be used as an objective tool to measure discrimination and categorization and that the human brain inherently and spontaneously (without any conscious or decisional processes) uses higher-level meaningful categorization information to interpret ambiguous (morph) shapes.</p>

                <p>Photoreceptors are electrically coupled to one another, and the spatiotemporal properties of electrical synapses in a two-dimensional retinal network are still not well studied, because of the limitation of the single electrode or pair recording techniques which do not allow simultaneously measuring responses of multiple photoreceptors at various locations in the retina. A multiple electrode recording system is needed. In this study, we investigate the network properties of the two-dimensional rod coupled array of the salamander retina (both sexes were used) by using the newly available multiple patch electrode system that allows simultaneous recordings from up to eight cells and to determine the electrical connectivity among multiple rods. We found direct evidence that voltage signal spread in the rod&ndash;rod coupling network in the absence of <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> (mediated by HCN channels) is passive and follows the linear cable equation. Under physiological conditions, <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> shapes the network signal by progressively shortening the response time-to-peak of distant rods, compensating the time loss of signal traveling from distant rods to bipolar cell somas and facilitating synchronization of rod output signals. Under voltage-clamp conditions, current flow within the coupled rods follows Ohm&rsquo;s law, supporting the idea that nonlinear behaviors of the rod network are dependent on membrane voltage. Rod&ndash;rod coupling is largely symmetrical in the 2D array, and voltage-clamp blocking the next neighboring rod largely suppresses rod signal spread into the second neighboring rod, suggesting that indirect coupling pathways play a minor role in rod&ndash;rod coupling.</p>

                <p>Peripheral sensory neurons are a critical part of the nervous system that transmit a multitude of sensory stimuli to the central nervous system. During larval and juvenile stages in zebrafish, this function is mediated by Rohon&ndash;Beard somatosensory neurons (RBs). RBs are optically accessible and amenable to experimental manipulation, making them a powerful system for mechanistic investigation of sensory neurons. Previous studies provided evidence that RBs fall into multiple subclasses; however, the number and molecular makeup of these potential RB subtypes have not been well defined. Using a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach, we demonstrate that larval RBs in zebrafish fall into three, largely nonoverlapping classes of neurons. We also show that RBs are molecularly distinct from trigeminal neurons in zebrafish. Cross-species transcriptional analysis indicates that one RB subclass is similar to a mammalian group of A-fiber sensory neurons. Another RB subclass is predicted to sense multiple modalities, including mechanical stimulation and chemical irritants. We leveraged our scRNA-seq data to determine that the fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) pathway is active in RBs. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of this pathway led to defects in axon maintenance and RB cell death. Moreover, this can be phenocopied by treatment with dovitinib, an FDA-approved Fgf inhibitor with a common side effect of peripheral neuropathy. Importantly, dovitinib-mediated axon loss can be suppressed by loss of Sarm1, a positive regulator of neuronal cell death and axonal injury. This offers a molecular target for future clinical intervention to fight neurotoxic effects of this drug.</p>

                <p>Technical advances in artificial manipulation of neural activity have precipitated a surge in studying the causal contribution of brain circuits to cognition and behavior. However, complexities of neural circuits challenge interpretation of experimental results, necessitating new theoretical frameworks for reasoning about causal effects. Here, we take a step in this direction, through the lens of recurrent neural networks trained to perform perceptual decisions. We show that understanding the dynamical system structure that underlies network solutions provides a precise account for the magnitude of behavioral effects due to perturbations. Our framework explains past empirical observations by clarifying the most sensitive features of behavior, and how complex circuits compensate and adapt to perturbations. In the process, we also identify strategies that can improve the interpretability of inactivation experiments.</p>

                <p>Recent work suggests that indentations of the cerebral cortex, or sulci, may be uniquely vulnerable to atrophy in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that the posteromedial cortex (PMC) is particularly vulnerable to atrophy and pathology accumulation. However, these studies did not consider small, shallow, and variable tertiary sulci that are located in association cortices and are often associated with human-specific aspects of cognition. Here, we manually defined 4,362 PMC sulci in 432 hemispheres in 216 human participants (50.5% female) and found that these smaller putative tertiary sulci showed more age- and AD-related thinning than larger, more consistent sulci, with the strongest effects for two newly uncovered sulci. A model-based approach relating sulcal morphology to cognition identified that a subset of these sulci was most associated with memory and executive function scores in older adults. These findings lend support to the retrogenesis hypothesis linking brain development and aging and provide new neuroanatomical targets for future studies of aging and AD.</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive motor neuron degeneration and muscle denervation. A recent transcriptomic study integrating a wide range of human ALS samples revealed that the upregulation of p53, a downstream target of inflammatory stress, is commonly detected in familial and sporadic ALS cases by a mechanism linked to a transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) dysfunction. In this study, we show that prolonged interferon-gamma (IFN) treatment of human induced pluripotent stem cell&ndash;derived spinal motor neurons results in a severe cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43. TDP-43 dysfunction resulting from either IFN exposure or an ALS-associated TDP-43 mutation was associated with the activation of the p53 pathway. This was accompanied by the hyperactivation of neuronal firing, followed by the complete loss of their electrophysiological function. Through a comparative single-cell transcriptome analysis, we have identified significant alterations in ALS-associated genes in motor neurons exposed to IFN, implicating their direct involvement in ALS pathology. Interestingly, IFN was found to induce significant levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in motor neurons without affecting the levels of any other immune checkpoint proteins. This finding suggests a potential role of excessive PD-L1 expression in ALS development, given that PD-L1 was recently reported to impair neuronal firing ability in mice. Our findings suggest that exposing motor neurons to IFN could directly derive ALS pathogenesis, even without the presence of the inherent genetic mutation or functional glia component. Furthermore, this study provides a comprehensive list of potential candidate genes for future immunotherapeutic targets with which to treat sporadic forms of ALS, which account for 90% of all reported cases.</p>

                <p>The subiculum (SUB), a hippocampal formation structure, is among the earliest brain regions impacted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Toward a better understanding of AD circuit-based mechanisms, we mapped synaptic circuit inputs to dorsal SUB using monosynaptic rabies tracing in the 5xFAD mouse model by quantitatively comparing the circuit connectivity of SUB excitatory neurons in age-matched controls and 5xFAD mice at different ages for both sexes. Input-mapped brain regions include the hippocampal subregions (CA1, CA2, CA3), medial septum and diagonal band, retrosplenial cortex, SUB, postsubiculum (postSUB), visual cortex, auditory cortex, somatosensory cortex, entorhinal cortex, thalamus, perirhinal cortex (Prh), ectorhinal cortex, and temporal association cortex. We find sex- and age-dependent changes in connectivity strengths and patterns of SUB presynaptic inputs from hippocampal subregions and other brain regions in 5xFAD mice compared with control mice. Significant sex differences for SUB inputs are found in 5xFAD mice for CA1, CA2, CA3, postSUB, Prh, lateral entorhinal cortex, and medial entorhinal cortex: all of these areas are critical for learning and memory. Notably, we find significant changes at different ages for visual cortical inputs to SUB. While the visual function is not ordinarily considered defective in AD, these specific connectivity changes reflect that altered visual circuitry contributes to learning and memory deficits. Our work provides new insights into SUB-directed neural circuit mechanisms during AD progression and supports the idea that neural circuit disruptions are a prominent feature of AD.</p>

                <p>Social experiences carry tremendous weight in our decision-making, even when social partners are not present. To determine mechanisms, we trained female mice to respond for two food reinforcers. Then, one food was paired with a novel conspecific. Mice later favored the conspecific-associated food, even in the absence of the conspecific. Chemogenetically silencing projections from the prelimbic subregion (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) obstructed this preference while leaving social discrimination intact, indicating that these projections are necessary for socially driven choice. Further, mice that performed the task had greater densities of dendritic spines on excitatory BLA neurons relative to mice that did not. We next induced chemogenetic receptors in cells active during social interactions&mdash;when mice were encoding information that impacted later behavior. BLA neurons stimulated by social experience were necessary for mice to later favor rewards associated with social conspecifics but not make other choices. This profile contrasted with that of PL neurons stimulated by social experience, which were necessary for choice behavior in social and nonsocial contexts alike. The PL may convey a generalized signal allowing mice to favor particular rewards, while units in the BLA process more specialized information, together supporting choice motivated by social information.</p>

                <p>The human medial temporal lobe (MTL) plays a crucial role in recognizing visual objects, a key cognitive function that relies on the formation of semantic representations. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how visual information of general objects is translated into semantic representations in the MTL. Furthermore, the debate about whether the human MTL is involved in perception has endured for a long time. To address these questions, we investigated three distinct models of neural object coding&mdash;semantic coding, axis-based feature coding, and region-based feature coding&mdash;in each subregion of the human MTL, using high-resolution fMRI in two male and six female participants. Our findings revealed the presence of semantic coding throughout the MTL, with a higher prevalence observed in the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC), while axis coding and region coding were primarily observed in the earlier regions of the MTL. Moreover, we demonstrated that voxels exhibiting axis coding supported the transition to region coding and contained information relevant to semantic coding. Together, by providing a detailed characterization of neural object coding schemes and offering a comprehensive summary of visual coding information for each MTL subregion, our results not only emphasize a clear role of the MTL in perceptual processing but also shed light on the translation of perception-driven representations of visual features into memory-driven representations of semantics along the MTL processing pathway.</p>

                <p>The accumulation of amyloid-<I>&beta;</I> (<I>A&beta;</I>) and hyperphosphorylated-tau (hp-tau) are two classical histopathological biomarkers in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). However, their detailed interactions with the electrophysiological changes at the meso- and macroscale are not yet fully understood. We developed a mechanistic multiscale model of AD progression, linking proteinopathy to its effects on neural activity and vice-versa. We integrated a heterodimer model of prion-like protein propagation and a brain network model of Jansen&ndash;Rit neural masses derived from human neuroimaging data whose parameters varied due to neurotoxicity. Results showed that changes in inhibition guided the electrophysiological alterations found in AD, and these changes were mainly attributed to <I>A&beta;</I> effects. Additionally, we found a causal disconnection between cellular hyperactivity and interregional hypersynchrony contrary to previous beliefs. Finally, we demonstrated that early <I>A&beta;</I> and hp-tau depositions&rsquo; location determine the spatiotemporal profile of the proteinopathy. The presented model combines the molecular effects of both <I>A&beta;</I> and hp-tau together with a mechanistic protein propagation model and network effects within a closed-loop model. This holds the potential to enlighten the interplay between AD mechanisms on various scales, aiming to develop and test novel hypotheses on the contribution of different AD-related variables to the disease evolution.</p>

                <p>In many real-life scenarios, our decisions could lead to multiple outcomes that conflict with value. Hence, an appropriate neural representation of the net experienced value of conflicting outcomes, which play a crucial role in guiding future decisions, is critical for adaptive behavior. As some recent functional neuroimaging work has primarily focused on the concurrent processing of monetary gains and aversive information, very little is known regarding the integration of conflicting value signals involving monetary losses and appetitive information in the human brain. To address this critical gap, we conducted a functional MRI study involving healthy human male participants to examine the nature of integrating positive emotion and monetary losses. We employed a novel experimental design where the valence (positive or neutral) of an emotional stimulus indicated the type of outcome (loss or no loss) in a choice task. Specifically, we probed two plausible integration patterns while processing conflicting value signals involving positive emotion and monetary losses: interactive versus additive. We found overlapping main effects of positive (vs neutral) emotion and loss (vs no loss) in multiple brain regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala, notably with a lack of evidence for interaction. Thus, our findings revealed the additive integration pattern of monetary loss and positive emotion outcomes, suggesting that the experienced value of the monetary loss was not modulated by the valence of the image signaling those outcomes. These findings contribute to our limited understanding of the nature of integrating conflicting outcomes in the healthy human brain with potential clinical relevance.</p>

                Background Salmonella enterica are bacteria that include more than 2,500 serovars. Most of these serovars have been linked to human foodborne illnesses, mainly related to poultry and pigs. Thus, these animals are considered the reservoirs of many Salmonella serovars and strains related to antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, serovars, β-lactam resistance genes, and the risk factors associated with Salmonella enterica in pork commercialized in open markets of Quito city. Methods For this, 165 pork meat samples were taken from municipal markets in three areas in the city. These samples were microbiologically processed following the ISO 6579-2014 standardized method. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was used to identify Salmonella serotyping and resistance genes. Strains not identified by PCR were typed by the Kauffman White Le Minor scheme. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with the presence of the microorganism. Results Salmonella prevalence in pork was 9.1%. Identified serovars were 4, [5], 12: i:- (53.3%), Infantis (33.3%), and Derby (13.4%). Furthermore, the β-lactam resistance genes bla CTX-M-65 could be identified in three S. infantis isolates. Multivariate analysis showed that temperature (above 8°C) and cutting surfaces (wood) presented significant association values. Conclusions In conclusion, pork in traditional markets of Quito is contaminated with Salmonella enterica, whose main serovars pose a public health concern, and shows beta-lactam resistance.

                Background Yeast strains that are tolerant to several environmental stresses are extensively employed to produce bioethanol from sugar-rich feedstock. Methods In our previous research findings, five wild indigenous strains of multi-stress tolerance yeast were isolated from traditional fermented alcoholic beverages (Tella, Tej, and Areke) in Ethiopia to the purpose of evaluate their potential use for bioethanol using sugarcane molasses as a substrate. Result The optimal parameters for maximum ethanol production were pH of 4.5, 25°Brix, 30°C, 4.0 g/l ammonium sulfate, supplement with yeast extract, and 72 h of incubation period. Under these optimum conditions, 13.13 ± 0.08% (v/v) ethanol was obtained. The yield of hydrous and anhydrous bioethanol from fermented molasses samples were produced at 94.20–95.60% (v/v) and 99.05–99.56% (v/v), respectively. Conclusion According to this finding, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT15F, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT18F, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate R9MU strains have been good candidates for production of industrial bioethanol.

However, it is unclear whether the effects of neutral and positive autobiographical memories differ. There is a need to confirm that genuinely neutral autobiographical memories can be retrieved without bias in response to a prompt to recall neutral memories. Methods In this pilot study, using “home” and “study” as cue words, we investigated whether participants were able to retrieve appropriate autobiographical memories when asked to recall a limited number of neutral or positive memories. Results Although participants were asked to recall neutral autobiographical memories, they tended to recall positive memories. Conclusions Our results support the concept of positive memory bias and suggest that future work should consider combining neutral and positive autobiographical memories, namely by asking participants to recall neutral–positive memories.

                <p>by Satyaki Roy, Shehzad Z. Sheikh, Terrence S. Furey</p>

Network inference is used to model transcriptional, signaling, and metabolic interactions among genes, proteins, and metabolites that identify biological pathways influencing disease pathogenesis. Advances in machine learning (ML)-based inference models exhibit the predictive capabilities of capturing latent patterns in genomic data. Such models are emerging as an alternative to the statistical models identifying causative factors driving complex diseases. We present CoVar, an ML-based framework that builds upon the properties of existing inference models, to find the central genes driving perturbed gene expression across biological states. Unlike differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that capture changes in individual gene expression across conditions, CoVar focuses on identifying <i>variational</i> genes that undergo changes in their expression network interaction profiles, providing insights into changes in the regulatory dynamics, such as in disease pathogenesis. Subsequently, it finds <i>core genes</i> from among the nearest neighbors of these variational genes, which are central to the variational activity and influence the coordinated regulatory processes underlying the observed changes in gene expression. Through the analysis of simulated as well as yeast expression data perturbed by the deletion of the mitochondrial genome, we show that CoVar captures the intrinsic variationality and modularity in the expression data, identifying key driver genes not found through existing differential analysis methodologies.

                <p>by Danica Despotović, Corentin Joffrois, Olivier Marre, Matthew Chalk</p>

The efficient coding hypothesis posits that early sensory neurons transmit maximal information about sensory stimuli, given internal constraints. A central prediction of this theory is that neurons should preferentially encode stimuli that are most surprising. Previous studies suggest this may be the case in early visual areas, where many neurons respond strongly to rare or surprising stimuli. For example, previous research showed that when presented with a rhythmic sequence of full-field flashes, many retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) respond strongly at the instance the flash sequence stops, and when another flash would be expected. This phenomenon is called the ‘omitted stimulus response’. However, it is not known whether the responses of these cells varies in a graded way depending on the level of stimulus surprise. To investigate this, we presented retinal neurons with extended sequences of stochastic flashes. With this stimulus, the surprise associated with a particular flash/silence, could be quantified analytically, and varied in a graded manner depending on the previous sequences of flashes and silences. Interestingly, we found that RGC responses could be well explained by a simple normative model, which described how they optimally combined their prior expectations and recent stimulus history, so as to encode surprise. Further, much of the diversity in RGC responses could be explained by the model, due to the different prior expectations that different neurons had about the stimulus statistics. These results suggest that even as early as the retina many cells encode surprise, relative to their own, internally generated expectations.

                <p>by Scott Boebinger, Aiden Payne, Giovanni Martino, Kennedy Kerr, Jasmine Mirdamadi, J. Lucas McKay, Michael Borich, Lena Ting</p>

The role of the cortex in shaping automatic whole-body motor behaviors such as walking and balance is poorly understood. Gait and balance are typically mediated through subcortical circuits, with the cortex becoming engaged as needed on an individual basis by task difficulty and complexity. However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how increased cortical contribution to whole-body movements shapes motor output. Here we use reactive balance recovery as a paradigm to identify relationships between hierarchical control mechanisms and their engagement across balance tasks of increasing difficulty in young adults. We hypothesize that parallel sensorimotor feedback loops engaging subcortical and cortical circuits contribute to balance-correcting muscle activity, and that the involvement of cortical circuits increases with balance challenge. We decomposed balance-correcting muscle activity based on hypothesized subcortically- and cortically-mediated feedback components driven by similar sensory information, but with different loop delays. The initial balance-correcting muscle activity was engaged at all levels of balance difficulty. Its onset latency was consistent with subcortical sensorimotor loops observed in the lower limb. An even later, presumed, cortically-mediated burst of muscle activity became additionally engaged as balance task difficulty increased, at latencies consistent with longer transcortical sensorimotor loops. We further demonstrate that evoked cortical activity in central midline areas measured using electroencephalography (EEG) can be explained by a similar sensory transformation as muscle activity but at a delay consistent with its role in a transcortical loop driving later cortical contributions to balance-correcting muscle activity. These results demonstrate that a neuromechanical model of muscle activity can be used to infer cortical contributions to muscle activity without recording brain activity. Our model may provide a useful framework for evaluating changes in cortical contributions to balance that are associated with falls in older adults and in neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.

                <p>by Gokul Gopinathan, Qian Xu, Xianghong Luan, Thomas G. H. Diekwisch</p>

The densely packed centromeric heterochromatin at minor and major satellites is comprised of H3K9me2/3 histones, the heterochromatin protein HP1α, and histone variants. In the present study, we sought to determine the mechanisms by which condensed heterochromatin at major and minor satellites stabilized by the chromatin factor CFDP1 affects the activity of the small GTPase Ran as a requirement for spindle formation. CFDP1 colocalized with heterochromatin at major and minor satellites and was essential for the structural stability of centromeric heterochromatin. Loss of CENPA, HP1α, and H2A.Z heterochromatin components resulted in decreased binding of the spindle nucleation facilitator RCC1 to minor and major satellite repeats. Decreased RanGTP levels as a result of diminished RCC1 binding interfered with chromatin-mediated microtubule nucleation at the onset of mitotic spindle formation. Rescuing chromatin H2A.Z levels in cells and mice lacking CFDP1 through knock-down of the histone chaperone ANP32E not only partially restored RCC1-dependent RanGTP levels but also alleviated CFDP1-knockout-related craniofacial defects and increased microtubule nucleation in CFDP1/ANP32E co-silenced cells. Together, these studies provide evidence for a direct link between condensed heterochromatin at major and minor satellites and microtubule nucleation through the chromatin protein CFDP1.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-284/v1?src=rss">Understanding rapid oral health deterioration and its associated factors among older adults: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Understanding the pivotal interplay between systemic and oral health is paramount to ensuring holistic care, particularly among the aging demographic. Therefore, this review article aims to explore the emerging concept of Rapid Oral Health Deterioration (ROHD) by reviewing the current knowledge base among older adults and identifying knowledge gaps in this area of research. Methods This scoping review was conducted in line with Arksey and O’Malley’s framework between December 2023 and March 2024 and reported while adhering to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic database search was performed across three databases i.e. PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE to collate the existing literature published in English between January 2013 and February 2024 addressing ROHD among older adults. After data charting, a critical appraisal of the selected studies was followed by qualitative thematic analysis. Results Among the 12 papers in this scoping review, 10 were cross-sectional studies, with one each of retrospective cohort and case-control studies. The qualitative thematic analysis of the selected articles resulted in the emergence of four main themes: risk factors for ROHD, attributes related to ROHD, challenges encountered in the management of ROHD, and management approaches for ROHD among older adults. Conclusions This scoping review provides an overview of the rapid deterioration of oral health among older adults. Age-related dental disease harms the quality of life and overall health. To avoid dental disorders and to maintain and improve oral health in older adults, an integrated and multidisciplinary approach is essential. If ROHD is not treated, it may lead to poor health, a lower quality of life, and in severe cases, systemic infections that increase hospitalizations and possibly cause death.

                Theranostics is a rapidly advancing field that is driving significant advancements in the healthcare industry by providing individualized medical solutions. Demand for theranostics is increasing over time and has led to the creation of theranostics-enabling high-tech technological centers. This review investigated the potential advantages and drawbacks of consolidating theranostics resources within technologically advanced facilities, particularly in developing nations, and led to three main observations: 1) The centralization of theranostics resources can lead to improved research, cost efficiency, and quality of healthcare services; 2) Developing countries may encounter hurdles such as resource allocation, infrastructure development, and skill acquisition, but these risks can be mitigated; 3) High-tech centers can play a major role in fostering innovation and advancing theranostics industry in these countries. In conclusion, this paper provides insights into the potential of high-tech centers as a pivotal point in the evolution of healthcare in developing countries. It calls for more funding support, in-depth research and collaborative efforts to overcome the challenges and harness the full potential of theranostics, as it has already occurred in some countries.

                Introduction Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2methods: manuel on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. Results 25patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods(p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age(>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. Conclusion TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.

<p>The human central amygdaloid nucleus is crucial for emotional processing and social behaviors and shows neurons with varied soma sizes, dendritic architecture, and spine density.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) has an ancient phylogenetic development and functions relevant for animal survival. Local cells receive intrinsic amygdaloidal information that codes emotional stimuli of fear, integrate them, and send cortical and subcortical output projections that prompt rapid visceral and social behavior responses. We aimed to describe the morphology of the neurons that compose the human CeA (<i>N</i> = 8 adult men). Cells within CeA coronal borders were identified using the thionine staining and were further analyzed using the “single-section” Golgi method followed by open-source software procedures for two-dimensional and three-dimensional image reconstructions. Our results evidenced varied neuronal cell body features, number and thickness of primary shafts, dendritic branching patterns, and density and shape of dendritic spines. Based on these criteria, we propose the existence of 12 morphologically different spiny neurons in the human CeA and discuss the variability in the dendritic architecture within cellular types, including likely interneurons. Some dendritic shafts were long and straight, displayed few collaterals, and had planar radiation within the coronal neuropil volume. Most of the sampled neurons showed a few to moderate density of small stubby/wide spines. Long spines (thin and mushroom) were observed occasionally. These novel data address the synaptic processing and plasticity in the human CeA. Our morphological description can be combined with further transcriptomic, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological/connectional approaches. It serves also to investigate how neurons are altered in neurological and psychiatric disorders with hindered emotional perception, in anxiety, following atrophy in schizophrenia, and along different stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-281/v1?src=rss">Osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of graphene oxide nano coated dental implants: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Osseointegration stands as a pivotal concept within the realm of dental implants, signifying the intricate process through which a dental implant integrates with the adjoining bone tissue. Graphene oxide (GO) has been shown to promote osseointegration, the process by which the implant fuses with the surrounding bone. The objective of this study was to assess the osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of GO nano coated dental implants. Methods A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) to identify relevant studies published. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that evaluated the effects of GO nano coating on osseointegrative and antimicrobial characteristics of dental implants. Studies not written in English and published before 2012 were excluded. Results The initial search yielded a total of 127 potential studies, of which six met the inclusion criteria and five were included in the review. These studies provided data on GO nano coated dental implants and their osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties. All the included studies showed moderate risk of bias. None of the studies provided information related to sample size calculation or sampling technique. Discussion The findings from the included studies demonstrated that GO nano coating had a positive impact on osseointegrative properties of dental implants. Enhanced bone-implant contact and increased bone density were observed in animals and humans receiving GO nano coated implants. Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of GO nano coating were found to inhibit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on the implant surface, reducing the risk of implant-associated infections. Conclusion The findings indicate that GO nano coating holds promise in enhancing the success rate and longevity of dental implants. However, more studies with larger sample sizes, are needed to further strengthen the evidence and determine the long-term effects of GO nano coated dental implants.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The New World suboscines (<i>Passeriformes</i> and Tyrannides) are one of the biggest endemic vertebrate radiations in South America, including the families Furnariidae and <i>Tyrannidae</i>. Avian brain morphology is a reliable proxy to study their evolution. The aim of this work is to elucidate whether the brains of these families reflect the ecological differences (e.g., feeding behavior) and to clarify macroevolutionary aspects of their neuroanatomy. Our hypotheses are as follows: Brain size is similar between both families and with other <i>Passeriformes</i>; brain morphology in Tyrannides is the result of the pressure of ecological factors; and brain disparity is low since they share ecological traits. Skulls of Furnariidae and <i>Tyrannidae</i> were micro-computed tomography–scanned, and three-dimensional models of the endocast were generated. Regression analyses were performed between brain volume and body mass. Linear and surface measurements were used to build phylomorphospaces and to calculate the amount of phylogenetic signal. <i>Tyrannidae</i> showed a larger brain disparity than Furnariidae, although it is not shaped by phylogeny in the Tyrannides. Furnariidae present enlarged Wulsts (eminentiae sagittales) but smaller optic lobes, while in <i>Tyrannidae</i>, it is the opposite. This could indicate that in Tyrannides there is a trade-off between the size of these two visual-related brain structures.</p>
