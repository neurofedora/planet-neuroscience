                Background - With the recent evolution of Financial Technology (FinTech), 11 peers to peer (P2P) lending platforms have been regulated by the Securities Commission in Malaysia since 2016. P2P lending platforms offer new investment opportunities to individual investors to earn higher rates on return than what traditional lenders usually provide. However, individual investors may face higher potential risks of default from their borrowers. Therefore, individual investors need to understand the potential exposure to such P2P lending platforms to make an effective investment decision. This study aims to explore the potential risk exposures that individual investors may experience at Malaysia's licensed P2P lending platforms.   Methods - Based on data collected manually from nine P2P lending platforms over five months, relationships between interest rates and various risk classifying factors such as credit rating, industry, business stage, loan purpose, and loan duration are examined.    Results- This study shows that loans with a similar credit rating and with or without similar loan purpose; and a business stage may offer investors significantly different interest rates. In addition, loans with shorter durations may provide investors with higher interest rates than those with longer durations. Finally, loans issued by companies from the same industry appeared to be charged with similar interest. These findings are valuable to investors to prepare themselves before making their investments at the P2P lending platforms.   Conclusion- With first hand-collected data, this study provides an original insight into Malaysia's current P2P lending platforms. Findings obtained for relationships between interest rates and risk classifying factors such as credit rating, industry, business stage, loan purpose and loan duration are valuable to investors of Malaysian P2P lending platforms.

     alt="Distribution and daily oscillation of GABA in the circadian system of the cockroach Rhyparobia maderae"/>
<p>GABA is a prominent neurotransmitter in the circadian system of the Madeira cockroach. The GABA-immunoreactive network overlaps with the arborizations of clock networks expressing pigment-dispersing factor. GABA levels show daily fluctuations with maximum concentrations during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day, suggesting a sleep promoting role.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter in nervous systems promoting sleep in both mammals and insects. In the Madeira cockroach, sleep-wake cycles are controlled by a circadian clock network in the brain's optic lobes, centered in the accessory medulla (AME) with its innervating pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) expressing clock neurons at the anterior-ventral rim of the medulla. GABA is present in cell clusters that innervate different circuits of the cockroach's AME clock, without colocalizing in PDF clock neurons. Physiological, immunohistochemical, and behavioral assays provided evidence for a role of GABA in light entrainment, possibly via the distal tract that connects the AME's glomeruli to the medulla. Furthermore, GABA was implemented in clock outputs to multiple effector systems in optic lobe and midbrain. Here, GABAergic brain circuits were analyzed further, focusing on the circadian system in search for sleep/wake controlling brain circuits. All GABA-immunoreactive neurons of the cockroach brain were also stained with an antiserum against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. We found strong overlap of the distribution of GABA-immunoreactive networks with PDF clock networks in optic lobes and midbrain. Neurons in five of the six soma groups that innervate the clock exhibited GABA immunoreactivity. The intensity of GABA immunoreactivity in the distal tract showed daily fluctuations with maximum staining intensity in the middle of the day and weakest staining at the end of the day. Quantification via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, likewise, showed higher GABA levels in the optic lobe during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day and lower levels during its activity phase at dusk. Our data further support the hypothesis that light- and PDF-dependently the circadian clock network of the cockroach controls GABA levels and thereby promotes sleep during the day.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Autism spectrum disorder in architecture perspective: a review of the literature and bibliometric assessment of research indexed in Web of Science [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The primary objective of this research paper was to explore the current state-of-the-art research on autism spectrum disorder from a designer's perspective. An increasing number of scholarly publications in this discipline have urged researcher interest in this topic; however, there is still a lack of quantitative analysis. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze global research output on autism spectrum disorder from a designer's perspective during 1992–2021. Methodology: A bibliometric method was employed to analyze the published literature from 1992–2021. 812 papers were downloaded from the Web of Science core collection for analysis focused on annual growth of literature, prolific authors, authorship pattern, productive organizations, countries, international collaboration, literature trends by keyword analysis, and identifying the funding agencies. Various bibliometrics and scientometrics software were used to analyze the data, namely Bibexcel, Biblioshiny, and VOS viewer. Results: There were 812 research papers published in 405 sources during 1992–2021. 2019 was noted as the most productive year (NP=101), and 2014 received the highest number of citations (TC=6634). Researchers preferred to publish as journal articles (NP=538; TC=24922). The University of Toronto, Canada, was identified as a productive institution with 42 publications and 5358 citations. The USA was the leading producing country with 433 publications, and most of the researchers publish their work in the journal "Scientific Reports" (NP=16). The word "autism" (NP=257) and "architecture" (NP=165) were the most frequently used keywords in autism research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evidence from simulation studies for selective constraints on the codon usage of the Angiosperm psbA gene</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Antonina Kalkus, Joy Barrett, Theyjasvi Ashok, Brian R. Morton</p>

The codon usage of the Angiosperm <i>psbA</i> gene is atypical for flowering plant chloroplast genes but similar to the codon usage observed in highly expressed plastid genes from some other Plantae, particularly Chlorobionta, lineages. The pattern of codon bias in these genes is suggestive of selection for a set of translationally optimal codons but the degree of bias towards these optimal codons is much weaker in the flowering plant <i>psbA</i> gene than in high expression plastid genes from lineages such as certain green algal groups. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. One is that the flowering plant <i>psbA</i> gene is currently under weak selective constraints for translation efficiency, the other is that there are no current selective constraints and we are observing the remnants of an ancestral codon adaptation that is decaying under mutational pressure. We test these two models using simulations studies that incorporate the context-dependent mutational properties of plant chloroplast DNA. We first reconstruct ancestral sequences and then simulate their evolution in the absence of selection on codon usage by using mutation dynamics estimated from intergenic regions. The results show that <i>psbA</i> has a significantly higher level of codon adaptation than expected while other chloroplast genes are within the range predicted by the simulations. These results suggest that there have been selective constraints on the codon usage of the flowering plant <i>psbA</i> gene during Angiosperm evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Assessing the drivers of syphilis among men who have sex with men in Switzerland reveals a key impact of screening frequency: A modelling study</a></h4>

Roth, Dunja Nicca, Matthias Cavassini, Manuel Battegay, Patrick Schmid, Enos Bernasconi, Huldrych F. Günthard, Andri Rauch, Roger D. Kouyos, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) </p>

Over the last decade, syphilis diagnoses among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) have strongly increased in Europe. Understanding the drivers of the ongoing epidemic may aid to curb transmissions. In order to identify the drivers of syphilis transmission in MSM in Switzerland between 2006 and 2017 as well as the effect of potential interventions, we set up an epidemiological model stratified by syphilis stage, HIV-diagnosis, and behavioral factors to account for syphilis infectiousness and risk for transmission. In the main model, we used ‘reported non-steady partners’ (nsP) as the main proxy for sexual risk. We parameterized the model using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, Swiss Voluntary Counselling and Testing center, cross-sectional surveys among the Swiss MSM population, and published syphilis notifications from the Federal Office of Public Health. The main model reproduced the increase in syphilis diagnoses from 168 cases in 2006 to 418 cases in 2017. It estimated that between 2006 and 2017, MSM with HIV diagnosis had 45.9 times the median syphilis incidence of MSM without HIV diagnosis. Defining risk as condomless anal intercourse with nsP decreased model accuracy (sum of squared weighted residuals, 378.8 vs. 148.3). Counterfactual scenarios suggested that increasing screening of MSM without HIV diagnosis and with nsP from once every two years to twice per year may reduce syphilis incidence (at most 12.8% reduction by 2017). Whereas, increasing screening among MSM with HIV diagnosis and with nsP from once per year to twice per year may substantially reduce syphilis incidence over time (at least 63.5% reduction by 2017). The model suggests that reporting nsP regardless of condom use is suitable for risk stratification when modelling syphilis transmission. More frequent screening of MSM with HIV diagnosis, particularly those with nsP may aid to curb syphilis transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using ephaptic coupling to estimate the synaptic cleft resistivity of the calyx of Held synapse</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Martijn C. Sierksma, J. Gerard G. Borst</p>

At synapses, the pre- and postsynaptic cells get so close that currents entering the cleft do not flow exclusively along its conductance, <i>g</i><sub>cl</sub>. A prominent example is found in the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), where the presynaptic action potential can be recorded in the postsynaptic cell in the form of a prespike. Here, we developed a theoretical framework for ephaptic coupling via the synaptic cleft, and we tested its predictions using the MNTB prespike recorded in voltage-clamp. The shape of the prespike is predicted to resemble either the first or the second derivative of the inverted presynaptic action potential if cleft currents dissipate either mostly capacitively or resistively, respectively. We found that the resistive dissipation scenario provided a better description of the prespike shape. Its size is predicted to scale with the fourth power of the radius of the synapse, explaining why intracellularly recorded prespikes are uncommon in the central nervous system. We show that presynaptic calcium currents also contribute to the prespike shape. This calcium prespike resembled the first derivative of the inverted calcium current, again as predicted by the resistive dissipation scenario. Using this calcium prespike, we obtained an estimate for <i>g</i><sub>cl</sub> of ~1 μS. We demonstrate that, for a circular synapse geometry, such as in conventional boutons or the immature calyx of Held, <i>g</i><sub>cl</sub> is scale-invariant and only defined by extracellular resistivity, which was ~75 Ωcm, and by cleft height. During development the calyx of Held develops fenestrations. We show that these fenestrations effectively minimize the cleft potentials generated by the adult action potential, which might otherwise interfere with calcium channel opening. We thus provide a quantitative account of the dissipation of currents by the synaptic cleft, which can be readily extrapolated to conventional, bouton-like synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The microbiome impacts host hybridization and speciation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Asia K. Miller, Camille S. Westlake, Karissa L. Cross, Brittany A. Leigh, Seth R. Bordenstein</p>

Microbial symbiosis and speciation profoundly shape the composition of life’s biodiversity. Despite the enormous contributions of these two fields to the foundations of modern biology, there is a vast and exciting frontier ahead for research, literature, and conferences to address the neglected prospects of merging their study. Here, we survey and synthesize exemplar cases of how endosymbionts and microbial communities affect animal hybridization and vice versa. We conclude that though the number of case studies remain nascent, the wide-ranging types of animals, microbes, and isolation barriers impacted by hybridization will likely prove general and a major new phase of study that includes the microbiome as part of the functional whole contributing to reproductive isolation. Though microorganisms were proposed to impact animal speciation a century ago, the weight of the evidence supporting this view has now reached a tipping point.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">On the optimality of the enzyme–substrate relationship in bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hugo Dourado, Matteo Mori, Terence Hwa, Martin J. Lercher</p>

Much recent progress has been made to understand the impact of proteome allocation on bacterial growth; much less is known about the relationship between the abundances of the enzymes and their substrates, which jointly determine metabolic fluxes. Here, we report a correlation between the concentrations of enzymes and their substrates in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We suggest this relationship to be a consequence of optimal resource allocation, subject to an overall constraint on the biomass density: For a cellular reaction network composed of effectively irreversible reactions, maximal reaction flux is achieved when the dry mass allocated to each substrate is equal to the dry mass of the unsaturated (or “free”) enzymes waiting to consume it. Calculations based on this optimality principle successfully predict the quantitative relationship between the observed enzyme and metabolite abundances, parameterized only by molecular masses and enzyme–substrate dissociation constants (<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>). The corresponding organizing principle provides a fundamental rationale for cellular investment into different types of molecules, which may aid in the design of more efficient synthetic cellular systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of accidental pediatric scald burns in a tertiary care center: hot cauldron burns versus accidental spill burns [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scald burns result from exposure to high-temperature fluids and are more common in the pediatric age group. They occur mainly by two mechanisms: (i) spill and (ii) immersion (hot cauldron) burns. These two patterns differ in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Scalds cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. The objective of this study was to compare accidental spill burns and hot cauldron burns in a hospital setting. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the secondary data of scald cases admitted during the years 2019 and 2020 in a burn-dedicated tertiary care center. Total population sampling was adopted. Data analysis was done partly using SPSS, version-23, and Stata-15. Mann Whitney U-test and Chi-square/Fisher's exact test were done appropriately to find associations between different variables. Regression analysis was performed taking mortality events as the outcome of interest. Results: Out of 108 scald cases, 43 (39.8%) had hot cauldron burns and 65 (60.2%) had accidental spill burns. Overall mortality was 16 (14.8%), out of which hot cauldron burns and accidental spill burns comprised 12 (75.0%) and 4 (25.0%), respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed the type of scald, age, and Baux score found to be associated with mortality. Every one-year increment in age had a 29% lower odds of occurrence of mortality event (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.99, p=0.042). Likewise, every one-point increment in Baux score was associated with 19% higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.190; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32; p<0.001). Conclusions: Accidental spill burns were more common but mortality was significantly higher for hot cauldron burns. The majority of burn injuries occurred inside the kitchen emphasizing appropriate parental precautions. The risk of mortality was significantly higher in burn events occurring outside the house, and burns involving back, buttocks, perineum, and lower extremities.

<p>Upon infection of primary neurons, astrocytes and microglia with tick-borne encephalitis virus, astrocytes mount particularly high IFN-β responses that initially depend on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family, is typically transmitted upon tick bite and can cause meningitis and encephalitis in humans. In TBEV-infected mice, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the downstream adaptor of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is needed to induce early type I interferon (IFN) responses and to confer protection. To characterize the brain-resident cell subset that produces protective IFN-β in TBEV-infected mice, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from mice and exposed these cell types to TBEV in vitro. Under such conditions, neurons showed the highest percentage of infected cells, whereas astrocytes and microglia were infected to a lesser extent. In the supernatant (SN) of infected neurons, IFN-β was not detectable, while infected astrocytes showed high and microglia low IFN-β expression. Transcriptome analyses of astrocytes implied that MAVS signaling was needed early after TBEV infection. Accordingly, MAVS-deficient astrocytes showed enhanced TBEV infection and significantly reduced early IFN-β responses. Nevertheless, at later time points, moderate amounts of IFN-β were detected in the SN of infected MAVS-deficient astrocytes. Transcriptome analyses indicated that MAVS deficiency negatively affected the induction of early anti-viral responses, which resulted in significantly increased TBEV replication. Treatment with MyD88 and TRIF inhibiting peptides reduced only late IFN-β responses of TBEV-infected WT astrocytes and blocked entirely IFN-β responses of infected MAVS-deficient astrocytes. Thus, upon TBEV exposure of brain-resident cells, astrocytes are important IFN-β producers showing biphasic IFN-β induction that initially depends on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.</p>

<p>We have employed α-syn oligomer proximity ligation assay to detect early changes in α-syn aggregation in the (Thy-1)-h[A30P] α-syn transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is a pathological hallmark in the Parkinson´s disease (PD) brain. The formation of α-syn oligomers is believed to be an early pathogenic event and the A30P mutation in the gene encoding α-syn, causing familial PD, has been shown to cause an accelerated oligomerization. Due to the problem of preserving antigen conformation on tissue surfaces, α-syn oligomers are difficult to detect <i>ex vivo</i> using conventional immunohistochemistry with oligomer-selective antibodies. Herein, we have instead employed the previously reported α-syn oligomer proximity ligation assay (ASO-PLA), along with a wide variety of biochemical assays, to discern the pathological progression of α-syn oligomers and their impact on the dopaminergic system in male and female (Thy-1)-h[A30P]α-syn transgenic (A30P-tg) mice. Our results reveal a previously undetected abundance of α-syn oligomers in midbrain of young mice, whereas phosphorylated (pS129) and proteinase k-resistant α-syn species were observed to a larger extent in aged mice. Although we did not detect loss of dopaminergic neurons in A30P-tg mice, a dysregulation in the monoaminergic system was recorded in older mice. Taken together, ASO-PLA should be a useful method for the detection of early changes in α-syn aggregation on brain tissue, from experimental mouse models in addition to <i>post mortem</i> PD cases.</p>

     alt="The ependymal cell cytoskeleton in the normal and injured spinal cord of mice"/>
<p>The cytoskeleton of the cells lining the central canal of the mouse spinal cord undergoes important modifications following injury. Ependymal cells change their pronounced apicobasal polarity with a striking rearrangement of key cytoskeletal proteins (F-actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein) that may be key events in the response of these progenitor-like cells.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cytoskeleton of ependymal cells is fundamental to organize and maintain the normal architecture of the central canal (CC). However, little is known about the plasticity of cytoskeletal components after spinal cord injury. Here, we focus on the structural organization of the cytoskeleton of ependymal cells in the normal and injured spinal cord of mice (both females and males) using immunohistochemical and electron microscopy techniques. We found that in uninjured animals, the actin cytoskeleton (as revealed by phalloidin staining) was arranged following the typical pattern of polarized epithelial cells with conspicuous actin pools located in the apical domain of ependymal cells. Transmission electron microscopy images showed microvilli tufts, long cilia, and characteristic intercellular membrane specializations. After spinal cord injury, F-actin rearrangements paralleled by fine structural modifications of the apical domain of ependymal cells were observed. These changes involved disruptions of the apical actin pools as well as fine structural modifications of the microvilli tufts. When comparing the control and injured spinal cords, we also found modifications in the expression of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After injury, vimentin expression disappeared from the most apical domains of ependymal cells but the number of GFAP-expressing cells within the CC increased. As in other polarized epithelia, the plastic changes in the cytoskeleton may be critically involved in the reaction of ependymal cells following a traumatic injury of the spinal cord.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">A role for T‐cell exhaustion in Long COVID‐19 and severe outcomes for several categories of COVID‐19 patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Unusual mortality rate differences and symptoms have been experienced by COVID-19 patients, and the postinfection symptoms called Long COVID-19 have also been widely experienced. A substantial percentage of COVID-19-infected individuals in specific health categories have been virtually asymptomatic, several other individuals in the same health categories have exhibited several unusual symptoms, and yet other individuals in the same health categories have fatal outcomes. It is now hypothesized that these differences in mortality rates and symptoms could be caused by a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection acting together with one or more latent pathogen infections in certain patients, through mutually beneficial induced immune cell dysfunctions, including T-cell exhaustion. A latent pathogen infection likely to be involved is the protozoan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, which infects approximately one third of the global human population. Furthermore, certain infections and cancers that cause T-cell exhaustion can also explain the more severe outcomes of other COVID-19 patients having several disease and cancer comorbidities.</p>

     alt="Altered static and dynamic functional network connectivity in temporal lobe epilepsy with different disease duration and their relationships with attention"/>
<p>Compared with healthy controls, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy patients with a shorter duration of disease showed differences in static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC). Compared with sFNC, dFNC analysis showed more and inconsistent inter-network functional connectivity abnormalities. At the same time, the variability of inter-network dFNC is correlated with orienting function.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain network alterations associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate altered patterns of static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC) in TLE with different durations of disease. In this study, 19 TLE patients with a disease duration of ≤5 years (TLE-SD), 24 TLE patients with a disease duration of &gt;5 years (TLE-LD), and 21 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and attention network test. We used group independent component analysis to determine the target resting-state networks. Sliding window correlation and <i>k</i>-means clustering analysis methods were used to obtain different dFNC states, temporal properties, and temporal variability. We then compared sFNC and dFNC between groups and found that compared with HCs, TLE-SD patients had increased sFNC between the dorsal attention network and sensorimotor network/visual network (VN), but decreased sFNC between the inferior–posterior default mode network and VN. In the strongly connected dFNC state, TLE-SD patients spent more time, had greater mean dwell time, and showed greater inconsistent abnormal network connectivity. There was a significant negative correlation between the temporal variability of auditory network- left fronto-parietal network connectivity and orienting effect. No significant differences in sFNC and dFNC were detected between TLE-LD and HC groups. These findings suggest that the damage and functional brain network abnormalities gradually occur in TLE patients after the onset of epilepsy, which might lead to functional network reorganization and compensatory remodeling as the disease progresses.</p>

<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) patients present higher frequency of intermediate monocytes expressing TLR10. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2-induced cytokine production.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral inflammation, particularly mediated by monocytes, can cause neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the mechanism of TLR2-induced cytokine impairment in peripheral monocytes from PD patients and the association between the presence of CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes and PD severity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PD patients and healthy individuals were evaluated for TLR expression on monocyte subsets (CD14 and CD16 expression) using flow cytometry. Moreover, cytokines were evaluated using flow cytometry after stimulation with Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys (TLR2/TLR1 agonist) in the absence or presence of neutralizing antibodies to TLR10. The severity of PD was assessed using the unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) and motor activity, anxiety (BAI), depression (BDI), and fatigue (PD Fatigue Scale-16) scales. The frequency of CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes and expression intensity of TLR2 and TLR10 were higher in patients with PD than healthy individuals. The frequency of intermediate monocytes (CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) was not significantly increased in patients with PD, but was the main monocyte subset expressing TLR10. The TLR2/TLR1-impaired cytokine production (IL-6, TNFα, IL-8, and IL-10) in PD patients was reversed by neutralizing TLR10. The high frequency of total CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes was associated with a reduction in the severity of PD according to the evaluation of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Peripheral monocytes from patients with PD showed phenotypic and functional alterations. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2-induced cytokine production. Furthermore, data suggested that a low frequency of CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes indicates the severity of PD. The results identified new opportunities for the development of novel PD neuroprotective therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Recent insights on astrocyte mechanisms in CNS homeostasis, pathology, and repair</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes play essential roles in development, homeostasis, injury, and repair of the central nervous system (CNS). Their development is tightly regulated by distinct spatial and temporal cues during embryogenesis and into adulthood throughout the CNS. Astrocytes have several important responsibilities such as regulating blood flow and permeability of the blood-CNS barrier, glucose metabolism and storage, synapse formation and function, and axon myelination. In CNS pathologies, astrocytes also play critical parts in both injury and repair mechanisms. Upon injury, they undergo a robust phenotypic shift known as “reactive astrogliosis,” which results in both constructive and deleterious outcomes. Astrocyte activation and migration at the site of injury provides an early defense mechanism to minimize the extent of injury by enveloping the lesion area. However, astrogliosis also contributes to the inhibitory microenvironment of CNS injury and potentiate secondary injury mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity, which facilitate neurodegeneration in CNS pathologies. Intriguingly, reactive astrocytes are increasingly a focus in current therapeutic strategies as their activation can be modulated toward a neuroprotective and reparative phenotype. This review will discuss recent advancements in knowledge regarding the development and role of astrocytes in the healthy and pathological CNS. We will also review how astrocytes have been genetically modified to optimize their reparative potential after injury, and how they may be transdifferentiated into neurons and oligodendrocytes to promote repair after CNS injury and neurodegeneration.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of death worldwide. It is a complex injury that influences cellular physiology, causes neuronal cell death, and affects molecular pathways in the brain. This in turn can result in sensory, motor, and behavioral alterations that deeply impact the quality of life. Repetitive mild TBI can progress into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative condition linked to severe behavioral changes. While current animal models of TBI and CTE such as rodents, are useful to explore affected pathways, clinical findings therein have rarely translated into clinical applications, possibly because of the many morphofunctional differences between the model animals and humans. It is therefore important to complement these studies with alternative animal models that may better replicate the individuality of human TBI. Comparative studies in animals with naturally evolved brain protection such as bighorn sheep, woodpeckers, and whales, may provide preventive applications in humans. The advantages of an in-depth study of these unconventional animals are threefold. First, to increase knowledge of the often-understudied species in question; second, to improve common animal models based on the study of their extreme counterparts; and finally, to tap into a source of biological inspiration for comparative studies and translational applications in humans.</p>

<p>Using the MSMT-CSD-based connectome, we identified increased structural connectivity in Japanese male world-class gymnasts (WCGs), involving sensorimotor, default mode, attentional, visual, and limbic subnetworks correlated with D-scores of floor, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and years of training.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In athletes, long-term intensive training has been shown to increase unparalleled athletic ability and might induce brain plasticity. We evaluated the structural connectome of world-class gymnasts (WCGs), as mapped by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging probabilistic tractography and a multishell, multitissue constrained spherical deconvolution method to increase the precision of tractography at the tissue interfaces. The connectome was mapped in 10 Japanese male WCGs and in 10 age-matched male controls. Network-based statistic identified subnetworks with increased connectivity density in WCGs, involving the sensorimotor, default mode, attentional, visual, and limbic areas. It also revealed a significant association between the structural connectivity of some brain structures with functions closely related to the gymnastic skills and the D-score, which is used as an index of the gymnasts' specific physical abilities for each apparatus. Furthermore, graph theory analysis demonstrated the characteristics of brain anatomical topology in the WCGs. They displayed significantly increased global connectivity strength with decreased characteristic path length at the global level and higher nodal strength and degree in the sensorimotor, default mode, attention, and limbic/subcortical areas at the local level as compared with controls. Together, these findings extend the current understanding of neural mechanisms that distinguish WCGs from controls and suggest brain anatomical network plasticity in WCGs resulting from long-term intensive training. Future studies should assess the contribution of genetic or early-life environmental factors in the brain network organization of WCGs. Furthermore, the indices of brain topology (i.e., connection density and graph theory indices) could become markers for the objective evaluation of gymnastic performance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmental stimuli such as temperature, food, and smell significantly influence the physiology and behavior of animals. Animals are differentially adapted to maintain their internal body functions in response to varied environmental conditions. These external cues are sensed by specialized neurons which are a part of the chemosensory and thermosensory systems. The inability to respond correctly to varied environmental conditions may result in compromised bodily functions and reduced longevity. For example, the ability to sense food is derived from the integrated action of olfactory and gustatory systems. The damage to the olfactory system will affect our decision of palatable food items which in turn can affect the response of the gustatory system, ultimately causing abnormal feeding habits. Recent studies have provided evidence that aging is regulated by sensory perception of environment. Aging is one of the most common causes of various neurodegenerative diseases and the perception of environmental cues is also found to regulate the development of neurodegenerative phenotype in several animal models. However, specific molecular signaling pathways involved in the process are not completely understood. The research conducted on one of the best-studied animal models of aging, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, has demonstrated multiple examples of gene–environment interaction at the neuronal level which affects life span. The findings may be useful to identify the key neuronal regulators of aging and age-related diseases in humans owing to conserved core metabolic and aging pathways from worms to humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The homeodomain transcription factors sine oculis homeobox 3 (Six3) and ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) are required for brain development. Their expression in specific brain areas is maintained in adulthood, where their functions are poorly understood. To identify the roles of <i>Six3</i> and <i>Vax1</i> in neurons, we conditionally deleted each gene using <i>Synapsin<sup>cre</sup>
</i>, a promoter targeting maturing neurons, and generated <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice. <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> females, but not males, had reduced fertility, due to impairment of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge driving ovulation. In nocturnal rodents, the LH surge requires a precise timing signal from the brain's circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), near the time of activity onset. Indeed, both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> females had impaired rhythmic SCN output, which was associated with weakened <i>Period 2</i> molecular clock function in both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice. These impairments were associated with a reduction of the SCN neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide in <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice and a modest weakening of SCN timekeeping function in both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice. Changes in SCN function were associated with mistimed peak PER2::LUC expression in the SCN and pituitary in both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> females. Interestingly, <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> ovaries presented reduced sensitivity to LH, causing reduced ovulation during superovulation. In conclusion, we have identified novel roles of the homeodomain transcription factors SIX3 and VAX1 in neurons, where they are required for proper molecular circadian clock function, SCN rhythmic output, and female fertility.</p>

<p>This study investigates microstructural changes in the Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) before and after specific treatment. Indeed, CPAP-treatment significantly increased DTI parameters such as Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in NAWM of the brainstem, corpus callosum and bilateral internal capsule of OSA patients at follow-up compared to baseline.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visually appreciable white matter (WM) changes have been described in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, few data exist on the involvement of silent WM abnormalities. This prospective study investigated the microstructural integrity of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in male OSA patients before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, using a neuroimaging approach. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired from 32 participants (16 severe never-treated OSA and 16 controls). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were used to assess the microstructural NAWM changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). In order to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, OSA patients underwent MRI evaluations at baseline and after 3 months of treatment (follow-up). CPAP treatment significantly increased the FA in NAWM of the brain stem, corpus callosum and bilateral internal capsule of OSA patients at follow-up compared to baseline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, TFCE-corrected). OSA patients also showed increases in AD in the corpus callosum, superior corona radiata, and internal capsule of the right hemisphere (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, TFCE-corrected) after CPAP treatment. A significant negative correlation was found between the FA of the corona radiata, corpus callosum, internal capsule, limbic structures, and neuropsychological scores at follow-up evaluation. No significant differences were found in MD and RD of NAWM in our patients after treatment. Our results demonstrate that FA and AD of NAWM in major tracts such as the corpus callosum and the internal capsule increased significantly after CPAP treatment, as a potential beneficial effect of ventilatory therapy. The recovery of NAWM alterations might also be related to the improvement in the neurocognitive profile, suggesting that nonclearly visible WM alterations may contribute to the physiopathology of OSA-related cognitive impairment.</p>

     alt="AMPA induced cognitive impairment in rats: Establishing the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, 4-PBA"/>
<p>The effect of AMPA induced excitotoxicity was studied on the rat hippocampus. AMPA apprehended the expression of GLUR receptors which afflict ER environment, thus inducing UPR and other cognitive impairments. Inhibiting ER stress with its specific inhibitor 4-PBA apprehended cognitive impairment and maintained neurotransmitters levels in addition to detaining UPR induced neuronal damage.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutamate excitotoxicity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) recently have been found to be instrumental in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the paucity of literature deciphering the inter-linkage among glutamate receptors, behavioral alterations, and ER demands thorough exploration. Reckoning the aforesaid concerns, a prospective study was outlined to delineate the influence of ER stress inhibition <i>via</i> 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) excitotoxicity-induced behavioral aspects and possible ER stress-glutamate linkage. Male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups namely sham (surgical control+vehicle, group 1), AMPA-induced excitotoxic group 2 receive a single intra-hippocampal injection of 10 mM AMPA, group 3 received AMPA along with PBA (i.p, 100 mg/kg body weight) for 15 days, and group 4 received PBA alone. Behavioral analyses were performed prior to the sacrifice of animals and hippocampus was extracted thereafter for further analysis. AMPA-induced excitotoxicity exhibited significant impairment of locomotion as well as cognitive functions. The levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, homo vanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine, and serotonin were reduced accompanied by reduced expression of GLUR1 and GLUR4 (glutamate receptor) as well as loss of neurons in different layers of hippocampus. ER stress markers were upregulated upon AMPA excitotoxicity. However, chemical chaperone PBA supplementation remarkably mitigated the behavioral alterations along with expression of glutamate and ER stress intermediates/markers in AMPA excitotoxic animals. Therefore, the present exploration convincingly emphasizes the significance of ER stress and its inhibition <i>via</i> PBA in combating cognitive impairment as well as improving locomotion in excitotoxic animals.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social interactions are partly driven by our ability to empathize—the capacity to share and understand others’ inner states. While a growing body of evidence suggests a link between past experiences and empathy, to what degree empathy is dependent on our own previous experiences (autobiographical memories, AMs) is still unclear. Whereas neuroimaging studies have shown wide overlapping brain networks underpinning AM and empathic processes, studies on clinical populations with memory loss have not always shown empathy is impaired. The current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography study will seek to shed light on this neuropsychological puzzle by testing whether self-perceived empathy is causally linked to AM retrieval. Cortical activity, together with self-rating of empathy, will be recorded for scenarios that echo personal experiences while a brain region critical for AM retrieval will be transiently inhibited using TMS before task performance.</p>

<p>Resilience to stress in male rats is lost 2 weeks after social defeat stress.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resilience to stress is the ability to quickly adapt to adversity. There is evidence that exposure to prolonged stress triggers neuroinflammation what produces individual differences in stress vulnerability. However, the relationship between stress resilience, neuroinflammation, and depressive-like behaviors remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term effects of social defeat stress (SDS) on neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and depressive-like behaviors. Male rats were subjected to the SDS paradigm. Social interaction was analyzed 1 and 2 weeks after ending the SDS to determine which animals were susceptible or resilient to stress. Neuroinflammation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, and elevated membrane permeability in astrocytes and microglia, as well as depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test were evaluated in all rats. One week after SDS, resilient rats increased their sucrose preference, and time spent in the floating behavior decreased in the forced swim test compared to susceptible rats. Surprisingly, resilient rats became susceptible to stress, and presented neuroinflammation 2 weeks after SDS. These findings suggest that SDS-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation persists in post-stress stages, regardless of whether rats were initially resilient or not. Our study opens a new approach to understanding the neurobiology of stress resilience.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health-care system. To date, the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD-immanent deterioration of domain-general functions and domain-specific numerical areas suggests the mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study will systematically investigate basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain-general factors. The overall sample consists of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients will be stratified into patients with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (level I-PD-MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing will be assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non)symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis will be employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants will be subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Study results will give the first broad insight into the extent of basic numerical deficits in different PD patient groups and will help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of the numerical deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.</p>

<p>The illustration of the generation of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells from SCPs associated with nerves during zebrafish development. In fish, peripheral nerve-associated SCPs detach and generate the majority of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells over significant periods of development and growth.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The autonomic portion of the peripheral nervous system orchestrates tissue homeostasis through direct innervation of internal organs, and via release of adrenalin and noradrenalin into the blood flow. The developmental mechanisms behind the formation of autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells are not fully understood. Using genetic tracing, we discovered that a significant proportion of sympathetic neurons in zebrafish originates from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) during a defined period of embryonic development. Moreover, SCPs give rise to the main portion of the chromaffin cells, as well as to a significant proportion of enteric and other autonomic neurons associated with internal organs. The conversion of SCPs into neuronal and chromaffin cells is ErbB receptor dependent, as the pharmacological inhibition of the ErbB pathway effectively perturbed this transition. Finally, using genetic ablations, we revealed that SCPs producing neurons and chromaffin cells migrate along spinal motor axons to reach appropriate target locations. This study reveals the evolutionary conservation of SCP-to-neuron and SCP-to-chromaffin cell transitions over significant growth periods in fish and highlights relevant cellular-genetic mechanisms. Based on this, we anticipate that multipotent SCPs might be present in postnatal vertebrate tissues, retaining the capacity to regenerate autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells.</p>

<p>Can transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improve implicit motor sequence learning in individuals with Parkinson's disease? A comparison with neurologically healthy, age- and sex-matched controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a cognitive function that is known to be directly associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Research on healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant (basal ganglia) network effects—hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal ganglia dysfunction. To date, only null effects have been reported in persons with PD. However, these studies did not determine the reacquisition effects, although previous studies in healthy young adults suggest that tDCS specifically exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL on reacquisition rather than acquisition. In the current study, we will therefore establish possible reacquisition effects, which are of a particular interest, as long-term effects are vital for the successful functional rehabilitation of persons with PD. Using a sham-controlled, counterbalanced design, we will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the serial reaction time task, in persons with PD and a neurologically healthy age- and sex-matched control (HC) group. Multilevel Mixed Models will be implemented to analyze the sequence-specific aspect of IMSL (primary outcome) and general learning (secondary outcome). We will determine not only the immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the application of tDCS but also the short-term (5 min post-tDCS) and long-term (1 week post-tDCS) reacquisition effects.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding and diagnosing cognitive impairment in epilepsy remains a prominent challenge. New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting-state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain-specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil-and-paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central-executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy. The present findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of functional brain network dysfunction in cognitive impairment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Different mutations in the <i>cadherin 23</i> (<i>CDH23</i>) gene in different genetic backgrounds have been linked to either syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of deafness in humans. We previously reported a progressive hearing loss (HL) mouse model, the <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mouse, which carries a 208T &gt; C mutation causing an amino acid substitution at S70P in C57BL/6J mice. To investigate the differences in <i>Cdh23</i> mutation-related HL in different genetic backgrounds, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate homozygous mice in the CBA/CaJ background that have the same base pair missense mutation (208T &gt; C) (<i>Cdh23<sup>erl2/erl2</sup>
</i>) as <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mice in the C57BL/6J background or a single base pair deletion (235G) (<i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i>) in the <i>Cdh23</i> gene at exon 5. The two mutant mice exhibit hearing impairment across a broad range of frequencies. The progression of HL in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl2/erl2</sup>
</i> mice is slower than that in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mice. We also found structural abnormalities in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl2/erl2</sup>
</i> and <i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i> mice. <i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i> mice show signs of vestibular dysfunction in open field behavior and swimming tests. In addition, we observed hair bundle defects in vestibular hair cells in <i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i> mice. Our results suggest an interaction between the <i>erl</i> locus and the C57BL/6J background that exacerbates HL in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mice. Moreover, our study confirms that the <i>Cdh23</i> gene is essential for normal hearing and balance. These two novel mutant mouse strains provide excellent models for studying <i>CDH23</i> mutation-related deafness in humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a focal epilepsy whose neurobiological underpinnings remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to identify possible neurochemical alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in participants with SHE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS). Thirty-nine participants with SHE (mean age, 30.7 years ± 11.3 [standard deviation], 24 men) and 59 controls (mean age, 29.4 years ± 10.4, 29 men) were consecutively and prospectively recruited and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and <sup>1</sup>H MRS in the bilateral DLPFCs. Brain concentrations of metabolites, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), <i>myo</i>-inositol (mI), choline, creatine, the sum of glutamate and glutamine, glutathione (GSH) and <i>γ</i>-aminobutyric acid, were estimated with LCModel and corrected for the partial volume effect of cerebrospinal fluid using tissue segmentation. ANCOVA analyses revealed lower concentration of NAA in the left DLPFC in participants with SHE compared with controls. A significant difference of NAA concentration between DLPFC in the two hemispheres (left &gt; right) was observed only in the control group. We further confirmed a higher GSH concentration in men than in women in SHE participants, which probably indicates that men are more susceptible to this disease. The mI concentration in the right DLPFC was negatively correlated with epilepsy duration. This study demonstrates that DLPFC is an important brain region involved in the pathophysiology of SHE, in which both neurons and astrocytes appear impaired, and the elevated GSH level may suggest an abnormality related to oxidative stress.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Repetitive behavioral phenotypes are a trait of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Such behaviors are typified by complex interactions between cognitive and neurobiological processes which most likely contribute to the suboptimal treatment responses often observed. To this end, exploration of the adenosinergic system may be useful, since adenosine-receptor modulation has previously shown promise to restore control over voluntary behavior and improve cognition in patients presenting with motor repetition. Here, we employed the deer mouse <i>(Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii)</i> model of compulsive-like behavioral persistence, seeking to investigate possible associations between stereotypic motor behavior and cognitive flexibility as measured in the T-maze continuous alternation task (T-CAT). The effect of istradefylline, a selective adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist at two doses (10 and 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) on the expression of stereotypy and T-CAT performance in high (H) and non-(N) stereotypical animals, was investigated in comparison to a control intervention (six groups; <i>n</i> = 8 or 9 per group). No correlation between H behavior and T-CAT performance was found. However, H but not N animals presented with istradefylline-sensitive spontaneous alternation and stereotypy, in that istradefylline at both doses significantly improved the spontaneous alternation scores and attenuated the stereotypical expression of H animals. Thus, evidence is presented that anti-adenosinergic drug action improves repetitive behavior and spontaneous alternation in stereotypical deer mice, putatively pointing to a shared psychobiological construct underlying naturalistic stereotypy and alterations in cognitive flexibility in deer mice.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (Hc) is composed of cytoarchitectonically distinct subfields: dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis sectors 1-3 (CA1-3), and subiculum. Limited evidence suggests differential maturation rates across the Hc subfields. While longitudinal studies are essential in demonstrating differential development of Hc subfields, a prerequisite for interpreting meaningful longitudinal effects is establishing test–retest consistency of Hc subfield volumes measured <i>in vivo</i> over time. Here, we examined test–retest consistency of Hc subfield volumes measured from structural MR images in two independent developmental samples. Sample One (<i>n</i> = 28, ages 7–20 years, <i>M</i> = 12.64, <i>SD</i> = 3.35) and Sample Two (<i>n</i> = 28, ages 7–17 years, <i>M</i> = 11.72, <i>SD</i> = 2.88) underwent MRI twice with a 1-month and a 2-year delay, respectively. High-resolution PD-TSE-T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MR images (0.4 × 0.4 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>) were collected and manually traced using a longitudinal manual demarcation protocol. In both samples, we found excellent consistency of Hc subfield volumes between the two visits, assessed by two-way mixed intraclass correlation (ICC (3) single measures ≥ 0.87), and no difference between children and adolescents. The results further indicated that discrepancies between repeated measures were not related to Hc subfield volumes, or visit number. In addition to high consistency, with the applied longitudinal protocol, we detected significant variability in Hc subfield volume changes over the 2-year delay, implying high sensitivity of the method in detecting individual differences. Establishing unbiased, high longitudinal consistency of Hc subfield volume measurements optimizes statistical power of a hypothesis test and reduces standard error of the estimate, together improving external validity of the measures in constructing theoretical models of memory development.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cilia are dynamic subcellular systems, with core structural and functional components operating in a highly coordinated manner. Since many environmental stimuli sensed by cilia are circadian in nature, it is reasonable to speculate that genes encoding cilia structural and functional components follow rhythmic circadian patterns of expression. Using computational methods and the largest spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of primates, we identified and analyzed the circadian rhythmic expression of cilia genes across 22 primate brain areas. We found that around 73% of cilia transcripts exhibited circadian rhythmicity across at least one of 22 brain regions. In 12 brain regions, cilia transcriptomes were significantly enriched with circadian oscillating transcripts, as compared to the rest of the transcriptome. The phase of the cilia circadian transcripts deviated from the phase of the majority of the background circadian transcripts, and transcripts coding for cilia basal body components accounted for the majority of cilia circadian transcripts. In addition, adjacent or functionally connected brain nuclei had large overlapping complements of circadian cilia genes. Most remarkably, cilia circadian transcripts shared across the basal ganglia nuclei and the prefrontal cortex peaked in these structures in sequential fashion that is similar to the sequential order of activation of the basal ganglia-cortical circuitry in connection with movement coordination, albeit on completely different timescales. These findings support a role for the circadian spatiotemporal orchestration of cilia gene expression in the normal physiology of the basal ganglia-cortical circuit and motor control. Studying orchestrated cilia rhythmicity in the basal ganglia-cortical circuits and other brain circuits may help develop better functional models, and shed light on the causal effects cilia functions have on these circuits and on the regulation of movement and other behaviors.</p>

<p>Murugappan et al., report that trigeminal neuropathy causes desynchronization and reduces neuronal communications in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-basolateral amygdala neural circuitry, associated with hypomyelination and reduced myelinating cells. The hypomyelination and desynchronization in the ACC lead to poor decision-making in male rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Infraorbital nerve-chronic constriction injury (ION-CCI) has become the most popular chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) injury animal model which causes prolonged mechanical allodynia. Accumulative evidence suggests that TNP interferes with cognitive functions, however the underlying mechanisms are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate decision-making performance as well as synaptic and large-scale neural synchronized alterations in the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) circuitry and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neural circuitry in male rats with TNP. Rat gambling task showed that ION-CCI led to decrease the proportion of good decision makers and increase the proportion of poor decision makers. Electrophysiological recordings showed long-lasting synaptic potentiation of local field potential in the trigeminal ganglia-SpV caudalis (SpVc) synapses in TNP rats. In this study, TNP led to disruption of ACC spike timing and basolateral amygdala (BLA) theta oscillation associated with suppressed synchronization of theta oscillation between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications. Myelination is critical for information flow between brain regions, and myelin plasticity is an important feature for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. We characterized newly formed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and mature OLs are reduced in TNP and are associated with reduced myelin strength in the ACC region. The functional disturbances in the BLA-ACC neural circuitry is pathologically associated with the myelin defects in the ACC region which may be relevant causes for the deficits in decision-making in chronic TNP state.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Children born extremely preterm (EP, &lt;28 weeks’ gestation) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW, &lt;1,000 g) are a vulnerable population at high risk of working memory impairments. We aimed to examine changes in the brain structural connectivity networks thought to underlie working memory performance, after completion of a working memory training program (Cogmed) compared with a placebo program in EP/ELBW children. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (the Improving Memory in a Preterm Randomised Intervention Trial). Children born EP/ELBW received either the Cogmed or placebo program at 7 years of age (<i>n</i> = 91). A subset of children had magnetic resonance imaging of the brain immediately pre- and 2 weeks post-training (Cogmed <i>n</i> = 28; placebo <i>n</i> = 27). <i>T</i>
<sub>1</sub>-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were used to perform graph theoretical analysis of structural connectivity networks. Changes from pre-training to post-training in structural connectivity metrics were generally similar between randomized groups. There was little evidence that changes in structural connectivity metrics were related to changes in working memory performance from pre- to post-training. Overall, our results provide little evidence that the Cogmed working memory training program has training-specific effects on structural connectivity networks in EP/ELBW children.</p>

     alt="Post-training stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impairs working memory training performance"/>
<p>We delivered transcranial direct current stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex before, during, or after working memory training in order to assess the optimal stimulation timing to maximize learning. Although our procedure did not end up eliciting learning benefits, we did find that stimulation immediately after training <i>impaired</i> performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Research investigating transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance cognitive training augments both our understanding of its long-term effects on cognitive plasticity as well as potential applications to strengthen cognitive interventions. Previous work has demonstrated enhancement of working memory training while applying concurrent tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, the optimal stimulation parameters are still unknown. For example, the timing of tDCS delivery has been shown to be an influential variable that can interact with task learning. In the present study, we used tDCS to target the right DLPFC while participants trained on a visuospatial working memory task. We sought to compare the relative efficacy of online stimulation delivered during training to offline stimulation delivered either immediately before or afterwards. We were unable to replicate previously demonstrated benefits of online stimulation; however, we did find evidence that offline stimulation delivered after training can actually be detrimental to training performance relative to sham. We interpret our results in light of evidence suggesting a role of the right DLPFC in promoting memory interference, and conclude that while tDCS may be a promising tool to influence the results of cognitive training, more research and an abundance of caution are needed before fully endorsing its use for cognitive enhancement. This work suggests that effects can vary substantially in magnitude and direction between studies, and may be heavily dependent on a variety of intervention protocol parameters such as the timing and location of stimulation delivery, about which our understanding is still nascent.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">The organization of the zebrafish pallium from a hodological perspective</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the connections (connectome) of the adult zebrafish pallium using carbocyanine dye tracing and ancillary anatomical methods. The everted zebrafish pallium (dorsal telencephalic area, D) is comprised of several major zones (medial, lateral, dorsal, central, anterior and posterior) distinguishable by their topography, cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry and genoarchitecture. Our comprehensive study reveals poor interconnectivity between these pallial areas, especially between medial (Dm), lateral/dorsal (Dl, Dd) and posterior (Dp) regions. This suggests that the zebrafish pallium has dedicated modules for different neural processes. Pallial connections with extrapallial regions also show compartmental organization. Major extratelencephalic afferents come from preglomerular nuclei (to Dl, Dd and Dm), posterior tuberal nucleus (to Dm), and lateral recess nucleus (to Dl). The subpallial (ventral, V) zones dorsal Vv, Vd and Vs, considered homologues of the striatum, amygdala and pallidum, are mainly afferent to Dl/Dd and Dp. Regarding the efferent pathways, they also appear characteristic of each pallial region. Rostral Dm projects to the dorsal entopeduncular nucleus. Dp is interconnected with the olfactory bulbs. The central region (Dc) defined here receives mainly projections from Dl-Dd and projects toward the pretectum and optic tectum, connections, which help to delimiting Dc. The connectome of the adult pallium revealed here complements extant studies on the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, and may be useful for neurogenetic studies performed during early stages of development. The connectome of the zebrafish pallium was also compared with the pallial connections reported in other teleosts, a large group showing high pallial diversity.</p>

                Social interaction deficits seen in psychiatric disorders emerge in early life and are most closely linked to neural circuit dysfunction. Due to technical limitations, we have limited understanding of how social behavior circuits develop. These data highlight social adversity and elevated dopamine in amygdala as causal in producing aberrant social behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Arthritis flares mediated by tissue-resident memory T cells in the joint</a></h4>

              
                Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by recurrent inflammation of some, but not all, joints. Chang et al. show that CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells accumulate in previously inflamed joints, nucleating local disease recurrence when triggered by antigens. TRM depletion attenuates arthritis flares, defining a mechanistic basis for joint-specific memory.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Peli1 facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by mediating ASC ubiquitination</a></h4>

              
                Inflammasome activation is crucial for host defense against infections and also contributes to inflammatory disorders, but the mechanism regulating inflammatory activation is incompletely understood. Zhang et al. demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Peli1 is important for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammasome-associated inflammatory responses in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">RNF168 E3 ligase participates in ubiquitin signaling and recruitment of SLX4 during DNA crosslink repair</a></h4>

              
                How ubiquitin signaling mediates SLX4 localization at DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) sites has been unclear. Katsuki et al. show that RNF168 E3 ligase contributes to an ICL-triggered ubiquitin cascade, which is required for SLX4 recruitment. Although SLX4/FANCP is an FA protein, RNF168 operates independently of the canonical FA pathway activation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Cross talk between the upstream exon-intron junction and Prp2 facilitates splicing of non-consensus introns</a></h4>

              
                Hümmer et al. show that S. pombe Prp2 (U2AF65) is dispensable for splicing of specific introns. While being located at the 3′ss, the requirement on Prp2 is mainly defined by the U1-5′ss interaction, pointing to a key role of Prp2 in the initial definition of the exon-intron boundaries.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Repression precedes independent evolutionary gains of a highly specific gene expression pattern</a></h4>

              
                Pu et al. show that the independent gain of a highly specific expression pattern across distantly related species may be because of the preexistence of repressor sequences that precedes the diversification of these species. This may reflect a general mechanism underlying the evolution of highly specific enhancers.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Conserved heterodimeric GTPase Rbg1/Tma46 promotes efficient translation in eukaryotic cells</a></h4>

              
                Conserved heterodimeric GTPase Drg/Dfrp proteins bind to the ribosome, but their function in translation is poorly understood. Zeng et al. find that the yeast homolog of Drg1/Dfrp1, named Rbg1/Tma46, suppresses prolonged ribosomal pausing and promotes efficient translation. The structure of the Rbg1/Tma46-bound ribosome reveals molecular interactions important for their function.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">TAFA4 relieves injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity through LDL receptors and modulation of spinal A-type K+ current</a></h4>

              
                Yoo et al. demonstrate that intrathecal or systemic administration of human recombinant TAFA4 reverses inflammatory, postoperative, and nerve injury-induced mechanical pain. The TAFA4 antihypersensitive effect requires functional RAP-sensitive LDL receptors to restore normal mechanical sensitivity by rescuing the injury-induced alterations of IA in two distinct subsets of spinal cord dorsal horn interneurons.

                Centralspindlin positions the cleavage furrow. Thomas et al. show that astral MTs target a dominant centralspindlin pool to the basal furrow in fly neuroblasts. This pool is separated from spindle-midzone-associated centralspindlin. When centralspindlin cortical recruitment is impaired, the midzone pool takes the lead to reset furrowing apically.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Echolocating toothed whales use ultra-fast echo-kinetic responses to track evasive prey</a></h4>

              
                Visual predators rely on fast-acting optokinetic responses to track and capture agile prey. Most toothed whales, however, rely on echolocation for hunting and have converged on biosonar clicking rates reaching 500/s during prey pursuits. If echoes are processed on a click-by-click basis, as assumed, neural responses 100× faster than those in vision are required to keep pace with this information flow. Using high-resolution biologging of wild predator-prey interactions, we show that toothed whales adjust clicking rates to track prey movement within 50–200 ms of prey escape responses. Hypothesising that these stereotyped biosonar adjustments are elicited by sudden prey accelerations, we measured echo-kinetic responses from trained harbour porpoises to a moving target and found similar latencies. High biosonar sampling rates are, therefore, not supported by extreme speeds of neural processing and muscular responses. Instead, the neurokinetic response times in echolocation are similar to those of tracking responses in vision, suggesting a common neural underpinning.

                Recent omics analyses of human biofluids provide opportunities to probe selected species of biomolecules for disease diagnostics. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy investigates the full repertoire of molecular species within a sample at once. Here, we present a multi-institutional study in which we analysed infrared fingerprints of plasma and serum samples from 1639 individuals with different solid tumours and carefully matched symptomatic and non-symptomatic reference individuals. Focusing on breast, bladder, prostate, and lung cancer, we find that infrared molecular fingerprinting is capable of detecting cancer: training a support vector machine algorithm allowed us to obtain binary classification performance in the range of 0.78–0.89 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), with a clear correlation between AUC and tumour load. Intriguingly, we find that the spectral signatures differ between different cancer types. This study lays the foundation for high-throughput onco-IR-phenotyping of four common cancers, providing a cost-effective, complementary analytical tool for disease recognition.

                Flexible behaviors over long timescales are thought to engage recurrent neural                    networks in deep brain regions, which are experimentally challenging to study.                    In insects, recurrent circuit dynamics in a brain region called the central                    complex (CX) enable directed locomotion, sleep, and context- and                    experience-dependent spatial navigation. We describe the first complete                    electron-microscopy-based connectome of the <i>Drosophila</i> CX,                    including all its neurons and circuits at synaptic resolution. We identified new                    CX neuron types, novel sensory and motor pathways, and network motifs that                    likely enable the CX to extract the fly’s head-direction, maintain it with                    attractor dynamics, and combine it with other sensorimotor information to                    perform vector-based navigational computations. We also identified numerous                    pathways that may facilitate the selection of CX-driven behavioral patterns by                    context and internal state. The CX connectome provides a comprehensive blueprint                    necessary for a detailed understanding of network dynamics underlying sleep,                    flexible navigation, and state-dependent action selection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Septal cholinergic input to CA2 hippocampal region controls social novelty discrimination via nicotinic receptor-mediated disinhibition</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine (ACh), released in the hippocampus from fibers originating in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) complex, is crucial for learning and memory. The CA2 region of the hippocampus has received increasing attention in the context of social memory. However, the contribution of ACh to this process remains unclear. Here, we show that in mice, ACh controls social memory. Specifically, MSDB cholinergic neurons inhibition impairs social novelty discrimination, meaning the propensity of a mouse to interact with a novel rather than a familiar conspecific. This effect is mimicked by a selective antagonist of nicotinic AChRs delivered in CA2. Ex vivo recordings from hippocampal slices provide insight into the underlying mechanism, as activation of nAChRs by nicotine increases the excitatory drive to CA2 principal cells via disinhibition. In line with this observation, optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in MSDB increases the firing of CA2 principal cells in vivo. These results point to nAChRs as essential players in social novelty discrimination by controlling inhibition in the CA2 region.

                During brain development, axons must extend over great distances in a relatively short amount of time. How the subcellular architecture of the growing axon sustains the requirements for such rapid build-up of cellular constituents has remained elusive. Human axons have been particularly poorly accessible to imaging at high resolution in a near-native context. Here, we present a method that combines cryo-correlative light microscopy and electron tomography with human cerebral organoid technology to visualize growing axon tracts. Our data reveal a wealth of structural details on the arrangement of macromolecules, cytoskeletal components, and organelles in elongating axon shafts. In particular, the intricate shape of the endoplasmic reticulum is consistent with its role in fulfilling the high demand for lipid biosynthesis to support growth. Furthermore, the scarcity of ribosomes within the growing shaft suggests limited translational competence during expansion of this compartment. These findings establish our approach as a powerful resource for investigating the ultrastructure of defined neuronal compartments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Purified EDEM3 or EDEM1 alone produces determinant oligosaccharide structures from M8B in mammalian glycoprotein ERAD</a></h4>

              
                Sequential mannose trimming of <i>N</i>-glycan, from M9 to M8B and then to oligosaccharides exposing the a1,6-linked mannosyl residue (M7A, M6 and M5), facilitates endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (gpERAD). We previously showed that EDEM2 stably disulfide-bonded to the thioredoxin domain-containing protein TXNDC11 is responsible for the first step (George et al., 2020). Here, we show that EDEM3 and EDEM1 are responsible for the second step. Incubation of pyridylamine-labeled M8B with purified EDEM3 alone produced M7 (M7A and M7C), M6 and M5. EDEM1 showed a similar tendency, although much lower amounts of M6 and M5 were produced. Thus, EDEM3 is a major a1,2-mannosidase for the second step from M8B. Both EDEM3 and EDEM1 trimmed M8B from a glycoprotein efficiently. Our confirmation of the Golgi localization of MAN1B indicates that no other a1,2-mannosidase is required for gpERAD. Accordingly, we have established the entire route of oligosaccharide processing and the enzymes responsible.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fascin limits Myosin activity within Drosophila border cells to control substrate stiffness and promote migration</a></h4>

              
                A key regulator of collective cell migrations, which drive development and cancer metastasis, is substrate stiffness. Increased substrate stiffness promotes migration and is controlled by Myosin. Using <i>Drosophila</i> border cell migration as a model of collective cell migration, we identify, for the first time, that the actin bundling protein Fascin limits Myosin activity in vivo. Loss of Fascin results in: increased activated Myosin on the border cells and their substrate, the nurse cells; decreased border cell Myosin dynamics; and increased nurse cell stiffness as measured by atomic force microscopy. Reducing Myosin restores on-time border cell migration in <i>fascin</i> mutant follicles. Further, Fascin’s actin bundling activity is required to limit Myosin activation. Surprisingly, we find that Fascin regulates Myosin activity in the border cells to control nurse cell stiffness to promote migration. Thus, these data shift the paradigm from a substrate stiffness-centric model of regulating migration, to uncover that collectively migrating cells play a critical role in controlling the mechanical properties of their substrate in order to promote their own migration. This understudied means of mechanical regulation of migration is likely conserved across contexts and organisms, as Fascin and Myosin are common regulators of cell migration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visual pursuit behavior in mice maintains the pursued prey on the retinal region with least optic flow</a></h4>

              
                Mice have a large visual field that is constantly stabilized by vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) driven eye rotations that counter head-rotations. While maintaining their extensive visual coverage is advantageous for predator detection, mice also track and capture prey using vision. However, in the freely moving animal quantifying object location in the field of view is challenging. Here, we developed a method to digitally reconstruct and quantify the visual scene of freely moving mice performing a visually based prey capture task. By isolating the visual sense and combining a mouse eye optic model with the head and eye rotations, the detailed reconstruction of the digital environment and retinal features were projected onto the corneal surface for comparison, and updated throughout the behavior. By quantifying the spatial location of objects in the visual scene and their motion throughout the behavior, we show that the prey image consistently falls within a small area of the VOR-stabilized visual field. This functional focus coincides with the region of minimal optic flow within the visual field and consequently area of minimal motion-induced image-blur, as during pursuit mice ran directly toward the prey. The functional focus lies in the upper-temporal part of the retina and coincides with the reported high density-region of Alpha-ON sustained retinal ganglion cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Plasticity of olfactory bulb inputs mediated by dendritic NMDA-spikes in rodent piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                The piriform cortex (PCx) is essential for learning of odor information. The current view postulates odor learning in the PCx is mainly due to plasticity in intracortical (IC) synapses, while odor information from the olfactory bulb carried via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) is 'hardwired'. Here we revisit this notion by studying location and pathway dependent plasticity rules. We find that in contrast to the prevailing view, synaptic and optogenetically activated LOT synapses undergo strong and robust long-term potentiation (LTP) mediated by only few local NMDA-spikes delivered at theta frequency, while global spike timing dependent plasticity protocols (STDP) failed to induce LTP in these distal synapses. In contrast, IC synapses in apical and basal dendrites undergo plasticity with both NMDA-spikes and STDP protocols but to a smaller extent compared with LOT synapses. These results are consistent with a self-potentiating mechanism of odor information via NMDA-spikes which can form branch-specific memory traces of odors that can further associate with contextual IC information via STDP mechanisms to provide cognitive and emotional value to odors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Auditory sensory deprivation induced by noise exposure exacerbates cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Although association between hearing impairment and dementia has been widely documented by epidemiological studies, the role of auditory sensory deprivation in cognitive decline remains to be fully understood. To address this issue we investigated the impact of hearing loss on the onset and time-course of cognitive decline in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), that is the 3×Tg-AD mice and the underlying mechanisms. We found that hearing loss induced by noise exposure in the 3×Tg-AD mice before the phenotype is manifested caused persistent synaptic and morphological alterations in the auditory cortex. This was associated with earlier hippocampal dysfunction, increased tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and redox imbalance, along with anticipated memory deficits compared to the expected time-course of the neurodegenerative phenotype. Our data suggest that a mouse model of AD is more vulnerable to central damage induced by hearing loss and shows reduced ability to counteract noise-induced detrimental effects, which accelerates the neurodegenerative disease onset.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fusion of tethered membranes can be driven by Sec18/NSF and Sec17/αSNAP without HOPS</a></h4>

              
                Yeast vacuolar membrane fusion has been reconstituted with R, Qa, Qb, and Qc-family SNAREs, Sec17/αSNAP, Sec18/NSF, and the hexameric HOPS complex. HOPS tethers membranes and catalyzes SNARE assembly into RQaQbQc <i>trans</i>-complexes which zipper through their SNARE domains to promote fusion. Previously, we demonstrated that Sec17 and Sec18 can bypass the requirement of complete zippering for fusion (Song et al., 2021), but it has been unclear whether this activity of Sec17 and Sec18 is directly coupled to HOPS. HOPS can be replaced for fusion by a synthetic tether when the three Q-SNAREs are pre-assembled. We now report that fusion intermediates with arrested SNARE zippering, formed with a synthetic tether but without HOPS, support Sec17/Sec18-triggered fusion. This zippering-bypass fusion is thus a direct result of Sec17 and Sec18 interactions: with each other, with the platform of partially zippered SNAREs, and with the apposed tethered membranes. As these fusion elements are shared among all exocytic and endocytic traffic, Sec17 and Sec18 may have a general role in directly promoting fusion.

                Using a high-throughput mitochondrial phenotyping platform to quantify multiple mitochondrial features among molecularly-defined immune cell subtypes, we quantify the natural variation in citrate synthase, mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), and respiratory chain enzymatic activities in human neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, and naïve and memory T lymphocyte subtypes. In mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same individuals, we show to what extent mitochondrial measures are confounded by both cell type distributions and contaminating platelets. Cell subtype-specific measures among women and men spanning 4 decades of life indicate potential age- and sex-related differences, including an age-related elevation in mtDNAcn, which are masked or blunted in mixed PBMCs. Finally, a proof-of-concept, repeated-measures study in a single individual validates cell type differences and also reveals week-to-week changes in mitochondrial activities. Larger studies are required to validate and mechanistically extend these findings. These mitochondrial phenotyping data build upon established immunometabolic differences among leukocyte sub-populations, and provide foundational quantitative knowledge to develop interpretable blood-based assays of mitochondrial health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Virophages and retrotransposons colonize the genomes of a heterotrophic flagellate</a></h4>

              
                Virophages can parasitize giant DNA viruses and may provide adaptive anti-giant virus defense in unicellular eukaryotes. Under laboratory conditions, the virophage mavirus integrates into the nuclear genome of the marine flagellate <i>Cafeteria burkhardae</i> and reactivates upon superinfection with the giant virus CroV. In natural systems, however, the prevalence and diversity of host-virophage associations has not been systematically explored. Here, we report dozens of integrated virophages in four globally sampled <i>C. burkhardae</i> strains that constitute up to 2% of their host genomes. These <span class="underline">e</span>ndogenous <span class="underline">ma</span>virus-<span class="underline">l</span>ike <span class="underline">e</span>lements (EMALEs) separated into eight types based on GC-content, nucleotide similarity, and coding potential and carried diverse promoter motifs implicating interactions with different giant viruses. Between host strains, some EMALE insertion loci were conserved indicating ancient integration events, whereas the majority of insertion sites were unique to a given host strain suggesting that EMALEs are active and mobile. Furthermore, we uncovered a unique association between EMALEs and a group of tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons, revealing yet another layer of parasitism in this nested microbial system. Our findings show that virophages are widespread and dynamic in wild <i>Cafeteria</i> populations, supporting their potential role in antiviral defense in protists.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The chromatin-remodeling enzyme Smarca5 regulates erythrocyte aggregation via Keap1-Nrf2 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Although thrombosis has been extensively studied using various animal models, our understanding of the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, using zebrafish model, we demonstrated that <i>smarca5</i>-deficient red blood cells (RBCs) formed blood clots in the caudal vein plexus. We further used the anti-thrombosis drugs to treat <i>smarca5<sup>zko1049a</sup></i> embryos and found that a thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, partially prevented blood clot formation in <i>smarca5<sup>zko1049a</sup></i>. To explore the regulatory mechanism of <i>smarca5</i> in RBC homeostasis, we profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape and transcriptome features in RBCs from <i>smarca5<sup>zko1049a</sup></i> and their siblings and found that both the chromatin accessibility at the <i>keap1a</i> promoter and expression of <i>keap1a</i> were decreased. Keap1 is a suppressor protein of Nrf2, which is a major regulator of oxidative responses. We further identified that the expression of <i>hmox1a</i>, a downstream target of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, was markedly increased upon <i>smarca5</i> deletion. Importantly, overexpression of <i>keap1a</i> or knockdown of <i>hmox1a</i> partially rescued the blood clot formation, suggesting that the disrupted Keap1-Nrf2 signaling is responsible for the RBC aggregation in <i>smarca5</i> mutants. Together, our study using zebrafish <i>smarca5</i> mutants characterizes a novel role for <i>smarca5</i> in RBC aggregation, which may provide a new venous thrombosis animal model to support drug screening and pre-clinical therapeutic assessments to treat thrombosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-EM reconstructions of inhibitor-bound SMG1 kinase reveal an autoinhibitory state dependent on SMG8</a></h4>

              
                The PI3K-related kinase (PIKK) SMG1 monitors progression of metazoan nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by phosphorylating the RNA helicase UPF1. Previous work has shown that the activity of SMG1 is impaired by small molecule inhibitors, is reduced by the SMG1 interactors SMG8 and SMG9, and is downregulated by the so-called SMG1 insertion domain. However, the molecular basis for this complex regulatory network has remained elusive. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of human SMG1-9 and SMG1-8-9 complexes bound to either a SMG1 inhibitor or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue at overall resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 3.6 Å. These structures reveal the basis with which a small molecule inhibitor preferentially targets SMG1 over other PIKKs. By comparison with our previously reported substrate-bound structure (Langer et al. 2020), we show that the SMG1 insertion domain can exert an autoinhibitory function by directly blocking the substrate binding path as well as overall access to the SMG1 kinase active site. Together with biochemical analysis, our data indicate that SMG1 autoinhibition is stabilized by the presence of SMG8. Our results explain the specific inhibition of SMG1 by an ATP-competitive small molecule, provide insights into regulation of its kinase activity within the NMD pathway, and expand the understanding of PIKK regulatory mechanisms in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Patched 1 reduces the accessibility of cholesterol in the outer leaflet of membranes</a></h4>

              
                A long-standing mystery in vertebrate Hedgehog signaling is how Patched 1 (PTCH1), the receptor for Hedgehog ligands, inhibits the activity of Smoothened, the protein that transmits the signal across the membrane. We previously proposed (Kinnebrew et al., 2019) that PTCH1 inhibits Smoothened by depleting accessible cholesterol from the ciliary membrane. To directly test the effect of PTCH1 on accessible cholesterol, we measured the transport activity of PTCH1 using an imaging-based assay to follow the kinetics of cholesterol extraction from the plasma membrane of live cells by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. PTCH1 depletes accessible cholesterol in the outer leaflet of the membrane in a manner regulated by its ligand Sonic Hedgehog and the transmembrane potassium gradient. We propose that PTCH1 moves cholesterol from the outer to the inner leaflet of the membrane in exchange for potassium ion export. Our results show that proteins can change accessible cholesterol levels in membranes to regulate signaling reaction.

                The efficiency of sensory coding is affected both by past events (adaptation) and by expectation of future events (prediction). Here we employed a novel visual stimulus paradigm to determine whether expectation influences orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex. We used two-photon calcium imaging (GCaMP6f) in awake mice viewing visual stimuli with different levels of predictability. The stimuli consisted of sequences of grating stimuli that randomly shifted in orientation or systematically rotated with occasionally unexpected rotations. At the single neuron and population level, there was significantly enhanced orientation-selective response to unexpected visual stimuli through a boost in gain, which was prominent in awake mice but also present to a lesser extent under anesthesia. We implemented a computational model to demonstrate how neuronal responses were best characterized when adaptation and expectation parameters were combined. Our results demonstrated that adaptation and prediction have unique signatures on activity of V1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Wernicke conundrum revisited: evidence from connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping in post-stroke aphasia</a></h4>

              
                The classical assumption that word and sentence comprehension deficits in stroke aphasia follow from damage to Wernicke's area has been questioned following discrepant results in primary progressive aphasia. We tested the hypothesis of Mesulam et al. (2015; 2019) that word and sentence comprehension deficits in stroke aphasia result from 'double disconnection' due to white matter damage: word comprehension deficits resulting from disconnection of the anterior temporal lobe and sentence comprehension deficits resulting from disconnection of the frontal lobe. We performed lesion-deficit correlations, including connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping, in four large, partially overlapping groups of English-speaking chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors. After removing variance due to object recognition and associative semantic processing, the same middle and posterior temporal lobe regions were implicated both in word comprehension deficits (N = 180) and complex noncanonical sentence comprehension deficits (N = 131). Repetition deficits (N = 218) were associated with damage to the posterior temporal lobe and superior longitudinal fasciculus, and agrammatic production (N = 92) was associated with damage to the posterior middle frontal gyrus. Connectome lesion-symptom mapping revealed similar temporal-occipital white matter disconnections for impaired word and noncanonical sentence comprehension, including the temporal pole. We found additional significant temporal-parietal disconnections for noncanonical sentence comprehension deficits, which may indicate a role for phonological working memory in processing complex syntax, but no significant frontal-temporal or frontal-parietal disconnections. By contrast, repetition deficits were associated with a very large set of significant disconnections, including frontal-temporal disconnections, and agrammatic production was associated primarily with significant disconnections within the frontal lobe. Our results largely agree with the classical notion that damage to Wernicke's area causes both word and sentence comprehension deficits in stroke-based aphasia, suggest a supporting role for temporal pole in both word and sentence comprehension, and speak against the hypothesis that sentence comprehension deficits in Wernicke's aphasia result from frontal-temporal or frontal-parietal disconnections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-range connections mirror and link microarchitectural and cognitive hierarchies in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Core features of higher-order cognition are hypothesized to be implemented via distributed cortical networks that are linked via long-range connections. However, these connections are biologically expensive, and it is unknown how the computational advantages long-range connections provide overcome the associated wiring costs. Our study investigated this question by exploring the relationship between long-range functional connections and local cortical microarchitecture. Specifically, our work (i) profiled distant cortical connectivity using resting-state fMRI and cortico-cortical geodesic distance mapping, (ii) assessed how long-range connections reflect local brain microarchitecture, and (iii) studied the microarchitectural similarity of regions connected through long-range connections. Analysis of two independent datasets indicated that sensory and motor areas had more clustered short-range connectivity patterns, while transmodal association cortices, including regions of the default mode network, were characterized by distributed, long-range connections. Confirmatory meta-analysis suggested that this topographical difference mirrored a shift in cognitive function, from perception/action towards emotional and social cognitive processing. Analysis of myelin-sensitive in vivo MRI in the same participants as well as post mortem histology and gene expression established that gradients in functional connectivity distance are paralleled by those present in cortical microarchitecture. Moreover, long-range connections were found to link together spatially remote regions of association cortex with an unexpectedly similar microarchitecture. These findings provide novel insights into how the organization of distributed functional networks in transmodal association cortex contribute to cognition, because they suggest that long-range connections link together distant islands of association cortex with similar microstructural features.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Desire and Craving ratings vary significantly for healthy alcohol consumers: Differences in semantic interpretation?</a></h4>

              
                Craving is a central concept in alcohol, and other substance, research. Beginning in 1955 the World Health Organization outlined a working definition of the term to be used in research and clinical settings. However, the semantic interpretation of craving as a concept is not widely agreed upon. Since the publication of this first craving definition, a handful of studies have been conducted to investigate differences in operational definitions of craving, and have demonstrated a lack of agreement between studies and across research subjects. With this background as evidence, our research group investigated, when left to their own semantic understanding of the terms, if regular alcohol consumers would rate craving for alcohol and desire for alcohol in similar ways using related descriptors. Thirty-nine healthy, non-binging regular alcohol consumers were studied across periods of their typical alcohol consumption and imposed alcohol abstinence, collecting ratings of desire and craving for alcohol approximately every two hours across the two experimental periods, and during neutral and alcohol related imagery viewing. Among these non-binging regular drinkers, ratings of desire and craving for alcohol are consistently different while drinking according to a persons typical routine or abstaining, throughout the day, and when viewing alcohol cue imagery.

                In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multitude of genetic risk factors and early biomarkers are known. Nevertheless, the causal factors responsible for initiating cognitive decline in AD remain controversial. Toxic plaques and tangles correlate with progressive neuropathology, yet disruptions in circuit activity emerge before their deposition in AD models and patients. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are potential candidates for dysregulating cortical excitability, as they display altered AP firing before neighboring excitatory neurons in prodromal AD. Here we report a novel mechanism responsible for PV hypoexcitability in young adult familial AD mice. We found that biophysical modulation of K+ channels, but not changes in mRNA expression, are responsible for dampened excitability. These K+ conductances could efficiently regulate near-threshold AP firing, resulting in gamma-frequency specific network hyperexcitability. Our findings suggest that posttranslational modulation of ion channels can reshape cortical network activity prior to changes in their gene expression in early AD.

                Deep neural networks (DNNs) are promising models of the cortical computations supporting human object recognition. However, despite their ability to explain a significant portion of variance in neural data, the agreement between models and brain representational dynamics is far from perfect. Here, we address this issue by asking which representational features are currently unaccounted for in neural timeseries data, estimated for multiple areas of the human ventral stream via source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. In particular, we focus on the ability of visuo-semantic models, consisting of human-generated labels of higher-level object features and categories, to explain variance beyond the explanatory power of DNNs alone. We report a gradual transition in the importance of visuo-semantic features from early to higher-level areas along the ventral stream. While early visual areas are better explained by DNN features, higher-level cortical dynamics are best accounted for by visuo-semantic models. These results suggest that current DNNs fail to fully capture the visuo-semantic features represented in higher-level human visual cortex and suggest a path towards more accurate models of ventral stream computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subtype transcriptomic profiling of myeloid cells in Alzheimer Disease brain illustrates the diversity in active microglia phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is hypothesized to contribute to disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Microglia demonstrate heterogeneous states in health and disease, with proposed beneficial, harmful, and disease specific subtypes. Defining the spectrum of microglia phenotypes is an important step in rational design of neuroinflammation modulating therapies. To facilitate improved phenotype resolution and group comparisons based on disease state we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq on more than 120,000 microglia nuclei from AD and control dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We identify clusters of microglia enriched for biological pathways implicating defined myeloid roles. We detected several previously unrecognized microglia populations in human AD brain, including three internalization and trafficking subtypes that were heterogeneous in their metabolic and inflammatory signatures. One of these endolysosomal subtypes is larger in AD individuals and was uniquely enriched for genes involved in nucleic acid detection and activation of interferon signaling. This inflammatory endolysosomal cluster also differentially regulated expression of genes associated with AD risk by genome wide association studies. We also identified a cluster of microglia with upregulated cell cycle and DNA repair genes that is proportionately larger in control individuals. Within cluster comparisons demonstrate that in AD brain, homeostatic microglia subpopulations upregulate inflammatory gene expression. These results highlight the heterogenous nature of the microglia response to AD pathology and will inform efforts to target specific subtypes of microglia in the development of novel AD therapies.

                This is a study of the phenomenal geometries constructed in the Riemannian geometry framework from simulated iso-disparity conics in the horizontal visual plane of the binocular system with the asymmetric eyes (AEs). The iso-disparity conic's arcs in the Cyclopean direction are the frontal visual geodesics. For the eyes' resting vergence posture, which depends on parameters of the AE, the iso-disparity conics are frontal straight lines in physical space. For all other fixations, the iso-disparity conics consist of families of the ellipses or hyperbolas depending on both the AE's parameters and the bifoveal fixation. An assumption underlying the relevant architecture of the human visual system is combined with results from simulated iso-disparity straight lines, giving the relative depth as a function of the distance. This establishes the metric tensor in binocular space of fixations for the eyes' resting vergence posture. The resulting geodesics in the gaze direction, give the distance to the horizon and zero curvature. For all other fixations, only the sign of the curvature can be inferred from the global behavior of the simulated iso-disparity conics.

                Background: Evoked potential (ERP) markers extracted from an EEG exam can provide novel sources of information regarding brain function allowing changes in cognition, from conditions such as concussion or unhealthy aging, to be measured and tracked over time. Age-related targets can provide useful guides for practitioners, trainers, and patients seeking to optimize and track brain function over time. Objective 1: To compare age-related changes in auditory P300 metrics of latencies and amplitudes collected in the course of routine clinical evaluations with published trends from research. Objective 2: To establish within-person test-retest variances for these P300 metrics. Objective 3: To validate a method for presenting age-stratified target ranges of P300 metrics. Participants: One thousand seven-hundred and seventy-eight reference subjects aged 13-90. Methods: Audio P300 was measured as part of a health screening exam for studies through Colorado University, Children's Hospital Colorado, Boone Heart Institute, WAVi Co., and various clinics alongside other clinical evaluations. Results: The age-related trends in both the P300 latency and amplitude measured in clinic match the age-related trends from previous research. In particular, the 2 control group endpoints at 20 and 90 years match the linear slopes predicted for age-related decline from early studies, and the inclusion of all ages produces a maturation prediction of a recent meta analysis where metrics peak near 20 years of age. Large between-person variances are observed across all studies but within-person variances remain consistent with previous studies. Conclusion: In-clinic measures of P300 latency and amplitude corroborate the age-related trends of published research taken over the last several decades. Large between-person variance remains, leaving P300 best suited for within-person comparison.

                Sleep insufficiency or decreased quality have been associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) already in its preclinical stages. Whether such traits are also present in rodent models of the disease has been poorly addressed, somewhat disabling the preclinical exploration of sleep-based therapeutic interventions for AD. We investigated age-dependent sleep-wake phenotype of a widely used mouse model of AD, the Tg2576 line. We implanted electroencephalography/electromyography headpieces into 6 months old (plaque-free, n=10) and 11 months old (moderate plaque-burdened, n=10) Tg2576 and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice and recorded vigilance states for 24 hours. Tg2576 mice exhibited significantly increased wakefulness and decreased non-rapid eye movement sleep over a 24-hour period compared to WT mice at 6, but not at 11 months of age. Concomitantly, delta power appeared decreased in 6-month old Tg2576 mice in comparison to age-matched WT controls, yielding a reduced slow-wave energy phenotype in the young mutants. Lack of genotype-related differences over 24 hours in overall sleep-wake phenotype at 11 months of age appears to be the result of the natural aging of WT mice. Therefore, our results indicate that at plaque-free stages of the disease, diminished sleep quality is present in Tg2576 mice which resembles aged healthy controls, suggesting an early-onset of sleep-wake deterioration in murine AD. Whether such disturbances in the natural patterns of sleep could in turn worsen disease progression warrants further exploration.

                Objective: Stress is a motivator to consume alcohol, a well-documented relapse risk, and is known to differentially affect biological and psychological processes as people age. Because alcohol consumption is known to decrease stress and increase affect, this study examined differences in ratings of stress and affect across the day in middle-aged versus younger adults who regularly consumed alcohol. Methods: A sample of males and females including younger (n=17) and middle-aged (n=18) drinkers was studied across two experimental periods: a 3-day period of usual drinking and a 3-day period of abstinence from alcohol. We also measured resting levels of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSArest), since it is a well-documented biomarker of stress and known to decrease with age. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings across periods of normal drinking and abstinence were modeled using hierarchical regression to assess differences in stress and affect throughout days of abstinence and normal drinking between the two age groups. Results: As anticipated, middle-aged participants had lower RSArest than those who were younger. Our analyses showed that middle-aged adults experienced a significant reduction in stress following drinking while no such effect was observed in the younger adults. Although the middle-aged adults showed overall lower stress, generally they also expressed higher affect than younger adults. Conclusions: Despite the mitigating role of alcohol on stress in the middle-aged group and the fact that they had higher affect than the younger adults, their lower levels of RSArest and higher daily reports of stress could pose a risk for chronic alcohol consumption.

                Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) have become a premier neuroscience research tool in the past decade for their utility in providing reversible manipulations of cellular activity following experimenter-controlled delivery of a DREADD-specific ligand. However, the commonly used DREADD ligand, clozapine-N- oxide (CNO), has metabolic and off-target effects that may confound experimental results and interpretations. Moreover, CNO has relatively poor affinity for DREADD receptors, which necessitates high doses for systemic administration applications. New DREADD ligands aim to reduce metabolic and potential off-target effects while maintaining strong efficacy for the designer receptors. Recently a novel DREADD ligand, deschloroclozapine (DCZ), was shown to induce chemogenetic-mediated cellular and behavioral effects in mice and monkeys without detectable side effects. While promising, further testing of DCZ across species and experimental paradigms is warranted. The goal of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of systemic DCZ for DREADD-based chemogenetic manipulations in behavioral and slice electrophysiological applications in rats. We demonstrate that a relatively low dose of DCZ (0.1 mg/kg) supports excitatory DREADD- mediated cFos induction, DREADD-mediated inhibition of a central amygdala-dependent behavior, and DREADD-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity in a slice electrophysiology preparation. In addition, we show that this dose of DCZ does not alter gross locomotor activity or induce a place preference/aversion in control rats without DREADD expression. Together, our findings support the use of systemic DCZ for DREADD-based manipulations in rats, and provide evidence that DCZ is a superior alternative to CNO.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod increases ethanol self-administration and induces expression of toll-like receptor related genes</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is growing evidence that immune signaling may be involved in both the causes and consequences of alcohol abuse. Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression is increased by alcohol consumption and is implicated in AUD, and specifically TLR7 may play an important role in ethanol consumption. Methods: We administered the TLR7-specific agonist imiquimod in male and female Long-Evans rats to determine 1) gene expression changes in brain regions involved in alcohol reinforcement, the nucleus accumbens core and anterior insular cortex, in rats with and without an alcohol history, and 2) whether TLR7 activation could modulate operant alcohol self-administration. Results: Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) was dramatically increased in both sexes at both 2 and 24 h post-injection regardless of alcohol history, while TLR3 and 7 gene expression changes were region- and sex-specific. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF was increased 24h post-injection in rats with an alcohol self-administration history but this effect did not persist after four injections, suggesting molecular tolerance. In both males and females, ethanol consumption was increased 24 h after imiquimod injections with sex-specific differences: in females this effect emerged following the first injection but in males this increase did not occur until the third injection, suggesting sex differences in adaptation to repeated TLR7 activation. Notably, imiquimod reliably induced weight loss, indicating that sickness behavior persisted across repeated injections. Conclusion: These findings show that TLR7 activation can modulate alcohol drinking in an operant self-administration paradigm, and suggest that TLR7 and IRF7 signaling pathways may be a viable druggable target for treatment of AUD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Involvement of mechanical cues in the migration of Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone during neocortical development</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence points to coordinated action of chemical and mechanical cues during brain development. At early stages of neocortical development, angiogenic factors and chemokines such as CXCL12, ephrins, and semaphorins assume crucial roles in orchestrating neuronal migration and axon elongation of postmitotic neurons. Here we explore the intrinsic mechanical properties of the developing marginal zone of the pallium in the migratory pathways and brain distribution of the pioneer Cajal-Retzius cells. These pioneer neurons are generated in several proliferative regions in the developing brain (e.g., the cortical hem and the pallial subpallial boundary) and migrate tangentially in the preplate/marginal zone covering the upper portion of the neocortex. These cells play crucial roles in correct neocortical layer formation by secreting several molecules such as Reelin. Our results indicate that the motogenic properties of Cajal-Retzius cells and their perinatal distribution in the marginal zone are also modulated by both chemical and mechanical factors, by the specific mechanical properties of Cajal-Retzius cells, and by the differential stiffness of the migratory routes. Indeed, cells originating in the cortical hem display higher migratory capacities than those generated in the pallial subpallial boundary which may be involved in the differential distribution of these cells in the dorsal-lateral axis in the developing marginal zone.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the genetic and environmental basis of head micromovements during MRI</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Head motion during magnetic resonance imaging is heritable. Further, it shares phenotypical and genetic variance with body mass index (BMI) and impulsivity. Yet, to what extent this trait is related to single genetic variants and physiological or behavioral features is unknown. We investigated the genetic basis of head motion in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. Further, we tested whether physiological or psychological measures, such as respiratory rate or impulsivity, mediated the relationship between BMI and head motion. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis for mean and maximal framewise head displacement (FD) in seven population neuroimaging cohorts (UK Biobank, LIFE-Adult, Rotterdam Study cohort 1-3, Austrian Stroke Prevention Family Study, Study of Health in Pomerania; total N = 35.109). We performed a pre-registered analysis to test whether respiratory rate, respiratory volume, self-reported impulsivity and heart rate mediated the relationship between BMI and mean FD in LIFE-Adult. Results: No variant reached genome-wide significance for neither mean nor maximal FD. Neither physiological nor psychological measures mediated the relationship between BMI and head motion. Conclusion: Based on these findings from a large meta-GWAS and pre-registered follow-up study, we conclude that the previously reported genetic correlation between BMI and head motion relies on polygenic variation, and that neither psychological nor simple physiological parameters explain a substantial amount of variance in the association of BMI and head motion. Future imaging studies should thus rigorously control for head motion at acquisition and during preprocessing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Internally Generated Time in the Rodent Hippocampus is Logarithmically Compressed</a></h4>

              
                The Weber-Fechner law proposes that our perceived sensory input increases with physical input on a logarithmic scale. Hippocampal "time cells" carry a record of recent experience by firing sequentially during a circumscribed period of time after a triggering stimulus. Different cells have "time fields" at different delays up to at least tens of seconds. Past studies suggest that time cells represent a compressed timeline by demonstrating that fewer time cells fire late in the delay and their time fields are wider. This paper asks whether the compression of time cells obeys the Weber-Fechner Law. Time cells were studied with a hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously accounts for the firing pattern at the trial level, cell level, and population level. This procedure allows separate estimates of the within-trial receptive field width and the across-trial variability. The analysis at the trial level suggests the time cells represent an internally coherent timeline as a group. Furthermore, even after isolating across-trial variability, time field width increases linearly with delay. Finally, we find that the time cell population is distributed evenly on a logarithmic time scale. Together, these findings provide strong quantitative evidence that the internal neural temporal representation is logarithmically compressed and obeys a neural instantiation of the Weber- Fechner Law.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct Representations of Body and Head motion are Dynamically Encoded by Purkinje cell Populations in the Macaque Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                The ability to accurately control our posture and perceive spatial orientation during self-motion requires knowledge of the motion of both the head and body. However, whereas the vestibular sensors and nuclei directly encode head motion, no sensors directly encode body motion. Instead, the integration of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs is necessary to transform vestibular information into the body-centric reference frame required for postural control. The anterior vermis of the cerebellum is thought to play a key role in this transformation, yet how its Purkinje cells integrate these inputs or what information they dynamically encode during self-motion remains unknown. Here we recorded the activity of individual anterior vermis Purkinje cells in alert monkeys during passively applied whole-body, body-under-head, and head-on-body rotations. Most neurons dynamically encoded an intermediate representation of self-motion between head and body motion. Notably, these neurons responded to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation and showed considerable heterogeneity in their response dynamics. Furthermore, their vestibular responses demonstrated tuning in response to changes in head-on-body position. In contrast, a small remaining percentage of neurons sensitive only to vestibular stimulation unambiguously encoded head-in-space motion across conditions. Using a simple population model, we establish that combining responses from 40 Purkinje cells can explain the responses of their target neurons in deep cerebellar nuclei across all self-motion conditions. We propose that the observed heterogeneity in Purkinje cells underlies the cerebellum's capacity to compute the dynamic representation of body motion required to ensure accurate postural control and perceptual stability in our daily lives.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social-affective features drive human representations of observed actions</a></h4>

              
                Humans observe actions performed by others in many different visual and social settings. What features do we extract and attend when we view such complex scenes, and how are they processed in the brain? To answer these questions, we curated two large-scale sets of naturalistic videos of everyday actions and estimated their perceived similarity in two behavioral experiments. We normed and quantified a large range of visual, action-related and social-affective features across the stimulus sets. Using a cross-validated variance partitioning analysis, we found that social-affective features predicted similarity judgments better than, and independently of, visual and action features in both behavioral experiments. Next, we conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, which revealed a sustained correlation between neural responses to videos and their behavioral similarity. Visual, action, and social-affective features predicted neural patterns at early, intermediate and late stages respectively during this behaviorally relevant time window. Together, these findings show that social-affective features are important for perceiving naturalistic actions, and are extracted at the final stage of a temporal gradient in the brain.

                Exposures to a hypomagnetic field can affect biological processes. Recently, it has been observed that hypomagnetic field exposure can adversely affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice. In the same study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hypomagnetic field effects has been demonstrated. However, the mechanistic reasons behind this effect are not clear. This study proposes a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of ROS production and the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a hypomagnetic field. The results of our calculations favor a singlet-born radical pair over a triplet-born radical pair. Our model predicts hypomagnetic field effects on the triplet/singlet yield of comparable strength as the effects observed in experimental studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our predictions are also in qualitative agreement with experimental results on superoxide concentration and other observed ROS effects. We also predict the effects of applied magnetic fields and oxygen isotopic substitution on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings strengthen the idea that nature might harness quantum resources in the context of the brain.

                Biological neurons integrate their inputs on dendrites using a diverse range of non-linear functions. However the majority of artificial neural networks (ANNs) ignore biological neurons' structural complexity and instead use simplified point neurons. Can dendritic properties add value to ANNs? In this paper we investigate this question in the context of continual learning, an area where ANNs suffer from catastrophic forgetting (i.e., ANNs are unable to learn new information without erasing what they previously learned). We propose that dendritic properties can help neurons learn context-specific patterns and invoke highly sparse context-specific subnetworks. Within a continual learning scenario, these task-specific subnetworks interfere minimally with each other and, as a result, the network remembers previous tasks significantly better than standard ANNs. We then show that by combining dendritic networks with Synaptic Intelligence (a biologically motivated method for complex weights) we can achieve significant resilience to catastrophic forgetting, more than either technique can achieve on its own. Our neuron model is directly inspired by the biophysics of sustained depolarization following dendritic NMDA spikes. Our research sheds light on how biological properties of neurons can be used to solve scenarios that are typically impossible for traditional ANNs to solve.

                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition that affects over 10 million people across the world, causing tremors and muscle weakness. Its mechanisms are unknown, but one key feature is selective cell death: neurons in the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta (SNc) die, but their neighbors, the cells in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), remain healthy. To study this phenomenon, we used an established single neuron model of the SNc, adapting its biophysical and bioenergetic properties to match that of the VTA. We discovered that reducing calcium influx correlates with higher ATP and lower ROS concentrations in the cell, suggesting in silico the importance of calcium influx in metabolic stress and selective vulnerability for Parkinson's Disease. Future efforts may target calcium channel inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, although caution is needed with potential metabolic side effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Constructing the hierarchy of predictive auditory sequences in the marmoset brain</a></h4>

              
                Our brains constantly generate predictions of sensory input that are compared with actual inputs, propagate the prediction-errors through a hierarchy of brain regions, and subsequently update the internal predictions of the world. However, the essential feature of predictive coding, the notion of hierarchical depth and its neural mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the hierarchical depth of predictive auditory processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density whole-brain electrocorticography (ECoG) in marmoset monkeys during an auditory local-global paradigm in which the temporal regularities of the stimuli were designed at two hierarchical levels. The prediction-errors and prediction updates were examined as neural responses to auditory mismatches and omissions. Using fMRI, we identified a hierarchical gradient along the auditory pathway: midbrain and sensory regions represented local, short-time-scale predictive processing followed by associative auditory regions, whereas anterior temporal and prefrontal areas represented global, long-time-scale sequence processing. The complementary ECoG recordings confirmed the activations at cortical surface areas and further differentiated the signals of prediction-error and update, which were transmitted via putatively bottom-up {gamma} and top-down {beta} oscillations, respectively. Furthermore, omission responses caused by absence of input, reflecting solely the two levels of prediction signals that are unique to the hierarchical predictive coding framework, demonstrated the hierarchical predictions in the auditory, temporal, and prefrontal areas. Thus, our findings support the hierarchical predictive coding framework, and outline how neural circuits and spatiotemporal dynamics are used to represent and arrange a hierarchical structure of auditory sequences in the marmoset brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal changes in resting state networks induced by propofol anesthesia.</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortical changes associated with propofol induced unconsciousness remain unknown. While the anesthetic agent affects the entire cerebral cortices, there might be spatiotemporal differences in cortical changes. In particular, we hypothesized that there might be spatiotemporal differences in cortical changes with propofol anesthesia. To address this hypothesis, we investigated power spectrum changes in electrocorticography (ECoG) signals obtained during the induction phase from awake state to unconsciousness. We found that, 1) the power increased in the range of frequencies < 46 Hz (delta to low gamma), and decreased in the range (62 to 150) Hz (high gamma), in global channels during the induction phase. 2) The power in the frontoparietal network (FPN), specifically the superior parietal lobule and prefrontal cortex, started to change early, but took a long time to completely change. However, the power in the default mode network (DMN) started to change late, but took a short time to completely change. 3) The power change ({Delta}Power) in the DMN was more conspicuous than that of the dorsal attention network (DAN) in high gamma frequency. Considering that the FPN is involved in communication with the external world and that DMN is involved in communication with self, loss of consciousness induced by general anesthesia results from first, disrupted communication between self and external world, and is then followed by disrupted communication within self, with decreased activity of the FPN, and later, attenuated activity of the DMN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Preservation of neural synchrony at peak alpha frequency via global synaptic scaling compensates for white matter structural decline over adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                We propose that preservation of functional integration, estimated from measures of neural synchrony, is a key neurocompensatory mechanism associated with healthy human ageing. To support this proposal, we demonstrate how phase-locking at peak alpha frequency from Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is invariant over lifespan in a large cohort of human participants, aged 18-88 years. Using empirically derived connection topologies from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, we create an in-silico model of whole-brain alpha dynamics. We show that enhancing inter-areal coupling can cancel the effect of increased axonal transmission delay associated with age-related degeneration of white matter tracts and thus, preserve neural synchrony. Together with analytical solutions for non-biological all-to-all connection scenarios, our model establishes the theoretical principles by which frequency slowing with age, frequently observed in the alpha band in diverse populations, can be viewed as an epiphenomenon of the underlying neurocompensatory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nuclear Export of Drosophila PERIOD contributes to temperature compensation of the circadian clock</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks are self-sustained molecular oscillators controlling daily changes of behavioral activity and physiology. For functional reliability and precision the frequency of these molecular oscillations must be stable at different environmental temperatures, known as  temperature compensation. Despite being an intrinsic property of all circadian clocks, this phenomenon is not well understood at the molecular level. Here we use behavioral and molecular approaches to characterize a novel mutation in the period ( per ) clock gene of Drosophila melanogaster , which alters a predicted nuclear export sequence (NES) of the PER protein. We show that this new per I530A allele leads to progressively longer behavioral periods and clock oscillations with increasing temperature in both clock neurons and peripheral clock cells. While the mutant PER I530A protein shows normal circadian fluctuations and post-translational modifications at cool temperatures, increasing temperatures lead to both, severe amplitude dampening and hypophosphorylation of PER I530A . We further show that PER I530A displays reduced repressor activity at warmer temperatures, presumably because it cannot inactivate the transcription factor CLOCK (CLK). With increasing temperatures nuclear accumulation of PER I530A within clock neurons is increased, suggesting that PER is normally exported out of the nucleus at warm temperatures. Consequently, downregulating the nuclear export factor CRM1 also leads to temperature-dependent changes of behavioral rhythms. In summary, our results suggest that the PER NES and the nuclear export of clock proteins play an important role in temperature compensation of the Drosophila circadian clock.

	<p>Gulf War illness (GWI) encompasses a constellation of persistent debilitating symptoms associated with significant changes in central nervous system (CNS) and immune functioning. Currently, there is no validated biomarker for GWI risk susceptibility. Given the impact of immune responses linked to GWI symptomology, genetic variability that causes persistent inflammatory/immune alterations may be key. This Boston University-based Gulf War Illness Consortium (GWIC) study investigated the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in variants of immune and pain genetic markers IL1B, IL2, IL6, IL6R, IL10, TNF, TGF, TLR2, TLR4, MD2, MYD88, BDNF, CRP, ICE, COMT and OPRM1 on GWI occurrence in a Caucasian subset of Gulf War (GW) veterans with (cases, n = 170) and without (controls, n = 34) GWI. Logistic regression modeling created a prediction model of GWI risk that associated genetic variability in TGF (rs1800469, p = 0.009), IL6R (rs8192284, p = 0.004) and TLR4 (rs4986791, p = 0.013) with GWI occurrence. This prediction model was specific and sensitive, with a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 71.4%. This is the first report of immune genetic variability being predictive of GWI and warrants validation in larger independent cohorts. Future reports will present interactions of these genetic risk factors with other characteristics of GW service.</p>

	<p>In this article, we detail the advantages of self-face identification latencies over more traditional tests of mirror self-recognition. Using reaction time latencies (measured in milliseconds) to identify different dimensions of the self, instead of relying on a simple dichotomous pass/fail mirror mark-test outcome, enables investigators to examine individual differences in self-processing time. This is a significant methodological step forward with important implications. The point of departure for our article is to detail research we and others have conducted on latencies for self-face identification, to show how self-processing occurs in the right side of the brain, how schizophrenia is a self-processing disorder, how self-face reaction time latencies implicate the existence of an underlying multiple modal self-processing system, and to explore ideas for future research.</p>

	<p>Purpose of review: To provide an update on paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), the involved antibodies and tumors, as well as management strategies. Recent findings: PCD represents the second most common presentation of the recently established class of immune mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs). Although rare in general, PCD is one of the most frequent paraneoplastic presentations and characterized clinically by a rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome. In recent years, several antibodies have been described in association with the clinical syndrome related to PCD; their clinical significance, however, has yet to be determined. The 2021 updated diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic neurologic symptoms help to establish the diagnosis of PCD, direct cancer screening, and to evaluate the presence of these newly identified antibodies. Recognition of the clinical syndrome and prompt identification of a specific antibody are essential for early detection of an underlying malignancy and initiation of an appropriate treatment, which represents the best opportunity to modulate the course of the disease. As clinical symptoms can precede tumor diagnosis by years, co-occurrence of specific symptoms and antibodies should prompt continuous surveillance of the patient. Summary: We provide an in-depth overview on PCD, summarize recent findings related to PCD, and highlight the transformed diagnostic approach.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented public health emergency, with consequences at the political, social, and economic levels. Mental health services have been called to play a key role in facing the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of the general population. In the period March-May 2020, an online survey was implemented as part of the Covid Mental Health Trial (COMET), a multicentric collaborative study carried out in Italy, one of the Western countries most severely hit by the pandemic. The present study aims to investigate the use of mental health resources during the first wave of the pandemic. The final sample consisted of 20,712 participants, mainly females (N = 14,712, 71%) with a mean age of 40.4 ± 14.3 years. Access to mental health services was reported in 7.7% of cases. Among those referred to mental health services, in 93.9% of cases (N = 1503 subjects) a psychological assessment was requested and in 15.7% of cases (N = 252) a psychiatric consultation. People reporting higher levels of perceived loneliness (OR 1.079, 95% CI 1.056–1.101, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), practicing smart-working (OR 1.122, 95% CI 0.980–1.285, p = 0.095), using avoidant (OR 1.586, 95% CI 1.458–1.725, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and approach (OR 1.215, 95% CI 1.138–1.299, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) coping strategies more frequently accessed mental health services. On the other hand, having higher levels of perceived social support (OR 0.833, 95% CI 0.795–0.873, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) was associated with a reduced probability to access mental health services. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new threat to the mental health and well-being of the general population, therefore specific strategies should be implemented to promote access to mental healthcare during the pandemic and afterwards.</p>

	<p>Proactive aggression (PA) is a planned and unprovoked form of aggression that is most often enacted for personal gain or in anticipation of a reward. Frequently described as “cold-blooded” or goal oriented, PA is thought to be associated with low autonomic arousal. With this view in mind, we performed a scoping review of the biological correlates of PA and identified 74 relevant articles. Physiological findings indicated a robust association between PA and reduced resting heart rate, and to a lesser extent a relationship between PA and decreased heart rate and skin conductance reactivity, perhaps indicating dampened sympathetic function. The twin literature identified PA as a heritable trait, but little evidence implicates specific genes in the pathogenesis of PA. Neuroimaging studies of PA pinpoint impaired amygdala function in the assessment and conditioning of aversive stimuli, which may influence the establishment of behavioral patterns. Nodes of the default mode network were identified as possible neural correlates of PA, suggesting that altered function of this network may be involved in the genesis of PA. Given the overlap of PA with reactive aggression and the overall behavioral complexity of PA, it is clear that multiple endophenotypes of PA exist. This comprehensive review surveys the most salient neurobiologically informed research on PA.</p>

	<p>Neuroinflammation is often accompanied by central nervous system (CNS) injury seen in various CNS diseases, with no specific treatment. Drug repurposing is a strategy of finding new uses for approved or investigational drugs, and can be enabled by the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), a large drug perturbation database. In this study, the signatures of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were compared with the signatures of compounds contained in the LINCS dataset. To the top 100 compounds obtained, the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)-based tool admetSAR was used to identify the top 10 candidate compounds with relatively high blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Furthermore, the seventh-ranked compound, dutasteride, a 5-α-reductase inhibitor, was selected for in vitro and in vivo validation of its anti-neuroinflammation activity. The results showed that dutasteride significantly reduced the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in the supernatants of LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, and decreased the levels of IL-6 in the hippocampus and plasma, and the number of activated microglia in the brain of LPS administration mice. Furthermore, dutasteride also attenuated the cognitive impairment caused by LPS stimulation in mice. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the LINCS dataset-based drug repurposing strategy is an effective approach, and the predicted candidate, dutasteride, has the potential to ameliorate LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.</p>

                Intensifying wildfire activity and climate change can drive rapid forest compositional shifts. In boreal North America, black spruce shapes forest flammability and depends on fire for regeneration. This relationship has helped black spruce maintain its dominance through much of the Holocene. However, with climate change and more frequent and severe...

                Background: Despite many studies on COVID-19, our knowledge of it remains incomplete. In some cases, treating SARS-CoV-2 infection concomitant with other diseases can be particularly challenging, as finding an appropriate treatment may involve some risks. Case presentation: A 34-year-old SARS-CoV-2 positive patient admitted due to fever, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and pneumonia, developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute kidney injury. Due to his severe state, abnormalities in laboratory tests and rapidly progressing loss of kidney function, kidney biopsy, as well as antibody panel were carried out, in which perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were found with a high titer (>200; N: <1:20). The results of kidney biopsy, combined with clinical manifestation and laboratory findings prompted the diagnosis of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in the course of p-ANCA vasculitis. Initial treatment consisted of heamodialyses, remdesivir, plasmaphereses, intravenous immunoglobulins, antibiotics, corticosteroids and nadroparin. Once the haemorrhage had subsided, kidney function had been partially retrieved and heamodialyses had no longer been necessary, cyclophosphamide treatment was initiated, despite being contraindicated in COVID-19 according to its summary of product characteristics. Immunotherapy is still continued. The patient has already received a total of 2.4g of cyclophosphamide (4 cycles of 600mg each every three weeks). Pulmonary and radiological regression, as well as improvement of renal parameters have been achieved.        Conclusions: We suspect that cyclophosphamide, the drug of choice in p-ANCA vasculitis, could be a potential factor providing regression of the radiological changes in the lungs and it could have prevented the patient from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19 diagnosis should not exclude searching for other diseases which can have a similar course. When treating a patient in a life-threatening condition, a departure from trying to find the perfect timing of cyclophosphamide delivery should be considered, as delaying it could cause potentially greater harm.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Aperiodic and Periodic Components of Ongoing Oscillatory Brain Dynamics Link Distinct Functional Aspects of Cognition across Adult Lifespan</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Signal transmission in the brain propagates via distinct oscillatory frequency bands but the aperiodic component, 1/f activity, almost always co-exists which most of the previous studies have not sufficiently taken into consideration. We used a recently proposed parameterization model that delimits the oscillatory and aperiodic components of neural dynamics on lifespan aging data collected from human participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Since healthy aging underlines an enormous change in local tissue properties, any systematic relationship of 1/f activity would highlight their impact on the self-organized critical functional states. Furthermore, we have used patterns of correlation between aperiodic background and metrics of behavior to understand the domain general effects of 1/f activity. We suggest that age-associated global change in 1/f baseline alters the functional critical states of the brain affecting the global information processing impacting critically all aspects of cognition, e.g., metacognitive awareness, speed of retrieval of memory, cognitive load, and accuracy of recall through adult lifespan. This alteration in 1/f crucially impacts the oscillatory features peak frequency (PF) and band power ratio, which relates to more local processing and selective functional aspects of cognitive processing during the visual short-term memory (VSTM) task. In summary, this study leveraging on big lifespan data for the first time tracks the cross-sectional lifespan-associated periodic and aperiodic dynamical changes in the resting state to demonstrate how normative patterns of 1/f activity, PF, and band ratio (BR) measures provide distinct functional insights about the cognitive decline through adult lifespan.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The benefits of mindfulness in mental healthcare professionals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout is a widely reported syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lowered sense of accomplishment. Mindfulness practices have been shown to be useful in lowering distress and burnout in clinical and non-clinical cohorts. Our aim was to explore the potential personal and occupational benefits of a structured mindfulness intervention on a cohort of mental health professionals. A mixed-methods approach was utilised in order to enhance the exploratory power of the study. Methods: We conducted a pilot study involving healthcare practitioners employed at a community outpatient mental health clinic. As a pilot, we relied on a single group and implemented a quasi-experimental, simultaneous mixed methods design by incorporating both quantitative pre- and post- testing alongside written qualitative post-test responses. Results: Analysis of the data demonstrated a significant difference between overall mindfulness when comparing post-test (mean=140.8, standard deviation=18.9) with pre-test data (mean=128.3, standard deviation=28.6). Participants also showed a statistically significant difference in three of the subscales: observation, describing, and non-reactivity. A moderate effect size was seen for each of the above differences.  Analysis of the qualitative data revealed a range of potential themes which may be used to explain the differences exhibited across participants’ personal and professional lives, which can be grouped into two thematic overarching groups: emotional reactivity and listening/communicating. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study indicate that a structured, six-week mindfulness program has the potential to benefit clinicians, personally by reducing emotional reactivity and professionally by promoting deep listening and communication.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Complexity and diversity in sparse code priors improve receptive field characterization of Macaque V1 neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ziniu Wu, Harold Rockwell, Yimeng Zhang, Shiming Tang, Tai Sing Lee</p>

System identification techniques—projection pursuit regression models (PPRs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—provide state-of-the-art performance in predicting visual cortical neurons’ responses to arbitrary input stimuli. However, the constituent kernels recovered by these methods are often noisy and lack coherent structure, making it difficult to understand the underlying component features of a neuron’s receptive field. In this paper, we show that using a dictionary of diverse kernels with complex shapes learned from natural scenes based on efficient coding theory, as the front-end for PPRs and CNNs can improve their performance in neuronal response prediction as well as algorithmic data efficiency and convergence speed. Extensive experimental results also indicate that these sparse-code kernels provide important information on the component features of a neuron’s receptive field. In addition, we find that models with the complex-shaped sparse code front-end are significantly better than models with a standard orientation-selective Gabor filter front-end for modeling V1 neurons that have been found to exhibit complex pattern selectivity. We show that the relative performance difference due to these two front-ends can be used to produce a sensitive metric for detecting complex selectivity in V1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">NanoMethViz: An R/Bioconductor package for visualizing long-read methylation data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shian Su, Quentin Gouil, Marnie E. Blewitt, Dianne Cook, Peter F. Hickey, Matthew E. Ritchie</p>

A key benefit of long-read nanopore sequencing technology is the ability to detect modified DNA bases, such as 5-methylcytosine. The lack of R/Bioconductor tools for the effective visualization of nanopore methylation profiles between samples from different experimental groups led us to develop the <i>NanoMethViz</i> R package. Our software can handle methylation output generated from a range of different methylation callers and manages large datasets using a compressed data format. To fully explore the methylation patterns in a dataset, <i>NanoMethViz</i> allows plotting of data at various resolutions. At the sample-level, we use dimensionality reduction to look at the relationships between methylation profiles in an unsupervised way. We visualize methylation profiles of classes of features such as genes or CpG islands by scaling them to relative positions and aggregating their profiles. At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the <i>spaghetti plot</i> and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest. In summary, our software makes the handling of methylation signal more convenient, expands upon the visualization options for nanopore data and works seamlessly with existing methylation analysis tools available in the Bioconductor project. Our software is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/NanoMethViz.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">OutbreakFlow: Model-based Bayesian inference of disease outbreak dynamics with invertible neural networks and its application to the COVID-19 pandemics in Germany</a></h4>

Mathematical models in epidemiology are an indispensable tool to determine the dynamics and important characteristics of infectious diseases. Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political decisions and interventional measures during an ongoing outbreak. However, reliably inferring the epidemical dynamics by connecting complex models to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual parameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated from scratch for every application of a given model. In this work, we address this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with specialized neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In an initial training phase, a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used as a coach for a neural network, which acquires global knowledge about the full range of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference phase, the trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and infers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the observed dynamics and reliably predict future progression. With its flexible framework, our simulation-based approach is applicable to a variety of epidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is designed to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter values and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these parameters. Application of our method to the early Covid-19 outbreak phase in Germany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic estimates for important disease characteristics, such as generation time, fraction of undetected infections, likelihood of transmission before symptom onset, and reporting delays using a very moderate amount of real-world observations.

                <p>by Stacy Tessler Lindau, Jennifer A. Makelarski, Chaitanya Kaligotla, Emily M. Abramsohn, David G. Beiser, Chiahung Chou, Nicholson Collier, Elbert S. Huang, Charles M. Macal, Jonathan Ozik, Elizabeth L. Tung</p>

CommunityRx (CRx), an information technology intervention, provides patients with a personalized list of healthful community resources (HealtheRx). In repeated clinical studies, nearly half of those who received clinical “doses” of the HealtheRx shared their information with others (“social doses”). Clinical trial design cannot fully capture the impact of information diffusion, which can act as a force multiplier for the intervention. Furthermore, experimentation is needed to understand how intervention delivery can optimize social spread under varying circumstances. To study information diffusion from CRx under varying conditions, we built an agent-based model (ABM). This study describes the model building process and illustrates how an ABM provides insight about information diffusion through <i>in silico</i> experimentation. To build the ABM, we constructed a synthetic population (“agents”) using publicly-available data sources. Using clinical trial data, we developed empirically-informed processes simulating agent activities, resource knowledge evolution and information sharing. Using RepastHPC and chiSIM software, we replicated the intervention <i>in silico</i>, simulated information diffusion processes, and generated emergent information diffusion networks. The CRx ABM was calibrated using empirical data to replicate the CRx intervention <i>in silico</i>. We used the ABM to quantify information spread via social versus clinical dosing then conducted information diffusion experiments, comparing the social dosing effect of the intervention when delivered by physicians, nurses or clinical clerks. The synthetic population (N = 802,191) exhibited diverse behavioral characteristics, including activity and knowledge evolution patterns. <i>In silico</i> delivery of the intervention was replicated with high fidelity. Large-scale information diffusion networks emerged among agents exchanging resource information. Varying the propensity for information exchange resulted in networks with different topological characteristics. Community resource information spread via social dosing was nearly 4 fold that from clinical dosing alone and did not vary by delivery mode. This study, using CRx as an example, demonstrates the process of building and experimenting with an ABM to study information diffusion from, and the population-level impact of, a clinical information-based intervention. While the focus of the CRx ABM is to recreate the CRx intervention <i>in silico</i>, the general process of model building, and computational experimentation presented is generalizable to other large-scale ABMs of information diffusion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multicellular spatial model of RNA virus replication and interferon responses reveals factors controlling plaque growth dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Josua O. Aponte-Serrano, Jordan J. A. Weaver, T. J. Sego, James A. Glazier, Jason E. Shoemaker</p>

Respiratory viruses present major public health challenges, as evidenced by the 1918 Spanish Flu, the 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, and 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemics, and the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestations at the cell and tissue levels is vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and to developing strain-independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular computational model of RNA virus infection and the type-I interferon-mediated antiviral response that it induces within lung epithelial cells. The model is built using the CompuCell3D multicellular simulation environment and is parameterized using data from influenza virus-infected cell cultures. Consistent with experimental observations, it exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. The model suggests that modifying the activity of signaling molecules in the JAK/STAT pathway or altering the ratio of the diffusion lengths of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of plaque growth arrest on diffusion lengths highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for <i>in vitro</i> measurement of these diffusion coefficients. Sensitivity analyses under conditions leading to continuous or arrested plaque growth found that plaque growth is more sensitive to variations of most parameters and more likely to have identifiable model parameters when conditions lead to plaque arrest. This result suggests that cytokine assay measurements may be most informative under conditions leading to arrested plaque growth. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms or to use as a component in models linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Inhibition of protein N-myristoylation blocks Plasmodium falciparum intraerythrocytic development, egress and invasion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anja C. Schlott, Ellen Knuepfer, Judith L. Green, Philip Hobson, Aaron J. Borg, Julia Morales-Sanfrutos, Abigail J. Perrin, Catherine Maclachlan, Lucy M. Collinson, Ambrosius P. Snijders, Edward W. Tate, Anthony A. Holder</p>

We have combined chemical biology and genetic modification approaches to investigate the importance of protein myristoylation in the human malaria parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. Parasite treatment during schizogony in the last 10 to 15 hours of the erythrocytic cycle with IMP-1002, an inhibitor of <i>N</i>-myristoyl transferase (NMT), led to a significant blockade in parasite egress from the infected erythrocyte. Two rhoptry proteins were mislocalized in the cell, suggesting that rhoptry function is disrupted. We identified 16 NMT substrates for which myristoylation was significantly reduced by NMT inhibitor (NMTi) treatment, and, of these, 6 proteins were substantially reduced in abundance. In a viability screen, we showed that for 4 of these proteins replacement of the N-terminal glycine with alanine to prevent myristoylation had a substantial effect on parasite fitness. In detailed studies of one NMT substrate, glideosome-associated protein 45 (GAP45), loss of myristoylation had no impact on protein location or glideosome assembly, in contrast to the disruption caused by GAP45 gene deletion, but GAP45 myristoylation was essential for erythrocyte invasion. Therefore, there are at least 3 mechanisms by which inhibition of NMT can disrupt parasite development and growth: early in parasite development, leading to the inhibition of schizogony and formation of “pseudoschizonts,” which has been described previously; at the end of schizogony, with disruption of rhoptry formation, merozoite development and egress from the infected erythrocyte; and at invasion, when impairment of motor complex function prevents invasion of new erythrocytes. These results underline the importance of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> NMT as a drug target because of the pleiotropic effect of its inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A pilot study assessing the uptake of core outcome sets in health technology assessments [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Core outcome sets (COS) are an agreed standardised collection of outcomes created with representation from all key stakeholders (such as patients, clinicians, researchers), which should be reported as a minimum for all trials in that corresponding clinical area. There has been little research investigating the use of core outcomes in Health technology assessments (HTAs) and none in non-oncology HTAs. This study aimed to assess the similarity between COS and HTA outcomes. Methods: Ten COS published between 2015 and 2019 were selected, with patient participation taken as a proxy measure for a high quality COS. The INAHTA database was used as a source to identify relevant HTAs, which were accessed through the hyperlinks provided. Outcomes selected for these assessments were categorised as either a specific, partial or no match compared to the COS. An additional cohort of non-oncology HTAs published between 2019 and 2021 were identified from the NICE website and compared against a relevant COS. Results: Six hundred and fifty-one HTAs were matched to the ten COS areas, of which 119 were reviewed. Of a possible 1318 core outcome matches, there were 562 (43%) matches, 413 (31%) specific and 149 (11%) partial. NICE HTA matches against corresponding COS ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total of 78% (73/94) matches, 57 (61%) specific and 16 (17%) partial. Conclusion: Further work is required to promote the awareness and implementation of COS within HTAs. Improved uptake across NICE HTAs is encouraging, demonstrating acceptance of COS by HTA producers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigating the impact of university image on international students’ participation behavior: An empirical study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The competition among higher education institutions (HEIs) around the world coupled with the rising mobility of international postgraduate students has created challenges for universities to maintain their competitive advantage. There is continuous emphasis from higher education administrators and governments on internationalization and creating global prominence in this sector. As an emerging hub in southeast Asia, Malaysia is no exception to this. Realizing this need for internationalization, this study has attempted to analyze the impact of university image as a higher-order formative construct on international students' participation behavior as a multidimensional construct. Methods: The sample of this study comprised 150 international students from public and private HEIs in Malaysia. The study focused on this group of students as their participation in university life and face-to-face interactions with university personnel have been significantly affected due to the restrictions on global travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purposive sampling was employed to select the respondents. A structured questionnaire based on a seven-point Likert scale was used to collect the responses. The hypothesized relationships of this cross-sectional study were examined using partial least square-based structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results: The results showed that all the four hypotheses developed in relation to the dimensions of participation behavior were supported. This research outcome has evidenced that university image can influence international students’ participation behavior such as information seeking, and information sharing behavior that can be perceived as positive behavioral outcomes towards their respective HEIs. Conclusions: Since the present study was conducted in one country, future studies may reproduce this in other southeast Asian countries. While cross-validation to local students lies outside the scope of this study, this empirically tested behavior model offers practical implications for universities, particularly in this uncertain period where HEIs are going through tremendous challenges to uphold their strong rapport with international students.

                Background: People with Down Syndrome (DS) are born with an extra copy of Chromosome (Chr) 21 and many of these individuals develop Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) when they age. This is due at least in part to the extra copy of the APP gene located on Chr 21. By 40 years, most people with DS have amyloid plaques which disrupt brain cell function and increase their risk for AD. About half of the people with DS develop AD and the associated dementia around 50 to 60 years of age, which is about the age at which the hereditary form of AD, early onset AD, manifests. In the absence of Chr 21 trisomy, duplication of APP alone is a cause of early onset Alzheimer’s disease, making it likely that having three copies of APP is important in the development of AD and in DS. Methods: We investigate the relationship between AD and DS through integrative analysis of genesets derived from a MeSH query of AD and DS associated beta amyloid peptides, Chr 21, GWAS identified AD risk factor genes, and differentially expressed genes in individuals with DS. Results:  Unique and shared aspects of each geneset were evaluated based on  functional enrichment analysis, transcription factor profile and network interactions. Genes that may be important to both disorders in the context of direct association with APP processing, Tau post translational modification  and network connectivity are ACSM1, APBA2, APLP1, BACE2, BCL2L, COL18A1, DYRK1A, IK, KLK6, METTL2B, MTOR, NFE2L2, NFKB1, PRSS1, QTRT1, RCAN1, RUNX1, SAP18 SOD1, SYNJ1, S100B. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and immune system processes likely contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and DS which is consistent with other published reports.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An examination of the structural linkages between households and community health services in realization of accelerated primary healthcare delivery in Kisumu County, Kenya: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The provision of community health services (CHS) is critical in accelerating primary health care delivery to vulnerable and deprived populations. However, the structural linkages between households and the CHS being provided by community health workers (CHWs) or volunteers in Kisumu County, Kenya, remains weak and inefffective. Methods: This study applied a descriptive approach using a systematic review technique to provide context and substance to the two main research questions: (1) how does the interaction between households and CHWs affect utilization of CHS to promote equity and right to health? (2) How do health-seeking behaviours of households influence their decision-making regarding choices of CHS? We screened the literature from Google scholar, JSTOR, SAGE and EBSCO based on our inclusion criteria, resulting in 21 studies. These studies were assessed for quality and eligibility and data extracted based on relevance to the research study. Results: Households place primacy on trust and confidentiality in the interaction with CHWs and this affects uptake of CHS. The social determinants of health are also critical in influencing the health-seeking behaviour of households and individuals and their choice of CHS. The successful models of CHS share the characteristic of community ownership and participation and provides for comprehensive health care teams. Conclusion: CHS are critical for the acceleration of primary health care delivery. It forms an important pathway for the achievement of universal health coverage, which is an outcome required for Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A brief review of simulated Kalman Filter Algorithm – variants and applications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Simulated Kalman Filter (SKF) solves optimization problems by finding the estimate of the optimum solution. As a multi-agent algorithm, every agent in the population acts as a Kalman filter by using a standard Kalman filter framework, which includes a simulated measurement process and a best-so-far solution as a reference. This paper presented an overview of the research progress in SKF from the day it was introduced until the present day, discussing the progress, improvements, modifications, and applications of SKF. The fundamental and standard algorithm were first introduced. Then, the work on the algorithm improvements was surveyed. Finally, the remaining unresolved problems and some directions of SKF research were discussed. We reviewed 57 SKF papers. 16 of them on fundamental improvements, 9 on extension of the algorithm to discrete problems and 25 on their applications. Researchers have worked on ideas to improve exploration capability to prevent premature convergence by trying prediction operators, opposition-based learning, and different iteration strategies. There were also attempts to hybridize SKF with other famous algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) to improve its performance. Lastly, a single-agent variant of SKF and a multi-objective SKF were introduced. SKF algorithms and its variants have been implemented in at least nine areas of applications: drill path optimization, airport gate allocation problem (AGAP), assembly sequence planning (ASP), system identification, feature selection, image template matching, controller tuning, wireless sensor network, and engineering design problem. The literature reviewed solely depended on the keyword search that contained the terms simulated Kalman filter from December 2015 to the present date. This is the first review paper on SKF. It is hoped that this survey would be beneficial for the researchers of this area and attracting interest towards the algorithm.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attitudes and habits regarding brain training applications and games among Japanese consumers: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While there is now a large amount of research investigating whether brain training applications and games are effective or not, there is less research on the expectations, attitudes, and habits of potential users of brain training programs. Previous research suggests that people generally have positive beliefs about the effectiveness of brain training which are not dependent on their level of experience of brain training. However, this research has primarily focused on western participants. Methods: In the present study, a questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes and habits of Japanese consumers towards brain training. The final sample contained responses from 818 people. In addition to descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients were calculated to determine if there were relationships between variables relating to participants' beliefs about brain training and experience of using brain training. Results: Participants had positive beliefs about the effectiveness of brain training. However, these beliefs were negligibly or weakly correlated with their level of experience of using brain training, both in terms of the number programs used (Pearson's r = 0.163) and duration of use (Pearson's r = 0.237). The most widely used brain training program (used by 52.93% of participants) was made by Nintendo for the handheld Nintendo DS games console. Conclusions: The research presented here supports previous findings which suggest that people's beliefs about the effectiveness of brain training software are not strongly related to their experience of using such software.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Stem cell therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease leading to loss of upper and lower motor neurons at both spinal and bulbar levels.   For patients with ALS rehabilitation is important to maintain functional independence, ensure safety and optimize quality of life but is not curative. Stem cell therapy (SCT) provides a new approach to treat previously incurable diseases although peer reviewed published evidence has shown no benefit in ALS for slowing disease progression or functional loss.   This case report presents a patient with ALS who underwent SCT but deteriorated rapidly after the procedure. Whether the deterioration was due to the natural progress of the disease or expedited by SCT remains unknown. The ethical considerations of how marketing influences healthcare and individuals’ decisions in desperate situations along with reasons for taking desperate measures are discussed.  Patient education and open communication with ALS patients are imperative in gaining patient satisfaction and overcoming ill effects that marketing could have on unconventional methods of intervention. Raising awareness about the availability and access to multidisciplinary care, the timing of decisions with regards to symptom management and end of life care have proven to enhance the quality of life for such patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neural matrix factorization++ based recommendation system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, Recommender System (RS) research work has covered a wide variety of Artificial Intelligence techniques, ranging from traditional Matrix Factorization (MF) to complex Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation methods such as MF, have limited learning capabilities as it only considers the linear combination between user and item vectors. For learning non-linear relationships, methods like Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) incorporate DNN into CF methods. Though, CF methods still suffer from cold start and data sparsity. This paper proposes an improved hybrid-based RS, namely Neural Matrix Factorization++ (NeuMF++), for effectively learning user and item features to improve recommendation accuracy and alleviate cold start and data sparsity. NeuMF++ is proposed by incorporating effective latent representation into NeuMF via Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE). NeuMF++ can also be seen as the fusion of GMF++ and MLP++. NeuMF is an NCF framework which associates with GMF (Generalized Matrix Factorization) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptrons). NeuMF achieves state-of-the-art results due to the integration of GMF linearity and MLP non-linearity. Concurrently, incorporating latent representations has shown tremendous improvement in GMF and MLP, which result in GMF++ and MLP++. Latent representation obtained through the SDAEs’ latent space allows NeuMF++ to effectively learn user and item features, significantly enhancing its learning capability. However, sharing feature extractions among GMF++ and MLP++ in NeuMF++ might hinder its performance. Hence, allowing GMF++ and MLP++ to learn separate features provides more flexibility and greatly improves its performance. Experiments performed on a real-world dataset have demonstrated that NeuMF++ achieves an outstanding result of a test root-mean-square error of 0.8681. In future work, we can extend NeuMF++ by introducing other auxiliary information like text or images. Different neural network building blocks can also be integrated into NeuMF++ to form a more robust recommendation model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Academic entrepreneurial engagement for frugal innovation in higher education institutions: a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Higher education institutions (HEI) are faced with increasing challenges related to shrinking resources, high operation costs, the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing student enrolment rates, and pressure to contribute to regional development and economic growth. To overcome such challenges, academics must move beyond their traditional functions of research and teaching and engage in entrepreneurial activities. Through engagement in entrepreneurial activities, academics can contribute to frugal innovation (FI) in private HEI (PHEI). The literature in this context emphasizes that academic entrepreneurial engagement (AEE) will lead to innovation, the identification of opportunities for new business ventures, financial rewards for institutions and academics, an impact on the economy, and the enhancement of social welfare. This study presents a systematic review of the literature and adopts the Transfield five-phase strategy to review the literature on AEE from the past two decades (2000–2020). A total of 1,067 papers on FI are obtained, only five of which focus on AEE. Moreover, papers related to AEE for FI are few. The study presents the research gaps, challenges, and potential factors for further research in this context. We conclude that FI for AEE in PHEI can be a game-changer for future sustainability. Moreover, we believe that the outcome of this review warrants further research.

                Background: Nanoparticles are globally synthesized for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, catalytic, magnetic, optical, and electronic properties that have put them at the forefront of a wide variety of studies. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) has received much consideration due to its technological and medicinal applications. In this study, we report on the synthesis process of ZnO nanoparticles using Athrixia phylicoides DC natural extract as a reducing agent.   Methods: Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify the compounds responsible for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. Structural, morphological and optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles have been characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).   Results: LC-MS results showed that different flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as Coumarin, an aromatic compound, reacted with the precursor to form ZnO nanoparticles. XRD and UV-Vis analysis confirmed the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, with a spherical shape showed in SEM images. The quasi-spherical ZnO crystals had an average crystallite size of 24 nm. EDS and FTIR analysis confirmed that the powders were pure with no other phase or impurity.   Conclusions: This study successfully demonstrated that the natural plant extract of A. phylicoides DC. can be used in the bio-reduction of zinc nitrate hexahydrate to prepare pure ZnO nanoparticles, thus, extending the use of this plant to an industrial level.

                Background: Studies have acknowledged that social media enables students to connect with and learn from experts from different ties available in the students’ personal learning environment (PLE). The inclusion of experts in formal learning activities through social media such as in scaffolding problem-solving activities helps students see the practicality of experts’ thinking in solving real-world problems. However, studies that evaluate experts’ problem-solving styles and how these influence the experts' thinking process in delivering the know-how to students on social media based on the ties that the students have with the experts in social media are scarce in the extant literature. The study aimed to explore the problem-solving styles that the experts portrayed on Facebook based on their ties with the students.  Methods: This study employed a simultaneous within-subject experimental design which was conducted in three closed Facebook groups with 12 final year management students, six business experts, and one instructor as the participants. The experts were invited by the students from the weak and strong ties in their PLE. Hinging on the Theory of Fluid and Crystallised intelligence and the Strength of Weak Ties Theory, this study employed thematic analysis using the ATLAS.ti qualitative data analysis software to map the experts’ comments on Facebook. Results:  The use of strong ties in combination with weak ties balances out the negative aspects of the business experts’ problem-solving styles.  All the experts used both fluid and crystallised intelligence in scaffolding the students’ learning; however, the degree of its usage correlated with the working experience of the experts. Conclusion: The use of weak or strong ties benefited the students as it expedited their problem-solving tasks since the experts have unique expertise to offer depending on the degree of their working experiences and the proximity of the students’ relationship with the experts.

                Background: This study aims to process porang flour, moringa leaves, and tempe into cookies that are high in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants as potential functional food snacks for adolescents with anemia. Methods: This study is experimental with a completely randomized trial design (CRD) with three treatments and triplicates. There are three comparison formulations of a combination of porang, moringa leaves, and black soybean-based tempe; respectively F1 (3:3:3)%, F2 (3:6:6)%, and F3 (3:10:10)%. The cookie sample was then analyzed for water content, ash, iron, folic acid, cobalt, and antioxidant activity. The differences between the samples were analyzed based on the activity of antioxidants, iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in data obtained from triplicates using multivariate ANOVA analysis. Results: The results of the ash and water content tests of all three cookie formulations showed values in accordance with the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for cookie products. F3 has significantly higher iron, folic acid, and cobalt levels than F1 and F2 (p<0.05). Antioxidant activity is highest in F3, but there is no meaningful difference between F2 and F3 (p>0.05). Conclusions: The combination of porang's tubers, moringa leaves, and tempe made from black soybeans, especially F3, has the potential to be used as a functional cookie processed product source of iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin, and antioxidants for adolescent anemia.

<p>Morphological and functional development of astrocytes in the visual thalamus: In the present study, we show that by eye-opening, astrocytes not only possess adult-like morphology but also completely enwrap retinogeniculate synapses and efficiently uptake extracellular glutamate.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labeled in <i>Aldh1l1-EGFP</i> mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheathe retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.</p>

     alt="Pretecto- and ponto-cerebellar pathways to the pigeon oculomotor cerebellum follow a zonal organization"/>
<p>Using injections of retrograde tracers, we show that the medial and lateral pontine nucleus (PM and PL, respectively), and the medial and lateral subdivisions of the medial spiriform nucleus (SpMm and SpMl, respectively) project to different parasagittal zones in the oculomotor cerebellum of the pigeon. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Both birds and mammals have relatively large forebrains and cerebella. In mammals, there are extensive sensory–motor projections to the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei originating from several parts of the cerebral cortex. Similar forebrain-to-cerebellum pathways exist in birds, but the organization of this circuitry has not been studied extensively. Birds have two nuclei at the base of the brainstem that are thought to be homologous to the pontine nuclei of mammals, the medial and lateral pontine nuclei (PM, PL). Additionally, birds are unique in that they have a pretectal nucleus called the medial spiriform nucleus (SpM) that, like the pontine nuclei, also receives projections from the forebrain and projects to the oculomotor cerebellum (OCb; folia VI to VIII). The OCb also receives input from the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM), which analyzes visual optic flow information resulting from self-movement. In this study, we used single or double injections of fluorescent tracers to study the organization of these inputs from PM, PL, SpM and LM to the OCb in pigeons. We found that these inputs follow a zonal organization. The most medial zone in the OCb, zone A1, receives bilateral inputs from the lateral SpM, PL and LM. Zones A2 and C receive a bilateral projection from the medial SpM, and a mostly contralateral projection from PM and LM. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructure of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar projections in the mouse"/>
<p>The confocal image of a coronal section through the left mouse pulvinar nucleus (PUL) illustrates the distribution of projections from the left (Ipsi, magenta) and right (Contra, green) superior colliculus (SC). This study examined the ultrastructure of ipsi and contra SC to PUL projections using viruses that induce the expression of peroxidase in synaptic vesicles (example electron micrographs circled, black arrows indicate synapses). Synaptic terminals originating from the ipsi SC were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals originating from the contra SC (left graph), and both populations of SC terminals were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals in the PUL that do not originate from the SC (right graph).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual pathways of the brain are organized into parallel channels that code different features of the external environment. In the current study, we investigated the anatomical organization of parallel pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to the pulvinar nucleus in the mouse. Virus injections placed in the ipsilateral and contralateral SC to induce the expression of different fluorescent proteins define two pulvinar zones. The lateral pulvinar (Pl) receives ipsilateral SC input and the caudal medial pulvinar (Pcm) receives bilateral SC input. To examine the ultrastructure of these projections using transmission electron microscopy, we injected the SC with viruses to induce peroxidase expression within synaptic vesicles or mitochondria. We quantitatively compared the sizes of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites, as well as the sizes of the overall population of synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites in the Pl and Pcm. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that ipsilateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than contralateral tectopulvinar terminals. In particular, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection includes a subset of large terminals (≥ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) that envelop dendritic protrusions of postsynaptic dendrites. We also found that both ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than the overall population of synaptic terminals in both the Pl and Pcm. Thus, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection is structurally distinct from the bilateral tectopulvinar pathway, but both tectopulvinar channels may be considered the primary or “driving” input to the Pl and Pcm.</p>

                Resilience to stressful life events has received considerable attention in both clinical and preclinical studies. A number of neural substrates have been identified as putatively mediating resilience to stress. However, there remains considerable diversity in how resilience is defined and studied. This article aims to examine how resilience is defined and conceptualized in social psychology, public health, and related fields, to better inform the understanding of stress resilience in the neurobiological context, and to differentiate resilience from other patterns of response to stressful experiences.
