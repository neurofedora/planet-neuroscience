	<p>Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) are the most common mental health disorders in the school-aged child population. Although harsh parenting is a key risk factor in the shaping of DBD, studies neglect the presence of siblings and differential parenting. This study aims to compare: (1) parenting style and sibling relationship in sibling dyads of clinical families, composed of a DBD child and a non-clinical sibling, with control families composed of two non-clinical siblings; (2) parenting style, sibling relationship, and emotional and behavioral problems in DBD child, non-clinical sibling, and non-clinical child of control group. Sixty-one families (composed of mother and sibling dyads), divided into clinical (n = 27) and control (n = 34) groups, completed the APQ, SRI, and CBCL questionnaires. Results indicated differential parenting in clinical families, compared to control group families, with higher negative parenting toward the DBD child than the sibling; no difference emerged in sibling relationship within sibling dyads (clinical vs. control). Finally, externalizing and internalizing problems were higher in DBD children and their siblings, compared to control, indicating DBD sibling psychopathology vulnerability. Findings suggest inclusion of siblings in the clinical assessment and rehabilitative intervention of DBD children, given that the promotion of positive parenting could improve mental health in the offspring.</p>

	<p>Carotid revascularization may lead to improved cognitive function beyond stroke prevention. This article summarizes the conclusions from available studies on the effects of carotid reperfusion procedures on cognitive function. The papers cited used different neuropsychological tests for cognitive assessment, resulting in different methodologies and the results obtained were not always convergent. However, most studies reported an improvement in neurocognitive abilities after both vascular interventions, but a more precise assessment of the specific benefits is still awaited. Clinical determinants to predict the effects of these treatments on cognitive function are still being sought, but results are not yet satisfactory. In view of these studies, carotid stenosis seems to be an independent risk factor for cognitive deterioration, and the main mechanisms responsible are embolism and cerebral hypoperfusion. The aim of this study is to order the knowledge about the effects of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and endarterectomy (CEA) on neurocognitive functions and to verify the usefulness of using these treatments.</p>

                Approximately 40% of human messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5′ untranslated regions.

Previously, we showed that the DPRs PR50 and GR50 are highly toxic when expressed in Caenorhabditis...

<p>Pupil dynamics alterations have been found in patients affected by a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism. Studies in mouse models have used pupillometry for phenotypic assessment and as a proxy for arousal. Both in mice and humans, pupillometry is noninvasive and allows for longitudinal experiments supporting temporal specificity; however, its measure requires dedicated setups. Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network that performs online pupillometry in both mice and humans in a web app format. This solution dramatically simplifies the usage of the tool for the nonspecialist and nontechnical operators. Because a modern web browser is the only software requirement, this choice is of great interest given its easy deployment and setup time reduction. The tested model performances indicate that the tool is sensitive enough to detect both locomotor-induced and stimulus-evoked pupillary changes, and its output is comparable to state-of-the-art commercial devices.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spontaneous recognition memory tasks are widely used to assess cognitive function in rodents and have become commonplace in the characterization of rodent models of neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Leveraging an animal&rsquo;s innate preference for novelty, these tasks use object exploration to capture the what, where and when components of recognition memory. Choosing and optimizing objects is a key feature when designing recognition memory tasks. Although the range of objects used in these tasks varies extensively across studies, object features can bias exploration, influence task difficulty and alter brain circuit recruitment. Here, we discuss the advantages of using 3D-printed objects in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks. We provide strategies for optimizing their design and usage, and offer a repository of tested, open-source designs for use with commonly used rodent species. The easy accessibility, low-cost, renewability and flexibility of 3D-printed open-source designs make this approach an important step toward improving rigor and reproducibility in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Secreted Reporter Assay Enables Quantitative and Longitudinal Monitoring of Neuronal Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to measure changes in neuronal activity in a quantifiable and precise manner is of fundamental importance to understand neuron development and function. Repeated monitoring of neuronal activity of the same population of neurons over several days is challenging and, typically, low-throughput. Here, we describe a new biochemical reporter assay that allows for repeated measurements of neuronal activity in a cell type-specific manner. We coupled activity-dependent elements from the <I>Arc/Arg3.1</I> gene with a secreted reporter, <I>Gaussia</I> luciferase (Gluc), to quantify neuronal activity without sacrificing the neurons. The reporter predominantly senses calcium and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent activity. By repeatedly measuring the accumulation of the reporter in cell media, we can profile the developmental dynamics of neuronal activity in cultured neurons from male and female mice. The assay also allows for longitudinal analysis of pharmacological treatments, thus distinguishing acute from delayed responses. Moreover, conditional expression of the reporter allows for monitoring cell type-specific changes. This simple, quantitative, cost-effective, automatable, and cell type-specific activity reporter is a valuable tool to study the development of neuronal activity in normal and disease-model conditions, and to identify small molecules or protein factors that selectively modulate the activity of a specific population of neurons.</p>

In this longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that diffusion characteristics of white matter (WM) tracts implicated in socio-emotional processing assessed in the neonatal period are associated with socio-emotional development in 151 very preterm children previously enrolled into the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42). All children underwent diffusion tensor imaging at term-equivalent age and fractional anisotropy (FA) was quantified in the uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Children&rsquo;s socio-emotional development was evaluated at preschool age (median = 4.63 years). Exploratory factor analysis conducted on the outcome variables revealed a three-factor structure, with latent constructs summarized as: "emotion moderation," "social function," and "empathy." Results of linear regression analyses, adjusting for full-scale IQ and clinical and socio-demographic variables, showed an association between lower FA in the right UF and higher "emotion moderation" scores (&beta; = &ndash;0.280; <I>p </I>&lt;<I> </I>0.001), which was mainly driven by negative affectivity scores (&beta; = &ndash;0.281; <I>p </I>=<I> </I>0.001). Results further showed an association between higher full-scale IQ and better social functioning (&beta; = &ndash;0.334, <I>p </I>&lt;<I> </I>0.001). Girls had higher empathy scores than boys (&beta; = &ndash;0.341, <I>p </I>=<I> </I>0.006). These findings suggest that early alterations of diffusion characteristics of the UF could represent a biological substrate underlying the link between very preterm birth and emotional dysregulation in childhood and beyond.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Learning-Induced Shifts in Mice Navigational Strategies Are Unveiled by a Minimal Behavioral Model of Spatial Exploration</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Shifts in spatial patterns produced during the execution of a navigational task can be used to track the effects of the accumulation of knowledge and the acquisition of structured information about the environment. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of mice behavior while performing a novel goal localization task in a large, modular arena, the HexMaze. To demonstrate the effects of different forms of previous knowledge we first obtain a precise statistical characterization of animals&rsquo; paths with sub-trial resolution and over different phases of learning. The emergence of a flexible representation of the task is accompanied by a progressive improvement of performance, mediated by multiple, multiplexed time scales. We then use a generative mathematical model of the animal behavior to isolate the specific contributions to the final navigational strategy. We find that animal behavior can be accurately reproduced by the combined effect of a goal-oriented component, becoming stronger with the progression of learning, and of a random walk component, producing choices unrelated to the task and only partially weakened in time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-notification and personalisation of text messages to increase questionnaire completion in a smoking cessation pregnancy RCT: an embedded randomised factorial trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Low completion rates of questionnaires in randomised controlled trials can compromise the reliability of the results, so ways to boost questionnaire completion are often implemented. Although there is evidence to suggest that sending a text message to participants increases completion, there is little evidence around the timing or personalisation of these text messages.    Methods:  A two-by-two factorial SWAT (study within a trial) was embedded within the MiQuit-3 trial, looking at smoking cessation within pregnant smokers. Participants who reached their 36-week gestational follow-up were randomised to receive a personalised or non-personalised text message, either one week or one day prior to their follow-up. Primary outcomes were completion rate of questionnaire via telephone. Secondary outcomes included: completion rate via any method, time to completion, and number of attempts to contact required.    Results  In total 194 participants were randomised into the SWAT to receive a text message that was personalised early(n=50), personalised late (n=47), non-personalised early(n=50), or non-personalised late(n=47). There was no evidence that timing of the text message (early: one week before; or late: one day before) had an effect on any of the outcomes. There was evidence that a personalised text message would result in fewer completions compared with a non-personalised text message when data was collected only via the telephone(adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22–0.87, p=0.02). However, these results were not significant when looking at completion via any method (adjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.30-1.24, p=0.17). There was no evidence to show that personalisation or not was better for any of the secondary outcomes.    Conclusion  Timing of the text message does not appear to influence the completion of questionnaires. Personalisation of a text message may be detrimental to questionnaire completion, if data is only collected via the telephone - however, more SWATs should be undertaken in this field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Heterodimer-heterotetramer formation mediates enhanced sensor activity in a biophysical model for BMP signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Shahriar Karim, Aasakiran Madamanchi, James A. Dutko, Mary C. Mullins, David M. Umulis</p>

Numerous stages of organismal development rely on the cellular interpretation of gradients of secreted morphogens including members of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family through transmembrane receptors. Early gradients of BMPs drive dorsal/ventral patterning throughout the animal kingdom in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Growing evidence in Drosophila, zebrafish, murine and other systems suggests that BMP ligand heterodimers are the primary BMP signaling ligand, even in systems in which mixtures of BMP homodimers and heterodimers are present. Signaling by heterodimers occurs through a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex comprising of two distinct type one BMP receptors and two type II receptors. To understand the system dynamics and determine whether kinetic assembly of heterodimer-heterotetramer BMP complexes is favored, as compared to other plausible BMP ligand-receptor configurations, we developed a kinetic model for BMP tetramer formation based on current measurements for binding rates and affinities. We find that contrary to a common hypothesis, heterodimer-heterotetramer formation is <i>not</i> kinetically favored over the formation of homodimer-tetramer complexes under physiological conditions of receptor and ligand concentrations and therefore other mechanisms, potentially including differential kinase activities of the formed heterotetramer complexes, must be the cause of heterodimer-heterotetramer signaling primacy. Further, although BMP complex assembly favors homodimer and homomeric complex formation over a wide range of parameters, ignoring these signals and instead relying on the heterodimer improves the range of morphogen interpretation in a broad set of conditions, suggesting a performance advantage for heterodimer signaling in patterning multiple cell types in a gradient.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The critical balance between dopamine D2 receptor and RGS for the sensitive detection of a transient decay in dopamine signal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hidetoshi Urakubo, Sho Yagishita, Haruo Kasai, Yoshiyuki Kubota, Shin Ishii</p>

In behavioral learning, reward-related events are encoded into phasic dopamine (DA) signals in the brain. In particular, unexpected reward omission leads to a phasic decrease in DA (DA dip) in the striatum, which triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) in DA D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing spiny-projection neurons (D2 SPNs). While this LTP is required for reward discrimination, it is unclear how such a short DA-dip signal (0.5–2 s) is transferred through intracellular signaling to the coincidence detector, adenylate cyclase (AC). In the present study, we built a computational model of D2 signaling to determine conditions for the DA-dip detection. The DA dip can be detected only if the basal DA signal sufficiently inhibits AC, and the DA-dip signal sufficiently disinhibits AC. We found that those two requirements were simultaneously satisfied only if two key molecules, D2R and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) were balanced within a certain range; this balance has indeed been observed in experimental studies. We also found that high level of RGS was required for the detection of a 0.5-s short DA dip, and the analytical solutions for these requirements confirmed their universality. The imbalance between D2R and RGS is associated with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia, both of which are accompanied by abnormal striatal LTP. Our simulations suggest that D2 SPNs in patients with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia cannot detect short DA dips. We finally discussed that such psychiatric and movement disorders can be understood in terms of the imbalance between D2R and RGS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mathematical learning deficits originate in early childhood from atypical development of a frontoparietal brain network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ulrike Kuhl, Sarah Sobotta, Legascreen Consortium , Michael A. Skeide</p>

Mathematical learning deficits are defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder (dyscalculia) in the International Classification of Diseases. It is not known, however, how such deficits emerge in the course of early brain development. Here, we conducted functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments in 3- to 6-year-old children without formal mathematical learning experience. We followed this sample until the age of 7 to 9 years, identified individuals who developed deficits, and matched them to a typically developing control group using comprehensive behavioral assessments. Multivariate pattern classification distinguished future cases from controls with up to 87% accuracy based on the regional functional activity of the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the network-level functional activity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the effective functional and structural connectivity of these regions. Our results indicate that mathematical learning deficits originate from atypical development of a frontoparietal network that is already detectable in early childhood.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thalamic Influence on Slow Wave Slope Renormalization During Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Slow waves are thought to mediate an overall reduction in synaptic strength during sleep. The specific contribution of the thalamus to this so-called synaptic renormalization is unknown. Thalamic stroke is associated with daytime sleepiness, along with changes to sleep electroencephalography and cognition, making it a unique “experiment of nature” to assess the relationship between sleep rhythms, synaptic renormalization, and daytime functions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sleep was studied by polysomnography and high-density electroencephalography over 17 nights in patients with thalamic (n = 12) and 15 nights in patients with extrathalamic (n = 11) stroke. Sleep electroencephalographic overnight slow wave slope changes and their relationship with subjective daytime sleepiness, cognition, and other functional tests were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thalamic and extrathalamic patients did not differ in terms of age, sleep duration, or apnea–hypopnea index. Conversely, overnight slope changes were reduced in a large cluster of electrodes in thalamic compared to extrathalamic stroke patients. This reduction was related to increased daytime sleepiness. No significant differences were found in other functional tests between the 2 groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with thalamic stroke, a reduction in overnight slow wave slope change and increased daytime sleepiness was found. Sleep- and wake-centered mechanisms for this relationship are discussed. Overall, this study suggests a central role of the thalamus in synaptic renormalization. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures and post-stroke epilepsy after acute ischemic stroke and evaluate the effects of reperfusion treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed the risk factors for post-stroke seizures using logistic or Cox regression in a multicenter study, including adults from 8 European referral centers with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. We compared the risk of post-stroke seizures between participants with or without reperfusion treatment following propensity score matching to reduce confounding due to treatment selection.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall cohort of 4,229 participants (mean age 71 years, 57% men), a higher risk of acute symptomatic seizures was observed in those with more severe strokes, infarcts located in the posterior cerebral artery territory, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Strokes caused by small-vessel occlusion carried a small risk of acute symptomatic seizures. 6% developed post-stroke epilepsy. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy were acute symptomatic seizures, more severe strokes, infarcts involving the cerebral cortex, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Electroencephalography findings within 7 days of stroke onset were not independently associated with the risk of post-stroke epilepsy. There was no association between reperfusion treatments in general or only intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy with the time to post-stroke epilepsy or the risk of acute symptomatic seizures.</p>

                Background  The CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials recommend use of a single primary outcome, to guard against the raised risk of false positive findings when multiple measures are considered. It is, however, possible to include a suite of multiple outcomes in an intervention study, while controlling the familywise error rate, if the criterion for rejecting the null hypothesis specifies that N or more of the outcomes reach an agreed level of statistical significance, where N depends on the total number of outcome measures included in the study, and the correlation between them.  Methods  Simulations were run, using a conventional null-hypothesis significance testing approach with alpha set at .05, to explore the case when between 2 and 12 outcome measures are included to compare two groups, with average correlation between measures ranging from zero to .8, and true effect size ranging from 0 to .7. In step 1, a table is created giving the minimum N significant outcomes (MinNSig) that is required for a given set of outcome measures to control the familywise error rate at 5%. In step 2, data are simulated using MinNSig values for each set of correlated outcomes and the resulting proportion of significant results is computed for different sample sizes,correlations, and effect sizes.  Results  The Adjust NVar approach can achieve a more efficient trade-off between power and type I error rate than use of a single outcome when there are three or more moderately intercorrelated outcome variables.  Conclusions  Where it is feasible to have a suite of moderately correlated outcome measures, then this might be a more efficient approach than reliance on a single primary outcome measure in an intervention study. In effect, it builds in an internal replication to the study. This approach can also be used to evaluate published intervention studies.

                Background: Insulin resistance has been independently associated with cardiac diseases. A free fatty acid is recently known to induce cardiac insulin resistance due to low-grade inflammation. Therefore, the improvement of free fatty acid levels can also improve cardiac insulin resistance. This study investigated the combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract in improvement of free fatty acid-induced cardiac insulin resistance by improving the adiponectin/FAS pathway. Methods: This study used 25 males Sprague-Dawley rats induced by a high-fat high sucrose diet and injection of low dose streptozotocin to make a metabolic syndrome (MS) rat model and standard chow as healthy control rats. The MS rats were treated with green tea (200 mg/ b. w.), decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee (300 mg/ b. w.), and the combination of both extracts in 9 weeks. Experimental groups in this study were divided into 5 groups: 1) MS (HFHS diet + STZ) group, 2) NC (normal chow) group, 3) GT (green tea extract) group, 4) GC (decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract), 5) CM (combination of both extracts) group. Adiponectin and HOMA-IR level was analysed using ELISA, and the gene expression of Adipo-R1, FAS, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, GLUT4 was measured by RT-PCR. Results: The combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee showed synergistic effects in improving FFA levels. The adiponectin/FAS pathway was attenuated in the CM group. Moreover, the combination also showed improvement in cardiac insulin resistance markers such as IRS1/2, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, and GLUT4. Conclusions:  The combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract improved cardiac insulin resistance better than green tea and green coffee extract administration alone by reducing free fatty acids levels through adiponectin/FAS pathway modulation.

                Online accounts to keep track of scientific publications, such as Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) or Google Scholar, can be time consuming to maintain and synchronize. Furthermore, the open access status of publications is often not easily accessible, hindering potential opening of closed publications. To lessen the burden of managing personal profiles, we developed a R shiny app that allows publication lists from multiple platforms to be retrieved and consolidated, as well as interactive exploration and comparison of publication profiles. A live version can be found at pubassistant.ch.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Utilizing data sampling techniques on algorithmic fairness for customer churn prediction with data imbalance problems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Customer churn prediction (CCP) refers to detecting which customers are likely to cancel the services provided by a service provider, for example, internet services. The class imbalance problem (CIP) in machine learning occurs when there is a huge difference in the samples of positive class compared to the negative class. It is one of the major obstacles in CCP as it deteriorates performance in the classification process. Utilizing data sampling techniques (DSTs) helps to resolve the CIP to some extent. Methods: In this paper, we review the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness, i.e., to investigate whether the results pose any discrimination between male and female groups and compare the results before and after using DSTs. Three real-world datasets with unequal balancing rates were prepared and four ubiquitous DSTs were applied to them. Six popular classification techniques were utilized in the classification process. Both classifier’s performance and algorithmic fairness are evaluated with notable metrics. Results: The results indicated that Random Forest classifier outperforms other classifiers in all three datasets and, using SMOTE and ADASYN techniques cause more discrimination in the female group. The rate of unintentional discrimination seems to be higher in the original data of extremely unbalanced datasets under the following classifiers: Logistics Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Conclusions: Algorithmic fairness has become a broadly studied area in recent years, yet there is a very little systematic study on the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness. This study presents important findings to further the use of algorithmic fairness in CCP research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integrating augmented reality technology in education: vector personal computer augmented reality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Educators often face difficulties in explaining abstract concepts such as vectors. During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, fully online classes have also caused additional challenges to using conventional teaching methods. To explain a vector concept of more than 2 dimensions, visualization becomes a problem. Although Microsoft PowerPoint can integrate animation, the illustration is still in 2-dimensions. Augmented reality (AR) technology is recommended to aid educators and students in teaching-learning vectors, namely via a vector personal computer augmented reality system (VPCAR), to fulfil the demand for tools to support the learning and teaching of vectors. Methods: A PC learning module for vectors was developed in a 3-dimensional coordinate system by using AR technology. Purposive sampling was applied to get feedback from educators and students in Malaysia through an online survey. The supportiveness of using VPCAR based on six items (attractiveness, easiness, visualization, conceptual understanding, inspiration and helpfulness) was recorded on 5-points Likert-type scales. Findings are presented descriptively and graphically. Results: Surprisingly, both students and educators adapted to the new technology easily and provided significant positive feedback that showed a left-skewed and J-shaped distribution for each measurement item, respectively. The distributions were proven significantly different among the students and educators, where supportive level result of educators was higher than students. This study introduced a PC learning module other than mobile apps as students mostly use laptops to attend online class and educators also engage other IT tools in their teaching. Conclusions: Based on these findings, VPCAR provides a good prospect in supporting educators and students during their online teaching-learning process. However, the findings may not be generalizable to all students and educators in Malaysia as purposive sampling was applied. Further studies may focus on government-funded schools using the newly developed VPCAR system, which is the novelty of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Hydroxychloroquine for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) does not respond well to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Chronic activation of microglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PPMS. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia and has neuroprotective effects in vitro.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-arm, phase 2 futility trial of 200mg oral HCQ twice daily for 18 months. In an effort to investigate disability worsening in the absence of overt focal inflammation, we excluded participants with contrast enhancing lesions on a screening MRI. The primary endpoint was ≥20% worsening on the timed 25-foot walk measured between 6 and 18 months of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Based on original trial data, 40% of the cohort were expected to worsen. We used a Simon two-stage design to compare a null hypothesis of 40% of the cohort worsening against the one-sided alternative of 20%. Using a 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power, HCQ treatment would be deemed successful if fewer than 10 of 35 participants experienced clinically significant worsening. The study met its primary endpoint, as only 8 of 35 participants worsened between 6 and 18 months. HCQ was overall well tolerated, with adverse events in 82% and serious adverse events in 12% of participants. All serious adverse events were unlikely related to HCQ use.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HCQ treatment was associated with reduced disability worsening in people with PPMS. HCQ is a promising treatment candidate in PPMS and should be investigated further in randomized controlled clinical trials. (<a target="_blank"

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparative Effectiveness of Stereo‐EEG versus Subdural Grids in Epilepsy Surgery</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the outcomes of subdural electrode (SDE) implantations versus stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG), the two predominant methods of intracranial EEG (iEEG) performed in difficult to localize drug-resistant focal epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Surgical Therapies Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy created an international registry of iEEG patients implanted between 2005-2019 with ≥ 1 year follow-up. We used propensity score matching to control exposure selection bias and generate comparable cohorts. Study endpoints: 1) likelihood of resection after iEEG; 2) seizure-freedom at last follow-up; and 3) complications (composite of either post-operative infection, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or permanent neurologic deficit).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten study sites from seven countries and three continents contributed 2,012 patients, including 1,468 (73%) eligible for analysis (526 SDE, 942 SEEG) of whom 988 (67%) underwent subsequent resection. Propensity score matching improved covariate balance between exposure groups for all analyses. Propensity-matched patients who underwent SDE had higher odds of subsequent resective surgery (odds ratio OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.05 – 1.84), and higher odds of complications (OR=2.24, 95% CI 1.34-3.74; unadjusted: 9.6% after SDE vs. 3.3% after SEEG). Odds of seizure-freedom in propensity-matched resected patients were 1.66 times higher (95% CI 1.21, 2.26) for SEEG compared to SDE (unadjusted: 55% seizure-free after SEEG-guided resections vs. 41% after SDE)</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to SEEG, SDE evaluations are more likely to lead to brain surgery in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, but have more surgical complications and lower probability of seizure-freedom. This comparative-effectiveness study provides the highest feasible evidence level to guide decisions on iEEG.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Impact of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Neurogenesis and Cortical Maturation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurodevelopmental delays and frontal lobe cortical dysmaturation are widespread among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest pool of neural stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal brain. Our aim is to determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurogenesis and cortical maturation in piglets whose SVZ development is similar to human infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three week-old piglets (n=29) were randomly assigned to control (no surgery), mild-CPB (34°C full flow for 60min) and severe-CPB groups (25°C circulatory-arrest for 60min). The SVZ and frontal lobe were analyzed with immunohistochemistry 3 days and 4 weeks postoperatively. MRI of the frontal lobe was used to assess cortical development.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SVZ neurogenic activity was reduced up to 4 weeks after both mild and severe CPB-induced insults. CPB also induced decreased migration of young neurons to the frontal lobe, demonstrating that CPB impairs postnatal neurogenesis. MRI 4 weeks after CPB displayed a decrease in gyrification index and cortical volume of the frontal lobe. Cortical fractional anisotropy was increased after severe CPB injury, indicating a prolonged deleterious impact of CPB on cortical maturation. Both CPB-induced insults displayed a significant change in densities of three major inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the frontal cortex. In addition, different CPB insults altered different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced neurological impairments. Further refinement of CPB hardware and techniques is necessary to improve long-term frontal cortical dysmaturation observed in children with CHD.</p>

                <p>Difficulty retrieving proper names is common in older adults, coinciding with the accumulation of aggregated proteins in mid-life. We investigated the ability of healthy older adults to retrieve the names of famous faces in relation to positron emission tomography measurements of amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. More tau in the left fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus was related to reduced proper name retrieval performance and this effect was potentiated by amyloid-β. These findings provide an explanation for a common complaint of older adults and link proper name retrieval to neural systems involved in face perception, memory, and naming</p>

                Astrocytes are essential cells of the central nervous system, characterized by dynamic relationships with neurons that range from functional metabolic interactions and regulation of neuronal firing activities, to the release of neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors. In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopaminergic neurons are progressively lost during the course of the disease, but the effects of PD on astrocytes and astrocyte-to-neuron communication remains largely unknown. This study focuses on the effects of the PD-related mutation LRRK2 G2019S in astrocytes generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We report the alteration of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis in astrocytes, and we identify the abnormal accumulation of key PD-related proteins within multi vesicular bodies (MVBs). We found that dopaminergic neurons internalize astrocyte-secreted EVs and that LRRK2 G2019S EVs are abnormally enriched in neurites and fail to provide full neurotrophic support to dopaminergic neurons. Thus, dysfunctional astrocyte-to-neuron communication via altered EV biological properties may participate in the progression of PD.

                Enzymatic pathways have evolved uniquely preferred protein expression stoichiometry in living cells, but our ability to predict the optimal abundances from basic properties remains underdeveloped. Here we report a biophysical, first-principles model of growth optimization for core mRNA translation, a multi-enzyme system that involves proteins with a broadly conserved stoichiometry spanning two orders of magnitude. We show that predictions from maximization of ribosome usage in a parsimonious flux model constrained by proteome allocation agree with the conserved ratios of translation factors. The analytical solutions, without free parameters, provide an interpretable framework for the observed hierarchy of expression levels based on simple biophysical properties, such as diffusion constants and protein sizes. Our results provide an intuitive and quantitative understanding for the construction of a central process of life, as well as a path toward rational design of pathway-specific enzyme expression stoichiometry.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adult stem cells and niche cells segregate gradually from common precursors that build the adult Drosophila ovary during pupal development</a></h4>

              
                Production of proliferative Follicle Cells (FCs) and quiescent Escort Cells (ECs) by Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) in adult Drosophila ovaries is regulated by niche signals from anterior (Cap Cells, ECs) and posterior (polar FCs) sources. Here we show that ECs, FSCs and FCs develop from common pupal precursors, with different fates acquired by progressive separation of cells along the AP axis and a graded decline in anterior cell proliferation. ECs, FSCs and most FCs derive from Intermingled Cell (IC) precursors interspersed with germline cells. Precursors also accumulate posterior to ICs before engulfing a naked germline cyst projected out of the germarium to form the first egg chamber and posterior polar FC signaling center. Thus, stem and niche cells develop in appropriate numbers and spatial organization through regulated proliferative expansion together with progressive establishment of spatial signaling cues that guide adult cell behavior, rather than through rigid early specification events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Localization of KRAS downstream target ARL4C to invasive pseudopods accelerates pancreatic cancer cell invasion</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate due to metastasis. Whereas KRAS is mutated in most pancreatic cancer patients, controlling KRAS or its downstream effectors has not been succeeded clinically. ARL4C is a small G protein whose expression is induced by the Wnt and EGF-RAS pathways. In the present study, we found that ARL4C is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer patients and showed that its localization to invasive pseudopods is required for cancer cell invasion. IQGAP1 was identified as a novel interacting protein for ARL4C. ARL4C recruited IQGAP1 and its downstream effector, MMP14, to invasive pseudopods. Specific localization of ARL4C, IQGAP1, and MMP14 was the active site of invasion, which induced degradation of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, subcutaneously injected antisense oligonucleotide against ARL4C into tumor-bearing mice suppressed metastasis of pancreatic cancer. These results suggest that ARL4C-IQGAP1-MMP14 signaling is activated at invasive pseudopods of pancreatic cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Principles of mRNA targeting via the Arabidopsis m6A-binding protein ECT2</a></h4>

              
                Specific recognition of <i>N6</i>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in mRNA by RNA-binding proteins containing a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain is important in eukaryotic gene regulation. The Arabidopsis YTH-domain protein ECT2 is thought to bind to mRNA at URU(m<sup>6</sup>A)Y sites, yet RR(m<sup>6</sup>A)CH is the canonical m<sup>6</sup>A consensus site in all eukaryotes and ECT2 functions require m<sup>6</sup>A binding activity. Here, we apply iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) and HyperTRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to define high-quality target sets of ECT2, and analyze the patterns of enriched sequence motifs around ECT2 crosslink sites. Our analyses show that ECT2 does in fact bind to RR(m<sup>6</sup>A)CH. Pyrimidine-rich motifs are enriched around, but not at m<sup>6</sup>A-sites, reflecting a preference for <i>N6</i>-adenosine methylation of RRACH/GGAU islands in pyrimidine-rich regions. Such motifs, particularly oligo-U and UNUNU upstream of m<sup>6</sup>A sites, are also implicated in ECT2 binding via its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Finally, URUAY-type motifs are enriched at ECT2 crosslink sites, but their distinct properties suggest function as sites of competition between binding of ECT2 and as yet unidentified RNA-binding proteins. Our study provides coherence between genetic and molecular studies of m<sup>6</sup>A-YTH function in plants, and reveals new insight into the mode of RNA recognition by YTH-domain-containing proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mutational analysis to explore long-range allosteric couplings involved in a pentameric channel receptor pre-activation and activation</a></h4>

              
                Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate chemical signaling through a succession of allosteric transitions that are yet not completely understood as intermediate states remain poorly characterized by structural approaches. In a previous study on the prototypic bacterial proton-gated channel GLIC, we generated several fluorescent sensors of the protein conformation that report a fast transition to a pre-active state, which precedes the slower process of activation with pore opening. Here, we explored the phenotype of a series of allosteric mutations, using paralleled steady-state fluorescence and electrophysiological measurements over a broad pH range. Our data, fitted to a 3-states Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model, show that mutations at the subunit interface in the extracellular domain (ECD) principally alter pre-activation, while mutations in the lower ECD and in the transmembrane domain principally alter activation. We also show that propofol alters both transitions. Data are discussed in the framework of transition pathways generated by normal mode analysis (iModFit) that suggest collective protein motions concerted with pore opening. It further supports that pre-activation involves major quaternary compaction of the ECD, and suggests that activation involves principally a re-organization of a 'central gating region' involving a contraction of the ECD β-sandwich and the tilt of the channel lining M2 helix.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A MET-PTPRK kinase-phosphatase rheostat controls ZNRF3 and Wnt signalling</a></h4>

              
                Zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Wnt receptors for ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Previously we showed that dephosphorylation of an endocytic tyrosine motif (4Y motif) in ZNRF3 by protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) promotes ZNRF3 internalization and Wnt receptor degradation (Chang et al. 2020). However, a responsible protein tyrosine kinase(s) (PTK) phosphorylating the 4Y motif remained elusive. Here we identify the proto-oncogene MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) as a 4Y kinase. MET binds to ZNRF3 and induces 4Y phosphorylation, stimulated by the MET ligand HGF (hepatocyte growth factor, scatter factor). HGF-MET signalling reduces ZNRF3-dependent Wnt receptor degradation thereby enhancing Wnt/b-catenin signalling. Conversely, depletion or pharmacological inhibition of MET promotes internalization of ZNRF3 and Wnt receptor degradation. We conclude that HGF-MET signalling phosphorylates- and PTPRK dephosphorylates ZNRF3 to regulate ZNRF3 internalization, functioning as a rheostat for Wnt signalling that may offer novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of mycobacterial CIII2CIV2 respiratory supercomplex bound to the tuberculosis drug candidate telacebec (Q203)</a></h4>

              
                The imidazopyridine telacebec, also known as Q203, is one of only a few new classes of compounds in more than fifty years with demonstrated antituberculosis activity in humans. Telacebec inhibits the mycobacterial respiratory supercomplex composed of complexes III and IV (CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>). In mycobacterial electron transport chains, CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> replaces canonical CIII and CIV, transferring electrons from the intermediate carrier menaquinol to the final acceptor, molecular oxygen, while simultaneously transferring protons across the inner membrane to power ATP synthesis. We show that telacebec inhibits the menaquinol:oxygen oxidoreductase activity of purified <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> at concentrations similar to those needed to inhibit electron transfer in mycobacterial membranes and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> growth in culture. We then used electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to determine structures of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> both in the presence and absence of telacebec. The structures suggest that telacebec prevents menaquinol oxidation by blocking two different menaquinol binding modes to prevent CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Members of the ELMOD protein family specify formation of distinct aperture domains on the Arabidopsis pollen surface</a></h4>

              
                Pollen apertures, the characteristic gaps in pollen wall exine, have emerged as a model for studying the formation of distinct plasma membrane domains. In each species, aperture number, position, and morphology are typically fixed; across species they vary widely. During pollen development, certain plasma membrane domains attract specific proteins and lipids and become protected from exine deposition, developing into apertures. However, how these aperture domains are selected is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that patterns of aperture domains in <i>Arabidopsis</i> are controlled by the members of the ancient ELMOD protein family, which, although important in animals, has not been studied in plants. We show that two members of this family, MACARON (MCR) and ELMOD_A, act upstream of the previously discovered aperture proteins and that their expression levels influence the number of aperture domains that form on the surface of developing pollen grains. We also show that a third ELMOD family member, ELMOD_E, can interfere with MCR and ELMOD_A activities, changing aperture morphology and producing new aperture patterns. Our findings reveal key players controlling early steps in aperture domain formation, identify residues important for their function, and open new avenues for investigating how diversity of aperture patterns in nature is achieved.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation and compensation in a bacterial gene regulatory network evolving under antibiotic selection</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulatory networks allow organisms to generate coordinated responses to environmental challenges. In bacteria, regulatory networks are re-wired and re-purposed during evolution, though the relationship between selection pressures and evolutionary change is poorly understood. In this study, we discover that the early evolutionary response of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to the antibiotic trimethoprim involves derepression of PhoPQ signaling, an Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive two-component system, by inactivation of the MgrB feedback-regulatory protein. We report that derepression of PhoPQ confers trimethoprim-tolerance to <i>E. coli</i> by hitherto unrecognized transcriptional upregulation of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), target of trimethoprim. As a result, mutations in <i>mgrB</i> precede and facilitate the evolution of drug resistance. Using laboratory evolution, genome sequencing, and mutation re-construction, we show that populations of <i>E. coli</i> challenged with trimethoprim are faced with the evolutionary ‘choice’ of transitioning from tolerant to resistant by mutations in DHFR, or compensating for the fitness costs of PhoPQ derepression by inactivating the RpoS sigma factor, itself a PhoPQ-target. Outcomes at this evolutionary branch-point are determined by the strength of antibiotic selection, such that high pressures favor resistance, while low pressures favor cost compensation. Our results relate evolutionary changes in bacterial gene regulatory networks to strength of selection and provide mechanistic evidence to substantiate this link.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The YTHDF proteins ECT2 and ECT3 bind largely overlapping target sets and influence target mRNA abundance, not alternative polyadenylation</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulation via <i>N6</i>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in mRNA involves RNA-binding proteins that recognize m<sup>6</sup>A via a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain. The plant YTH domain proteins ECT2 and ECT3 act genetically redundantly in stimulating cell proliferation during organogenesis, but several fundamental questions regarding their mode of action remain unclear. Here, we use HyperTRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to show that most ECT2 and ECT3 targets overlap, with only few examples of preferential targeting by either of the two proteins. HyperTRIBE in different mutant backgrounds also provides direct views of redundant and specific target interactions of the two proteins. We also show that contrary to conclusions of previous reports, ECT2 does not accumulate in the nucleus. Accordingly, inactivation of <i>ECT2</i>, <i>ECT3</i> and their surrogate <i>ECT4</i> does not change patterns of polyadenylation site choice in ECT2/3 target mRNAs, but does lead to lower steady state accumulation of target mRNAs. In addition, mRNA and microRNA expression profiles show indications of stress response activation in <i>ect2/ect3/ect4</i> mutants, likely via indirect effects. Thus, previous suggestions of control of alternative polyadenylation by ECT2 are not supported by evidence, and ECT2 and ECT3 act largely redundantly to regulate target mRNA, including its abundance, in the cytoplasm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social framing effects in decision making</a></h4>

              
                Human decisions are known to be strongly influenced by the manner in which options are presented, the "framing effect". Here, we ask whether decision-makers are also influenced by how advice from other knowledgeable agents are framed, a "social framing effect". Concretely, do students learn better from a teacher who often frames advice by emphasizing appetitive outcomes, or do they learn better from another teacher who usually emphasizes avoiding options that can be harmful to their progress? We study the computational and neural mechanisms by which framing of advice affect decision-making, social learning, and trust. We found that human participants are more likely to trust and follow an adviser who often uses an appetitive frame for advice compared with another one who often uses an aversive frame. This social framing effect is implemented through a modulation of the integrative abilities of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. At the time of choice, this region combines information learned via personal experiences of reward with social information, but the combination differs depending on the social framing of advice. Personally-acquired information is weighted more strongly when dealing with an adviser who uses an aversive frame. The findings suggest that social advice is systematically incorporated into our decisions, while being affected by biases similar to those influencing individual value-based learning.

                The exact mechanism behind general anesthesia remains an open question in neuroscience. It has been proposed that anesthetics selectively prevent consciousness and memory via acting on microtubules (MTs). It is known that the magnetic field modulates MT organization. A recent study shows that a radical pair model can explain the isotope effect in xenon-induced anesthesia and predicts magnetic field effects on anesthetic potency. Further, reactive oxygen species are also implicated in MT stability and anesthesia. Based on a simple radical pair mechanism model and a simple mathematical model of MT organization, we show that magnetic fields can modulate spin dynamics of naturally occurring radical pairs in MT. We show that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the reaction cycle, which translates into a change in the MT density. We can reproduce magnetic field effects on the MT concentration that have been observed. Our model also predicts additional effects at slightly higher fields. Our model further predicts that the effect of zinc on the MT density exhibits isotopic dependence. The findings of this work make a connection between microtubule-based and radical pair-based quantum theories of consciousness.

                Accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau is linked to neuronal cell death in tauopathies, but how exactly intraneuronal Tau levels are regulated in health and disease remains unclear. Here we identify the trafficking adaptor protein Numb as an essential regulator of Tau homeostasis. Conditional inactivation of Numb in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) increases monomeric and oligomeric Tau levels, leading to axonal blebbing followed by neuronal cell loss in aged mice. Moreover, in a mouse model of tauopathy, inactivation of Numb in RGCs and spinal motoneurons accelerates neurodegeneration, and leads to precocious hindlimb paralysis. Conversely, overexpression of the long isoform of Numb (Numb-72), but not other isoforms, decreases intracellular Tau levels by promoting the extracellular release of monomeric Tau, and AAV-mediated delivery of Numb-72 in RGCs in vivo prevents neurodegeneration in two different mouse models of tauopathy. Taken together, these results uncover Numb as a modulator of intracellular Tau levels and identify Numb-72 as a novel therapeutic factor for tauopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Estimates of Curvilinear Self-Motion from Neural Signals in a Model of Primate MSTd</a></h4>

              
                Self-motion produces characteristic patterns of optic flow on the eye of the mobile observer. Movement along linear, straight paths without eye movements yields motion that radiates from the direction of travel (heading). The observer experiences more complex motion patterns while moving along more general curvilinear (e.g. circular) paths, the appearance of which depends on the radius of the curved path (path curvature) and the direction of gaze. Neurons in brain area MSTd of primate visual cortex exhibit tuning to radial motion patterns and have been linked with linear heading perception. MSTd also contains neurons that exhibit tuning to spirals, but their function is not well understood. We investigated in a computational model whether MSTd, through its diverse pattern tuning, could support estimation of a broader range of self-motion parameters from optic flow than has been previously demonstrated. We used deep learning to decode these parameters from signals produced by neurons tuned to radial expansion, spiral, ground flow, and other patterns in a mechanistic neural model of MSTd. Specifically, we found that we could accurately decode the clockwise/counterclockwise sign of curvilinear path and the gaze direction relative to the path tangent from spiral cells; heading from radial cells; and the curvature (radius) of the curvilinear path from activation produced by both radial and spiral populations. We demonstrate accurate decoding of these linear and curvilinear self-motion parameters in both synthetic and naturalistic videos of simulated self-motion. Estimates remained stable over time, while also rapidly adapting to dynamic changes in the observers curvilinear self-motion. Our findings suggest that specific populations of neurons in MSTd could effectively signal important aspects of the observers linear and curvilinear self-motion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Finding landmarks - An investigation of viewing behavior during spatial navigation in VR using a graph-theoretical analysis approach</a></h4>

              
                Vision provides the most important sensory information for spatial navigation. Recent technical advances allow new options to conduct more naturalistic experiments in virtual reality (VR) while additionally gather data of the viewing behavior with eye tracking investigations. Here, we propose a method that allows to quantify characteristics of visual behavior by using graph-theoretical measures to abstract eye tracking data recorded in a 3D virtual urban environment. The analysis is based on eye tracking data of 20 participants, who freely explored the virtual city Seahaven for 90 minutes with an immersive VR headset with an inbuild eye tracker. To extract what participants looked at, we defined "gaze" events, from which we created gaze graphs. On these, we applied graph-theoretical measures to reveal the underlying structure of visual attention. Applying graph partitioning, we found that our virtual environment could be treated as one coherent city. To investigate the importance of houses in the city, we applied the node degree centrality measure. Our results revealed that 10 houses had a node degree that exceeded consistently two-sigma distance from the mean node degree of all other houses. The importance of these houses was supported by the hierarchy index, which showed a clear hierarchical structure of the gaze graphs. As these high node degree houses fulfilled several characteristics of landmarks, we named them "gaze-graph-defined landmarks". Applying the rich club coefficient, we found that these gaze-graph-defined landmarks were preferentially connected to each other and that participants spend the majority of their experiment time in areas where at least two of those houses were visible. Our findings do not only provide new experimental evidence for the development of spatial knowledge, but also establish a new methodology to identify and assess the function of landmarks in spatial navigation based on eye tracking data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Genetic Platform for Functionally Profiling Odorant Receptors Ex Vivo Using Olfactory Cilia.</a></h4>

              
                The molecular basis for odor perception in humans remains a black box as odorant receptors (ORs) are notoriously difficult to study outside of their native environment. Efforts toward OR expression and functional profiling in heterologous systems have been met with limited success due to poor efficiency of cell surface expression and consequently reduced G-protein signal amplification. We previously reported a genetic strategy in mice to increase the number of sensory neurons expressing specific ORs, which transforms the 10 million neurons of the mouse nose into a bioreactor producing large quantities of fully functional OR protein. We now describe the isolation of cilia from these bioreactors for two human ORs. Cilia are known to contain all components of the olfactory signal transduction machinery and can be placed into an ex vivo well-plate assay to rapidly measure robust, reproducible odor-specific responses. Our OR1A1 and OR5AN1 isolated cilia reveal 10-100fold more sensitivity than existing assays. Tissue from a single animal produces up to 4,000 384-well assay wells, and isolated olfactory cilia can be stored frozen and thus preserved for long term usage. This pipeline offers a sensitive, highly scalable ex vivo odor screening platform that opens the door for decoding human olfaction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Here's the twist: How the brain updates naturalistic event memories as our understanding of the past changes</a></h4>

              
                The brain actively reshapes past memories in light of new incoming information. In the current study, we ask how the brain supports this updatinge process during the encoding and recall of naturalistic stimuli. One group of participants watched a movie ("The Sixth Sense") with a cinematic "twist" at the end that dramatically changed the interpretation of previous events. Next, participants were asked to verbally recall the movie events, taking into account the new "twist" information. Most participants updated their recall to incorporate the twist. Two additional groups recalled the movie without having to update their memories during recall: one group never saw the twist; another group was exposed to the twist prior to the beginning of the movie, and thus the twist information was incorporated both during encoding and recall. We found that providing participants with information about the twist beforehand altered neural response patterns during movie-viewing in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, presenting participants with the twist at the end of the movie changed the neural representation of the previously-encoded information during recall in a subset of DMN regions. Further evidence for this transformation was obtained by comparing the neural activation patterns during encoding and recall and correlating them with behavioral signatures of memory updating. Our results demonstrate that neural representations of past events encoded in the DMN are dynamically integrated with new information that reshapes our memory in natural contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced nociception in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy</a></h4>

              
                The most prevalent comorbidity of cerebral palsy (CP) is pain. In order to investigate the relationship between perinatal injuries that cause CP and nociception, we investigated mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), sham surgery without hypoxia, and after a typical, unperturbed gestation. A range of motor deficits were observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 minutes at 70-80% gestation) as previously described. We found that HI caused mechanical and thermal allodynia at postnatal day 5, which was accompanied by an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene related peptide; CGRP) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn. Non-peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of isolectin B4; IB4) were unaltered in HI kits but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Interestingly, HI-subjected rabbits exhibited allodynia, even in the absence of motor deficits. HI motor affected and unaffected kits had similar thermal sensitivity but affected kits had less mechanical sensitivity than HI unaffected kits. These findings suggest that prenatal neural injuries impact sensory and motor networks independently and that developing sensory circuits may be more vulnerable than motor circuits to perturbation by prenatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. In conclusion, pain experienced by individuals with CP could arise from developmental insults capable of causing the condition, and therapeutics that specifically target altered nociception in these individuals could be beneficial for treating and preventing chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction of Inefficient BCI Users based on Cognitive Skills and Personality Traits</a></h4>

              
                BCI inefficiency is one of the major challenges of motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI). Past research suggests that certain cognitive skills and personality traits correlate with MI-BCI real-time performance. Other studies have examined sensorimotor rhythm changes (also known as mu suppression) as a valuable indicator of successful execution of the MI task. This research aims to combine these insights by investigating whether cognitive factors and personality traits can make predictions of a users ability to modulate mu rhythms during a MI-BCI task. Data containing 55 subjects who completed a MI task was employed, and a stepwise linear regression model was implemented to select the most relevant features for mu suppression prediction. The most accurate model was based on these factors: Spatial Ability, Visuospatial Memory, Autonomy, and Vividness of Visual Imagery. Further correlation analyses showed that a novice users mu suppression during a MI-BCI task can be predicted based on their visuospatial memory ability, as measured by the Design Organization Test (DOT).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Face masks impair reconstruction of acoustic speech features and higher-level segmentational features in the presence of a distractor speaker</a></h4>

              
                Face masks have become a prevalent measure during the Covid-19 pandemic to counteract the transmission of SARS-CoV 2. An unintended 'side-effect' of face masks is their adverse influence on speech perception especially in challenging listening situations. So far, behavioural studies have not pinpointed exactly which feature(s) of speech processing face masks affect in such listening situations. We conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech (i.e. an audiobook). In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). A decoding model on the clear AV speech (i.e. no additional speaker and target speaker not wearing a face mask) was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations, i.e. when a distracting speaker was also presented. Our findings demonstrate the detrimental impact face masks have on listening and speech perception, thus extending previous behavioural results. Supporting the idea of visual facilitation of speech is the fact that we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics. This idea is in line with recent research, also by our group, showing that visual cortical regions track spectral modulations. Since hearing impairment usually affects higher frequencies, the detrimental effect of face masks might pose a particular challenge for individuals who likely need the visual information about higher frequencies (e.g. formants) to compensate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spectral graph theory of brain oscillations -- revisited and improved</a></h4>

              
                Mathematical modeling of the relationship between the functional activity and the structural wiring of the brain has largely been undertaken using non-linear and biophysically detailed mathematical models with regionally varying parameters. While this approach provides us a rich repertoire of multistable dynamics that can be displayed by the brain, it is computationally demanding. Moreover, although neuronal dynamics at the microscopic level are nonlinear and chaotic, it is unclear if such detailed nonlinear models are required to capture the emergent meso- (regional population ensemble) and macro-scale (whole brain) behavior, which is largely deterministic and reproducible across individuals. Indeed, recent modeling effort based on spectral graph theory has shown that an analytical model without regionally varying parameters can capture the empirical magnetoencephalography frequency spectra and the spatial patterns of the alpha and beta frequency bands accurately. In this work, we demonstrate an improved hierarchical, linearized, and analytic spectral graph theory-based model that can capture the frequency spectra obtained from magnetoencephalography recordings of resting healthy subjects. We reformulated the spectral graph theory model in line with classical neural mass models, therefore providing more biologically interpretable parameters, especially at the local scale. We demonstrated that this model performs better than the original model when comparing the spectral correlation of modeled frequency spectra and that obtained from the magnetoencephalography recordings. This model also performs equally well in predicting the spatial patterns of the empirical alpha and beta frequency bands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the reliability, validity, and utility of overlapping networks: Implications for cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Brain regions can be consistently clustered together into a small number of large-scale networks based on the correlation of their activity across time. However, the methods typically used to assign regions to these networks typically force non- or minimal overlap between the networks, losing information about how particular regions may connect to multiple networks. However, new methods are emerging that allow networks to overlap. Here, we examined the reliability and validity of one such assignment method, the mixed membership algorithm, and the utility of overlapping assignment for identifying potential gaps in existing network models of behavior. Analyses were conducted on resting state data from a large set of participants. First, we split the data into two halves and generated group-level overlapping networks for each subgroup. We then used a bootstrapped Dice similarity analysis to demonstrate that the binarized network topographies showed good agreement between subgroups. Next, we generated nonoverlapping networks in the combined data using a typical k-means clustering method. Using the same Dice Similarity analysis, we compared these nonoverlapping networks both with previously published nonoverlapping networks (Yeo et al, 2011) and with overlapping networks likewise generated for the combined data. The nonoverlapping networks generally recapitulated known networks in the literature, and the overlapping networks captured large portions of one to three nonoverlapping network topographies. Following this, we used a relative entropy analysis to assess the uniformity of each region's distribution of connections across the overlapping networks. While many regions were indeed assigned to one network, more were assigned to multiple networks. Furthermore, regions assigned to multiple networks did not necessarily show stronger connection to one network over the others. Finally, we assessed the network membership of regions of the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks of the Dual-Networks model of cognitive control. In combination, the regions were members of all of the overlapping networks, and the majority were assigned to multiple networks. Together, these results indicate that overlapping assignment produces consistent and biologically plausible network topographies, and that a complete network model of cognitive control, or indeed any network model of behavior needs to be updated to account for multiple-network membership and the complex interactions that occur between the relevant networks as a function of their overlapping nature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced Production of Mesencephalic Dopaminergic Neurons from Lineage-Restricted Human Undifferentiated Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                The differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons requires a precise combination of extrinsic factors that recapitulates the in vivo environment and timing. Current methods are capable of generating authentic mesDA neurons after long-term culture in vitro; however, when mesDA progenitors are transplanted in vivo, the resulting mesDA neurons are only minor components of the graft. This low yield hampers the broad use of these cells in the clinic. In this study, we genetically modified pluripotent stem cells to generate a novel type of stem cells called lineage-restricted undifferentiated stem cells (LR-USCs), which robustly generate mesDA neurons. LR-USCs are prevented from differentiating into a broad range of nondopaminergic cell types by knocking out genes that are critical for the specification of cells of alternate lineages. Specifically, we target transcription factors involved in the production of spinal cord and posterior hindbrain cell types. When LR-USCs are differentiated under caudalizing condition, which normally give rise to hindbrain cell types, a large proportion adopt a midbrain identity and develop into authentic mesDA neurons. We show that the mesDA neurons are electrophysiologically active, and due to their higher purity, are capable of restoring motor behavior eight weeks after transplantation into 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. This novel strategy improves the reliability and scalability of mesDA neuron generation for clinical use.

                The sleep and circadian systems act in concert to regulate sleep-wake timing, yet the molecular mechanisms that underpin their interaction to induce sleep remain unknown. Synaptic protein phosphorylation, driven by the kinase SIK3, correlates with sleep pressure, however it is unclear whether these phosphoproteome changes are causally responsible for inducing sleep. Here we show that the light-dependent activity of SIK1 controls the phosphorylation of a subset of the brain phosphoproteome to induce sleep in a manner that is independent of sleep pressure. By uncoupling phosphorylation and sleep induction from sleep pressure, we establish that synaptic protein phosphorylation provides a causal mechanism for the induction of sleep under different environmental contexts. Furthermore, we propose a framework that details how the salt-inducible kinases regulate the synaptic phosphoproteome to integrate exogenous and endogenous stimuli, thereby providing the molecular basis upon which the sleep and circadian systems interact to control the sleep-wake cycle.

                Membrane excitability and cell-to-cell communication in the brain are tightly regulated by diverse ion channels and receptor proteins localized to distinct membrane compartments. Currently, a major technical barrier in cellular neuroscience is lack of reliable methods to label these membrane proteins and image their sub-cellular localization and dynamics. To overcome this challenge, we devised optical imaging strategies that enable systematic characterization of subcellular composition, relative abundances and trafficking dynamics of membrane proteins at nanometer scales in cultured neurons as well as in the brain. Using these methods, we revealed exquisite developmental regulation of subcellular distributions of voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Nav1.2 and Nav1.6, settling a decade long debate regarding the molecular identity of sodium channels in dendrites. In addition, we discovered a previously uncharacterized trafficking pathway that targets Nav1.2 to unmyelinated fragments in the distal axon. Myelination counteracts this pathway, facilitating the installment of Nav1.6 as the dominant VGSC in the axon. Together, these imaging approaches unveiled compartment-specific trafficking mechanisms underpinning differential membrane distributions of VGSCs and open avenues to decipher how membrane protein localization and dynamics contribute to neural computation in the brain.

                Previous work has sought to understand decision confidence as a prediction of the probability that a decision will be correct, leading to debate over whether these predictions are optimal, and whether they rely on the same decision variable as decisions themselves. This work has generally relied on idealized, low-dimensional modeling frameworks, such as signal detection theory or Bayesian inference, leaving open the question of how decision confidence operates in the domain of high-dimensional, naturalistic stimuli. To address this, we developed a deep neural network model optimized to assess decision confidence directly given high-dimensional inputs such as images. The model naturally accounts for a number of puzzling dissociations between decisions and confidence, suggests a principled explanation of these dissociations in terms of optimization for the statistics of sensory inputs, and makes the surprising prediction that, despite these dissociations, decisions and confidence depend on a common decision variable.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational Fingerprints: Modeling Interactions Between Brain Regions as Points in a Function Space</a></h4>

              
                In this paper we propose a novel technique to investigate the nonlinear interactions between brain regions that captures both the strength and the type of the functional relationship. Inspired by the field of functional analysis, we propose that the relationship between activity in two different brain areas can be viewed as a point in function space, identified by coordinates along an infinite set of basis functions. Using Hermite Polynomials as basis functions, we estimate from fMRI data a truncated set of coordinates that serve as a "computational fingerprint," characterizing the interaction between two brain areas. We provide a proof of the convergence of the estimates in the limit, and we validate the method with simulations in which the ground truth is known, additionally showing that computational fingerprints detect statistical dependence also when correlations ("functional connectivity") is near zero. We then use computational fingerprints to examine the neural interactions with a seed region of choice: the Fusiform Face Area (FFA). Using k-means clustering across each voxel's computational fingerprint, we illustrate that the addition of the nonlinear basis functions allows for the discrimination of inter-regional interactions that are otherwise grouped together when only linear dependence is used. Finally, we show that regions in V5 and medial occipital and temporal lobes exhibit significant nonlinear interactions with the FFA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Axial motion estimation and correction for simultaneous multi-plane two-photon calcium imaging</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon imaging in behaving animals is typically accompanied by brain motion. For functional imaging experiments, for example with genetically encoded calcium indicators, such brain motion induces changes in fluorescence intensity. These motion related intensity changes or motion artifacts cannot easily be separated from neural activity induced signals. While lateral motion within the focal plane can be corrected by computationally aligning images, axial motion, out of the focal plane, cannot easily be corrected. Here, we develop an algorithm for axial motion correction for non-ratiometric calcium indicators taking advantage of simultaneous multi-plane imaging. Using at least two simultaneously recorded focal planes, the algorithm separates motion related and neural activity induced changes in fluorescence intensity. The developed motion correction approach allows axial motion estimation and correction at high frame rates for isolated structures in the imaging volume in vivo, such as sparse expression patterns in the fruit fly brain.

                The search for optimized forms of human-computer interaction (HCI) has intensified alongside the growing potential for the combination of biosignals with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to enable the next generation of personal computing. At the core, this requires decoding the user's biosignals into digital commands. Electromyography (EMG) is a biosensor of particular interest due to the ease of data collection, the relatively high signal-to-noise-ratio, its non-invasiveness, and the ability to interpret the signal as being generated by (intentional) muscle activity. Here, we investigate the potential of using data taken from a simple 2-channel EMG setup to differentiate 5 distinct movements. In particular, EMG was recorded from two bipolar sensors over small hand muscles (extensor digitorum, flexor digitorum profundus) while a subject performed 50 trials of dorsal extension and return for each of the five digits. The maximum and the mean data values across the trial were determined for each channel and used as features. A k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification was performed and overall 5-class classification accuracy reached 94% when using the full trial's time window, while simulated real-time classification reached 90.4% accuracy when using the constructed kNN model (k=3) with a 280ms sliding window. Additionally, unsupervised learning was performed and a homogeneity of 85% was achieved. This study demonstrates that reliable decoding of different natural movements is possible with fewer than one channel per class, even without taking into account temporal features of the signal. The technical feasibility of this approach in a real-time setting was validated by sending real-time EMG data to a custom Unity3D VR application through a Lab Streaming Layer to control a user interface. Further use-cases of gamification and rehabilitation were also examined alongside integration of eye-tracking and gesture recognition for a sensor fusion approach to HCI and user intent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An open-source method for analysis of confocal calcium imaging with sparse cells</a></h4>

              
                Background: The research in the neuroscience field has evolved to use complex imaging and computational tools to extract comprehensive information from data sets. Calcium imaging is a widely used technique that requires sophisticated software to get precise and reproducible results. Many laboratories struggle to adopt computational methods due to the lack of computational knowledge and paywalls for software. New Method: Here we propose a calcium imaging analysis method using TrackMate, an open-source Fiji plugin, to track neurons at single-cell resolution, detect regions of interest (ROIs), and extract fluorescence intensities. For confocal images, this method uses the maximal value to represent the cell intensity for each z stack. This method can be done without coding or be combined with Python or Jupyter Notebook scripts to accelerate the analysis. Results: This method is validated in fly larval cool neurons, whose calcium changes in these neurons respond to temperature fluctuation. It also identifies potential problems in approaches that extract signals from maximal projection images. Comparison with existing methods: This method does not depend on programming knowledge and/or commercial software but uses open-source software and requires no coding abilities. Since TrackMate automatically defines ROIs, this method greatly avoids human error and increases reproducibility. In addition, practice images and a step-by-step guide are provided to help users adopt this method in their experiments. Conclusions: Therefore, this open-source method allows for the analysis of calcium imaging data at single-cell resolution with high reproducibility and has the potential to be applied in various cell types and animal models by researchers with different programming abilities.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that causes a range of social communication and behavioral impairments. ASD typically manifests in young children, often with developmental delay or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID) as comorbidities. Accruing evidence indicates that ASD is highly heritable and genome-wide studies on ASD cohorts have defined numerous genetic contributors. Notably, most of these studies have been performed with individuals of European and Hispanic ancestry and thus there is a paucity of genetic analyses of ASD in the East Asian population. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 772 ASD trios from China, combining with a previous study of 369 Chinese ASD trios, to identify de novo variants in a total of 1141 ASD trios. We found that ASD probands without DD/ID carried less disruptive de novo variants, including protein-truncating and missense variants, than ASD with DD/ID. Surprisingly, we showed that expression of genes with de novo variants found in ASD probands without DD/ID were enriched in a specific group of neural progenitor cells, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying high functioning autism. Importantly, some ASD risk genes from this study are not present in the current ASD gene database, suggesting that there are novel genetic contributors to ASD in East Asian populations. We validated one such novel ASD risk gene SLC35G1 by showing that mice harboring heterozygous deletion of Slc35g1 exhibited defects in social interaction behaviors. Together, this work nominates novel ASD risk genes and indicates that ASD genetic studies in different geographic populations are essential to reveal the comprehensive genetic architecture of ASD.

                Neuronal processing is energy demanding, and relies on sugar metabolism as an energy source. To provide a constant metabolite supply neurons and glial cells express many glucose and lactate transporters of the solute carrier (SLC) 5A family. Here we dissect the partially redundant functions of three highly related glia specific Drosophila genes encoding SLC5A proteins, Rumpel, Bumpel and Kumpel. While knockdown of rumpel causes several behavioral phenotypes, they are less prominent in rumpel mutants. bumpel and kumpel mutants are viable and fertile, lacking discernible phenotypes. However, in bumpel kumpel double mutants and to an even greater extent in rumpel bumpel kumpel triple mutants oogenesis is disrupted at the onset of the vitollegenic phase. This indicates at least partially redundant functions between these genes. Rescue experiments exploring this effect indicate that oogenesis can be affected by CNS glial cells. Moreover, expression of heterologous mammalian SLC5A transporter proteins, with known transport properties, suggest that Bumpel and/or Kumpel transport glucose or lactate. Overall, our results imply a redundancy in SLC5A nutrient sensing functions in Drosophila glial cells, affecting ovarian development and behavior.

                Our mind can represent various objects from the physical world metaphorically into an abstract and complex high-dimensional object space, with a finite number of orthogonal axes encoding critical object features. Previous fMRI studies have shown that the middle fusiform sulcus in the ventral temporal cortex separates the real-world small-size map from the large-size map. Here we asked whether the feature of objects' real-world size constructed an axis of object space with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based on three criteria of sensitivity, independence and necessity that are impractical to be examined altogether with traditional approaches. A principal component analysis on features extracted by the DCNNs showed that objects' real-world size was encoded by an independent component, and the removal of this component significantly impaired DCNN's performance in recognizing objects. By manipulating stimuli, we found that the shape and texture of objects, rather than retina size, co-occurrence and task demands, accounted for the representation of the real-world size in the DCNNs. A follow-up fMRI experiment on humans further demonstrated that the shape, but not the texture, was used to infer the real-world size of objects in humans. In short, with both computational modeling and empirical human experiments, our study provided the first evidence supporting the feature of objects' real-world size as an axis of object space, and devised a novel paradigm for future exploring the structure of object space.

                Despite the recognized importance of spinal cord in sensory processing, motor behaviors and/or neural diseases, the underlying neuronal clusters remain elusive. Recently, several studies attempted to define the neuronal types and functional heterogeneity in spinal cord using single cell and/or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in varied animal models. However, the molecular evidence of neuronal heterogeneity in human spinal cord has not been established yet. Here we sought to classify spinal cord neurons from human donors by high-throughput single-nucleus RNA-sequencing. The functional heterogeneity of identified cell types and signaling pathways that connecting neuronal subtypes were explored. Moreover, we also compared human results with previous single-cell transcriptomic profiles of mouse spinal cord. As a result, we generated the first comprehensive atlas of human spinal cord neurons and defined 18 neuronal clusters. In addition to identification of the new and functionally-distinct neuronal subtypes, our results also provide novel marker genes for previously known neuronal types. The comparation with mouse transcriptomic profiles revealed an overall similarity in the cellular composition of spinal cord between the two species. In summary, these results illustrate the complexity and diversity of neuronal types in human spinal cord and will provide an important resource for future researches to explore the molecular mechanism underlying several spinal cord physiology and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adeno-associated virus (AAV) reduces cortical dendritic complexity in a TLR9-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) allow rapid and efficient gene delivery in the nervous system. AAVs are widely used in research and are the basis of multiple FDA-approved gene therapies. Here, we find that the immune response to AAV's genome reduces dendritic complexity in mammalian cortex. Dendritic loss associated with AAV-mediated gene delivery occurs at experimentally-relevant titers, cannot be explained by responses to transgene expression or surgery, and is not restricted to a particular capsid serotype, encoded transgene, promoter, or production facility. AAV-associated dendritic loss is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and upregulation of immune molecules that can limit dendritic complexity and synaptic transmission. Blocking detection of unmethylated CpG-rich DNA via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) protects dendritic complexity, suggesting that immunodetection of a core feature of the AAV genome triggers dendritic loss. These results reveal previously unsuspected impacts of AAV on neuronal structure and function and identify TLR9 inhibitors as important tools to improve the safety and efficacy of AAV-mediated gene delivery in the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal-prefrontal theta coupling develops as mice become proficient in associative odorant discrimination learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory requires coordinated activity between different regions of the brain. Here we studied the interaction between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal dorsal CA1 during associative odorant discrimination learning in the mouse. We found that as the animal learns to discriminate odorants in a go-no go task the coupling of high frequency neural oscillations to the phase of theta oscillations (phase-amplitude coupling or PAC) changes in a manner that results in divergence between rewarded and unrewarded odorant-elicited changes in the theta-phase referenced power (tPRP) for beta and gamma oscillations. In addition, in the proficient animal there was a decrease in the coordinated oscillatory activity between CA1 and mPFC in the presence of the unrewarded odorant. Furthermore, the changes in PAC resulted in a marked increase in the accuracy for decoding odorant identity from tPRP when the animal became proficient. Finally, we studied the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II  (CaMKII), a protein involved in learning and memory, in oscillatory neural processing in this task. We find that the accuracy for decoding the odorant identity from tPRP decreases in CaMKII knockout mice and that this accuracy correlates with behavioral performance. These results implicate a role for PAC and CaMKII in olfactory go-no go associative learning in the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.

	<p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is involved in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased HPA axis activity can be observed during chronic stress, which plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression. Overactivity of the HPA axis occurs in major depressive disorder (MDD), leading to cognitive dysfunction and reduced mood. There is also a correlation between the HPA axis activation and gut microbiota, which has a significant impact on the development of MDD. It is believed that the gut microbiota can influence the HPA axis function through the activity of cytokines, prostaglandins, or bacterial antigens of various microbial species. The activity of the HPA axis in schizophrenia varies and depends mainly on the severity of the disease. This review summarizes the involvement of the HPA axis in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on major depression and schizophrenia, and highlights a possible correlation between these conditions. Although many effective antidepressants are available, a large proportion of patients do not respond to initial treatment. This review also discusses new therapeutic strategies that affect the HPA axis, such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists, vasopressin V1B receptor antagonists and non-psychoactive CB1 receptor agonists in depression and/or schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>Although recent studies have explored the potential of multidomain brain health programs, there is a dearth of literature on operationalizing this research to create a clinical treatment program specifically for subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Patients seen by geriatricians in primary care and by behavioral neurology services at our institution presenting with SCD were recruited via a patient-appropriate flyer. After all participants had a 1-h brain health consultation with a neuropsychologist and were provided with program materials, they were randomized to attend a 10-week intervention designed to support program implementation (N = 10) or the control group of implementing the program on their own (N = 11). The program included (1) a calendar-based executive and memory support system for compensatory training and (2) training in healthy lifestyle. There were no significant differences between groups for any outcomes. Participants across both groups showed significant improvements with moderate effect sizes in compensatory strategy use, anxiety symptoms, and daily functioning, which were sustained through 6-month follow-up. They also increased physical activity by the end of the intervention period but did not sustain this through 6-month follow-up. Our pilot study demonstrates preliminary feasibility of a cognitive compensatory and lifestyle-based brain health program. Additional research is recommended to further develop two potentially scalable implementation strategies—coaching and self-implementation after brief consultation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with eHealth interventions or digital biomarkers provides added value to the current care path. Evidence in the literature is currently scarce. MS sherpa is an eHealth intervention with digital biomarkers, aimed at monitoring symptom progression and disease activity. To show the added value of digital biomarker–based eHealth interventions to the MS care path, an early Health Technology Assessment (eHTA) was performed, with MS sherpa as an example, to assess the potential impact on treatment switches. (2) Methods: The eHTA was performed according to the Dutch guidelines for health economic evaluations. A decision analytic MS model was used to estimate the costs and benefits of MS standard care with and without use of MS sherpa, expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from both societal and health care perspectives. The efficacy of MS sherpa on early detection of active disease and the initiation of a treatment switch were modeled for a range of assumed efficacy (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%). (3) Results: From a societal perspective, for the efficacy of 15% or 20%, MS sherpa became dominant, which means cost-saving compared to the standard of care. MS sherpa is cost-effective in the 5% and 10% scenarios (ICERs EUR 14,535 and EUR 4069, respectively). From the health care perspective, all scenarios were cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the efficacy of MS sherpa in detecting active disease early leading to treatment switches be the most impactful factor in the MS model. (4) Conclusions: The results indicate the potential of eHealth interventions to be cost-effective or even cost-saving in the MS care path. As such, digital biomarker–based eHealth interventions, like MS sherpa, are promising cost-effective solutions in optimizing MS disease management for people with MS, by detecting active disease early and helping neurologists in decisions on treatment switch.</p>

	<p>The sensorimotor system plays a critical role in several cognitive processes. Here, we review recent studies documenting this interplay at different levels. First, we concentrate on studies that have shown how the sensorimotor system is flexibly involved in interactions with objects. We report evidence demonstrating how social context and situations influence affordance activation, and then focus on tactile and kinesthetic components in body–object interactions. Then, we turn to word use, and review studies that have shown that not only concrete words, but also abstract words are grounded in the sensorimotor system. We report evidence that abstract concepts activate the mouth effector more than concrete concepts, and discuss this effect in light of studies on adults, children, and infants. Finally, we pinpoint possible sensorimotor mechanisms at play in the acquisition and use of abstract concepts. Overall, we show that the involvement of the sensorimotor system is flexibly modulated by context, and that its role can be integrated and flanked by that of other systems such as the linguistic system. We suggest that to unravel the role of the sensorimotor system in cognition, future research should fully explore the complexity of this intricate, and sometimes slippery, relation.</p>

	<p>Developmental dyslexia is typically defined as a difficulty with an individual’s command of written language, arising from deficits in phonological awareness. However, motor entrainment difficulties in non-linguistic synchronization and time-keeping tasks have also been reported. Such findings gave rise to proposals of an underlying rhythm processing deficit in dyslexia, even though to date, evidence for impaired motor entrainment with the rhythm of natural speech is rather scarce, and the role of speech rhythm in phonological awareness is unclear. The present study aimed to fill these gaps. Dyslexic adults and age-matched control participants with variable levels of previous music training completed a series of experimental tasks assessing phoneme processing, rhythm perception, and motor entrainment abilities. In a rhythm entrainment task, participants tapped along to the perceived beat of natural spoken sentences. In a phoneme processing task, participants monitored for sonorant and obstruent phonemes embedded in nonsense strings. Individual sensorimotor skills were assessed using a number of screening tests. The results lacked evidence for a motor impairment or a general motor entrainment difficulty in dyslexia, at least among adult participants of the study. Instead, the results showed that the participants’ performance in the phonemic task was predictive of their performance in the rhythmic task, but not vice versa, suggesting that atypical rhythm processing in dyslexia may be the consequence, but not the cause, of dyslexic difficulties with phoneme-level encoding. No evidence for a deficit in the entrainment to the syllable rate in dyslexic adults was found. Rather, metrically weak syllables were significantly less often at the center of rhythmic attention in dyslexic adults as compared to neurotypical controls, with an increased tendency in musically trained participants. This finding could not be explained by an auditory deficit in the processing of acoustic-prosodic cues to the rhythm structure, but it is likely to be related to the well-documented auditory short-term memory issue in dyslexia.</p>

	<p>Oxidative stress mechanisms may explain associations between perinatal acetaminophen exposure and childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We investigated whether the changes in umbilical cord plasma amino acids needed to synthesize the antioxidant glutathione and in the oxidative stress biomarker 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine may explain the association between cord plasma acetaminophen and ADHD in the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC). Mother–child dyads were followed at the Boston Medical Center between 1998 and 2018. Cord plasma analytes were measured from archived samples collected at birth. Physician diagnoses of childhood ADHD were obtained from medical records. The final sample consisted of 568 participants (child mean age [SD]: 9.3 [3.5] years, 315 (52.8%) male, 248 (43.7%) ADHD, 320 (56.3%) neurotypical development). Cord unmetabolized acetaminophen was positively correlated with methionine (R = 0.33, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), serine (R = 0.30, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), glycine (R = 0.34, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and glutamate (R = 0.16, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Children with cord acetaminophen levels &amp;amp;gt;50th percentile appeared to have higher risk of ADHD for each increase in cord 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine level. Adjusting for covariates, increasing cord methionine, glycine, serine, and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine were associated with significantly higher odds for childhood ADHD. Cord methionine statistically mediated 22.1% (natural indirect effect logOR = 0.167, SE = 0.071, p = 0.019) and glycine mediated 22.0% (natural indirect effect logOR = 0.166, SE = 0.078, p = 0.032) of the association between cord acetaminophen &amp;amp;gt;50th percentile with ADHD. Our findings provide some clues, but additional investigation into oxidative stress pathways and the association of acetaminophen exposure and childhood ADHD is warranted.</p>

	<p>Internet use has been steadily and unstoppably gaining ground in all areas of life, from recreational activities to the establishment of social relations. However, addictive use of the Internet is a problem that seriously affects some people. Factors that may influence the occurrence of inappropriate internet use include age and social skills. For this reason, the aim of this study is to analyze the influence of social skills and age on the development of problematic internet use in university students. The study involved 514 students enrolled at a university in Spain, who filled in two questionnaires, one on problematic internet use and the other on social skills. Multivariate multiple linear regression models revealed that some social skills variables (conversation and social ease, empathic and positive feeling skills, risk coping) predicted problematic internet use. In addition, age played a role in preference for online social interaction and deficient self-regulation. Younger students were more at risk of having obsessive thoughts related to internet use and of engaging in compulsive internet use compared to older students.</p>

	<p>Before the course of Alzheimer’s disease fully manifests itself and largely impairs a patient’s cognitive abilities, its progression has already lasted for a considerable time without being noticed. In this project, we mapped the development of spatial orientation impairment in an active place avoidance task—a highly sensitive test for mild hippocampal damage. We tested vision, anxiety and spatial orientation performance at four age levels of 4, 6, 9, and 12 months across male and female TgF-344 AD rats carrying human genes for presenilin-1 and amyloid precursor protein. We found a progressive deterioration of spatial navigation in transgenic animals, beginning already at the age of 4 months, that fully developed at 6 months of age across both male and female groups, compared to their age-matched controls. In addition, we described the gradual vision impairment that was accentuated in females at the age of 12 months. These results indicate a rather early onset of cognitive impairment in the TgF-344 AD Alzheimer’s disease model, starting earlier than shown to date, and preceding the reported development of amyloid plaques.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Both birds and mammals have relatively large forebrains and cerebella. In mammals, there are extensive sensori-motor projections to the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei originating from several parts of the cerebral cortex. Similar forebrain-to-cerebellum pathways exist in birds but the organization of this circuitry has not been studied extensively. Birds have two nuclei at the base of the brainstem thought to be homologous to the pontine nuclei of mammals, the medial and lateral pontine nuclei (PM, PL). Additionally, birds are unique in that they have a pretectal nucleus called the medial spiriform nucleus (SpM) that, like the pontine nuclei, also receives projections from the forebrain and projects to the oculomotor cerebellum (OCb; folia VI to VIII). The OCb also receives input from the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM), which analyzes visual optic flow information resulting from self-movement. In this study, we used single or double injections of fluorescent tracers to study the organization of these inputs from PM, PL, SpM and LM to the OCb in pigeons. We found that these inputs follow a zonal organization. The most medial zone in the OCb, zone A1, receives bilateral inputs from the lateral SpM, PL and LM. Zones A2 and C receive a bilateral projection from the medial SpM, and a mostly contralateral projection from PM and LM. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Previous Motor Actions Outweigh Sensory Information in Sensorimotor Statistical Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans can use their previous experience in form of statistical priors to improve decisions. It is, however, unclear how such priors are learned and represented. Importantly, it has remained elusive whether prior learning is independent of the sensorimotor system involved in the learning process or not, as both modality-specific and modality-general learning have been reported in the past. Here, we used a saccadic eye movement task to probe the learning and representation of a spatial prior across a few trials. In this task, learning occurs in an unsupervised manner and through encountering trial-by-trial visual hints drawn from a distribution centered on the target location. Using a model-comparison approach, we found that participants&rsquo; prior knowledge is largely represented in the form of their previous motor actions, with minimal influence from the previously seen visual hints. By using two different motor contexts for response (looking either at the estimated target location, or exactly opposite to it), we could further compare whether prior experience obtained in one motor context can be transferred to the other. Although learning curves were highly similar, and participants seemed to use the same strategy for both response types, they could not fully transfer their knowledge between contexts, as performance and confidence ratings dropped after a switch of the required response. Together, our results suggest that humans preferably use the internal representations of their previous motor actions, rather than past incoming sensory information, to form statistical sensorimotor priors on the timescale of a few trials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Task- and Intensity-Dependent Modulation of Arm-Trunk Neural Interactions in the Corticospinal Pathway in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Most human movements require coordinated activation of multiple muscles. Although many studies reported associations between arm, leg, and trunk muscles during functional tasks, their neural interaction mechanisms still remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate arm-trunk or arm-leg neural interactions in the corticospinal tract during different arm muscle contractions. Specifically, we examined corticospinal excitability of the erector spinae (ES; trunk extensor), rectus abdominis (RA; trunk flexor), and tibialis anterior (TA; leg) muscles while participants exerted: (1) wrist flexion and (2) wrist extension isometric contraction at various contraction intensity levels ranging from rest to 50% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) effort. Corticospinal excitability was assessed using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited through motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results showed that ES MEPs were facilitated even at low contractions (&gt;5% MVC) during wrist flexion and extension, while stronger contractions (&gt;25% MVC) were required to facilitate RA MEPs. The extent of facilitation of ES MEPs depended on contraction intensity of wrist extension, but not flexion. Moreover, TA MEPs were facilitated at low contractions (&gt;5% MVC) during wrist flexion and extension, but contraction intensity dependence was only shown during stronger wrist extension contractions (&gt;25% MVC). In conclusion, trunk extensor corticospinal excitability seems to depend on the task and the intensity of arm contraction, while this is not true for trunk flexor and leg muscles. Our study therefore demonstrated task- and intensity-dependent neural interactions of arm-trunk connections, which may underlie anatomic and/or functional substrates of these muscle pairs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Somatostatin Interneurons of the Insula Mediate QR2-Dependent Novel Taste Memory Enhancement</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Forming long-term memories is crucial for adaptive behavior and survival in changing environments. The molecular consolidation processes which underlie the formation of these long-term memories are dependent on protein synthesis in excitatory and SST-expressing neurons. A centrally important, parallel process to this involves the removal of the memory constraint quinone reductase 2 (QR2), which has been recently shown to enhance memory consolidation for novel experiences in the cortex and hippocampus, via redox modulation. However, it is unknown within which cell type in the cortex removal of QR2 occurs, nor how this affects neuronal function. Here, we use novel taste learning in the mouse anterior insular cortex (aIC) to show that similarly to mRNA translation, QR2 removal occurs in excitatory and SST-expressing neurons. Interestingly, both novel taste and QR2 inhibition reduce excitability specifically within SST, but not excitatory neurons. Furthermore, reducing QR2 expression in SST, but not in PV or excitatory neurons, is sufficient to enhance taste memory. Thus, QR2 mediated intrinsic property changes of SST interneurons in the aIC is a central removable factor to allow novel taste memory formation. This previously unknown involvement of QR2 and SST interneurons in resetting aIC activity hours following learning, describes a molecular mechanism to define cell circuits for novel information. Therefore, the QR2 pathway in SST interneurons provides a fresh new avenue by which to tackle age-related cognitive deficits, while shedding new light onto the functional machinations of long-term memory formation for novel information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transient Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation Causes Region- and Cell Type-Dependent Functional Deficits in the Mouse Hippocampus In Vitro</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurons are highly vulnerable to conditions of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) such as stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Recovery of cognitive and behavioral functions requires re-emergence of coordinated network activity, which, in turn, relies on the well-orchestrated interaction of pyramidal cells (PYRs) and interneurons. We therefore modelled HI in the mouse hippocampus, a particularly vulnerable region showing marked loss of PYR and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) after hypoxic-ischemic insults. Transient oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in <I>ex vivo</I> hippocampal slices led to a rapid loss of neuronal activity and spontaneous network oscillations (sharp wave-ripple complexes; SPW-Rs), and to the occurrence of a spreading depolarization. Following reperfusion, both SPW-R and neuronal spiking resumed, but FSI activity remained strongly reduced compared with PYR. Whole-cell recordings in CA1 PYR revealed, however, a similar reduction of both EPSCs and IPSCs, leaving inhibition-excitation (I/E) balance unaltered. At the network level, SPW-R incidence was strongly reduced and the remaining network events showed region-specific changes including reduced ripple energy in CA3 and increased ripple frequency in CA1. Together, our data show that transient hippocampal energy depletion results in severe functional alterations at the cellular and network level. While I/E balance is maintained, synaptic activity, interneuron spiking and coordinated network patterns remain reduced. Such alterations may be network-level correlates of cognitive and functional deficits after cerebral HI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Hedgehog Signaling Pathway is Expressed in the Adult Mouse Hypothalamus and Modulated by Fasting</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The hedgehog signaling pathway is best known for its role in developmental patterning of the neural tube and limb bud. More recently, hedgehog signaling has been recognized for its roles in growth of adult tissues and maintenance of progenitor cell niches. However, the role of hedgehog signaling in fully differentiated cells like neurons in the adult brain is less clear. In mammals, coordination of hedgehog pathway activity relies on primary cilia and patients with ciliopathies such as Bardet&ndash;Biedl and Alstro&#x0308;m syndrome exhibit clinical features clearly attributable to errant hedgehog such as polydactyly. However, these ciliopathies also present with features not clearly associated with hedgehog signaling such as hyperphagia-associated obesity. How hedgehog signaling may contribute to feeding behavior is complex and unclear, but cilia are critical for proper energy homeostasis. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the expression of core components of the hedgehog signaling pathway in the adult mouse hypothalamus with an emphasis on feeding centers. We show that hedgehog pathway genes continue to be expressed in differentiated neurons important for the regulation of feeding behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that pathway activity is regulated at the transcriptional level by fasting. These data suggest that hedgehog signaling is involved in the proper functioning of brain regions that regulate feeding behavior and that hedgehog pathway dysfunction may play a role in the obesity observed in certain ciliopathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prenatal Androgen Treatment Does Not Alter the Firing Activity of Hypothalamic Arcuate Kisspeptin Neurons in Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neuroendocrine control of reproduction is disrupted in many individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), who present with increased luteinizing hormone (LH), and presumably gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), release frequency, and high androgen levels. Prenatal androgenization (PNA) recapitulates these phenotypes in primates and rodents. Female offspring of mice injected with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on gestational days 16&ndash;18 exhibit disrupted estrous cyclicity, increased LH and testosterone, and increased GnRH neuron firing rate as adults. PNA also alters the developmental trajectory of GnRH neuron firing rates, markedly blunting the prepubertal peak in firing that occurs in three-week (3wk)-old controls. GnRH neurons do not express detectable androgen receptors and are thus probably not the direct target of DHT. Rather, PNA likely alters GnRH neuronal activity by modulating upstream neurons, such as hypothalamic arcuate neurons co-expressing kisspeptin, neurokinin B (gene Tac2), and dynorphin, also known as KNDy neurons. We hypothesized PNA treatment changes firing rates of KNDy neurons in a similar age-dependent manner as GnRH neurons. We conducted targeted extracellular recordings (0.5&ndash;2 h) of Tac2-identified KNDy neurons from control and PNA mice at 3wks of age and in adulthood. About half of neurons were quiescent (&lt;0.005 Hz). Long-term firing rates of active cells varied, suggestive of episodic activity, but were not different among groups. Short-term burst firing was also similar. We thus reject the hypothesis that PNA alters the firing rate of KNDy neurons. This does not preclude altered neurosecretory output of KNDy neurons, involvement of other neuronal populations, or <I>in vivo</I> networks as critical drivers of altered GnRH firing rates in PNA mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency-Dependent Synaptic Dynamics Differentially Tune CA1 and CA2 Pyramidal Neuron Responses to Cortical Input</a></h4>

              
                <p>Entorhinal cortex neurons make monosynaptic connections onto distal apical dendrites of CA1 and CA2 pyramidal neurons through the perforant path (PP) projection. Previous studies show that differences in dendritic properties and synaptic input density enable the PP inputs to produce a much stronger excitation of CA2 compared with CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here, using mice of both sexes, we report that the difference in PP efficacy varies substantially as a function of presynaptic firing rate. Although a single PP stimulus evokes a 5- to 6-fold greater EPSP in CA2 compared with CA1, a brief high-frequency train of PP stimuli evokes a strongly facilitating postsynaptic response in CA1, with relatively little change in CA2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that blockade of NMDARs significantly reduces strong temporal summation in CA1 but has little impact on that in CA2. As a result of the differences in the frequency- and NMDAR-dependent temporal summation, naturalistic patterns of presynaptic activity evoke CA1 and CA2 responses with distinct dynamics, differentially tuning CA1 and CA2 responses to bursts of presynaptic firing versus single presynaptic spikes, respectively.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent studies have demonstrated that abundant entorhinal cortical innervation and efficient dendritic propagation enable hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons to produce robust excitation evoked by single cortical stimuli, compared with CA1. Here we uncovered, unexpectedly, that the difference in efficacy of cortical excitation varies substantially as a function of presynaptic firing rate. A burst of stimuli evokes a strongly facilitating response in CA1, but not in CA2. As a result, the postsynaptic response of CA1 and CA2 to presynaptic naturalistic firing displays contrasting temporal dynamics, which depends on the activation of NMDARs. Thus, whereas CA2 responds to single stimuli, CA1 is selectively recruited by bursts of cortical input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ste20-like Kinase Is Critical for Inhibitory Synapse Maintenance and Its Deficiency Confers a Developmental Dendritopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The size and structure of the dendritic arbor play important roles in determining how synaptic inputs of neurons are converted to action potential output. The regulatory mechanisms governing the development of dendrites, however, are insufficiently understood. The evolutionary conserved Ste20/Hippo kinase pathway has been proposed to play an important role in regulating the formation and maintenance of dendritic architecture. A key element of this pathway, Ste20-like kinase (SLK), regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in non-neuronal cells and is strongly expressed throughout neuronal development. However, its function in neurons is unknown. We show that, during development of mouse cortical neurons, SLK has a surprisingly specific role for proper elaboration of higher, &ge; third-order dendrites both in male and in female mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLK is required to maintain excitation-inhibition balance. Specifically, SLK knockdown caused a selective loss of inhibitory synapses and functional inhibition after postnatal day 15, whereas excitatory neurotransmission was unaffected. Finally, we show that this mechanism may be relevant for human disease, as dysmorphic neurons within human cortical malformations revealed significant loss of SLK expression. Overall, the present data identify SLK as a key regulator of both dendritic complexity during development and inhibitory synapse maintenance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that dysmorphic neurons of human epileptogenic brain lesions have decreased levels of the Ste20-like kinase (SLK). Decreasing SLK expression in mouse neurons revealed that SLK has essential functions in forming the neuronal dendritic tree and in maintaining inhibitory connections with neighboring neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Climbing Fiber-Mediated Spillover Transmission to Interneurons Is Regulated by EAAT4</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurotransmitter spillover is a form of communication not readily predicted by anatomic structure. In the cerebellum, glutamate spillover from climbing fibers recruits molecular layer interneurons in the absence of conventional synaptic connections. Spillover-mediated signaling is typically limited by transporters that bind and reuptake glutamate. Here, we show that patterned expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) in Purkinje cells regulates glutamate spillover to molecular layer interneurons. Using male and female Aldolase C-Venus knock-in mice to visualize zebrin microzones, we find larger climbing fiber-evoked spillover EPSCs in regions with low levels of EAAT4 compared with regions with high EAAT4. This difference is not explained by presynaptic glutamate release properties or postsynaptic receptor density but rather by differences in the glutamate concentration reaching receptors on interneurons. Inhibiting glutamate transport normalizes the differences between microzones, suggesting that heterogeneity in EAAT4 expression is a primary determinant of differential spillover. These results show that neuronal glutamate transporters limit extrasynaptic transmission in a non&ndash;cell-autonomous manner and provide new insight into the functional specialization of cerebellar microzones.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) help maintain the fidelity and independence of point-to-point synaptic transmission. Whereas glial transporters are critical to maintain low ambient levels of extracellular glutamate to prevent excitotoxicity, neuronal transporters have more subtle roles in shaping excitatory synaptic transmission. Here we show that the patterned expression of neuronal EAAT4 in cerebellar microzones controls glutamate spillover from cerebellar climbing fibers to nearby interneurons. These results contribute to fundamental understanding of neuronal transporter functions and specialization of cerebellar microzones.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) Inactivation Increases Neuronal Network Activity by Enhancing Ca2+ Influx via L-Type Ca2+ Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by hamartomas in various organs, such as the brain, lungs, and kidneys. Epilepsy, along with autism and intellectual disability, is one of the neurologic impairments associated with TSC that has an intimate relationship with developmental outcomes and quality of life. Sustained activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) via <I>TSC1</I> or <I>TSC2</I> mutations is known to be involved in the onset of epilepsy in TSC. However, the mechanism by which mTOR causes seizures remains unknown. In this study, we showed that, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived <I>TSC2-</I>deficient (<I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) neurons exhibited elevated neuronal activity with highly synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Notably, <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons presented enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs), which contributed to the abnormal neurite extension and sustained activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity. Expression of Cav1.3, a subtype of LTCCs, was increased in <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons, but long-term rapamycin treatment suppressed this increase and reversed the altered neuronal activity and neurite extensions. Thus, we identified Cav1.3 LTCC as a critical downstream component of TSC-mTOR signaling that would trigger enhanced neuronal network activity of <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons. We suggest that LTCCs could be potential novel targets for the treatment of epilepsy in TSC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> There is a close relationship between elevated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity and epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, the underlying mechanism by which mTOR causes epilepsy remains unknown. In this study, using human <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons, we identified elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as a critical downstream component of TSC-mTOR signaling and a potential cause of both elevated neuronal activity and neurite extension in <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons. Our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized connection between sustained mTOR activation and elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in human TSC neurons, which could cause epilepsy in TSC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Postmitotic Prox1 Expression Controls the Final Specification of Cortical VIP Interneuron Subtypes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Throughout development, neuronal identity is controlled by key transcription factors that determine the unique properties of a cell. During embryogenesis, the transcription factor Prox1 regulates VIP-positive cortical interneuron migration, survival, and connectivity. Here, we explore the role of Prox1 as a regulator of genetic programs that guide the final specification of VIP interneuron subtypes in early postnatal life. Synaptic <I>in vitro</I> electrophysiology in male and female mice shows that postnatal Prox1 removal differentially affects the dynamics of excitatory inputs onto VIP bipolar and multipolar subtypes. RNA sequencing reveals that one of the downstream targets of Prox1 is the postsynaptic protein Elfn1, a constitutive regulator of presynaptic release probability. Further genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that removing Prox1 reduces Elfn1 function in VIP multipolar but not in bipolar cells. Finally, overexpression experiments and analysis of native <I>Elfn1</I> mRNA expression reveal that Elfn1 levels are differentially controlled at the post-transcriptional stage. Thus, in addition to activity-dependent processes that contribute to the developmental trajectory of VIP cells, genetic programs engaged by Prox1 control the final differentiation of multipolar and bipolar subtypes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The transcription factor Prox1 generates functional diversification of cortical VIP interneuron subtypes in early postnatal life, thus expanding the inhibitory repertoire of the cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Akt Regulates Sox10 Expression to Control Oligodendrocyte Differentiation via Phosphorylating FoxO1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sox10 is a well known factor to control oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, and its expression is regulated by Olig2. As an important protein kinase, Akt has been implicated in diseases with white matter abnormalities. To study whether and how Akt may regulate OL development, we generated OL lineage cell-specific <I>Akt1</I>/<I>Akt2</I>/<I>Akt3</I> triple conditional knock-out (<I>Akt</I> cTKO) mice. Both male and female mice were used. These mutants exhibit a complete loss of mature OLs and unchanged apoptotic cell death in the CNS. We show that the deletion of Akt three isoforms causes downregulation of Sox10 and decreased levels of phosphorylated FoxO1 in the brain. <I>In vitro</I> analysis reveals that the expression of FoxO1 with mutations on phosphorylation sites for Akt significantly represses the <I>Sox10</I> promoter activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of FoxO1 by Akt is important for Sox10 expression. We further demonstrate that mutant FoxO1 without Akt phosphorylation epitopes is enriched in the Sox10 promoter. Together, this study identifies a novel FoxO1 phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for Sox10 expression and OL differentiation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysfunction of Akt is associated with white matter diseases including the agenesis of the corpus callosum. However, it remains unknown whether Akt plays an important role in oligodendrocyte differentiation. To address this question, we generated oligodendrocyte lineage cell-specific <I>Akt1</I>/<I>Akt2</I>/<I>Akt3</I> triple-conditional knock-out mice. Akt mutants exhibit deficient white matter development, loss of mature oligodendrocytes, absence of myelination, and unchanged apoptotic cell death in the CNS. We demonstrate that deletion of Akt three isoforms leads to downregulation of Sox10, and that phosphorylation of FoxO1 by Akt is critical for Sox10 expression. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism to regulate Sox10 expression. This study may provide insights into molecular mechanisms for neurodevelopmental diseases caused by dysfunction of protein kinases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hypothalamic Glutamate/GABA Cotransmission Modulates Hippocampal Circuits and Supports Long-Term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Subcortical input engages in cortico-hippocampal information processing. Neurons of the hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) innervate the dentate gyrus (DG) by coreleasing two contrasting fast neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, and thereby support spatial navigation and contextual memory. However, the synaptic mechanisms by which SuM neurons regulate the DG activity and synaptic plasticity are not well understood. The DG comprises excitatory granule cells (GCs) as well as inhibitory interneurons (INs). Combining optogenetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that the SuM input differentially regulates the activities of different DG neurons in mice of either sex via distinct synaptic mechanisms. Although SuM activation results in synaptic excitation and inhibition in all postsynaptic cells, the ratio of these two components is variable and cell type-dependent. Specifically, dendrite-targeting INs receive predominantly synaptic excitation, whereas soma-targeting INs and GCs receive primarily synaptic inhibition. Although SuM excitation alone is insufficient to excite GCs, it enhances the GC spiking precision and reduces the latencies in response to excitatory drives. Furthermore, SuM excitation enhances the GC spiking in response to the cortical input, thereby promoting induction of long-term potentiation at cortical-GC synapses. Collectively, these findings provide physiological significance of the cotransmission of glutamate/GABA by SuM neurons in the DG network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cortical-hippocampal pathways transfer mnemonic information during memory acquisition and retrieval, whereas subcortical input engages in modulation of communication between the cortex and hippocampus. The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) neurons of the hypothalamus innervate the dentate gyrus (DG) by coreleasing glutamate and GABA onto granule cells (GCs) and interneurons and support memories. However, how the SuM input regulates the activity of various DG cell types and thereby contributes to synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. Combining optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrate that the SuM input differentially regulates DG cell dynamics and consequently enhances GC excitability as well as synaptic plasticity at cortical input-GC synapses. Our findings highlight a significant role of glutamate/GABA cotransmission in regulating the input-output dynamics of DG circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Cortical Area MT Is Required for Development of the Dorsal Stream and Associated Visuomotor Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The middle temporal (MT) area of the extrastriate visual cortex has long been studied in adulthood for its distinctive physiological properties and function as a part of the dorsal stream, yet interestingly it possesses a similar maturation profile as the primary visual cortex (V1). Here, we examined whether an early-life lesion in MT of marmoset monkeys (six female, two male) altered the dorsal stream development and the behavioral precision of reaching-to-grasp sequences. We observed permanent changes in the anatomy of cortices associated with both reaching (parietal and medial intraparietal areas) and grasping (anterior intraparietal area), as well as in reaching-and-grasping behaviors. In addition, we observed a significant impact on the anatomy of V1 and the direction sensitivity of V1 neurons in the lesion projection zone. These findings indicate that area MT is a crucial node in the development of primate vision, affecting both V1 and areas in the dorsal visual pathway known to mediate visually guided manual behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies have identified a role for the MT area of the visual cortex in perceiving motion, yet none have examined its central role in the development of the visual cortex and in the establishment of visuomotor behaviors. To address this, we used a unilateral MT lesion model in neonatal marmosets before examining the anatomic, physiological, and behavioral consequences. In adulthood, we observed perturbations in goal-orientated reach-and-grasp behavior, altered direction selectivity of V1 neurons, and changes in the cytoarchitecture throughout dorsal stream areas. This study highlights the importance of MT as a central node in visual system development and consequential visuomotor activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modality-Specific Modulation of Temperature Representations in the Spinal Cord after Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Different types of tissue injury, such as inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, cause modality-specific alternations on temperature perception. There are profound changes in peripheral sensory neurons after injury, but how patterned neuronal activities in the CNS encode injury-induced sensitization to temperature stimuli is largely unknown. Using <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging and mouse genetics, we show that formalin- and prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB>-induced inflammation dramatically increase spinal responses to heating and decrease responses to cooling in male and female mice. The reduction of cold response is largely eliminated on ablation of TRPV1-expressing primary sensory neurons, indicating a crossover inhibition of cold response from the hyperactive heat inputs in the spinal cord. Interestingly, chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin can rapidly increase spinal responses to cooling and suppress responses to heating. Together, our results suggest a push&ndash;pull mechanism in processing cold and heat inputs and reveal a synergic mechanism to shift thermosensation after injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this paper, we combine our novel <I>in vivo</I> spinal cord two-photon calcium imaging, mouse genetics, and persistent pain models to study how tissue injury alters the sensation of temperature. We discover modality-specific changes of spinal temperature responses in different models of injury. Chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin leads to cold hypersensitivity and heat hyposensitivity. By contrast, inflammation increases heat sensitivity and decreases cold sensitivity. This decrease in cold sensitivity results from the stronger crossover inhibition from the hyperactive heat inputs. Our work reveals the bidirectional change of thermosensitivity by injury and suggests that the crossover inhibitory circuit underlies the shifted thermosensation, providing a mechanism to the biased perception toward a unique thermal modality that was observed clinically in chronic pain patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Representation of the Subjective Value of Information</a></h4>

              
                <p>To improve future decisions, people should seek information based on the value of information (VOI), which depends on the current evidence and the reward structure of the upcoming decision. When additional evidence is supplied, people should update the VOI to adjust subsequent information seeking, but the neurocognitive mechanisms of this updating process remain unknown. We used a modified beads task to examine how the VOI is represented and updated in the human brain of both sexes. We theoretically derived, and empirically verified, a normative prediction that the VOI depends on decision evidence and is biased by reward asymmetry. Using fMRI, we found that the subjective VOI is represented in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Critically, this VOI representation was updated when additional evidence was supplied, showing that the DLPFC dynamically tracks the up-to-date VOI over time. These results provide new insights into how humans adaptively seek information in the service of decision-making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For adaptive decision-making, people should seek information based on what they currently know and the extent to which additional information could improve the decision outcome, formalized as the VOI. Doing so requires dynamic updating of VOI according to outcome values and newly arriving evidence. We formalize these principles using a normative model and show that information seeking in people adheres to them. Using fMRI, we show that the underlying subjective VOI is represented in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and, critically, that it is updated in real time according to newly arriving evidence. Our results reveal the computational and neural dynamics through which evidence and values are combined to inform constantly evolving information-seeking decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Implicit Neurofeedback Training of Feature-Based Attention Promotes Biased Sensory Processing during Integrative Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Complex perceptual decisions, in which information must be integrated across multiple sources of evidence, are ubiquitous but are not well understood. Such decisions rely on sensory processing of each individual source of evidence, and are therefore vulnerable to bias if sensory processing resources are disproportionately allocated among visual inputs. To investigate this, we developed an implicit neurofeedback protocol embedded within a complex decision-making task to bias sensory processing in favor of one source of evidence over another. Human participants of both sexes (<I>N</I> = 30) were asked to report the average motion direction across two fields of oriented moving bars. Bars of different orientations flickered at different frequencies, thus inducing steady-state visual evoked potentials. Unbeknownst to participants, neurofeedback was implemented to implicitly reward attention to a specific "trained" orientation (rather than any particular motion direction). As attentional selectivity for this orientation increased, the motion coherence of both fields of bars increased, making the task easier without altering the relative reliability of the two sources of evidence. Critically, these neurofeedback trials were alternated with "test" trials in which motion coherence was not contingent on attentional selectivity, allowing us to assess the training efficacy. The protocol successfully biased sensory processing, resulting in earlier and stronger encoding of the trained evidence source. In turn, this evidence was weighted more heavily in behavioral and neural representations of the integrated average, although the two sources of evidence were always matched in reliability. These results demonstrate how biases in sensory processing can impact integrative decision-making processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many everyday decisions require active integration of different sources of sensory information, such as deciding when it is safe to cross a road, yet little is known about how the brain prioritizes sensory sources in the service of adaptive behavior, or whether such decisions can be altered through learning. Here we addressed these questions using a novel behavioral protocol that provided observers with real-time feedback of their own brain activity patterns in which sensory processing was implicitly biased toward a subset of the available information. We show that, while such biases are a normal and adaptive mechanism for humans to process complex visual information, they can also contribute to suboptimal decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dorsal Root Ganglia Macrophages Maintain Osteoarthritis Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain is the major debilitating symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), which is difficult to treat. In OA patients joint tissue damage only poorly associates with pain, indicating other mechanisms contribute to OA pain. Immune cells regulate the sensory system, but little is known about the involvement of immune cells in OA pain. Here, we report that macrophages accumulate in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) distant from the site of injury in two rodent models of OA. DRG macrophages acquired an M1-like phenotype, and depletion of DRG macrophages resolved OA pain in male and female mice. Sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee joint shape DRG macrophages into an M1-like phenotype. Persisting OA pain, accumulation of DRG macrophages, and programming of DRG macrophages into an M1-like phenotype were independent of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 nociceptors. Inhibition of M1-like macrophages in the DRG by intrathecal injection of an IL4-IL10 fusion protein or M2-like macrophages resolved persistent OA pain. In conclusion, these findings reveal a crucial role for macrophages in maintaining OA pain independent of the joint damage and suggest a new direction to treat OA pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In OA patients pain poorly correlates with joint tissue changes indicating mechanisms other than only tissue damage that cause pain in OA. We identified that DRG containing the somata of sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee are infiltrated with macrophages that are shaped into an M1-like phenotype by sensory neurons. We show that these DRG macrophages actively maintain OA pain remotely and independent of joint damage. The phenotype of these macrophages is crucial for a pain-promoting role. Targeting the phenotype of DRG macrophages with either M2-like macrophages or a cytokine fusion protein that skews macrophages into an M2-like phenotype resolves OA pain. Our work reveals a mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of OA pain distant from the affected knee joint and suggests that dorsal root ganglia macrophages are a target to treat osteoarthritis chronic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">GluN3-Containing NMDA Receptors in the Rat Nucleus Accumbens Core Contribute to Incubation of Cocaine Craving</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cue-induced cocaine craving progressively intensifies (incubates) after withdrawal from cocaine self-administration in rats and humans. In rats, the expression of incubation ultimately depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs that accumulate in synapses onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc core. However, the delay in their accumulation (~1 month after drug self-administration ceases) suggests earlier waves of plasticity. This prompted us to conduct the first study of NMDAR transmission in NAc core during incubation, focusing on the GluN3 subunit, which confers atypical properties when incorporated into NMDARs, including insensitivity to Mg<sup>2+</sup> block and Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeability. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted in MSNs of adult male rats 1-68 d after discontinuing extended-access saline or cocaine self-administration. NMDAR transmission was enhanced after 5 d of cocaine withdrawal, and this persisted for at least 68 d of withdrawal. The earliest functional alterations were mediated through increased contributions of GluN2B-containing NMDARs, followed by increased contributions of GluN3-containing NMDARs. As predicted by GluN3-NMDAR incorporation, fewer MSN spines exhibited NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. GluN3A knockdown in NAc core was sufficient to prevent incubation of craving, consistent with biotinylation studies showing increased GluN3A surface expression, although array tomography studies suggested that adaptations involving GluN3B also occur. Collectively, our data show that a complex cascade of NMDAR and AMPAR plasticity occurs in NAc core, potentially through a homeostatic mechanism, leading to persistent increases in cocaine cue reactivity and relapse vulnerability. This is a remarkable example of experience-dependent glutamatergic plasticity evolving over a protracted window in the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> "Incubation of craving" is an animal model for the persistence of vulnerability to cue-induced relapse after prolonged drug abstinence. Incubation also occurs in human drug users. AMPAR plasticity in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the NAc core is critical for incubation of cocaine craving but occurs only after a delay. Here we found that AMPAR plasticity is preceded by NMDAR plasticity that is essential for incubation and involves GluN3, an atypical NMDAR subunit that markedly alters NMDAR transmission. Together with AMPAR plasticity, this represents profound remodeling of excitatory synaptic transmission onto MSNs. Given the importance of MSNs for translating motivation into action, this plasticity may explain, at least in part, the profound shifts in motivated behavior that characterize addiction.</p>

                Background: Multiple long-term care (LTC) reports have issued similar recommendations for improvement across Canadian LTC homes. Our primary objective was to identify the most common recommendations made over the past 10 years. Our secondary objective was to estimate the total cost of studying LTC issues repeatedly from 1998 to 2020. Methods: The qualitative and cost analyses were conducted in Canada from July to October 2020. Using a list of reports, inquiries and commissions from The Royal Society of Canada Working Group on Long-Term Care, we coded recurrent recommendations in LTC reports. We contacted the sponsoring organizations for a cost estimate, including direct and indirect costs. All costs were adjusted to 2020 Canadian dollar values. Results: Of the 80 Canadian LTC reports spanning the years of 1998 to 2020, 24 (30%) were based on a national level and 56 (70%) were focused on provinces or municipalities. Report length ranged from 4 to 1491 pages and the median number of contributors was 14 (interquartile range, IQR, 5–26) per report. The most common recommendation was to increase funding to LTC to improve staffing, direct care and capacity (67% of reports). A median of 8 (IQR 3.25–18) recommendations were made per report. The total cost for all 80 reports was estimated to be $23,626,442.78. Conclusions: Problems in Canadian LTC homes and their solutions have been known for decades. Despite this, governments and non-governmental agencies continue to produce more reports at a monetary and societal cost to Canadians.

Methods: A virtual classroom was developed in a three-dimensional space, and 10 university students were tested to understand color vision variations.  Results: Most participants noted that the virtual classroom was an excellent educational tool, which could help teachers understand the problems associated with [visual analog scale (VAS): mean ± standard deviation (SD), 9.55 ± 1.57] and obtain a better understanding of (VAS: mean ± SD, 9.04 ± 1.0) color vision variations.  Conclusions: Our results show that this approach enhanced the participants' understanding of color vision variations; thus, it may assist children who suffer from this variation. It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach for teachers.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter in nervous systems promoting sleep in both mammals and insects. In the Madeira cockroach sleep-wake cycles are controlled by a circadian clock network in the brain's optic lobes, centered in the accessory medulla (AME) with its innervating pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) expressing clock neurons at the anterior-ventral rim of the medulla. GABA is present in cell clusters that innervate different circuits of the cockroach's AME clock, without colocalizing in PDF clock neurons. Physiological, immunohistochemical, and behavioral assays provided evidence for a role of GABA in light entrainment, possibly via the distal tract that connects the AME's glomeruli to the medulla. Furthermore, GABA was implemented in clock outputs to multiple effector systems in optic lobe and midbrain. Here, GABAergic brain circuits were analyzed further, focusing on the circadian system in search for sleep/wake controlling brain circuits. Consistently, GABA-immunoreactive neurons of the cockroach brain were also stained with an antiserum against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. We found strong overlap of the distribution of GABA-immunoreactive networks with PDF clock networks in optic lobes and midbrain. Neurons in five of the six soma groups that innervate the clock exhibited GABA immunoreactivity. As predicted, the intensity of GABA immunoreactivity in the distal tract showed daily fluctuations with maximum staining intensity in the middle of the day and weakest staining at the end of the day. Quantification via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, likewise, hinted higher GABA levels in the optic lobe during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day and lower levels during its activity phase at dusk. Our data further support the hypothesis that light- and PDF-dependently the circadian clock network of the cockroach controls GABA levels and thereby promotes sleep during the day.</p>

                <p>by Yuval R. Zelnik, Yair Mau, Moshe Shachak, Ehud Meron</p>

Humans play major roles in shaping and transforming the ecology of Earth. Unlike natural drivers of ecosystem change, which are erratic and unpredictable, human intervention in ecosystems generally involves planning and management, but often results in detrimental outcomes. Using model studies and aerial-image analysis, we argue that the design of a successful human intervention form calls for the identification of the self-organization modes that drive ecosystem change, and for studying their dynamics. We demonstrate this approach with two examples: grazing management in drought-prone ecosystems, and rehabilitation of degraded vegetation by water harvesting. We show that grazing can increase the resilience to droughts, rather than imposing an additional stress, if managed in a spatially non-uniform manner, and that fragmental restoration along contour bunds is more resilient than the common practice of continuous restoration in vegetation stripes. We conclude by discussing the need for additional studies of self-organization modes and their dynamics.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon form of stroke affecting mostly young individuals. Although genetic factors are thought to play a role in this cerebrovascular condition, its genetic etiology is not well understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic variants influencing susceptibility to CVT. A 2-stage genome-wide study was undertaken in 882 Europeans diagnosed with CVT and 1,205 ethnicity-matched control subjects divided into discovery and independent replication datasets.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall case–control cohort, we identified highly significant associations with 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 9q34.2 region. The strongest association was with rs8176645 (combined <i>p</i> = 9.15 × 10<sup>−24</sup>; odds ratio [OR] = 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.76–2.31). The discovery set findings were validated across an independent European cohort. Genetic risk score for this 9q34.2 region increases CVT risk by a pooled estimate OR = 2.65 (95% CI = 2.21–3.20, <i>p</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). SNPs within this region were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with coding regions of the <i>ABO</i> gene. The <i>ABO</i> blood group was determined using allele combination of SNPs rs8176746 and rs8176645. Blood groups A, B, or AB, were at 2.85 times (95% CI = 2.32–3.52, <i>p</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) increased risk of CVT compared with individuals with blood group O.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We present the first chromosomal region to robustly associate with a genetic susceptibility to CVT. This region more than doubles the likelihood of CVT, a risk greater than any previously identified thrombophilia genetic risk marker. That the identified variant is in strong LD with the coding region of the <i>ABO</i> gene with differences in blood group prevalence provides important new insights into the pathophysiology of CVT.

Rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 were subjected to strenuous exercise and treated with distilled water only; while Groups 2, 3 and 4 were subjected to strenuous exercise and treated with 100 mg/kg body weight, 200 mg/kg body weight and 300 mg/kg body weight of red-fleshed pitaya extract, respectively. Strenuous exercises in rats was performed by intense swimming of 20 min/day, 3 days a week for 3 weeks. HSP70 expression and cortisol were measured with Enzyme-Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Results: There was a significant reduction of HSP70 (p=0.000) and cortisol expression (p=0.000) between the groups. Also, there was a significant difference in the average decreasing of HSP70 expression between group 4 and either groups 1 or 2 (p=0.000). However, a significant difference between groups 4 and 3 was not observed (p=0.813). Lastly, a significant difference was found in the average decrease of cortisol expression between groups 4 and 1 (p=0.000), 2 (p=0.000), and 3 (p=0.000) respectively. Conclusion: Red-fleshed pitaya is potential to be utilized as antioxidant to decrease the HSP70 and cortisol expression.

     alt="Sub-second transient activated patterns to sad expressions in major depressive disorders discovered via hidden Markov model"/>
<p>We explored the comprehensive processing framework of negative emotional stimuli in patients with major depressive disorders. With a well-established hidden Markov model, the whole processing was segmented into three dynamic states via brain functions, and temporal–spatial dynamic dysfunction was found during different task stages in depression.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathological mechanisms of major depressive disorders (MDDs) is associated with the overexpression of negative emotions, and the fast transient-activated patterns underlying overrepresentation in depression still remain to be revealed to date. We hypothesized that the aberrant spatiotemporal attributes of the process of sad expressions are related to the neuropathology of MDD and help to detect the depression severity. We enrolled a total of 96 subjects including 47 patients with MDD and 49 healthy controls (HCs), and recorded their magnetoencephalography data under a sad expression recognition task. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to separate the whole neural activity into several brain states, then to characterize the dynamics. To find the disrupted temporal–spatial characteristics, power estimations and fractional occupancy (FO) of each state were estimated and contrasted between MDDs and HCs. Three states were found over the period of emotional stimuli processing procedure. The early visual stage (0–270 ms) was mainly manifested by state 1, and the emotional information processing stage (270–600 ms) was manifested by state 2, while the state 3 remained a steady proportion across the whole period. MDDs activated statistically more in limbic system during state 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.0045) and less in frontoparietal control network during state 3 (<i>p =</i> 5.38 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) relative to HCs. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were significantly correlated with the predicted disorder severity using FO values (<i>p</i> = 0.0062, <i>r</i> = 0.3933). Relative to HCs, MDDs perceived the sad contents quickly and spent more time overexpressing the negative emotions. These phenomena indicated MDD patients might easily indulge in negative emotion and neglect other things. Furthermore, temporal descriptors built by HMM could be potential biomarkers for identifying the severity of depression disorders.</p>

                Background: Drug resistance and multi drugs tuberculosis (DR/MDR-TB) are associated with patients' low adherence to undergoing complex treatment. Driven by the increasing use and penetration of a smartphone and the End of TB Strategy that seeks for digital health solution, Center for Tropical Medicine Universitas Gadjah Mada has developed TOMO, an Android-based app for improving medication adherence in MDR-TB. Objective: This paper aims to present the sequential steps to develop the app, its general architecture, and its functionalities. Methods: It is a design thinking process involving two MDR-TB referral centers, district health offices, primary health centers, and MDR-TB patients in Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We adopted the Principles for Digital Development to develop and design the app. MDR-TB treatment guideline from the Indonesian Ministry of Health was used to develop functionalities of the app for improving adherence.    Results: TOMO app could be used by patients, primary health centers, clinical teams, and case managers. The app prototype features include adverse event records and reports, medication-taking reminders, and communication between the patient and the TB-MDR case manager. We have successfully tested the functionalities based on four use cases: patients with high adherence, patients with low adherence, patients with adverse events, and patients following treatment in the primary health center without any visit to the MDR-TB center.        Conclusion: TOMO app has contributed to the limited body of literature on improving TB-MDR adherence with digital health intervention, especially using a health app. The app has been tested using four scenarios. We will follow up with usability testing before implementing the app in a real setting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study protocol for the SeMaCo study: A longitudinal regional cohort study to assess COVID-19 seroprevalence in blood donors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Serologic studies are crucial for clarifying the regional dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic as well as the success of a vaccination campaign against COVID-19. We describe a cohort study investigating the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Magdeburg (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany). Protocol and study design: The SeMaCo study (Serologische Untersuchungen bei Blutspendern des Großraums Magdeburg auf Antikörper gegen SARS-CoV-2) is a longitudinal, regional cohort study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in blood donors from Magdeburg (Capital of Saxony-Anhalt) and surrounding areas. We consider blood donors as a surrogate for the healthy, working-age population of Saxony-Anhalt. The study primarily aims to measure the prevalence and kinetics of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in first time and repeat blood donors over a period of 21 months. The study explores four survey periods of three to four months each (January–April 21, July–October 21, February–April 22, July–October 22). At each visit, we will assess the attitude towards vaccination, the antibody response following vaccination, as well as undesired vaccination effects. Furthermore, we will collect data on occupational activities, housing conditions and the frequency of family and other social contacts. Discussion: The SeMaCo study extends the spectrum of seroepidemiological investigations in Germany. A longitudinal observation with repeated testing and serial interviews can provide a more accurate view on the dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence and spread than repeated cross-sectional studies. Based on interim results from similar studies, we expect a seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies below 5% in the first survey period. SeMaCo will influence policy decisions and preventative measures.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of four months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type (WT) control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.</p>
