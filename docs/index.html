<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Michael T Kelliher, Harriet AJ Saunders, Jill Wildonger</p><div><p>Neurons are exquisitely polarized cells whose structure and function relies on microtubules. Microtubules in signal-receiving dendrites and signal-sending axons differ in their organization and microtubule-associated proteins. These differences, coupled with microtubule post-translational modifications, combine to locally regulate intracellular transport, morphology, and function. Recent discoveries provide new insight into the regulation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in neurons, the relationship between microtubule acetylation and mechanosensation, and the spatial patterning of microtubules that regulates motor activity and cargo delivery in axons and dendrites. Together, these new studies bring us closer to understanding how microtubule function is locally tuned to match the specialized tasks associated with signal reception and transmission.</p></div>

for EEG signals. And calculating their average clustering, average degree, and
average shortest path length. We manage to characterize two different data sets
from each other. Each data set consisted of focal and non-focal activity, from
where epileptic regions could be identified. This method yields good results
for identifying sets of data from epileptic zones. Suggesting our approach
could be used to aid physicians with diagnosing epilepsy from EEG data.

<p>by Daniel Toker, Friedrich T. Sommer</p>

An outstanding problem in neuroscience is to understand how information is integrated across the many modules of the brain. While classic information-theoretic measures have transformed our understanding of feedforward information processing in the brain’s sensory periphery, comparable measures for information flow in the massively recurrent networks of the rest of the brain have been lacking. To address this, recent work in information theory has produced a sound measure of network-wide “integrated information”, which can be estimated from time-series data. But, a computational hurdle has stymied attempts to measure large-scale information integration in real brains. Specifically, the measurement of integrated information involves a combinatorial search for the informational “weakest link” of a network, a process whose computation time explodes super-exponentially with network size. Here, we show that spectral clustering, applied on the correlation matrix of time-series data, provides an approximate but robust solution to the search for the the informational weakest link of large networks. This reduces the computation time for integrated information in large systems from longer than the lifespan of the universe to just minutes. We evaluate this solution in brain-like systems of coupled oscillators as well as in high-density electrocortigraphy data from two macaque monkeys, and show that the informational “weakest link” of the monkey cortex splits posterior sensory areas from anterior association areas. Finally, we use our solution to provide evidence in support of the long-standing hypothesis that information integration is maximized by networks with a high global efficiency, and that modular network structures promote the segregation of information.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qkXV8ndLl4k" width="1" />

<p>by Simon N. Weber, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Grid cells have attracted broad attention because of their highly symmetric hexagonal firing patterns. Recently, research has shifted its focus from the global symmetry of grid cell activity to local distortions both in space and time, such as drifts in orientation, local defects of the hexagonal symmetry, and the decay and reappearance of grid patterns after changes in lighting condition. Here, we introduce a method that allows to visualize and quantify such local distortions, by assigning both a local grid score and a local orientation to each individual spike of a neuronal recording. The score is inspired by a standard measure from crystallography, which has been introduced to quantify local order in crystals. By averaging over spikes recorded within arbitrary regions or time periods, we can quantify local variations in symmetry and orientation of firing patterns in both space and time.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQ_b-Q4hyrA" width="1" />

<p>by Lior Tiroshi, Joshua A. Goldberg</p>

The theory of phase oscillators is an essential tool for understanding population dynamics of pacemaking neurons. GABAergic pacemakers in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a main basal ganglia (BG) output nucleus, receive inputs from the direct and indirect pathways at distal and proximal regions of their dendritic arbors, respectively. We combine theory, optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiological experiments in acute brain slices to ask how dendritic properties impact the propensity of the various inputs, arriving at different locations along the dendrite, to recruit or entrain SNr pacemakers. By combining cable theory with sinusoidally-modulated optogenetic activation of either proximal somatodendritic regions or the entire somatodendritic arbor of SNr neurons, we construct an analytical model that accurately fits the empirically measured somatic current response to inputs arising from illuminating the soma and various portions of the dendritic field. We show that the extent of the dendritic tree that is illuminated generates measurable and systematic differences in the pacemaker’s phase response curve (PRC), causing a shift in its peak. Finally, we show that the divergent PRCs correctly predict differences in two major features of the collective dynamics of SNr neurons: the fidelity of population responses to sudden step-like changes in inputs; and the phase latency at which SNr neurons are entrained by rhythmic stimulation, which can occur in the BG under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Our novel method generates measurable and physiologically meaningful spatial effects, and provides the first empirical demonstration of how the collective responses of SNr pacemakers are determined by the transmission properties of their dendrites. SNr dendrites may serve to delay distal striatal inputs so that they impinge on the spike initiation zone simultaneously with pallidal and subthalamic inputs in order to guarantee a fair competition between the influence of the monosynaptic direct- and polysynaptic indirect pathways.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CqH4TZGZ4Nc" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>In recent years, evidence has accumulated that non-Mendelian transgenerational inheritance of qualities acquired through experience is possible. In particular, it has been shown that raising rodents in a so-called enriched environment (EE) can not only modify the animals’ behavior and increase their susceptibility to activity-dependent neuronal network changes, but also influences both behavior and neuronal plasticity of the non-enriched offspring. Here, we tested whether such a transgenerational transmission can also be observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) using ocular dominance (OD) plasticity after monocular deprivation (MD) as a paradigm. Whereas OD plasticity after 7 d of MD is absent in standard-cage (SC) raised mice beyond postnatal day (P)110, it is present lifelong in EE-raised mice. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging to visualize cortical activity, we confirm these previous observations and additionally show that OD plasticity is not only preserved in adult EE mice but also in their adult non-enriched offspring: mice born to enriched parents, but raised in SCs at least until P110 displayed similar OD shifts toward the open eye after 7 d of MD as age-matched EE-raised animals. Furthermore, testing the offspring of EE-female versus EE-males with SC-mating partners revealed that only pups of EE-females, but not of EE-males, preserved OD plasticity into adulthood, suggesting that the life experiences of the mother have a greater impact on the continued V1 plasticity of the offspring. The OD plasticity of the non-enriched pups of EE-mothers was, however, mechanistically different from that of non-enriched pups of EE-parents or EE mice.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40231">Real-time experimental control using network-based parallel processing</a></h4>

Modern neuroscience research often requires the coordination of multiple processes such as stimulus generation, real-time experimental control, as well as behavioral and neural measurements. The technical demands required to simultaneously manage these processes with high temporal fidelity is a barrier that limits the number of labs performing such work. Here we present an open-source, network-based parallel processing framework that lowers this barrier. The Real-Time Experimental Control with Graphical User Interface (REC-GUI) framework offers multiple advantages: (<i>i</i>) a modular design that is agnostic to coding language(s) and operating system(s) to maximize experimental flexibility and minimize researcher effort, (<i>ii</i>) simple interfacing to connect multiple measurement and recording devices, (<i>iii</i>) high temporal fidelity by dividing task demands across CPUs, and (<i>iv</i>) real-time control using a fully customizable and intuitive GUI. We present applications for human, non-human primate, and rodent studies which collectively demonstrate that the REC-GUI framework facilitates technically demanding, behavior-contingent neuroscience research.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37527">Species-specific maturation profiles of human, chimpanzee and bonobo neural cells</a></h4>

Comparative analyses of neuronal phenotypes in closely related species can shed light on neuronal changes occurring during evolution. The study of post-mortem brains of nonhuman primates (NHPs) has been limited and often does not recapitulate important species-specific developmental hallmarks. We utilize induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to investigate the development of cortical pyramidal neurons following migration and maturation of cells grafted in the developing mouse cortex. Our results show differential migration patterns in human neural progenitor cells compared to those of chimpanzees and bonobos both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting heterochronic changes in human neurons. The strategy proposed here lays the groundwork for further comparative analyses between humans and NHPs and opens new avenues for understanding the differences in the neural underpinnings of cognition and neurological disease susceptibility between species.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In real-life situations, the appearance of a person’s face can vary substantially across different encounters, making face recognition a challenging task for the visual system. Recent fMRI decoding studies have suggested that face recognition is supported by identity representations located in regions of the occipitotemporal cortex. Here, we used EEG to elucidate the temporal emergence of these representations. Human participants viewed a set of highly variable face images of 4 highly familiar celebrities (2 males and 2 females), while performing an orthogonal task. Univariate analyses of event-related EEG responses revealed a pronounced differentiation between male and female faces, but not between identities of the same sex. Using multivariate representational similarity analysis, we observed a gradual emergence of face identity representations, with an increasing degree of invariance. Face identity information emerged rapidly, starting shortly after 100 ms from stimulus onset, but was modulated by sex differences and image similarities. From 400 ms after onset and predominantly in the right hemisphere, identity representations showed 2 invariance properties: 1) they equally discriminated identities of opposite sexes and of the same sex, and 2) they were tolerant to image-based variations. These invariant representations may be a crucial prerequisite for successful face recognition in everyday situations, where the appearance of a familiar person can vary drastically.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, and anhedonia, precede the onset of debilitating motor symptoms in Huntington’s disease (HD), and their development may give insight into early disease progression and treatment. However, the neuronal and circuit mechanisms of premanifest HD pathophysiology are not well-understood. Here, using a transgenic rat model expressing the full-length human mutant HD gene, we find early and profound deficits in reward motivation in the absence of gross motor abnormalities. These deficits are accompanied by significant and progressive dysfunction in corticostriatal processing and communication among brain areas critical for reward-driven behavior. Together, our results define early corticostriatal dysfunction as a possible pathogenic contributor to psychiatric disturbances and may help identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of HD.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/543165v1?rss=1">Endogenous oxytocin inhibits hypothalamic stress responsive neurons following acute hypernatremia</a></h4>

Significant prior evidence indicates that centrally acting oxytocin robustly modulates stress responsiveness and anxiety-like behavior, although the neural mechanisms behind these effects are not completely understood. A plausible neural basis for oxytocin mediated stress reduction is via inhibition of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) that regulate activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Previously, we have shown that following subcutaneous injection of 2.0 M NaCl, oxytocin (OT) synthesizing neurons are activated in the rat PVN, an oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) dependent inhibitory tone develops on a subset of parvocellular neurons, and stress-mediated increases in plasma corticosterone levels are blunted. Here, we utilized transgenic male CRH-reporter mice to selectively target PVN CRH neurons for whole-cell recordings. These experiments reveal that acute salt loading produces tonic inhibition of PVN CRH neurons through a mechanism that is largely independent of synaptic activity. Further studies reveal that CRH neurons within the PVN synthesize mRNA for Oxtr(s). Salt induced Oxtr-dependent inhibitory tone was eliminated in individual PVN CRH neurons filled with GDP-{beta}-S, and was also largely absent in PVN CRH neurons extracted form CRH-Oxtr KO mice. Additional electrophysiological studies suggest that reduced excitability of PVN CRH neurons in salt loaded animals is associated with increased activation of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Collectively, these data reveal a likely cellular mechanism by which endogenous oxytocin signaling reduces the excitability of PVN CRH neurons to curb stress responsiveness during times of high plasma osmolality.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/542712v1?rss=1">Greater BOLD signal during successful emotional stimulus reappraisal is associated with better dietary self-control</a></h4>

We combined established emotion regulation and dietary choice tasks with fMRI to investigate behavioral and neural associations in self-regulation across the two domains in human participants. We found that increased BOLD activity during the successful reappraisal of positive and negative emotional stimuli was associated with better dietary self control. This cross-task correlation was present in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex as well as the striatum. These results suggest that neural processes related to the reappraisal of emotional stimuli may also facilitate dietary self-control. However, within the dietary self-control task itself, we did not find that prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity significantly increased with self-control success during our food choice task, in contrast to previous reports. This prompted us to conduct exploratory analyses, which revealed that BOLD activity in PFC tracks the amount of taste and healthiness at stake on each self-control challenge trial regardless of the chosen outcome. This exploratory finding also replicated in an independent dataset. We discuss the implications of this evidence that individuals track the self-control stakes in light of theories about effortful self-regulation. In addition, we discuss features of this version of the food choice task that may have reduced the need to recruit PFC to achieve self-control. In summary, our findings indicate that the neural systems supporting emotion reappraisal can generalize to other behavioral contexts that require reevaluation to conform to the current goal.

We use the other's gaze direction to identify her/his object of interest and to shift our attention to the same object, i.e. to establish joint attention. However, gaze direction may not be sufficient to unambiguously identify the object of interest as the other's gaze may hit more than one object. In this case, the observer must use a priori information to disambiguate the object choice. Using fMRI, we suggest that the disambiguation is based on a 3-component network. A first component, the well-known gaze following patch in the posterior STS is activated by gaze following per se. BOLD activity here is determined exclusively by the usage of gaze direction and is independent of the need to disambiguate the relevant object. On the other hand, BOLD activity revealing a priori information for the disambiguation and starting early enough to this end is confined to a patch of cortex at the inferior frontal junction. Finally, BOLD activity reflecting the convergence of both, a priori information and gaze direction, needed to shift attention to a particular object location is confined to the posterior parietal cortex.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/540930v1?rss=1">Altered cortical development and psychiatric symptom risk in adolescents exposed to maternal stress in utero</a></h4>

Objective: Maternal exposure to stress during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for cognitive and behavioral sequelae in offspring. Animal research demonstrates exposure to stress during gestation has effects on brain structure. In humans, however, little is known about the enduring effects of in utero exposure to maternal stress on brain morphology. We examine whether maternal report of stressful events during pregnancy is associated with brain structure and behavior in adolescents. Method: We compare gray matter morphometry of typically-developing early adolescents (11-14 years of age, mean 12.7) based on presence/absence of maternal report of stressful event(s) during pregnancy: prenatal stress (PS; n=28), no prenatal stress (NS; n=55). The Drug Use Survey Index Revised (DUSI-R) assessed adolescent risk for problematic behaviors. Exclusionary criteria included pre-term birth, low birth weight, and maternal substance use during pregnancy. Groups were equivalent for demographic (age, sex, IQ, SES, race/ethnicity), and birth measures (weight, length). Results: Compared to NS peers, adolescents in the PS group exhibited increased gray matter volume in bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC): bilateral intraparietal sulcus, left superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule. Additionally, the PS group displayed greater risk for psychiatric symptoms and family system dysfunction, as assessed via DUSI-R subscales. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the enduring neurodevelopmental effects of exposure to maternal stress while in utero, suggesting the dynamic alterations in brain structure that occur during the adolescent critical period may unmask the latent effects of gestational stress on brain morphology and increase subsequent risk for psychiatric symptomatology.

Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity is often described as an adjustment of neuronal excitability to maintain stable spiking output. Here we report that intrinsic plasticity in the tectum of Xenopus tadpoles also supports temporal tuning, wherein neurons independently adjust spiking responses to fast and slow patterns of synaptic activation. Using the dynamic clamp technique, and five different types of visual, acoustic, and multisensory conditioning, we show that in tadpoles exposed to light flashes, tectal neurons became selective for fast synaptic inputs, while neurons exposed to looming and multisensory stimuli remained responsive to longer inputs. We also report a homeostatic co-tuning between synaptic and intrinsic temporal properties in tectal cells, as neurons that naturally received fast synaptic inputs tended to be most responsive to long-lasting synaptic conductances, and the other way around. These results expand our understanding of plasticity in the brain, and inform future work on the mechanisms of sensorimotor transformation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/540450v1?rss=1">Progranulin deficiency leads to reduced glucocerebrosidase activity</a></h4>

Mutation in the GRN gene, encoding the progranulin (PGRN) protein, shows a dose-dependent disease correlation, wherein haploinsufficiency results in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and complete loss results in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Although the exact function of PGRN is unknown, it has been increasingly implicated in lysosomal physiology. Here we report that PGRN interacts with the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and is essential for proper GBA activity. GBA activity is significantly reduced in tissue lysates from PGRN-deficient mice. This is further evidence that reduced lysosomal hydrolase activity may be a pathological mechanism in cases of GRN-related FTLD and NCL.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/539114v1?rss=1">Local Targeted Memory Reactivation in Human Sleep</a></h4>

Memory consolidation can be promoted via Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) that re-presents training cues or context during sleep. Whether TMR acts locally or globally on cortical sleep oscillations remains unknown. Here we exploit the unique functional neuroanatomy of olfaction with its ipsilateral stimulus processing to perform local TMR in one brain hemisphere. Participants learned associations between words and locations in left or right visual fields with contextual odor throughout. During post-learning naps, odors were presented to one nostril throughout NREM sleep. We found improved memory for specific words processed in the cued hemisphere (ipsilateral to stimulated nostril). Unilateral odor cues locally modulated slow wave activity (SWA) such that regional SWA increase in the cued hemisphere negatively correlated with select memories for cued words. Moreover, local TMR improved slow wave-spindle coupling specifically in the cued hemisphere. Thus, TMR in human sleep transcends global action by selectively promoting specific memories associated with local sleep oscillations.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/537977v1?rss=1">Dynamics of cortical degeneration over a decade in Huntington\'s Disease</a></h4>

The neurodegenerative process is typically slowly progressive and complex. While simple models of neurodegeneration suggest that brain changes progress at a near constant rate, previous research shows regional variation within the temporal progression of atrophy, indicating that over the course of neurodegeneration, different regions may undergo changing rates of atrophy. Characterization of long-term dynamic brain changes in neurodegeneration requires both extensive longitudinal MRI datasets and an advanced modeling framework. Until recently, both of these elements were not available. Here, we implement a novel dynamic systems approach to infer patterns of regional progression spatially and temporally in a unique longitudinal dataset with up to seven annual individual brain scans per participant from 49 Huntington's Disease (HD) gene-carriers. We map participant- and group-level trajectories of cortical atrophy in HD using a decade of data that encompasses motor symptom onset and, for the first time, show that neurodegenerative brain changes exhibit complex temporal dynamics of atrophy with substantial regional variation in progressive cortical atrophy. Some fronto-occipital cortical areas show an almost constant rate of atrophy, while medial-inferior temporal areas undergo only minor change. Interestingly, cortical sensory-motor areas were found to show a noticeable acceleration of atrophy following HD diagnosis. Furthermore, we establish links between individual atrophy and genetic markers of HD (CAG repeat length), as well as showing that cortical motor network changes predict subsequent decline in task-based motor performance, demonstrating face-validity of the model. Our findings highlight the complex pattern of dynamic cortical change occurring in HD that can help to resolve the biological underpinnings of HD progression.

Genome annotation is the process of identifying the location and function of a genome's encoded features. Improving the biological accuracy of annotation is a complex and iterative process requiring researchers to review and incorporate multiple sources of information such as transcriptome alignments, predictive models based on sequence profiles, and comparisons to features found in related organisms. Because rapidly decreasing costs are enabling an ever-growing number of scientists to incorporate sequencing as a routine laboratory technique, there is widespread demand for tools that can assist in the deliberative analytical review of genomic information. To this end, we present Apollo, an open source software package that enables researchers to efficiently inspect and refine the precise structure and role of genomic features in a graphical browser-based platform. Some of Apollo’s newer user interface features include support for real-time collaboration, allowing distributed users to simultaneously edit the same encoded features while also instantly seeing the updates made by other researchers on the same region in a manner similar to Google Docs. Its technical architecture enables Apollo to be integrated into multiple existing genomic analysis pipelines and heterogeneous laboratory workflow platforms. Finally, we consider the implications that Apollo and related applications may have on how the results of genome research are published and made accessible.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f6P1BeFwcgE" width="1" />

<p>by Amin Allahyar, Joske Ubels, Jeroen de Ridder</p>

Robustly predicting outcome for cancer patients from gene expression is an important challenge on the road to better personalized treatment. Network-based outcome predictors (NOPs), which considers the cellular wiring diagram in the classification, hold much promise to improve performance, stability and interpretability of identified marker genes. Problematically, reports on the efficacy of NOPs are conflicting and for instance suggest that utilizing random networks performs on par to networks that describe biologically relevant interactions. In this paper we turn the prediction problem around: instead of using a given biological network in the NOP, we aim to identify the network of genes that truly improves outcome prediction. To this end, we propose SyNet, a gene network constructed ab initio from synergistic gene pairs derived from survival-labelled gene expression data. To obtain SyNet, we evaluate synergy for all 69 million pairwise combinations of genes resulting in a network that is specific to the dataset and phenotype under study and can be used to in a NOP model. We evaluated SyNet and 11 other networks on a compendium dataset of &gt;4000 survival-labelled breast cancer samples. For this purpose, we used cross-study validation which more closely emulates real world application of these outcome predictors. We find that SyNet is the only network that truly improves performance, stability and interpretability in several existing NOPs. We show that SyNet overlaps significantly with existing gene networks, and can be confidently predicted (~85% AUC) from graph-topological descriptions of these networks, in particular the breast tissue-specific network. Due to its data-driven nature, SyNet is not biased to well-studied genes and thus facilitates post-hoc interpretation. We find that SyNet is highly enriched for known breast cancer genes and genes related to e.g. histological grade and tamoxifen resistance, suggestive of a role in determining breast cancer outcome.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e8NV-FivGl4" width="1" />

<p>Hearing depends on extracting frequency, intensity, and temporal properties from sound to generate an auditory map for acoustical signal processing. How physiology intersects with molecular specification to fine tune the developing properties of the auditory system that enable these aspects remains unclear. We made a novel conditional deletion model that eliminates the transcription factor NEUROD1 exclusively in the ear. These mice (both sexes) develop a truncated frequency range with no neuroanatomically recognizable mapping of spiral ganglion neurons onto distinct locations in the cochlea nor a cochleotopic map presenting topographically discrete projections to the cochlear nuclei. The disorganized primary cochleotopic map alters tuning properties of the inferior colliculus units, which display abnormal frequency, intensity, and temporal sound coding. At the behavioral level, animals show alterations in the acoustic startle response, consistent with altered neuroanatomical and physiological properties. We demonstrate that absence of the primary afferent topology during embryonic development leads to dysfunctional tonotopy of the auditory system. Such effects have never been investigated in other sensory systems because of the lack of comparable single gene mutation models.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> All sensory systems form a topographical map of neuronal projections from peripheral sensory organs to the brain. Neuronal projections in the auditory pathway are cochleotopically organized, providing a tonotopic map of sound frequencies. Primary sensory maps typically arise by molecular cues, requiring physiological refinements. Past work has demonstrated physiologic plasticity in many senses without ever molecularly undoing the specific mapping of an entire primary sensory projection. We genetically manipulated primary auditory neurons to generate a scrambled cochleotopic projection. Eliminating tonotopic representation to auditory nuclei demonstrates the inability of physiological processes to restore a tonotopic presentation of sound in the midbrain. Our data provide the first insights into the limits of physiology-mediated brainstem plasticity during the development of the auditory system.</p>

<p>We have identified a member of the growth arrest and DNA damage (Gadd45) protein family, Gadd45, which is known to be critically involved in DNA repair, as a key player in the regulation of immediate early gene (IEG) expression underlying the consolidation of associative fear memory in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Gadd45 temporally influences learning-induced IEG expression in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PLPFC) through its interaction with DNA double-strand break (DSB)-mediated changes in DNA methylation. Our findings suggest a two-hit model of experience-dependent IEG activity and learning that comprises (1) a first wave of IEG expression governed by DSBs and followed by a rapid increase in DNA methylation, and (2) a second wave of IEG expression associated with the recruitment of Gadd45 and active DNA demethylation at the same site, which is necessary for memory consolidation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the pattern of immediate early gene transcription in the brain relate to the storage and accession of information, and what controls these patterns? This paper explores how Gadd45, a gene that is known to be involved with DNA modification and repair, regulates the temporal coding of IEGs underlying associative learning and memory. We reveal that, during fear learning, Gadd45 serves to act as a coordinator of IEG expression and subsequent memory consolidation by directing temporally specific changes in active DNA demethylation at the promoter of plasticity-related IEGs.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/949?rss=1">The Immunosuppressant Macrolide Tacrolimus Activates Cold-Sensing TRPM8 Channels</a></h4>

<p>TRPM8 is a polymodal, nonselective cation channel activated by cold temperature and cooling agents that plays a critical role in the detection of environmental cold. We found that TRPM8 is a pharmacological target of tacrolimus (FK506), a macrolide immunosuppressant with several clinical uses, including the treatment of organ rejection following transplants, treatment of atopic dermatitis, and dry eye disease. Tacrolimus is an inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, an action shared with cyclosporine. Tacrolimus activates TRPM8 channels in different species, including humans, and sensitizes their response to cold temperature by inducing a leftward shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve. The effects of tacrolimus on purified TRPM8 in lipid bilayers demonstrates conclusively that it has a direct gating effect. Moreover, the lack of effect of cyclosporine rules out the canonical signaling pathway involving the phosphatase calcineurin. Menthol (TRPM8-Y745H)- and icilin (TRPM8-N799A)-insensitive mutants were also activated by tacrolimus, suggesting a different binding site. In cultured mouse DRG neurons, tacrolimus evokes an increase in intracellular calcium almost exclusively in cold-sensitive neurons, and these responses were drastically blunted in <i>Trpm8 KO</i> mice or after the application of TRPM8 antagonists. Cutaneous and corneal cold thermoreceptor endings are also activated by tacrolimus, and tacrolimus solutions trigger blinking and cold-evoked behaviors. Together, our results identify TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons as molecular targets of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus. The actions of tacrolimus on TRPM8 resemble those of menthol but likely involve interactions with other channel residues.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> TRPM8 is a polymodal TRP channel involved in cold temperature sensing, thermoregulation, and cold pain. TRPM8 is also involved in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease, and TRPM8 activation has antiallodynic and antipruritic effects, making it a prime therapeutic target in several cutaneous and neural diseases. We report the direct agonist effect of tacrolimus, a potent natural immunosuppressant with multiple clinical applications, on TRPM8 activity. This interaction represents a novel neuroimmune interface. The identification of a clinically approved drug with agonist activity on TRPM8 channels could be used experimentally to probe the function of TRPM8 in humans. Our findings may explain some of the sensory and anti-inflammatory effects described for this drug in the skin and the eye surface.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/1119?rss=1">Phase-Dependent Suppression of Beta Oscillations in Parkinson's Disease Patients</a></h4>

<p>Synchronized oscillations within and between brain areas facilitate normal processing, but are often amplified in disease. A prominent example is the abnormally sustained beta-frequency (~20 Hz) oscillations recorded from the cortex and subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's disease patients. Computational modeling suggests that the amplitude of such oscillations could be modulated by applying stimulation at a specific phase. Such a strategy would allow selective targeting of the oscillation, with relatively little effect on other activity parameters. Here, activity was recorded from 10 awake, parkinsonian patients (6 male, 4 female human subjects) undergoing functional neurosurgery. We demonstrate that stimulation arriving on a particular patient-specific phase of the beta oscillation over consecutive cycles could suppress the amplitude of this pathophysiological activity by up to 40%, while amplification effects were relatively weak. Suppressive effects were accompanied by a reduction in the rhythmic output of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons and synchronization with the mesial cortex. While stimulation could alter the spiking pattern of STN neurons, there was no net effect on firing rate, suggesting that reduced beta synchrony was a result of alterations to the relative timing of spiking activity, rather than an overall change in excitability. Together, these results identify a novel intrinsic property of cortico-basal ganglia synchrony that suggests the phase of ongoing neural oscillations could be a viable and effective control signal for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This work has potential implications for other brain diseases with exaggerated neuronal synchronization and for probing the function of rhythmic activity in the healthy brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In Parkinson's disease (PD), movement impairment is correlated with exaggerated beta frequency oscillations in the cerebral cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Using a novel method of stimulation in PD patients undergoing neurosurgery, we demonstrate that STN beta oscillations can be suppressed when consecutive electrical pulses arrive at a specific phase of the oscillation. This effect is likely because of interrupting the timing of neuronal activity rather than excitability, as stimulation altered the firing pattern of STN spiking without changing overall rate. These findings show the potential of oscillation phase as an input for "closed-loop" stimulation, which could provide a valuable neuromodulation strategy for the treatment of brain disorders and for elucidating the role of neuronal oscillations in the healthy brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/1109?rss=1">Postretrieval Relearning Strengthens Hippocampal Memories via Destabilization and Reconsolidation</a></h4>

<p>Memory reconsolidation is hypothesized to be a mechanism by which memories can be updated with new information. Such updating has previously been shown to weaken memory expression or change the nature of the memory. Here we demonstrate that retrieval-induced memory destabilization also allows that memory to be strengthened by additional learning. We show that for rodent contextual fear memories, this retrieval conditioning effect is observed only when conditioning occurs within a specific temporal window opened by retrieval. Moreover, it necessitates hippocampal protein degradation at the proteasome and engages hippocampal Zif268 protein expression, both of which are established mechanisms of memory destabilization-reconsolidation. We also demonstrate a conceptually analogous pattern of results in human visual paired-associate learning. Retrieval-relearning strengthens memory performance, again only when relearning occurs within the temporal window of memory reconsolidation. These findings link retrieval-mediated learning in humans to the reconsolidation literature, and have potential implications both for the understanding of endogenous memory gains and strategies to boost weakly learned memories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory reconsolidation allows existing memories to be updated with new information. Previous research has demonstrated that reconsolidation can be manipulated pharmacologically and behaviorally to impair problematic memories. In this article, we show that reconsolidation can also be exploited to strengthen memory. This is shown both in rats, in a fear memory setting, and in a human declarative memory setting. For both, the behavioral conditions necessary to observe the memory strengthening match those that are required to trigger memory reconsolidation. There are several behavioral approaches that have previously been shown convincingly to strengthen memory. The present demonstration that reconsolidation can underpin long-lasting memory improvements may both provide an underlying mechanism for such approaches and provide new strategies to boost memories.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/1100?rss=1">The Role of Meaning in Visual Memory: Face-Selective Brain Activity Predicts Memory for Ambiguous Face Stimuli</a></h4>

<p>How people process images is known to affect memory for those images, but these effects have typically been studied using explicit task instructions to vary encoding. Here, we investigate the effects of intrinsic variation in processing on subsequent memory, testing whether recognizing an ambiguous stimulus as meaningful (as a face vs as shape blobs) predicts subsequent visual memory even when matching the perceptual features and the encoding strategy between subsequently remembered and subsequently forgotten items. We show in adult humans of either sex that single trial EEG activity can predict whether participants will subsequently remember an ambiguous Mooney face image (e.g., an image that will sometimes be seen as a face and sometimes not be seen as a face). In addition, we show that a classifier trained only to discriminate between whether participants perceive a face versus non-face can generalize to predict whether an ambiguous image is subsequently remembered. Furthermore, when we examine the N170, an event-related potential index of face processing, we find that images that elicit larger N170s are more likely to be remembered than those that elicit smaller N170s, even when the exact same image elicited larger or smaller N170s across participants. Thus, images processed as meaningful, in this case as a face, during encoding are better remembered than identical images that are not processed as a face. This provides strong evidence that understanding the meaning of a stimulus during encoding plays a critical role in visual memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Is visual memory inherently visual or does meaning and other conceptual information necessarily play a role even in memory for detailed visual information? Here we show that it is easier to remember an image when it is processed in a meaningful way, as indexed by the amount of category-specific brain activity it elicits. In particular, we use single-trial EEG activity to predict whether an image will be subsequently remembered, and show that the main driver of this prediction ability is whether or not an image is seen as meaningful or non-meaningful. This shows that the extent to which an image is processed as meaningful can be used to predict subsequent memory even when controlling for perceptual factors and encoding strategies that typically differ across images.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/1088?rss=1">Stimulus Context and Reward Contingency Induce Behavioral Adaptation in a Rodent Tactile Detection Task</a></h4>

<p>Behavioral adaptation is a prerequisite for survival in a constantly changing sensory environment, but the underlying strategies and relevant variables driving adaptive behavior are not well understood. Many learning models and neural theories consider probabilistic computations as an efficient way to solve a variety of tasks, especially if uncertainty is involved. Although this suggests a possible role for probabilistic inference and expectation in adaptive behaviors, there is little if any evidence of this relationship experimentally. Here, we investigated adaptive behavior in the rat model by using a well controlled behavioral paradigm within a psychophysical framework to predict and quantify changes in performance of animals trained on a simple whisker-based detection task. The sensory environment of the task was changed by transforming the probabilistic distribution of whisker deflection amplitudes systematically while measuring the animal's detection performance and corresponding rate of accumulated reward. We show that the psychometric function deviates significantly and reversibly depending on the probabilistic distribution of stimuli. This change in performance relates to accumulating a constant reward count across trials, yet it is exempt from changes in reward volume. Our simple model of reward accumulation captures the observed change in psychometric sensitivity and predicts a strategy seeking to maintain reward expectation across trials in the face of the changing stimulus distribution. We conclude that rats are able maintain a constant payoff under changing sensory conditions by flexibly adjusting their behavioral strategy. Our findings suggest the existence of an internal probabilistic model that facilitates behavioral adaptation when sensory demands change.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The strategy animals use to deal with a complex and ever-changing world is a key to understanding natural behavior. This study provides evidence that rodent behavioral performance is highly flexible in the face of a changing stimulus distribution, consistent with a strategy to maintain a desired accumulation of reward.</p>

<p>Humans with alcohol use disorder typically abstain because of the negative consequences associated with excessive drinking, and exposure to contexts previously associated with alcohol use can trigger relapse. We used a rat model that captures a characteristic of this human condition: namely voluntary abstinence from alcohol use because of contingent punishment. There is substantial variability in the propensity to relapse following extended periods of abstinence, and this is a critical feature preventing the successful treatment of alcohol use disorder. Here we examined relapse following acute or prolonged abstinence. In male alcohol preferring P rats, we found an increased propensity to relapse in Context B, the punishment context after prolonged abstinence. Next, we found that neither alcohol intake history nor the motivational strength of alcohol predicted the propensity to relapse. We next examined the putative circuitry of context-induced relapse to alcohol seeking following prolonged abstinence using Fos as a marker of neuronal activation. The anterior insular cortex (AI) was the only brain region examined where Fos expression correlated with alcohol seeking behavior in Context B after prolonged abstinence. Finally, we used local infusion of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists (muscimol + baclofen) to show a causal role of the AI in context-induced relapse in Context B, the punishment context after prolonged abstinence. Our results show that there is substantial individual variability in the propensity to relapse in the punishment-associated context after prolonged abstinence, and this is mediated by activity in the AI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A key feature of alcohol use disorder is that sufferers show an enduring propensity to relapse throughout their lifetime. Relapse typically occurs despite the knowledge of adverse consequences including health complications or relationship breakdowns. Here we use a recently developed rodent model that recapitulates this behavior. After an extended period of abstinence, relapse propensity is markedly increased in the "adverse consequence" environment, akin to humans with alcohol use disorder relapsing in the face of adversity. From a circuitry perspective, we demonstrate a causal role of the anterior insular cortex in relapse to alcohol seeking after extended abstinence following punishment imposed voluntary cessation of alcohol use.</p>

<p>Attention is a critical component of visual perception; however, the mechanisms of attention at the granular level are poorly understood. One possible mechanism by which attention modulates neuronal activity is to control the efficacy of communication between connected neurons; however, it is unclear whether attention alters communication efficacy across a variety of neuronal circuits. In parallel, attentional modulation of neuronal firing rate is not uniform but depends upon the match between neuronal feature selectivity and the feature required for successful task completion. Here we tested whether modulation of communication efficacy is a viable mechanism of attention by assessing whether it is consistent across a variety of neuronal circuits and dependent upon the type of information conveyed in each circuit. We identified monosynaptically connected pairs of V1 neurons through cross-correlation of neuronal spike trains recorded in adult female macaque monkeys performing attention-demanding contrast-change detection tasks. Attention toward the stimulus in the receptive field of recorded neurons significantly facilitated the efficacy of communication among connected pairs of V1 neurons. The amount of attentional enhancement depended upon neuronal physiology, with larger facilitation for circuits conveying information about task-relevant features. Furthermore, presynaptic activity was more determinant of attentional enhancement of communication efficacy than postsynaptic activity, and feedforward local circuits often displayed the largest facilitation with attention. Together, these findings highlight attentional modulation of communication efficacy as a generalized mechanism of attention and demonstrate that attentional modulation at the granular level depends on the relevance of feature-specific information conveyed by neuronal circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How we pay attention to objects and locations in the visual environment has a profound impact on visual perception. Individual neurons in the visual cortex are similarly regulated by shifts in visual attention; however, the rules that govern whether and how attention alters neuronal activity are not known. In this study, we explored whether attention regulates communication between connected pairs of neurons in the primary visual cortex. We observed robust attentional facilitation of communication among these circuits. Furthermore, the extent to which the circuits were facilitated by attention depended on whether the information they conveyed was relevant for the particular attention task.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/1058?rss=1">Inhibition of Nigrostriatal Dopamine Release by Striatal GABAA and GABAB Receptors</a></h4>

<p>Nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) is critical to action selection and learning. Axonal DA release is locally influenced by striatal neurotransmitters. Striatal neurons are principally GABAergic projection neurons and interneurons, and a small minority of other neurons are cholinergic interneurons (ChIs). ChIs strongly gate striatal DA release via nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) identified on DA axons. Striatal GABA is thought to modulate DA, but GABA receptors have not been documented conclusively on DA axons. However, ChIs express GABA receptors and are therefore candidates for potential mediators of GABA regulation of DA. We addressed whether striatal GABA and its receptors can modulate DA release directly, independently from ChI regulation, by detecting DA in striatal slices from male mice using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in the absence of nAChR activation. DA release evoked by single electrical pulses in the presence of the nAChR antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine was reduced by GABA or agonists of GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, with effects prevented by selective GABA receptor antagonists. GABA agonists slightly modified the frequency sensitivity of DA release during short stimulus trains. GABA agonists also suppressed DA release evoked by optogenetic stimulation of DA axons. Furthermore, antagonists of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors together, or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors alone, significantly enhanced DA release evoked by either optogenetic or electrical stimuli. These results indicate that striatal GABA can inhibit DA release through GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and that these actions are not mediated by cholinergic circuits. Furthermore, these data reveal that there is a tonic inhibition of DA release by striatal GABA operating through predominantly GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The principal inhibitory transmitter in the mammalian striatum, GABA, is thought to modulate striatal dopamine (DA) release, but definitive evidence for GABA receptors on DA axons is lacking. Striatal cholinergic interneurons regulate DA release via axonal nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and also express GABA receptors, but they have not been eliminated as potentially critical mediators of DA regulation by GABA. Here, we found that GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors inhibit DA release without requiring cholinergic interneurons. Furthermore, ambient levels of GABA inhibited DA release predominantly through GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. These findings provide further support for direct inhibition of DA release by GABA receptors and reveal that striatal GABA operates a tonic inhibition on DA output that could critically influence striatal output.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/1044?rss=1">A Brainstem Neural Substrate for Stopping Locomotion</a></h4>

<p>Locomotion occurs sporadically and needs to be started, maintained, and stopped. The neural substrate underlying the activation of locomotion is partly known, but little is known about mechanisms involved in termination of locomotion. Recently, reticulospinal neurons (stop cells) were found to play a crucial role in stopping locomotion in the lamprey: their activation halts ongoing locomotion and their inactivation slows down the termination process. Intracellular recordings of these cells revealed a distinct activity pattern, with a burst of action potentials at the beginning of a locomotor bout and one at the end (termination burst). The termination burst was shown to be time linked to the end of locomotion, but the mechanisms by which it is triggered have remained unknown. We studied this in larval sea lampreys (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>; the sex of the animals was not taken into account). We found that the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which is known to initiate and control locomotion, stops ongoing locomotion by providing synaptic inputs that trigger the termination burst in stop cells. When locomotion is elicited by MLR stimulation, a second MLR stimulation stops the locomotor bout if it is of lower intensity than the initial stimulation. This occurs for MLR-induced, sensory-evoked, and spontaneous locomotion. Furthermore, we show that glutamatergic and, most likely, monosynaptic projections from the MLR activate stop cells during locomotion. Therefore, activation of the MLR not only initiates locomotion, but can also control the end of a locomotor bout. These results provide new insights onto the neural mechanisms responsible for stopping locomotion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is a brainstem region well known to initiate and control locomotion. Since its discovery in cats in the 1960s, the MLR has been identified in all vertebrate species tested from lampreys to humans. We now demonstrate that stimulation of the MLR not only activates locomotion, but can also stop it. This is achieved through a descending glutamatergic signal, most likely monosynaptic, from the MLR to the reticular formation that activates reticulospinal stop cells. Together, our findings have uncovered a neural mechanism for stopping locomotion and bring new insights into the function of the MLR.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/6/1030?rss=1">A Corticotropin Releasing Factor Network in the Extended Amygdala for Anxiety</a></h4>

<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is important for fear responses to discrete cues. Recent findings indicate that the CeA also contributes to states of sustained apprehension that characterize anxiety, although little is known about the neural circuitry involved. The stress neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is anxiogenic and is produced by subpopulations of neurons in the lateral CeA and the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBST). Here we investigated the function of these CRF neurons in stress-induced anxiety using chemogenetics in male rats that express Cre recombinase from a <i>Crh</i> promoter. Anxiety-like behavior was mediated by CRF projections from the CeA to the dlBST and depended on activation of CRF1 receptors and CRF neurons within the dlBST. Our findings identify a CRF<sup>CeA</sup>-&gt;CRF<sup>dlBST</sup> circuit for generating anxiety-like behavior and provide mechanistic support for recent human and primate data suggesting that the CeA and BST act together to generate states of anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anxiety is a negative emotional state critical to survival, but persistent, exaggerated apprehension causes substantial morbidity. Identifying brain regions and neurotransmitter systems that drive anxiety can help in developing effective treatment. Much evidence in rodents indicates that neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) generate anxiety-like behaviors, but more recent findings also implicate neurons of the CeA. The neuronal subpopulations and circuitry that generate anxiety are currently subjects of intense investigation. Here we show that CeA neurons that release the stress neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) drive anxiety-like behaviors in rats via a pathway to dorsal BST that activates local BST CRF neurons. Thus, our findings identify a CeA-&gt;BST CRF neuropeptide circuit that generates anxiety-like behavior.</p>

<p>The common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) is a small New World primate species that has been recently targeted as a potentially powerful preclinical model of human prefrontal cortex dysfunction. Although the structural boundaries of frontal cortex were described in marmosets at the start of the 20th century (Brodmann, 1909) and refined more recently (Paxinos et al., 2012), the broad functional boundaries of marmoset frontal cortex have yet to be established. In this study, we sought to functionally derive boundaries of the marmoset lateral frontal cortex (LFC) using ultra-high field (9.4 T) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We collected RS-fMRI data in seven (four females, three males) lightly anesthetized marmosets and used a data-driven hierarchical clustering approach to derive subdivisions of the LFC based on intrinsic functional connectivity. We then conducted seed-based analyses to assess the functional connectivity between these clusters and the rest of the brain. The results demonstrated seven distinct functional clusters within the LFC. The functional connectivity patterns of these clusters with the rest of the brain were also found to be distinct and organized along a rostrocaudal gradient, consonant with those found in humans and macaques. Overall, these results support the view that marmosets are a promising preclinical modeling species for studying LFC dysfunction related to neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative human brain diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The common marmoset is a New World primate that has garnered recent attention as a powerful complement to canonical Old World primate (e.g., macaques) and rodent models (e.g., rats, mice) for preclinical modeling of the human brain in healthy and diseased states. A critical step in the development of marmosets for such models is to characterize functional network topologies of frontal cortex in healthy, normally functioning marmosets, that is, how these circuitries are functionally divided and how those topologies compare to human circuitry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate functional boundaries of the lateral frontal cortex and the corresponding network topologies in marmoset monkeys.</p>

<p>The habenulo-interpeduncular system (HIPS) is now recognized as a critical circuit modulating aversion, reward, and social behavior. There is evidence that dysfunction of this circuit leads to psychiatric disorders. Because psychiatric diseases may originate in developmental abnormalities, it is crucial to investigate the developmental mechanisms controlling the formation of the HIPS. Thus far, this issue has been the focus of limited studies. Here, we explored the developmental processes underlying the formation of the medial habenula (MHb) and its unique output, the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), in mice independently of their gender. We report that the <i>Otx2</i> homeobox gene is essential for the proper development of both structures. We show that MHb and IPN neurons require <i>Otx2</i> at different developmental stages and, in both cases, <i>Otx2</i> deletion leads to disruption of HIPS subcircuits. Finally, we show that Otx2<sup>+</sup> neurons tend to be preferentially interconnected. This study reveals that synaptically connected components of the HIPS, despite radically different developmental strategies, share high sensitivity to <i>Otx2</i> expression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain reward circuits are highly complex and still poorly understood. In particular, it is important to understand how these circuits form as many psychiatric diseases may arise from their abnormal development. This work shows that <i>Otx2</i>, a critical evolutionary conserved gene implicated in brain development and a predisposing factor for psychiatric diseases, is required for the formation of the habenulo-interpeduncular system (HIPS), an important component of the reward circuit. Otx2 deletion affects multiple processes such as proliferation and migration of HIPS neurons. Furthermore, neurons expressing <i>Otx2</i> are preferentially interconnected. Therefore, <i>Otx2</i> expression may represent a code that specifies the connectivity of functional subunits of the HIPS. Importantly, the <i>Otx2</i> conditional knock-out animals used in this study might represent a new genetic model of psychiatric diseases.</p>

<p>In a recent publication (Tzvetanov (2018), bioRxiv 465807), I made an
extensive analysis with computational modelling and psychophysics of the simple
experimental design of Dr. D.Tadin (Tadin, Lappin, Gilroy and Blake (2003),
Nature, 424:312-315) about motion perception changes in humans due to size and
contrast of the stimulus. This publication sparked from strong claims made in
Schallmo et al. (2018) (eLife, 7:e30334) about two important points: (1)
"divisive normalization", not inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms, creates the
observed psychophysical results and (2) drug-enhanced inhibition showed
perceptual outcomes that hint to "weaker suppression" (i.e. inhibition) not
stronger "suppression". Schallmo &amp; Murray (2018, bioRxiv, 495291) presented
concerns about my extensive publication, specifically about the parts where I
directly analysed some of their methods, results and claims. Here, I show that
their concerns do not provide clear answers to my specific points and further
do not mention other major critiques of data interpretation and modelling of
this experimental design. Therefore, I maintain all my claims that were
elaborated in details in my first publication (Tzvetanov, 2018, bioRxiv
465807): the specific ones that analyse the results of their and other studies,
but also the more broad modelling that is applicable to any study using the
simple experimental design of Dr. D.Tadin.

<p>The aim of a number of psychophysics tasks is to uncover how mammals make
decisions in a world that is in flux. Here we examine the characteristics of
ideal and near--ideal observers in a task of this type. We ask when and how
performance depends on task parameters and design, and, in turn, what observer
performance tells us about their decision-making process. In the dynamic clicks
task subjects hear two streams (left and right) of Poisson clicks with
different rates. Subjects are rewarded when they correctly identify the side
with the higher rate, as this side switches unpredictably. We show that a
reduced set of task parameters defines regions in parameter space in which
optimal, but not near-optimal observers, maintain constant response accuracy.
We also show that for a range of task parameters an approximate normative model
must be finely tuned to reach near-optimal performance, illustrating a
potential way to distinguish between normative models and their approximations.
In addition, we show that using the negative log-likelihood and the 0/1-loss
functions to fit these types of models is not equivalent: the 0/1-loss leads to
a bias in parameter recovery that increases with sensory noise. These findings
suggest ways to tease apart models that are hard to distinguish when tuned
exactly, and point to general pitfalls in experimental design, model fitting,
and interpretation of the resulting data.

<p>The design and analysis of spiking neural network algorithms will be
accelerated by the advent of new theoretical approaches. In an attempt at such
approach, we provide a principled derivation of a spiking algorithm for
unsupervised learning, starting from the nonnegative similarity matching cost
function. The resulting network consists of integrate-and-fire units and
exhibits local learning rules, making it biologically plausible and also
suitable for neuromorphic hardware. We show in simulations that the algorithm
can perform sparse feature extraction and manifold learning, two tasks which
can be formulated as nonnegative similarity matching problems.

<p>fMRI is a unique non-invasive approach for understanding the functional
organization of the human brain, and task-based fMRI promotes identification of
functionally relevant brain regions associated with a given task. Here, we use
fMRI (using the Poffenberger Paradigm) data collected in mono- and dizygotic
twin pairs to propose a novel approach for assessing similarity in functional
networks. In particular, we compared network similarity between pairs of twins
in task-relevant and task-orthogonal networks. The proposed method measures the
similarity between functional networks using a geodesic distance between graph
Laplacians. With method we show that networks are more similar in monozygotic
twins compared to dizygotic twins. Furthermore, the similarity in monozygotic
twins is higher for task-relevant, than task-orthogonal networks.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43558">Rapid task-dependent tuning of the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

Adapting neural representation to rapidly changing behavioural demands is a key challenge for the nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the output of the primary olfactory area of the mouse, the olfactory bulb, is already a target of dynamic and reproducible modulation. The modulation depends on the stimulus tuning of a given neuron, making olfactory responses more discriminable through selective amplification in a demand-specific way.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43128">Structure of a bacterial ATP synthase</a></h4>

ATP synthases produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate with energy from a transmembrane proton motive force. Bacterial ATP synthases have been studied extensively because they are the simplest form of the enzyme and because of the relative ease of genetic manipulation of these complexes. We expressed the <i>Bacillus</i> PS3 ATP synthase in <i>Eschericia coli</i>, purified it, and imaged it by cryo-EM, allowing us to build atomic models of the complex in three rotational states. The position of subunit <i>e</i> shows how it is able to inhibit ATP hydrolysis while allowing ATP synthesis. The architecture of the membrane region shows how the simple bacterial ATP synthase is able to perform the same core functions as the equivalent, but more complicated, mitochondrial complex. The structures reveal the path of transmembrane proton translocation and provide a model for understanding decades of biochemical analysis interrogating the roles of specific residues in the enzyme.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42591">A systematically-revised ribosome profiling method for bacteria reveals pauses at single-codon resolution</a></h4>

In eukaryotes, ribosome profiling provides insight into the mechanism of protein synthesis at the codon level. In bacteria, however, the method has been more problematic and no consensus has emerged for how to best prepare profiling samples. Here, we identify the sources of these problems and describe new solutions for arresting translation and harvesting cells in order to overcome them. These improvements remove confounding artifacts and improve the resolution to allow analyses of ribosome behavior at the codon level. With a clearer view of the translational landscape in vivo, we observe that filtering cultures leads to translational pauses at serine and glycine codons through the reduction of tRNA aminoacylation levels. This observation illustrates how bacterial ribosome profiling studies can yield insight into the mechanism of protein synthesis at the codon level and how these mechanisms are regulated in response to changes in the physiology of the cell.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37321">Humans strategically shift decision bias by flexibly adjusting sensory evidence accumulation</a></h4>

Decision bias is traditionally conceptualized as an internal reference against which sensory evidence is compared. Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation toward a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants’ decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation toward target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2—6 Hz (theta) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8—12 Hz (alpha) power in posterior cortex. Alpha suppression in turn was linked to the output activity in visual cortex, as expressed through 59—100 Hz (gamma) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation toward the decision bound that maximizes reward.

The meaning and assumptions about what can be revealed through neuroscience color our understanding and questions about the brain. Today, neuroscientists are stepping into the traditional territory of philosophers and humanists, asking questions—and often revealing insights–into the nature of reason, free will, identity, and, ultimately, the mind. As an illustration of the broad impact of neuroscience, in a world with a rapidly growing aging population, families wonder whether technology can restore an identity robbed by Alzheimer’s or enhance cognition and memory against the erosion that typically accompanies aging.

In this issue of Neuron, Neuner et al. (2019) report the generation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transgenic mouse models on a panel of 28 background strains, showing marked background-dependent phenotypic variability. These findings imply that analogous variation in human AD phenotypes may be due, at least in part, to subtle effects of genetic background.

We have previously described hypomorphic reelin (Reln) mutant mice, RelnCTRdel, in which the morphology of the dentate gyrus is distinct from that seen in reeler mice. In the RelnCTRdel mutant the infrapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus fails to extend, while the suprapyramidal blade forms with a relatively compact granule neuron layer. The distribution of Cajal-Retzius cells in the dentate gyrus was aberrant; Cajal-Retzius neurons were increased in the suprapyramidal blade, but were greatly reduced along the subpial surface of the prospective infrapyramidal blade. We also observed multiple abnormalities of the fimbriodentate junction. Firstly, progenitor cells were distributed abnormally; the neurogenic cluster at the fimbriodentate junction was absent, lacking the normal accumulation of Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitors. However, the number of dividing cells in the dentate gyrus was not generally decreased. Secondly, a defect of secondary glial scaffold formation, limited to the infrapyramidal blade, was observed. The densely radiating glial fibers characteristic of the normal fimbriodentate junction were absent in mutants. These fibers might be required for migration of progenitors, which may account for the failure of neurogenic cluster formation. These findings suggest the importance of the secondary scaffold and neurogenic cluster of the fimbriodentate junction in morphogenesis of the mammalian dentate gyrus. Our study provides direct genetic evidence showing that normal RELN function is required for Cajal-Retzius cell positioning in the dentate gyrus, and for formation of the fimbriodentate junction to promote infrapyramidal blade extension.

Physical activity (PA) has preventive and possibly restorative effects in aging-related cognitive decline, which relate to intrinsic functional interactions (functional connectivity, FC) in large-scale brain networks. Preventive and ameliorative effects of PA on cognitive decline have also been documented in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the neural substrates that mediate the association between PA and cognitive performance under such neurological conditions remain unknown. Here we set out to examine if the association between PA and cognitive performance in PD is mediated by FC in large-scale sensorimotor and association brain networks. Data from 51 PD patients were analyzed. Connectome-level analysis based on a whole-brain parcellation showed that self-reported levels of PA were associated with increased FC between, but not within the default mode (DMN) and salience networks (SAL) (p &lt; .05, false discovery rate corrected). Additionally, multiple parallel mediation analysis further demonstrated that FC between left lateral parietal nodes in the DMN and rostral prefrontal nodes in the SAL mediated the association between PA and executive function performance. These findings are in line with previous studies linking FC in large-scale association networks with the effects of PA on cognition in healthy aging. Our results extend these previous results by demonstrating that the association between PA and cognitive performance in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD is mediated by integrative functional interactions in large-scale association networks.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/542928v1?rss=1">Developmental time course of SNAP-25 isoform regulation of hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning</a></h4>

SNAP-25 is essential in activity-dependent vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release in the nervous system. During development and adulthood, SNAP-25 appears to have differential influences on long- and short-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The involvement of SNAP-25 in this process may be altered by two different splice variants expressed in adolescences versus adulthood in hippocampal neurons. This study suggests that the adolescent isoform, SNAP-25a can contribute to developmental regulation of the expression of LTD and LTP. In mice deficient in SNAP-25b, the adult isoform, Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses showed slower release kinetics, reduced initial release probabilities, decreased LTP and enhanced LTD at 1 month. By 4 months of age, when mice have fully developed in the absence of SNAP-25b, the gene targeted mice appear to have compensated for the lack of the adult SNAP-25b isoform. Moreover, hippocampal-dependent training reversed reductions in LTP, but not LTD, seen at 1 month. In 4 month old adult mice, training prevented the compensatory reversal of LTD that had been observed prior to training. These findings support the hypothesis that immature SNAP-25a plays a strong role in the expression of plasticity at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in adolescent mice, but compensatory mechanisms that reverse alterations in synaptic plasticity once mice reach adulthood.

Affective disorders such as major depression are common but serious illnesses characterized by altered processing of emotional information. Although the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms increase dramatically over the course of childhood and adolescence, much of our understanding of their neurobiological bases comes from work characterizing adult's responses to static emotional information. As a consequence, relationships between depressive brain phenotypes and naturalistic emotional processing, as well as the manner in which these associations emerge over the lifespan, remain poorly understood. Here, we apply static and dynamic inter-subject correlation analyses to examine how brain function is associated with clinical and non- clinical depressive symptom severity in 112 children and adolescents (7-21 years old) who viewed an emotionally evocative clip from the film Despicable Me during functional MRI. Our results reveal that adolescents with greater depressive symptom severity exhibit atypical fMRI responses during movie viewing, and that this effect is stronger during less emotional moments of the movie. Furthermore, adolescents with more similar item-level depression symptom profiles showed more similar brain responses during movie viewing. In contrast, children's depressive symptom severity and profiles were unrelated to their brain response typicality or similarity. Together, these results indicate a developmental change in the relationships between brain function and depressive symptoms from childhood through adolescence. Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms may shape how the brain responds to complex emotional information in a dynamic manner sensitive to both developmental stage and affective context.

The dynamics of neuronal firing during natural vision are poorly understood. Surprisingly, mean firing rates of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of freely behaving rodents are similar during prolonged periods of light and darkness, but it is unknown whether this reflects a slow adaptation to changes in natural visual input, or insensitivity to rapid changes in visual drive. Here we use chronic electrophysiology in freely behaving rats of either sex to follow individual V1 neurons across many dark-light (D-L) and light-dark (L-D) transitions. We show that, even on rapid timescales (1s to 10 min), neuronal activity was only weakly modulated by transitions that coincided with the expected 12h/12h light-dark cycle. In contrast, a larger subset of V1 neurons consistently responded to unexpected L-D and D-L transitions, and disruption of the regular L-D cycle with 60 hours of complete darkness induced a robust increase in V1 firing upon re-introduction of visual input. Thus, V1 neurons fire at similar rates in the presence or absence of natural stimuli, and significant changes in activity arise only transiently in response to unexpected changes in the visual environment. Further, although mean rates were similar in L and D, pairwise correlations were significantly stronger during natural vision, suggesting that information about natural scenes in V1 is more readily extractable from correlations than from individual firing rates. Together, our findings show that V1 firing rates are rapidly and actively stabilized during expected changes in visual input, and are remarkably stable at both short and long timescales.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/542498v1?rss=1">Network-specific synchronization of electrical slow-wave oscillations regulates sleep in Drosophila</a></h4>

Slow-wave rhythms characteristic of deep sleep oscillate in the delta band (0.5-4 Hz) and can be found across various brain regions in vertebrates. Across systems it is however unclear how oscillations arise and whether they are the causal functional unit steering behavior. Here, for the first time in any invertebrate, we discover sleep-relevant delta oscillations in Drosophila. We find that slow-wave oscillations in the sleep-regulating R2 network increase with sleep need. Optical multi-unit voltage recordings reveal that single R2 neurons get synchronized by sensory and circadian input pathways. We show that this synchronization depends on NMDA receptor (NMDARs) coincidence detector function and on an interplay of cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs setting a resonance frequency. Genetically targeting the coincidence detector function of NMDARs in R2, and thus the uncovered mechanism underlying synchronization, abolished network-specific slow-wave oscillations. It also disrupted sleep and facilitated light-induced wakening, directly establishing a causal role for slow-wave oscillations in regulating sleep and sensory gating. We therefore propose that the synchronization-based increase in oscillatory power likely represents an evolutionarily conserved, potentially optimal, strategy for constructing sleep-regulating sensory gates.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/542464v1?rss=1">ATAT1-enriched vesicles promote microtubule acetylation via axonal transport</a></h4>

Microtubules are polymerized dimers of - and {beta}-tubulin that underlie a broad range of cellular activities. Acetylation of -tubulin by the acetyl-transferase ATAT1 modulates microtubule dynamics and functions in neurons. However, it remains unclear how and why this enzyme acetylates microtubules over long distances in axons. Here, we show that loss of ATAT1 impairs axonal transport in neurons and cell free motility assays confirm a requirement of tubulin acetylation for proper bidirectional vesicular transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that the main cellular pool of ATAT1 is transported at the cytosolic side of neuronal vesicles that are moving along axons. Altogether, our data suggest that axonal transport of ATAT1-enriched vesicles is the predominant driver of -tubulin acetylation in axons.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/542456v1?rss=1">Firing rate distributions in spiking networks with heterogeneous connectivity</a></h4>

Meanfield theory for networks of spiking neurons based on the so-called diffusion approximation has been used to calculate certain measures of neuronal activity which can be compared with experimental data. This includes the distribution of firing rates across the network. However, the theory in its current form applies only to networks in which there is relatively little heterogeneity in the number of incoming and outgoing connections per neuron. Here we extend this theory to include networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Furthermore, the theory takes into account correlations in the in-degree and out-degree of neurons, which would arise e.g. in the case of networks with hub-like neurons. Finally, we show that networks with broad and postively correlated degrees can generate a large-amplitude sustained response to transient stimuli which does not occur in more homogeneous networks.

The canonical computational model for the cognitive process underlying two-alternative forced-choice decision making is the so-called drift-diffusion model (DDM). In this model, a decision variable keeps track of the integrated difference in sensory evidence for two competing alternatives. Here I extend the notion of a drift-diffusion process to multiple alternatives. The competition between n alternatives takes place in a linear subspace of n-1 dimensions; that is, there are n-1 decision variables, which are coupled through correlated noise sources. I derive the multiple-alternative DDM starting from a system of coupled, linear firing rate equations. If the original neuronal system is nonlinear, one can once again derive a model describing a lower dimensional diffusion process. The dynamics of the nonlinear DDM can be recast as the motion of a particle on a potential, the general form of which is given analytically for an arbitrary number of alternatives.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/542340v1?rss=1">Protein appetite drives neural activity in the ventral tegmental area</a></h4>

Amino acids are essential for almost all biological processes and many cannot be synthesized de novo. Thus, it is crucial that all animals, including humans, acquire an adequate amount of protein in their diet. Here, we show that rats maintained on a protein-restricted diet develop a strong preference for protein, relative to carbohydrate. In addition, this preference was associated with increased neural activation in ventral tegmental area while rats were consuming protein. These changes were relatively persistent as when protein levels were restored by switching back to regular chow, behavioral preference and elevated neural activity to protein did not completely disappear. This study provides the first indication that activity in mesolimbic circuitry is involved in generating an appetite for protein in times of need.

Mathematical reasoning is central to everyday life. Lesion data and functional MRI studies suggest that even simple arithmetic involves the coordination of multiple spatially diverse brain regions, but to date, math processing has not been well characterized using direct brain recordings, especially outside of the parietal cortex. To address this, we utilized an unparalleled data set of 310 subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of arithmetic reasoning. Our data support the importance of regions previously implicated in numerosity such as the superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus. However, we also identify contributions to arithmetic processing from regions such as the entorhinal cortex and temporal pole. Using the excellent bihemispheric coverage afforded by our data set and the precise temporal resolution of intracranial recordings, we characterize in detail the spatial and temporal characteristics of an arithmetic processing network, quantifying subtle hemispheric differences for selected regions. We also examine how activity in these regions predicts arithmetic ability and look for gender differences in the pattern of network activation. Our findings further define the complex network of regions involved in human arithmetical reasoning.

<p>by Robert Marsland III, Wenping Cui, Joshua Goldford, Alvaro Sanchez, Kirill Korolev, Pankaj Mehta</p>

A fundamental goal of microbial ecology is to understand what determines the diversity, stability, and structure of microbial ecosystems. The microbial context poses special conceptual challenges because of the strong mutual influences between the microbes and their chemical environment through the consumption and production of metabolites. By analyzing a generalized consumer resource model that explicitly includes cross-feeding, stochastic colonization, and thermodynamics, we show that complex microbial communities generically exhibit a transition as a function of available energy fluxes from a “resource-limited” regime where community structure and stability is shaped by energetic and metabolic considerations to a diverse regime where the dominant force shaping microbial communities is the overlap between species’ consumption preferences. These two regimes have distinct species abundance patterns, different functional profiles, and respond differently to environmental perturbations. Our model reproduces large-scale ecological patterns observed across multiple experimental settings such as nestedness and differential beta diversity patterns along energy gradients. We discuss the experimental implications of our results and possible connections with disorder-induced phase transitions in statistical physics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6rGQ4SobGjM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with high risk of ischemic heart disease, but whether this is also the case for ischemic stroke is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that high remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>102,964 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with information on remnant cholesterol at baseline in 2003‐15 were included in a prospective observational association study. Individuals were followed for up to 14 years, during which time 2,488 were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results were independently confirmed in 9,548 individuals enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991‐94; 983 ischemic strokes developed during up to 26 years of follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stepwise higher remnant cholesterol concentrations were associated with stepwise higher ischemic stroke risk in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with multivariable adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.99(95%confidence interval: 1.49‐2.67) for individuals with remnant cholesterol concentrations ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL), compared to individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL). Results were similar in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke at age 80 in the Copenhagen General Population Study ranged from 7.3% for individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL) to 11.5% for individuals with remnant cholesterol ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Individuals with high remnant cholesterol concentrations had higher risk of ischemic stroke. These results indicate that randomized clinical trials with remnant cholesterol lowering in individuals with high concentrations, with the aim of preventing ischemic strokes, are needed.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &gt; 700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from <i>MR Base</i> and <i>LD‐hub</i>. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We have shown via linkage disequilibrium score regression that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we have developed a public resource (<a href="https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://lng‐nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny</a>) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated LDL cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.</p>

Abstract<p>Large-scale slow oscillations allow the integration of neuronal activity across brain regions during sensory or cognitive processing. However, evidence that this form of coding also holds for pathological networks, such as for distributed networks in epileptic disorders, does not yet exist. Here, we show in a mouse model of unilateral hippocampal epilepsy that epileptic fast ripples generated in the neocortex distant from the primary focus occur during transient trains of interictal epileptic discharges. During these epileptic paroxysms, local phase-locking of neuronal firing and a phase-amplitude coupling of the epileptic discharges over a slow oscillation at 3-5 Hz are detected. Furthermore, the build-up of the slow oscillation begins in the bi-hippocampal network that includes the focus, which synchronizes and drives the activity across the large-scale epileptic network into the frontal cortex. This study provides the first functional description of the emergence of neocortical fast ripples in hippocampal epilepsy and shows that cross-frequency coupling might be a fundamental mechanism underlying the spreading of epileptic activity.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Focal epilepsies are no longer considered as diseases of a single brain region, but as a network disease. However, the mechanisms leading to the emergence of pathological activity outside of the seizure-onset zone remain unknown. In this work, we show in a mouse-model of temporal lobe epilepsy that large-scale slow oscillations of 3-5 Hz synchronize distant brain regions and constrain the expression of epileptic transient events in neocortical areas. This study establishes the first evidence that cross-frequency coupling promotes the expression of pathological activity across an epileptic network, revealing that similar mechanisms operate to convey physiological and pathological activity across brain areas.</p>

Abstract<p>The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) are areas affected early and severely in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and this is associated with deficits in episodic memory. Amyloid beta (Aβ), the main protein found in amyloid plaques, can affect neuronal physiology and excitability, and several AD mouse models with memory impairments display aberrant network activity, including hyperexcitability and seizures. In this study, we investigated single cell physiology in EC and network activity in EC and dentate gyrus in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging in acute slices. In slices from transgenic animals up to 4 months of age, the majority of the principal neurons in layer II of EC, fan cells and stellate cells, expressed intracellular Aβ. Whereas the electrophysiological properties of fan cells were unaltered, stellate cells were more excitable in transgenic than in control rats. Stimulation in the dentate gyrus resulted in comparable patterns in both groups at 3 and 9 months, but at 12 months, the elicited responses in the transgenic group showed a significant preference for the enclosed blade, without any change in overall excitability. Only transient changes in the local network activity were seen in the medial entorhinal cortex. Although the observed changes in the McGill rat model are subtle, they are specific, pointing to a differential and selective involvement of specific parts of the hippocampal circuitry in Aβ pathology.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The hippocampal region, essential for episodic memory, is affected in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we use the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model to study the effects of Aβ pathology on networks and single cells in the hippocampal region. In young animals, we observed widespread intracellular Aβ accumulation, which later progressed to extracellular plaques. However, the in vitro physiology was largely unaltered, with only changes in single cell excitability of stellate cells in layer II of MEC and network activation patterns in dentate gyrus. Thus, these two components of the entorhinal-hippocampal network emerge as potentially more vulnerable in the context of Aβ pathology.</p>

Abstract
<p>The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BL) is thought to support numerous emotional behaviors through specific microcircuits. These are often thought to be comprised of feedforward networks of principal cells (PNs) and interneurons. Neither well-understood nor often considered are recurrent and feedback connections, which likely engender oscillatory dynamics within BL. Indeed, oscillations in the gamma frequency range (40 – 100 Hz) are known to occur in the BL, and yet their origin and effect on local circuits remains unknown. To address this, we constructed a biophysically and anatomically detailed model of the rat BL and its local field potential (LFP) based on the physiological and anatomical literature, along with <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> data we collected on the activities of neurons within the rat BL. Remarkably, the model produced intermittent gamma oscillations (~50 – 70 Hz) whose properties matched those recorded <i>in vivo</i>, including their entrainment of spiking. BL gamma-band oscillations were generated by the intrinsic circuitry, depending upon reciprocal interactions between PNs and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), while connections within these cell types affected the rhythm’s frequency. The model allowed us to conduct experimentally impossible tests to characterize the synaptic and spatial properties of gamma. The entrainment of individual neurons to gamma depended on the number of afferent connections they received, and gamma bursts were spatially restricted in the BL. Importantly, the gamma rhythm synchronized PNs and mediated competition between ensembles. Together, these results indicate that the recurrent connectivity of BL expands its computational and communication repertoire.</p>

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, is a ubiquitous mechanism that generates transcriptomic diversity. This process is particularly important for proper neuronal function; however, little is known about how RNA editing is dynamically regulated between the many functionally distinct neuronal populations of the brain.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior acetylcholinesterase PET imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([<sup>18</sup>F]FEOBV) PET.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (P=0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to non‐fallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (P=0.0012) and limbic archicortex (P=0.004) in freezers compared to non‐freezers. Whole brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal and mesiofrontal limbic regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FOG in PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25428?af=R">The Blood Pressure Paradox in Acute Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the association of post‐stroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0‐1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time&gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time&gt;3s/delay time&gt;6s).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 0.88, P=0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion and active blood pressure lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment.</p>

<p>A novel diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging protocol sensitive to contraction of individual skeletal motor units was developed. We applied this technique to the lower limb muscles of 4 patients with confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 6 healthy controls. A 3‐minute scan revealed florid fasciculation in ALS patients, involving both superficial and deep muscles, and at a frequency higher than in healthy controls. This novel imaging technique reveals hitherto unobtainable information on human motor unit structure and function, which may allow earlier diagnosis and recruitment to clinical trials.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01267">Rhythm Zone Theory: Speech Rhythms are Physical after all. (arXiv:1902.01267v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Speech rhythms have been dealt with in three main ways: from the
introspective analyses of rhythm as a correlate of syllable and foot timing in
linguistics and applied linguistics, through analyses of durations of segments
of utterances associated with consonantal and vocalic properties, syllables,
feet and words, to models of rhythms in speech production and perception as
physical oscillations. The present study avoids introspection and
human-filtered annotation methods and extends the signal processing paradigm of
amplitude envelope spectrum analysis by adding an additional analytic step of
edge detection, and postulating the co-existence of multiple speech rhythms in
rhythm zones marked by identifiable edges (Rhythm Zone Theory, RZT). An
exploratory investigation of the utility of RZT is conducted, suggesting that
native and non-native readings of the same text are distinct sub-genres of read
speech: a reading by a US native speaker and non-native readings by relatively
low-performing Cantonese adult learners of English. The study concludes by
noting that with the methods used, RZT can distinguish between the speech
rhythms of well-defined sub-genres of native speaker reading vs. non-native
learner reading, but needs further refinement in order to be applied to the
paradoxically more complex speech of low-performing language learners, whose
speech rhythms are co-determined by non-fluency and disfluency factors in
addition to well-known linguistic factors of grammar, vocabulary and discourse

<p>In this short communication I present a study on cortical thickness and
functional networks' coupling topology by cortical lobes. First, I demonstrated
modular organisation of these networks by the cortical surface frontal,
temporal, parietal and occipital divisions. Secondly, I mapped the coupling
topology of cortical thickness and functional networks for positive and
negative correlations. Finally, I showed that the coupled positive correlations
map onto within-lobe cortical interactions and negative onto between-lobes
interactions.

<p>Patients diagnosed with epilepsy experience cognitive dysfunction that may be
due to a transient cognitive/memory impairment (TCI/TMI) caused by spontaneous
epileptiform spikes. We asked in a cohort of 166 adult patients with medically
refractory focal epilepsy if spikes in specific neuroanatomical regions during
verbal episodic memory encoding would significantly decrease the probability of
recall. We found using a na\"ive Bayesian machine learning model that the
probability of correct word recall decreased significantly by 11.9% when spikes
occurred in left Brodmann area 21 (BA)21, (p&lt;0.001), 49.7% in left BA38
(p=0.01), and 32.2% in right BA38 (p&lt;0.001), and 21.4% in left BA36 (p&lt;0.01).
We also examined the influence of the seizure-onset zone and the language
dominant hemisphere on this effect. Our results demonstrate that spontaneous
epileptiform spikes produce a large effect TCI/TMI in brain regions known to be
important in semantic processing and episodic memory. Thus memory impairment in
patients with epilepsy may be attributable to cellular events associated with
abnormal inter-ictal electrical events.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00951">Spike statistics of stochastic homoclinic neuron models in the bistable region. (arXiv:1902.00951v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Neurons typically show two distinct dynamical regimes: Resting state,
corresponding to a stable fixpoint, are often observed for low average input.
Higher input commonly result in tonic spiking, which corresponds to a stable
limit cycle. Some neurons, however, show an additional intermediate, bistable
regime, with coexistence of resting-state fixpoint and limit-cycle spiking. In
this article, a bistable neuron with spike onset at a saddle-homoclinic orbit
bifurcation is investigated. In the bistable region, noise can switch between
rest and spiking, and thus increase the variability of the spike train compared
to neurons with only one stable attractor. This has consequences for spike-time
coding as it effectively increases the output entropy of neuronal ensembles.
Here, the spiking statistics is derived for homoclinic conductance-based neuron
models. Switching between rest and spiking is mainly determined along the
downstroke of the action potential, a dynamical feature lacking in common
neuron models with reset dynamics. Nonetheless similar derivations can be
applied to quadratic integrate-and-fire models. The derived interspike interval
distribution is shown to be unimodal, which warrants the future use of
meanfield approaches to networks of bistable neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43584">Heparin-induced tau filaments are polymorphic and differ from those in Alzheimer's and Pick's diseases</a></h4>

Assembly of microtubule-associated protein tau into filamentous inclusions underlies a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Tau filaments adopt different conformations in Alzheimer's and Pick's diseases. Here, we used cryo- and immuno- electron microscopy to characterise filaments that were assembled from recombinant full-length human tau with four (2N4R) or three (2N3R) microtubule-binding repeats in the presence of heparin. 2N4R tau assembles into multiple types of filaments, and the structures of three types reveal similar 'kinked hairpin' folds, in which the second and third repeats pack against each other. 2N3R tau filaments are structurally homogeneous, and adopt a dimeric core, where the third repeats of two tau molecules pack in a parallel manner. The heparin-induced tau filaments differ from those of Alzheimer's or Pick's disease, which have larger cores with different repeat compositions. Our results illustrate the structural versatility of amyloid filaments, and raise questions about the relevance of in vitro assembly.

Sleep depriving mice affects clock-gene expression, suggesting that these genes contribute to sleep homeostasis. The mechanisms linking extended wakefulness to clock-gene expression are, however, not well understood. We propose CIRBP to play a role because its rhythmic expression is i) sleep-wake driven and ii) necessary for high-amplitude clock-gene expression <i>in vitro</i>. We therefore expect <i>Cirbp </i>knock-out (KO) mice to exhibit attenuated sleep-deprivation induced changes in clock-gene expression, and consequently to differ in their sleep homeostatic regulation. Lack of CIRBP indeed blunted the sleep-deprivation incurred changes in cortical expression of <i>Nr1d1</i> whereas it amplified the changes in <i>Per2 </i>and <i>Clock</i>. Concerning sleep homeostasis, KO mice accrued only half the extra REM sleep wild-type (WT) littermates obtained during recovery. Unexpectedly, KO mice were more active during lights-off which was accompanied with faster theta oscillations compared to WT mice. Thus, CIRBP adjusts cortical clock-gene expression after sleep deprivation and expedites REM-sleep recovery.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43230">Optical manipulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis using photoswitchable ceramides</a></h4>

Ceramides are central intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism that also function as potent messengers in stress signaling and apoptosis. Progress in understanding how ceramides execute their biological roles is hampered by a lack of methods to manipulate their cellular levels and metabolic fate with appropriate spatiotemporal precision. Here, we report on clickable, azobenzene-containing ceramides, caCers, as photoswitchable metabolic substrates to exert optical control over sphingolipid production in cells. Combining atomic force microscopy on model bilayers with metabolic tracing studies in cells, we demonstrate that light-induced alterations in the lateral packing of caCers lead to marked differences in their metabolic conversion by sphingomyelin synthase and glucosylceramide synthase. These changes in metabolic rates are instant and reversible over several cycles of photoswitching. Our findings disclose new opportunities to probe the causal roles of ceramides and their metabolic derivatives in a wide array of sphingolipid-dependent cellular processes with the spatiotemporal precision of light.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42761">Spatial and temporal organization of RecA in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> DNA-damage response</a></h4>

The RecA protein orchestrates the cellular response to DNA damage via its multiple roles in the bacterial SOS response. Lack of tools that provide unambiguous access to the various RecA states within the cell have prevented understanding of the spatial and temporal changes in RecA structure/function that underlie control of the damage response. Here, we develop a monomeric C-terminal fragment of the λ repressor as a novel fluorescent probe that specifically interacts with RecA filaments on single-stranded DNA (RecA*). Single-molecule imaging techniques in live cells demonstrate that RecA is largely sequestered in storage structures during normal metabolism. Upon DNA damage, the storage structures dissolve and the cytosolic pool of RecA rapidly nucleates to form early SOS-signaling complexes, maturing into DNA-bound RecA bundles at later time points. Both before and after SOS induction, RecA* largely appears at locations distal from replisomes. Upon completion of repair, RecA storage structures reform.

How long neural information is stored in a local brain area reflects functions of that region and is often estimated by the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals in the area. Here, we investigated such intrinsic neural timescales in high-functioning adults with autism and examined whether local brain dynamics reflected their atypical behaviours. By analysing resting-state fMRI data, we identified shorter neural timescales in the sensory/visual cortices and a longer timescale in the right caudate in autism. The shorter intrinsic timescales in the sensory/visual areas were correlated with the severity of autism, whereas the longer timescale in the caudate was associated with cognitive rigidity. These observations were confirmed from neurodevelopmental perspectives and replicated in two independent cross-sectional datasets. Moreover, the intrinsic timescale was correlated with local grey matter volume. This study shows that functional and structural atypicality in local brain areas is linked to higher-order cognitive symptoms in autism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41930">HIV-1 Vpu is a potent transcriptional suppressor of NF-κB-elicited antiviral immune responses</a></h4>

Many viral pathogens target innate sensing cascades and/or cellular transcription factors to suppress antiviral immune responses. Here, we show that the accessory viral protein U (Vpu) of HIV-1 exerts broad immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Global transcriptional profiling of infected CD4+ T-cells revealed that <i>vpu</i>-deficient HIV-1 strains induce substantially stronger immune responses than the respective wild type viruses. Gene set enrichment analyses and cytokine arrays showed that Vpu suppresses the expression of NF-κB targets including interferons and restriction factors. Mutational analyses demonstrated that this immunosuppressive activity of Vpu is independent of its ability to counteract the restriction factor and innate sensor tetherin. However, Vpu-mediated inhibition of immune activation required an arginine residue in the cytoplasmic domain that is critical for blocking NF-κB signaling downstream of tetherin. In summary, our findings demonstrate that HIV-1 Vpu potently suppresses NF-κB-elicited antiviral immune responses at the transcriptional level.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41855">The cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of honey bee workers develop via a socially-modulated innate process</a></h4>

Large social insect colonies exhibit a remarkable ability for recognizing group members via colony-specific cuticular pheromonal signatures. Previous work suggested that in some ant species, colony-specific pheromonal profiles are generated through a mechanism involving the transfer and homogenization of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) across members of the colony. However, how colony-specific chemical profiles are generated in other social insect clades remains mostly unknown. Here we show that in the honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>), the colony-specific CHC profile completes its maturation in foragers via a sequence of stereotypic age-dependent quantitative and qualitative chemical transitions, which are driven by environmentally-sensitive intrinsic biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, the CHC profiles of individual honey bees are not likely produced through homogenization and transfer mechanisms, but instead mature in association with age-dependent division of labor. Furthermore, non-nestmate rejection behaviors seem to be contextually restricted to behavioral interactions between entering foragers and guards at the hive entrance.

Most efforts to estimate the reproducibility of published findings have focused on specific areas of research, even though science is usually assessed and funded on a regional or national basis. Here we describe a project to assess the reproducibility of findings in biomedical science published by researchers based in Brazil. The Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative is a systematic, multi-center effort to repeat between 60 and 100 experiments: the project will focus on a set of common laboratory methods, repeating each experiment in three different laboratories. The results, due in 2021, will allow us to estimate the level of reproducibility of biomedical science in Brazil, and to investigate what the published literature can tell us about the reproducibility of research in a given area.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40789">Cryptic genetic variation shapes the adaptive evolutionary potential of enzymes</a></h4>

Genetic variation among orthologous proteins can cause cryptic phenotypic properties that only manifest in changing environments. Such variation may impact the evolvability of proteins, but the underlying molecular basis remains unclear. Here, we performed comparative directed evolution of four orthologous metallo-β-lactamases toward a new function and found that different starting genotypes evolved to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Despite a low initial fitness, one ortholog reached a significantly higher fitness plateau than its counterparts, via increasing catalytic activity. By contrast, the ortholog with the highest initial activity evolved to a less-optimal and phenotypically distinct outcome through changes in expression, oligomerization and activity. We show how cryptic molecular properties and conformational variation of active site residues in the initial genotypes cause epistasis, that could lead to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the molecular details that connect genetic variation to protein function to improve the prediction of protein evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40576">Delayed inhibition mechanism for secondary channel factor regulation of ribosomal RNA transcription</a></h4>

RNA polymerases (RNAPs) contain a conserved 'secondary channel' which binds regulatory factors that modulate transcription initiation. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, the secondary channel factors (SCFs) GreB and DksA both repress ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, but SCF loading and repression mechanisms are unclear. We observed <i>in vitro</i> fluorescently labeled GreB molecules binding to single RNAPs and initiation of individual transcripts from an rRNA promoter. GreB arrived and departed from promoters only in complex with RNAP. GreB did not alter initial RNAP-promoter binding but instead blocked a step after conformational rearrangement of the initial RNAP-promoter complex. Strikingly, GreB-RNAP complexes never initiated at an rRNA promoter; only RNAP molecules arriving at the promoter without bound GreB produced transcript. The data reveal that a model SCF functions by a 'delayed inhibition' mechanism and suggest that rRNA promoters are inhibited by GreB/DksA because their short-lived RNAP complexes do not allow sufficient time for SCFs to dissociate.

Tsai et al. describe how the biosynthesis of specific phospholipids is linked to neurodegeneration and synaptic vesicle loss in adult Drosophila photoreceptors. Neurodegeneration is dependent on activity, and vesicle depletion engages a transcriptional feedback loop that includes SREBP and tetraspanins.

<p>by Wan Yang, Juan Li, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Measles is a highly infectious, severe viral disease. The disease is targeted for global eradication; however, this result has proven challenging. In China, where countrywide vaccination coverage for the last decade has been above 95% (the threshold for measles elimination), measles continues to cause large epidemics. To diagnose factors contributing to the persistency of measles, here we develop a model-inference system to infer measles transmission dynamics in China. The model-inference system uses demographic and vaccination data for each year as model inputs to directly account for changing population dynamics (including births, deaths, migrations, and vaccination). In addition, it simultaneously estimates unobserved model variables and parameters based on incidence data. When fitted to yearly incidence data for the entire population, it is able to accurately estimate independent, out-of-sample age-specific incidence. Using this validated model-inference system, we are thus able to estimate epidemiological and demographical characteristics key to measles transmission during 1951–2004 for three key locations in China, including its capital Beijing. These characteristics include age-specific population susceptibility and incidence rates, the basic reproductive number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>), reporting rate, population mixing intensity, and amplitude of seasonality. Key differences among the three sites reveal population and epidemiological characteristics crucial for understanding the current persistence of measles epidemics in China. We also discuss the implications our findings have for future elimination strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k-kP7DF8SuQ" width="1" />

<p>by David V. McLeod, Troy Day</p>

How social traits such as altruism and spite evolve remains an open question in evolutionary biology. One factor thought to be potentially important is demographic stochasticity. Here we provide a general theoretical analysis of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution. We show that the evolutionary impact of stochasticity depends on how the social action alters the recipient’s life cycle. If the action alters the recipient’s death rate, then demographic stochasticity always favours altruism and disfavours spite. On the other hand, if the action alters the recipient’s birth rate, then stochasticity can either favour or disfavour both altruism and spite depending on the ratio of the rate of population turnover to the population size. Finally, we also show that this ratio is critical to determining if demographic stochasticity can reverse the direction of selection upon social traits. Our analysis thus provides a general understanding of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X8WcHZJyKEE" width="1" />

<p>by Limeng Pu, Rajiv Gandhi Govindaraj, Jeffrey Mitchell Lemoine, Hsiao-Chun Wu, Michal Brylinski</p>

Comprehensive characterization of ligand-binding sites is invaluable to infer molecular functions of hypothetical proteins, trace evolutionary relationships between proteins, engineer enzymes to achieve a desired substrate specificity, and develop drugs with improved selectivity profiles. These research efforts pose significant challenges owing to the fact that similar pockets are commonly observed across different folds, leading to the high degree of promiscuity of ligand-protein interactions at the system-level. On that account, novel algorithms to accurately classify binding sites are needed. Deep learning is attracting a significant attention due to its successful applications in a wide range of disciplines. In this communication, we present DeepDrug3D, a new approach to characterize and classify binding pockets in proteins with deep learning. It employs a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network in which biomolecular structures are represented as voxels assigned interaction energy-based attributes. The current implementation of DeepDrug3D, trained to detect and classify nucleotide- and heme-binding sites, not only achieves a high accuracy of 95%, but also has the ability to generalize to unseen data as demonstrated for steroid-binding proteins and peptidase enzymes. Interestingly, the analysis of strongly discriminative regions of binding pockets reveals that this high classification accuracy arises from learning the patterns of specific molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, aromatic and hydrophobic contacts. DeepDrug3D is available as an open-source program at https://github.com/pulimeng/DeepDrug3D with the accompanying TOUGH-C1 benchmarking dataset accessible from https://osf.io/enz69/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IOucG4wUETk" width="1" />

<p>by Ahmed A. Metwally, Philip S. Yu, Derek Reiman, Yang Dai, Patricia W. Finn, David L. Perkins</p>

Food allergy is usually difficult to diagnose in early life, and the inability to diagnose patients with atopic diseases at an early age may lead to severe complications. Numerous studies have suggested an association between the infant gut microbiome and development of allergy. In this work, we investigated the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict food allergies in early life (0-3 years) from subjects’ longitudinal gut microbiome profiles. Using the DIABIMMUNE dataset, we show an increase in predictive power using our model compared to Hidden Markov Model, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and LASSO regression. We further evaluated whether the training of LSTM networks benefits from reduced representations of microbial features. We considered sparse autoencoder for extraction of potential latent representations in addition to standard feature selection procedures based on Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and variance prior to the training of LSTM networks. The comprehensive evaluation reveals that LSTM networks with the mRMR selected features achieve significantly better performance compared to the other tested machine learning models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0lsCUFCXces" width="1" />

<p>by Honda Naoki, Ryutaro Akiyama, Dini Wahyu Kartika Sari, Shin Ishii, Yasumasa Bessho, Takaaki Matsui</p>

The reproducibility of embryonic development is remarkable, although molecular processes are intrinsically stochastic at the single-cell level. How the multicellular system resists the inevitable noise to acquire developmental reproducibility constitutes a fundamental question in developmental biology. Toward this end, we focused on vertebrate somitogenesis as a representative system, because somites are repeatedly reproduced within a single embryo whereas such reproducibility is lost in segmentation clock gene-deficient embryos. However, the effect of noise on developmental reproducibility has not been fully investigated, because of the technical difficulty in manipulating the noise intensity in experiments. In this study, we developed a computational model of ERK-mediated somitogenesis, in which bistable ERK activity is regulated by an FGF gradient, cell-cell communication, and the segmentation clock, subject to the intrinsic noise. The model simulation generated our previous <i>in vivo</i> observation that the ERK activity was distributed in a step-like gradient in the presomitic mesoderm, and its boundary was posteriorly shifted by the clock in a stepwise manner, leading to regular somite formation. Here, we showed that this somite regularity was robustly maintained against the noise. Removing the clock from the model predicted that the stepwise shift of the ERK activity occurs at irregular timing with irregular distance owing to the noise, resulting in somite size variation. This model prediction was recently confirmed by live imaging of ERK activity in zebrafish embryos. Through theoretical analysis, we presented a mechanism by which the clock reduces the inherent somite irregularity observed in clock-deficient embryos. Therefore, this study indicates a novel role of the segmentation clock in noise-resistant developmental reproducibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5KQ0qVfE2zo" width="1" />

<p>by Stephanie L. Barnes, Nathan M. Belliveau, William T. Ireland, Justin B. Kinney, Rob Phillips</p>

Despite the central importance of transcriptional regulation in biology, it has proven difficult to determine the regulatory mechanisms of individual genes, let alone entire gene networks. It is particularly difficult to decipher the biophysical mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in living cells and determine the energetic properties of binding sites for transcription factors and RNA polymerase. In this work, we present a strategy for dissecting transcriptional regulatory sequences using <i>in vivo</i> methods (massively parallel reporter assays) to formulate quantitative models that map a transcription factor binding site’s DNA sequence to transcription factor-DNA binding energy. We use these models to predict the binding energies of transcription factor binding sites to within 1 <i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i> of their measured values. We further explore how such a sequence-energy mapping relates to the mechanisms of trancriptional regulation in various promoter contexts. Specifically, we show that our models can be used to design specific induction responses, analyze the effects of amino acid mutations on DNA sequence preference, and determine how regulatory context affects a transcription factor’s sequence specificity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0hkB9Alflg" width="1" />

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Central nervous system (CNS) pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inwards. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a ‘surface‐in' process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We focused on the thalamus which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxel‐wise volume changes were calculated using deformation based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up 4.6 years, SD 1.9). 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional ‘surface‐in' gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate 3.01, CI 1.44‐4.58, p = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate 0.33, CI 0.12‐0.54, p = 0.0021).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis‐disease specific ‘surface‐in' process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The two related tumor necrosis factor members a proliferation‐inducing ligand (APRIL) and B‐cell activation factor (BAFF) are currently targeted in autoimmune diseases as B‐cell regulators. In multiple sclerosis (MS), combined APRIL/BAFF blockade led to unexpected exacerbated inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients. Here, we investigate the role of the APRIL/BAFF axis in the CNS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>APRIL expression was analyzed in MS lesions by immunohistochemistry. The <i>in vivo</i> role of APRIL was assessed in the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Functional <i>in vitro</i> studies were performed with human and mouse astrocytes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>APRIL was expressed in lesions from EAE. In its absence, the disease was worst. Lesions from MS patients also showed APRIL expression upon infiltration of macrophages. Notably, all the APRIL secreted by these macrophages specifically targeted astrocytes. The upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, sometimes bearing chondroitin sulfate of type E sugar moieties, binding APRIL, in reactive astrocytes explained the latter selectivity. Astrocytes responded to APRIL by producing a sufficient amount of IL‐10 to dampen antigen‐specific T‐cell proliferation and pathogenic cytokine secretion. Finally, an intraspinal delivery of recombinant APRIL before disease onset, shortly reduced EAE symptoms. Repeated intravenous injections of recombinant APRIL before and even at disease onset also had an effect.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data show that APRIL mediates an anti‐inflammatory response from astrocytes in MS lesions. This protective activity is not shared with BAFF. Ann Neurol 2019;9999:1–15</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25413?af=R">Cerebellar degeneration correlates with motor symptoms in Huntington disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: “motor” or “mood.”</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the <i>IT15</i> gene, or age at death.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25418?af=R">Neural function in DCC mutation carriers with and without mirror movements</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recently identified mutations of the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, <i>DCC,</i> present an opportunity to investigate, in living human brain, mechanisms affecting neural connectivity and the basis of mirror movements, involuntary contralateral responses that mirror voluntary unilateral actions. We hypothesized that haploinsufficient <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements would exhibit decreased <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, a functional ipsilateral corticospinal tract, greater “mirroring” motor representations, and reduced interhemispheric inhibition. <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements might exhibit some of these features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The participants (n = 52) included 13 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements, 7 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements, 13 relatives without the mutation or mirror movements, and 19 unrelated healthy volunteers. The multimodal approach comprised quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under resting and task conditions, and measures of white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mirror movements were associated with reduced <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, increased ipsilateral TMS‐induced motor evoked potentials, increased fMRI responses in the mirroring M1 and cerebellum, and markedly reduced interhemispheric inhibition. The <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation, irrespective of mirror movements, was associated with reduced functional connectivity and white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Diverse connectivity abnormalities were identified in mutation carriers with and without mirror movements, but corticospinal effects and decreased peripheral <i>DCC</i> mRNA appeared driven by the mirror movement phenotype. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–10</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the initial termination rate of status epilepticus (SE) in a large observational study and explore associated variables.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data of adults treated for SE were collected prospectively in centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, during 4.5 years. Incident episodes of 1,049 patients were analyzed using uni‐ and multivariate statistics to determine factors predicting cessation of SE within 1 hour (for generalized convulsive SE [GCSE]) and 12 hours (for non‐GCSE) of initiating treatment.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age at SE onset was 70 years; most frequent etiologies were remote (32%) and acute (31%). GCSE was documented in 43%. Median latency between SE onset and first treatment was 30 minutes in GCSE and 150 minutes in non‐GCSE. The first intravenous compound was a benzodiazepine in 86% in GCSE and 73% in non‐GCSE. Bolus doses of the first treatment step were lower than recommended by current guidelines in 76% of GCSE patients and 78% of non‐GCSE patients. In 319 GCSE patients (70%), SE was ongoing 1 hour after initiating treatment and in 342 non‐GCSE patients (58%) 12 hours after initiating treatment. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that use of benzodiazepines as first treatment step and a higher cumulative dose of anticonvulsants within the first period of treatment were associated with shorter time to cessation of SE for both groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In clinical practice, treatment guidelines were not followed in a substantial proportion of patients. This underdosing correlated with lack of cessation of SE. Our data suggest that sufficiently dosed benzodiazepines should be used as a first treatment step. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–12</p>

<p>This paper describes the outlines of a research program for understanding the
cognitive-emotional brain, with an emphasis on the issue of dynamics: How can
we study, characterize, and understand the neural underpinnings of
cognitive-emotional behaviors as inherently dynamic processes? The framework
embraces many of the central themes developed by Steve Grossberg in his
extensive body of work in the past 50 years. By embracing head on the
leitmotifs of dynamics, decentralized computation, emergence, selection and
competition, and autonomy, it is proposed that a science of the mind-brain can
be developed that is built upon a solid foundation of understanding behavior
while employing computational and mathematical tools in an integral manner. A
key implication of the framework is that standard ways of thinking about
causation are inadequate when unravelling the workings of a complex system such
as the brain. Instead, it is proposed that researchers should focus on
determining the dynamic multivariate structure of brain data. Accordingly,
central problems become to characterize the dimensionality of neural
trajectories, and the geometry of the underlying neural space. At a time when
the development of neurotechniques has reached a fever pitch, neuroscience
needs to redirect its focus and invest comparable energy in the conceptual and
theoretical dimensions of its research endeavor. Otherwise we run the risk of
being able to measure 'every atom' in the brain in a theoretical vacuum.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We mapped alterations of the functional structure of the cerebral cortex using a novel imaging approach in a sample of 160 obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Whole-brain functional connectivity maps were generated using multidistance measures of intracortical neural activity coupling defined within isodistant local areas. OCD patients demonstrated neural activity desynchronization within the orbitofrontal cortex and in primary somatosensory, auditory, visual, gustatory, and olfactory areas. Symptom severity was significantly associated with the degree of functional structure alteration in OCD-relevant brain regions. By means of a novel imaging perspective, we once again identified brain alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex, involving areas purportedly implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD. However, our results also indicated that weaker intracortical activity coupling is also present in each primary sensory area. On the basis of previous neurophysiological studies, such cortical activity desynchronization may best be interpreted as reflecting deficient inhibitory neuron activity and altered sensory filtering.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dysfunction of motor cortices is thought to contribute to motor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little is known on the link between cortical dopaminergic loss, abnormalities in motor cortex neural activity and motor deficits. We address the role of dopamine in modulating motor cortical activity by focusing on the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing a cued-licking task. We first demonstrate licking deficits and concurrent alterations of spiking activity in ALM of head-fixed mice with unilateral depletion of dopaminergic neurons (i.e., mice injected with 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle). Hemilesioned mice displayed delayed licking initiation, shorter duration of licking bouts, and lateral deviation of tongue protrusions. In parallel with these motor deficits, we observed a reduction in the prevalence of cue responsive neurons and altered preparatory activity. Acute and local blockade of D1 receptors in ALM recapitulated some of the key behavioral and neural deficits observed in hemilesioned mice. Altogether, our data show a direct relationship between cortical D1 receptor modulation, cue-evoked, and preparatory activity in ALM, and licking initiation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To uncover the ontogenesis of the human indusium griseum (IG), 28 post-mortem fetal human brains, 12–40 postconceptional weeks (PCW) of age, and 4 adult brains were analyzed immunohistochemically and compared with post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 28 fetal brains (14–41 PCW). The morphogenesis of the IG occurred between 12 and 15 PCW, transforming the bilateral IG primordia into a ribbon-like cortical lamina. The histogenetic transition of sub-laminated zones into the three-layered cortical organization occurred between 15 and 35 PCW, concomitantly with rapid cell differentiation that occurred from 18 to 28 PCW and the elaboration of neuronal connectivity during the entire second half of gestation. The increasing number of total cells and neurons in the IG at 25 and 35 PCW confirmed its continued differentiation throughout this period. High-field 3.0 T post-mortem MRI enabled visualization of the IG at the mid-fetal stage using T2-weighted sequences. In conclusion, the IG had a distinct histogenetic differentiation pattern than that of the neighboring intralimbic areas of the same ontogenetic origin, and did not show any signs of regression during the fetal period or postnatally, implying a functional role of the IG in the adult brain, which is yet to be disclosed.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In many species of Mammalia, the surface of the brain develops from a smooth structure to one with many fissures and folds, allowing for vast expansion of the surface area of the cortex. The importance of understanding what drives cortical folding extends beyond mere curiosity, as conditions such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal alcohol syndrome are associated with impaired folding in the infant and child. Despite being a key feature of brain development, the mechanisms driving cortical folding remain largely unknown. In this review we discuss the possible role of the subplate, a developmentally transient compartment, in directing region-dependent development leading to sulcal and gyral formation. We discuss the development of the subplate in species with lissencephalic and gyrencephalic cortices, the characteristics of the cells found in the subplate, and the possible presence of molecular cues that guide axons into, and out of, the overlying and multilayered cortex before the appearance of definitive cortical folds. An understanding of what drives cortical folding is likely to help in understanding the origins of abnormal folding patterns in clinical pathologies.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>During early development, the infant brain is highly plastic and sensory experiences modulate emerging cortical maps, enhancing processing efficiency as infants set up key linguistic precursors. Early interactive acoustic experience (IAE) with spectrotemporally-modulated non-speech has been shown to facilitate optimal acoustic processing and generalizes to novel non-speech sounds at 7-months-of-age. Here we demonstrate that effects of non-speech IAE endure well beyond the immediate training period and robustly generalize to speech processing. Infants who received non-speech IAE differed at 9-months-of-age from both naïve controls and those with only passive acoustic exposure, demonstrating broad modulation of oscillatory dynamics. For the standard syllable, increased high-gamma (&gt;70 Hz) power within auditory cortices indicates that IAE fosters native speech processing, facilitating establishment of phonemic representations. The higher left beta power seen may reflect increased linking of sensory information and corresponding articulatory patterns, while bilateral decreases in theta power suggest more mature automatized speech processing, as less neuronal resources were allocated to process syllabic information. For the deviant syllable, left-lateralized gamma (&lt;70 Hz) enhancement suggests IAE promotes phonemic-related discrimination abilities. Theta power increases in right auditory cortex, known for favoring slow-rate decoding, implies IAE facilitates the more demanding processing of the sporadic deviant syllable.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Alcohol abuse is a major public health problem worldwide. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control regular drinking may help to reduce hazards of alcohol consumption. While immunological mechanisms have been related to alcohol drinking, most studies reported changes in immune function that are secondary to alcohol use. In this report, we analyse how the gene “TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator” (<span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span>) affects alcohol drinking behavior. Based on our recent discovery in a large GWAS dataset that suggested an association of <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span>, SNP rs197273, with alcohol drinking, we report that SNP rs197273 in <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span> is associated both with gene expression (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 1.16 × 10<sup>−19</sup>) and regional methylation (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 5.90 × 10<sup>−25</sup>). A <span style="font-style: italic;">tank</span> knock out mouse model suggests a role of TANK in alcohol drinking, anxiety-related behavior, as well as alcohol exposure induced activation of insular cortex NF-κB. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies among up to 1896 adolescents reveal that TANK is involved in the control of brain activity in areas of aversive interoceptive processing, including the insular cortex, but not in areas related to reinforcement, reward processing or impulsiveness. Our findings suggest that the cortical neuroimmune regulator TANK is associated with enhanced aversive emotional processing that better protects from the establishment of alcohol drinking behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus displays a complex organization and function that is perturbed in many neuropathologies. Histological work revealed a complex arrangement of subfields along the medial–lateral and the ventral–dorsal dimension, which contrasts with the anterior–posterior functional differentiation. The variety of maps has raised the need for an integrative multimodal view. We applied connectivity-based parcellation to 1) intrinsic connectivity 2) task-based connectivity, and 3) structural covariance, as complementary windows into structural and functional differentiation of the hippocampus. Strikingly, while functional properties (i.e., intrinsic and task-based) revealed similar partitions dominated by an anterior–posterior organization, structural covariance exhibited a hybrid pattern reflecting both functional and cytoarchitectonic subdivision. Capitalizing on the consistency of functional parcellations, we defined robust functional maps at different levels of partitions, which are openly available for the scientific community. Our functional maps demonstrated a head–body and tail partition, subdivided along the anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axis. Behavioral profiling of these fine partitions based on activation data indicated an emotion–cognition gradient along the anterior–posterior axis and additionally suggested a self-world-centric gradient supporting the role of the hippocampus in the construction of abstract representations for spatial navigation and episodic memory.</span>

Calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) is essential for voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV) autoregulation. Abderemane-Ali et al. demonstrate that the CaV selectivity filter (SF) forms the CDI gate, suggesting an SF-based inactivation paradigm shared with other voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily members.

Constraint-based modeling (CBM) is increasingly used to analyze the metabolism of complex microbial communities involved in ecology, biomedicine, and various biotechnological processes. While CBM is an established framework for studying the metabolism of single species with linear stoichiometric models, CBM of communities with balanced growth is more complicated, not only due to the larger size of the multi-species metabolic network but also because of the bilinear nature of the resulting community models. Moreover, the solution space of these community models often contains biologically unrealistic solutions, which, even with model linearization and under application of certain objective functions, cannot easily be excluded. Here we present RedCom, a new approach to build reduced community models in which the metabolisms of the participating organisms are represented by net conversions computed from the respective single-species networks. By discarding (single-species) net conversions that violate a minimality criterion in the exchange fluxes, it is ensured that unrealistic solutions in the community model are excluded where a species altruistically synthesizes large amounts of byproducts (instead of biomass) to fulfill the requirements of other species. We employed the RedCom approach for modeling communities of up to nine organisms involved in typical degradation steps of anaerobic digestion in biogas plants. Compared to full (bilinear and linearized) community models, we found that the reduced community models obtained with RedCom are not only much smaller but allow, also in the largest model with nine species, extensive calculations required to fully characterize the solutions space and to reveal key properties of communities with maximum methane yield and production rates. Furthermore, the predictive power of the reduced community models is significantly larger because they predict much smaller ranges of feasible community compositions and exchange fluxes still being consistent with measurements obtained from enrichment cultures. For an enrichment culture for growth on ethanol, we also used metaproteomic data to further constrain the solution space of the community models. Both model and proteomic data indicated a dominance of acetoclastic methanogens (Methanosarcinales) and Desulfovibrionales being the least abundant group in this microbial community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukP6-AaBg4" width="1" />

<p>by Dave Osthus, Ashlynn R. Daughton, Reid Priedhorsky</p>

The ability to produce timely and accurate flu forecasts in the United States can significantly impact public health. Augmenting forecasts with internet data has shown promise for improving forecast accuracy and timeliness in controlled settings, but results in practice are less convincing, as models augmented with internet data have not consistently outperformed models without internet data. In this paper, we perform a controlled experiment, taking into account data backfill, to improve clarity on the benefits and limitations of augmenting an already good flu forecasting model with internet-based nowcasts. Our results show that a good flu forecasting model can benefit from the augmentation of internet-based nowcasts in practice for all considered public health-relevant forecasting targets. The degree of forecast improvement due to nowcasting, however, is uneven across forecasting targets, with short-term forecasting targets seeing the largest improvements and seasonal targets such as the peak timing and intensity seeing relatively marginal improvements. The uneven forecasting improvements across targets hold even when “perfect” nowcasts are used. These findings suggest that further improvements to flu forecasting, particularly seasonal targets, will need to derive from other, non-nowcasting approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NREuF014noo" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>Vestibulospinal neurons are organized into discrete groups projecting from brainstem to spinal cord, enabling vertebrates to maintain proper balance and posture. The two largest groups are the lateral vestibulospinal tract (LVST) group and the contralateral medial vestibulospinal tract (cMVST) group, with different projection lateralities and functional roles. In search of a molecular basis for these differences, we performed RNA sequencing on LVST and cMVST neurons from mouse and chicken embryos followed by immunohistofluorescence validation. Focusing on transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes, we identified TF signatures that uniquely distinguish the LVST from the cMVST group and further parse different rhombomere-derived portions comprising the cMVST. Immunohistofluorescence assessment of the CNS from spinal cord to cortex demonstrated that these TF signatures are restricted to the respective vestibulospinal groups and some neurons in their immediate vicinity. Collectively, these results link the combinatorial expression of TFs to developmental and functional subdivisions within the vestibulospinal system.</p><p><b>Significance statement:</b> The molecular underpinnings of hodological and functional subdivisions within brainstem-to-spinal cord projection neurons are poorly understood. Transcriptomic profiling is an important step towards obtaining a molecular characterization of individual projection neuron groups and identifying candidate genes potentially involved in their specification. Here we use this approach to identify transcription factor signatures conserved in mouse and chicken that distinguish the two major vestibulospinal projection neuron groups and define coherent subpopulations within them, using whole transcriptome sequencing and immunohistofluorescence combined with retrograde tracing.</p>

Abstract<p>Dynamical changes in the environment strongly impact our perception. Likewise, sensory systems preferentially represent stimulus changes, enhancing temporal contrast. In olfaction, odor concentration changes across consecutive inhalations (<i>C<sub>t</sub></i>) can guide odor source localization, yet the neural representation of <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> has not been studied in vertebrates. <b>We have found that, in the mouse olfactory bulb, a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, enhancing the contrast between different concentrations.</b> These concentration change responses are direction selective: they respond either to increments or decrements of concentration, reminiscent of ON and OFF selectivity in the retina. This contrast enhancement scales with the magnitude, but not the duration of the concentration step. Further, <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</p><p><b>Significance</b> As an animal tracks an odor plume, concentration changes over time. Here we show that olfactory bulb neurons explicitly represent concentration changes between consecutive inhalations. This response property enhances temporal contrast, as in other sensory systems. Fine temporal spike patterns do not improve concentration change decoding. These signals may guide olfactory navigation in the natural environment.</p>

Abstract<p>Development of the nervous system relies on a balance between axon and dendrite growth and subsequent pruning and degeneration. The developmental degeneration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons has been well studied in part because it can be readily modeled by removing the trophic support by nerve growth factor (NGF) <i>in vitro</i>. We have recently reported that axonal fragmentation induced by NGF withdrawal is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and here we address the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry required for developmental axon degeneration of mouse embryonic DRG neurons. Our results show that the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid family member 1 (TRPV1) cation channel plays a critical role mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in DRG axons withdrawn from NGF. We further demonstrate that TRPV1 activation is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that is driven through protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) -dependent pathways that become active upon NGF withdrawal. These findings demonstrate novel mechanistic links between NGF deprivation, PKC activation, ROS generation and TRPV1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in sensory axon degeneration.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neurons are equipped with the genetic means to degenerate, and a subset of peripheral neurons normally degenerate during embryonic development to establish a mature pattern. This beneficial neurodegeneration is regulated by signaling pathways that are only partially understood, yet share components with pathways that mediate pathological degeneration of crucial neural structures during adult diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Here, we identify TRPV1 as a key regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into axoplasm that is required for developmental degeneration modeled by NGF withdrawal from sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion <i>in vitro.</i> Crucially, we report that the TRPV1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is prompted by a signaling axis comprised of PKC-dependent NOX complex activation and ROS generation upstream of TRPV1.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0007-19.2019v1?rss=1">Synaptic organization of VGLUT3 expressing low-threshold mechanosensitive C fiber terminals in the rodent spinal cord</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMRs formed central terminals of type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Here we show that low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) form central terminals of a certain class of synaptic glomeruli, where they are subject to presynaptic inhibition and establish synapses onto distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. These results prompt a revised interpretation of dorsal horn ultrastructure, and provide a basis for ultrastructural identification of C-LTMRs in future studies of the role of these fibers in somatosensation. Furthermore, our observations indicate that C-LTMR terminations are subject to complex regulation and are well-positioned to participate in integration of afferent signals that lead to percepts of affective touch and pain.</p>

<p>Extracting and detecting spike activities from the fluorescence observations
is an important step in understanding how neuron systems work. The main
challenge lies in that the combination of the ambient noise with dynamic
baseline fluctuation, often contaminates the observations, thereby
deteriorating the reliability of spike detection. This may be even worse in the
face of the nonlinear biological process, the coupling interactions between
spikes and baseline, and the unknown critical parameters of an underlying
physiological model, in which erroneous estimations of parameters will affect
the detection of spikes causing further error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a random finite set (RFS) based Bayesian approach. The dynamic
behaviors of spike sequence, fluctuated baseline and unknown parameters are
formulated as one RFS. This RFS state is capable of distinguishing the hidden
active/silent states induced by spike and non-spike activities respectively,
thereby \emph{negating the interaction role} played by spikes and other
factors. Then, premised on the RFS states, a Bayesian inference scheme is
designed to simultaneously estimate the model parameters, baseline, and crucial
spike activities. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can gain an
extra $12\%$ detection accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art MLSpike
method.

<p>Process-oriented theories of cognition must be evaluated against time-ordered
observations. Here we present a representative example for data assimilation of
the SWIFT model, a dynamical model of the control of spatial fixation position
and fixation duration during reading. First, we develop and test an approximate
likelihood function of the model, which is a combination of a pseudo-marginal
spatial likelihood and an approximate temporal likelihood function. Second, we
use a Bayesian approach to parameter inference using an adapative Markov chain
Monte Carlo procedure. Our results indicate that model parameters can be
estimated reliably for individual subjects. We conclude that approximative
Bayesian inference represents a considerable step forward for the area of
eye-movement modeling, where modelling of individual data on the basis of
process-based dynamic models has not been possible before.

<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has a unique role in memory retrieval:
fMRI and electrocorticography studies suggest that within the ventral PPC (VPC)
specifically, there is an anterior-posterior functional divergence between
externally-oriented and internally-oriented attention to memory (AtoM).
However, the role of VPC during verbal episodic encoding, and the relationship
between encoding- and retrieval-related activity, is less understood. Here we
show that activation within a subregion of VPC is doubly dissociated between
its anterior and posterior parts, during encoding compared to recall in a free
recall task. We found that regional activation defined by increased high gamma
power and decreased beta power oscillations during encoding and recall
correlated with recall success. During word encoding, iEEG sites that showed
this correlation were located anterior to those that showed deactivation.
Conversely, during word recall, sites that showed stronger correlations between
activity and number of words recalled were located more posteriorly. Our
results demonstrate the significance of high gamma and beta oscillations
suggesting a push-pull relationship between attention to external stimuli and
internal memories within left ventral PPC. Knowledge of this divergence of
function along the anterior-posterior axis within left ventral PPC may prove
useful for guiding brain stimulation strategies.

<p>by Dimitrije Marković, Andrea M. F. Reiter, Stefan J. Kiebel</p>

In our daily lives timing of our actions plays an essential role when we navigate the complex everyday environment. It is an open question though how the representations of the temporal structure of the world influence our behavior. Here we propose a probabilistic model with an explicit representation of state durations which may provide novel insights in how the brain predicts upcoming changes. We illustrate several properties of the behavioral model using a standard reversal learning design and compare its task performance to standard reinforcement learning models. Furthermore, using experimental data, we demonstrate how the model can be applied to identify participants’ beliefs about the latent temporal task structure. We found that roughly one quarter of participants seem to have learned the latent temporal structure and used it to anticipate changes, whereas the remaining participants’ behavior did not show signs of anticipatory responses, suggesting a lack of precise temporal expectations. We expect that the introduced behavioral model will allow, in future studies, for a systematic investigation of how participants learn the underlying temporal structure of task environments and how these representations shape behavior.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MvC8apYzGP4" width="1" />

The circadian oscillator, an internal time-keeping device found in most organisms, enables timely regulation of daily biological activities by maintaining synchrony with the external environment. The mechanistic basis underlying the adjustment of circadian rhythms to changing external conditions, however, has yet to be clearly elucidated. We explored the mechanism of action of nicotinamide in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, a metabolite that lengthens the period of circadian rhythms, to understand the regulation of circadian period. To identify the key mechanisms involved in the circadian response to nicotinamide, we developed a systematic and practical modeling framework based on the identification and comparison of gene regulatory dynamics. Our mathematical predictions, confirmed by experimentation, identified key transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of circadian period and uncovered the role of blue light in the response of the circadian oscillator to nicotinamide. We suggest that our methodology could be adapted to predict mechanisms of drug action in complex biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vbjb0fubKc0" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of eight years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5Mb duplication event involving the gene <i>PMP22</i>.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina beadchips. Genome‐wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. <i>SIPA1L2</i> (signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using co‐immunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and <i>in vitro</i> siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified significant association of four SNPs (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in <i>SIPA1L2</i> with foot dorsiflexion strength (P &lt; 1×10<sup>‐7</sup>). Co‐immunoprecipitation and mass‐spectroscopy studies identified β‐actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Further, we show that <i>SIPA1L2</i> is part of a myelination‐associated co‐expressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, <i>in vitro</i> knock‐down of <i>SIPA1L2</i> in Schwannoma cells lead to a significant reduction of <i>PMP22</i> expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions.</p>

Abstract<p>Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential (LFP) monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day 11 (P11) and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl<sup>-</sup> influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Febrile seizures are the most common neurological disorder in children. For the treatment of febrile seizures, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators are generally used and successfully supress seizures in most cases. However, it is still up for debate whether these drugs could depolarize immature neurons in the developing brain. Here, using a mouse model of febrile seizures, we show that high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators exacerbate the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of complex febrile seizures at postnatal day 11 but not at 14. We further found that the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter isoform 1 blocker bumetanide suppresses the phenotypes deteriorated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators. Thus, our findings suggest high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators possibly activate immature neurons.</p>

Abstract<p>Prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of neurobehavioral pathologies, including autism and schizophrenia. A common feature of these psychiatric disorders is prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory circuit disruption due to GABAergic interneuron alteration. Cortical interneurons are generated and migrate throughout late gestation and early infancy, making them highly susceptible to perinatal insults such as preterm birth. Term and preterm PFC pathology specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical markers for interneurons. Based on the changes seen, a new preterm encephalopathy mouse model was developed to produce similar PFC interneuron loss. Maternal immune activation (MIA; modeling chorioamnionitis, associated with 85% of extremely preterm births) was combined with chronic sublethal hypoxia (CSH; modeling preterm respiratory failure), with offspring of both sexes assessed anatomically, molecularly and neurobehaviorally. In the PFC examined from the human preterm samples compared to matched term samples at corrected age, a decrease in somatostatin and calbindin interneurons was seen in upper cortical layers. This pattern of interneuron loss in upper cortical layers was mimicked in the mouse PFC following the combination of MIA and CSH, but not after either insult alone. This persistent interneuron loss is associated with postnatal microglial activation that occurs during CSH only after MIA. The combined insults lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits which parallel human psychopathologies that may be seen after extremely preterm birth. This new preclinical model supports a paradigm in which specific cellular alterations seen in preterm encephalopathy can be linked with a risk of neuropsychiatric sequela. Specific interneuron subtypes may provide therapeutic targets to prevent or ameliorate these neurodevelopmental risks.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Growing evidence suggests that a common component of psychiatric disorders is damage to inhibitory neurons. In the frontal lobe, these neurons continue to develop during late gestation and infancy, predisposing preterm survivors to neurobehavioral disorders and/or cognitive impairment. Preventing neuronal damage depends on having accurate models of preterm brain injury with well-defined outcome measures that can be examined in both small animals and humans. In this study, interneuron number were assessed in term and preterm human frontal brain tissues and in a novel multifactorial model that combines prenatal inflammation with postnatal hypoxia resulting in long-term inhibitory neuron loss. This new model was validated through anatomical and functional assessments that directly translate to human measures.</p>

Abstract<p>Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. While we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types is statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> A major challenge in cancer chemotherapy is to effectively kill tumor cells while preserving healthy issue. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to side effects by anti-cancer agents. Agents that induce a recently identified type of cell death, called ferroptosis, are widely being considered for cancer treatment. However, precise understanding of how ferroptosis induction in cancer cells may simultaneously thwart function or viability of post-mitotic neurons is essential in defining the efficacy and toxicity of these agents. We show that mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death in cancer cells are similar to those in neurons. We leverage prior studies of ferroptosis in neurons to identify histone deacetylase inhibitors as agents that enhance chemotherapy-induced ferroptosis of tumors while inhibiting ferroptosis in neurons.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The biological mechanisms underlying complex forms of learning requiring the understanding of rules based on previous experience are yet unknown. Previous studies raise the intriguing possibility that improvement in complex learning tasks requires the long-term modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of the slow calcium-dependent potassium current (sI<sub>AHP</sub>) simultaneously in most neurons in the relevant neuronal networks in several key brain areas. Such sI<sub>AHP</sub> reduction is expressed in attenuation of the post-burst after-hyperpolarization (AHP) potential, and thus in enhanced repetitive action potential firing.</p><p>Using complex olfactory-discrimination (OD) learning as a model for complex learning, we show that brief activation of the GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor results in long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability in neurons from controls, but not from trained rats. Such an effect can be obtained by a brief tetanic synaptic stimulation or by direct application of kainate, both of which reduce the post-burst AHP in pyramidal neurons. Induction of long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability is mediated via a metabotropic process that requires PKC and ERK activation.</p><p>Intrinsic neuronal excitability cannot be modulated by synaptic activation in neurons from GluK2 knockout mice. Accordingly, these mice are incapable of learning the complex OD task. Moreover, viral-induced overexpression of Gluk2 in piriform cortex pyramidal neurons results in remarkable enhancement of complex OD learning. Thus, signaling via kainate receptors has a central functional role in higher cognitive abilities.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study we describe the molecular and cellular mechanism for complex learning.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that complex learning is accompanied by enhanced intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of a slow potassium current in most neurons in the relevant brain areas.</p><p>Using complex olfactory-discrimination (OD) learning we show that the kainate GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor is necessary and sufficient for complex learning.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Swathi Ayloo, Chenghua Gu</p><div><p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a functional interface separating the brain from the circulatory system and is essential for homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.</p></div>

<p>The NEURON simulator has been developed over the past three decades and is
widely used by neuroscientists to model the electrical activity of neuronal
networks. Large network simulation projects using NEURON have supercomputer
allocations that individually measure in the millions of core hours.
Supercomputer centers are transitioning to next generation architectures and
the work accomplished per core hour for these simulations could be improved by
an order of magnitude if NEURON was able to better utilize those new hardware
capabilities. In order to adapt NEURON to evolving computer architectures, the
compute engine of the NEURON simulator has been extracted and has been
optimized as a library called CoreNEURON. This paper presents the design,
implementation and optimizations of CoreNEURON. We describe how CoreNEURON can
be used as a library with NEURON and then compare performance of different
network models on multiple architectures including IBM BlueGene/Q, Intel
Skylake, Intel MIC and NVIDIA GPU. We show how CoreNEURON can simulate existing
NEURON network models with 4-7x less memory usage and 2-7x less execution time
while maintaining binary result compatibility with NEURON.

<p>Unfolding how the brain functionally shifts within the cognitive space
remains an unresolved question. From a brain connectivity perspective, there
exist two main concepts: cognitive shifts and cognitive flexibility. Although
the former is the proxy of the latter, the biggest challenge, in terms of
bridging these two concepts, lies in the fact that cognitive shifts are
governed by topological rules whereas cognitive flexibility is purely
numerical. In this paper, we bridge the aforementioned concepts while
preserving the complexity of cognition by proposing a formalism based on a 2D
network morphospace that quantifies trapping and exit characteristics of
network subsystems, naturally interpreted as functional communities. We show
that the constructed measurements reflect the emergent phenomenon of
higher-order cognitive states in addition to being able to quantify cognitive
flexibility, as a direct output. Leveraging this analytic framework, cognitive
shifts among traversedly integrated/segregated states of cognition are shown to
be projected from subject specific cognitive signatures. The evidence of
individual fingerprint emerged from cognitive flexibility domain legitimizes
the quest to explore the intrinsic relationship between flexibility of
functional networks and behavioral measures, including fluid intelligence. The
constructed multi-linear models using flexibility descriptors demonstrate an
above chance level of specificity. Finally, through the associations between
behavioral measures and flexibility theory, we found that frontoparietal (FP)
activation level, expressed through FP preconfiguration, and default mode
network (DMN) efficiency, expressed through DMN preconfiguration, are
positively correlated with all behavioral measures.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The neural substrates of intelligence represent a fundamental but largely uncharted topic in human developmental neuroscience. Prior neuroimaging studies have identified modest but highly dynamic associations between intelligence and cortical thickness (CT) in childhood and adolescence. In a separate thread of research, quantitative genetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated that most measures of intelligence are highly heritable, as are many brain regions associated with intelligence. In the current study, we integrate these 2 streams of prior work by examining the genetic contributions to CT–intelligence relationships using a genetically informative longitudinal sample of 813 typically developing youth, imaged with high-resolution MRI and assessed with Wechsler Intelligence Scales (IQ). In addition to replicating the phenotypic association between multimodal association cortex and language centers with IQ, we find that CT–IQ covariance is nearly entirely genetically mediated. Moreover, shared genetic factors drive the rapidly evolving landscape of CT–IQ relationships in the developing brain.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In early blind individuals, brain activation by a variety of nonperceptual cognitive tasks extends to the visual cortex, while in the sighted it is restricted to supramodal association areas. We hypothesized that such activation results from the integration of different sectors of the visual cortex into typical task-dependent networks. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI in blind and sighted subjects using tasks assessing speech comprehension, incidental long-term memory and both verbal and nonverbal executive control, in addition to collecting resting-state data. All tasks activated the visual cortex in blind relative to sighted subjects, which enabled its segmentation according to task sensitivity. We then assessed the unique brain-scale functional connectivity of the segmented areas during resting state. Language-related seeds were preferentially connected to frontal and temporal language areas; the seed derived from the executive task was connected to the right dorsal frontoparietal executive network; and the memory-related seed was uniquely connected to mesial frontoparietal areas involved in episodic memory retrieval. Thus, using a broad set of language, executive, and memory tasks in the same subjects, combined with resting state connectivity, we demonstrate the selective integration of different patches of the visual cortex into brain-scale networks with distinct localization, lateralization, and functional roles.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although the central medial nucleus (CeM) of the thalamus is an essential part of the arousal system for sleep and anesthesia initiation, the precise mechanisms that regulate its activity are not well studied. We examined the role of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 isoform of T-type calcium channels (T-channels) in the excitability and rhythmic activity of CeM neurons during isoflurane (ISO)-induced anesthesia by using mouse genetics and selective pharmacology. Patch-clamp recordings taken from acute brain slices revealed that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in CeM are inhibited by prototypical volatile anesthetic ISO (250 and 500 μM) and selective T-channels blocker 3,5-dichloro-<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2). Both TTA-P2 and ISO attenuated tonic and burst firing modes, and hyperpolarized CeM neurons from wild type (WT) mice. These effects were greatly diminished or abolished in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Our ensuing in vivo local field potential (LFP) recordings from CeM indicated that the ability of TTA-P2 and anesthetic concentrations of ISO to promote δ oscillation was substantially weakened in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Furthermore, escalating ISO concentrations induced stronger burst-suppression LFP pattern in mutant than in WT mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time the importance of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in thalamocortical oscillations from the non-specific thalamic nuclei that underlie clinically important effects of ISO.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In Parkinson’s disease, the degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons is consistently associated with modified metabolic activity in the cerebellum. Here we examined the functional reorganization taking place in the cerebello–cerebral circuit in a murine model of Parkinson’s disease with 6-OHDA lesion of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Cerebellar optogenetic stimulations evoked similar movements in control and lesioned mice, suggesting a normal coupling of cerebellum to the motor effectors after the lesion. In freely moving animals, the firing rate in the primary motor cortex was decreased after the lesion, while cerebellar nuclei neurons showed an increased firing rate. This increase may result from reduced inhibitory Purkinje cells inputs, since a population of slow and irregular Purkinje cells was observed in the cerebellar hemispheres of lesioned animals. Moreover, cerebellar stimulations generated smaller electrocortical responses in the motor cortex of lesioned animals suggesting a weaker cerebello–cerebral coupling. Overall these results indicate the presence of functional changes in the cerebello–cerebral circuit, but their ability to correct cortical dysfunction may be limited due to functional uncoupling between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A consensus on the number of morphologically different types of pyramidal cells (PCs) in the neocortex has not yet been reached, despite over a century of anatomical studies, due to the lack of agreement on the subjective classifications of neuron types, which is based on expert analyses of neuronal morphologies. Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of PCs can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical PCs. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of PCs in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The mammalian cerebral cortex is divided into different areas according to their function and pattern of connections. Studies comparing primary visual (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of primates have demonstrated striking pyramidal neuron (PN) specialization not present in comparable areas of the mouse neocortex. To better understand PFC evolution and regional PN specialization, we studied the tree shrew, a species with a close phylogenetic relationship to primates. We defined the tree shrew PFC based on cytoarchitectonic borders, thalamic connectivity and characterized the morphology and electrophysiology of layer II/III PNs in V1 and PFC. Similar to primates, the PFC PNs in the tree shrew fire with a regular spiking pattern and have larger dendritic tree and spines than those in V1. However, V1 PNs showed strikingly large basal dendritic arbors with high spine density, firing at higher rates and in a more varied pattern than PFC PNs. Yet, unlike in the mouse and unreported in the primate, medial prefrontal PN are more easily recruited than either the dorsolateral or V1 neurons. This specialization of PN morphology and physiology is likely to be a significant factor in the evolution of cortex, contributing to differences in the computational capacities of individual cortical areas.</span>

The multifaceted functions of the brain are borne through seemingly infinite spatiotemporal interactions between its resident neural elements. Using a combinatorial approach, Schuman and colleagues (J. Neurosci. 2018;39:125–139) recently identify four layer 1 cortical interneuron subtypes, including a hitherto uncharacterized neuron they term the ‘canopy’ cell. Properties unique to each of the subtypes likely endow them with distinct roles in top-down processing.

<p>by Itay Katzir, Murat Cokol, Bree B. Aldridge, Uri Alon</p>

Drug combinations are a promising approach to achieve high efficacy at low doses and to overcome resistance. Drug combinations are especially useful when drugs cannot achieve effectiveness at tolerable doses, as occurs in cancer and tuberculosis (TB). However, discovery of effective drug combinations faces the challenge of combinatorial explosion, in which the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of drugs and doses. A recent advance, called the dose model, uses a mathematical formula to overcome combinatorial explosion by reducing the problem to a feasible quadratic one: using data on drug pairs at a few doses, the dose model accurately predicts the effect of combinations of three and four drugs at all doses. The dose model has not yet been tested on higher-order combinations beyond four drugs. To address this, we measured the effect of combinations of up to ten antibiotics on <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> growth, and of up to five tuberculosis (TB) drugs on the growth of <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>. We find that the dose model accurately predicts the effect of these higher-order combinations, including cases of strong synergy and antagonism. This study supports the view that the interactions between drug pairs carries key information that largely determines higher-order interactions. Therefore, systematic study of pairwise drug interactions is a compelling strategy to prioritize drug regimens in high-dimensional spaces.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HjJA1n5znGo" width="1" />

<p>by Sulav Duwal, Laura Dickinson, Saye Khoo, Max von Kleist</p>

Currently, there is no effective vaccine to halt HIV transmission. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the drug combination Truvada can substantially decrease HIV transmission in individuals at risk. Despite its benefits, Truvada-based PrEP is expensive and needs to be taken once-daily, which often leads to inadequate adherence and incomplete protection. These deficits may be overcome by next-generation PrEP regimen, including currently investigated long-acting formulations, or patent-expired drugs. However, poor translatability of animal- and <i>ex vivo</i>/<i>in vitro</i> experiments, and the necessity to conduct long-term (several years) human trials involving considerable sample sizes (N&gt;1000 individuals) are major obstacles to rationalize drug-candidate selection. We developed a prophylaxis modelling tool that mechanistically considers the mode-of-action of all available drugs. We used the tool to screen antivirals for their prophylactic utility and identify lower bound effective concentrations that can guide dose selection in PrEP trials. While <i>in vitro</i> measurable drug potency usually guides PrEP trial design, we found that it may over-predict PrEP potency for all drug classes except reverse transcriptase inhibitors. While most drugs displayed graded concentration-prophylaxis profiles, protease inhibitors tended to switch between none- and complete protection. While several treatment-approved drugs could be ruled out as PrEP candidates based on lack-of-prophylactic efficacy, darunavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine and rilpivirine could more potently prevent infection than existing PrEP regimen (Truvada). Notably, some drugs from this candidate set are patent-expired and currently neglected for PrEP repurposing. A next step is to further trim this candidate set by ruling out compounds with ominous safety profiles, to assess different administration schemes in silico and to test the remaining candidates in human trials.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WUqKyesJwDU" width="1" />

Gut microbiota and human relationships are strictly connected to each other. What we eat reflects our body-mind connection and synchronizes with people around us. However, how this impacts on gut microbiota and, conversely, how gut bacteria influence our dietary behaviors has not been explored yet. To quantify the complex dynamics of this interplay between gut and human behaviors we explore the “gut-human behavior axis” and its evolutionary dynamics in a real-world scenario represented by the social multiplex network. We consider a dual type of similarity, homophily and gut similarity, other than psychological and unconscious biases. We analyze the dynamics of social and gut microbial communities, quantifying the impact of human behaviors on diets and gut microbial composition and, backwards, through a control mechanism. Meal timing mechanisms and “chrono-nutrition” play a crucial role in feeding behaviors, along with the quality and quantity of food intake. Considering a population of shift workers, we explore the dynamic interplay between their eating behaviors and gut microbiota, modeling the social dynamics of chrono-nutrition in a multiplex network. Our findings allow us to quantify the relation between human behaviors and gut microbiota through the methodological introduction of gut metabolic modeling and statistical estimators, able to capture their dynamic interplay. Moreover, we find that the timing of gut microbial communities is slower than social interactions and shift-working, and the impact of shift-working on the dynamics of chrono-nutrition is a fluctuation of strategies with a major propensity for defection (e.g. high-fat meals). A deeper understanding of the relation between gut microbiota and the dietary behavioral patterns, by embedding also the related social aspects, allows improving the overall knowledge about metabolic models and their implications for human health, opening the possibility to design promising social therapeutic dietary interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JTUsq9HYq3M" width="1" />

<p>by Jordan J. Clark, Mark L. Benson, Richard D. Smith, Heather A. Carlson</p>

Understanding how ligand binding influences protein flexibility is important, especially in rational drug design. Protein flexibility upon ligand binding is analyzed herein using 305 proteins with 2369 crystal structures with ligands (holo) and 1679 without (apo). Each protein has at least two apo and two holo structures for analysis. The inherent variation in structures with and without ligands is first established as a baseline. This baseline is then compared to the change in conformation in going from the apo to holo states to probe induced flexibility. The inherent backbone flexibility across the apo structures is roughly the same as the variation across holo structures. The induced backbone flexibility across apo-holo pairs is larger than that of the apo or holo states, but the increase in RMSD is less than 0.5Å. Analysis of χ<sub>1</sub> angles revealed a distinctly different pattern with significant influences seen for ligand binding on side-chain conformations in the binding site. Within the apo and holo states themselves, the variation of the χ<sub>1</sub> angles is the same. However, the data combining both apo and holo states show significant displacements. Upon ligand binding, χ<sub>1</sub> angles are frequently pushed to new orientations outside the range seen in the apo states. Influences on binding site variation could not be easily attributed to features such as ligand size or x-ray structure resolution. By combining these findings, we find that most binding site flexibility is compatible with the common practice in flexible docking, where backbones are kept rigid and side chains are allowed some degree of flexibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gUvhEfpxopQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0393-18.2019v1?rss=1">Modes of accessing bicarbonate for the regulation of membrane guanylate cyclase (ROS-GC) in retinal rods and cones</a></h4>

ABSTRACT<p>The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, <i>Ambystoma tigrinum</i>, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl<sup>-</sup> dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> or from exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO<sub>2</sub> was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bicarbonate accentuates the role of the membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, in phototransduction. In current research, bicarbonate rather than gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> is proven to be the ligand for ROS-GCs. Bicarbonate may be preferred because its movements are subject to tighter control. In rods, membrane impermeant bicarbonate gains entry at the synaptic zone and is cleared by Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent exchange at the outer segment. A novel insight is that while cones are similar, they also obtain bicarbonate at their outer segments and express an enzyme for making their own bicarbonate from endogenous together with exogenous CO<sub>2</sub>. Multiple pathways for access in cones indicate a need for greater uptake of bicarbonate and better buffering of its intracellular concentration than in rods.</p>

Abstract<p>The inter-regional connectivity of sensory structures in the brain allows for the modulation of sensory processing in manners important for perception. In the olfactory system, odor representations in the olfactory bulb (OB) are modulated by feedback centrifugal innervation from several olfactory cortices, including the piriform cortex and anterior olfactory nucleus. Previous studies reported that an additional olfactory cortex, the olfactory tubercle, also centrifugally innervates the OB and may even shape the activity of OB output neurons. In an attempt to identify the cell-types of this centrifugal innervation, we performed retrograde tracing experiments in mice utilizing three unique strategies, including retrobeads, retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving a fluorescent reporter, and retrograde AAV driving Cre-expression in the Ai9 floxed transgenic reporter line. Our results replicated the standing literature and uncovered robustly labeled neurons in the ipsilateral piriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, and numerous other structures known to innervate the OB. Surprisingly, consistent throughout all of our approaches, no labeled soma were observed in the olfactory tubercle. These findings indicate that the olfactory tubercle is unique among other olfactory cortices in that it does not innervate the OB, which refines our understanding of the centrifugal modulation of the OB.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The perception of our environment relies upon the distribution of sensory information throughout brain regions. This is true in the olfactory system wherein projections between olfactory centers, including feedback centrifugal input to the olfactory bulb, provide the basis for olfactory perception. Here, we show that one olfactory cortical structure, the olfactory tubercle, is unique among olfactory cortices in that it lacks feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. This ‘negative result’ is important in that it refines current models for the circuitry of our olfactory system and challenges previous literature reporting such a pathway in fact exists.</p>

<p>Alcohol abuse leads to aberrant forms of emotionally salient memory, i.e., limbic memory, that promote escalated alcohol consumption and relapse. Accordingly, activity-dependent structural abnormalities are likely to contribute to synaptic dysfunctions that occur from suddenly ceasing chronic alcohol consumption. Here we show that alcohol-dependent male rats fail to perform an emotional-learning task during abstinence but recover their functioning by l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin (l-DOPA) administration during early withdrawal. l-DOPA also reverses the selective loss of dendritic "long thin" spines observed in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell of alcohol-dependent rats during abstinence, as well as the reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and postsynaptic density-95-positive elements. Patch-clamp experiments in NAc slices reveal that both <i>in vivo</i> systemic l-DOPA administration and <i>in vitro</i> exposure to dopamine can restore the loss of long-term depression (LTD) formation, counteract the reduction in NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents and rectify the altered NMDAR/AMPAR ratio observed in alcohol-withdrawn rats. Further, <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis experiments show that blunted dopaminergic signaling is revived after l-DOPA treatment during early withdrawal. These results suggest a key role of an efficient dopamine signaling for maintaining, and restore, neural trophism, NMDA-dependent LTD, and ultimately optimal learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Blunted dopamine signaling and altered glutamate connectivity in the nucleus accumbens represent the neuroanatomical basis for the impairment in aversive limbic memory observed during withdrawal in alcohol dependence. Supplying l-DOPA during withdrawal re-establishes synaptic morphology and functional neuroadaptations, suggesting a complete recovery of nucleus accumbens glutamatergic synaptic plasticity when dopamine is revived. Importantly, restoring dopamine transmission allows those synapses to encode emotionally relevant information and rescue flexibility in the neuronal circuits that process limbic memory formation. Under these conditions, drugs capable of selectively boosting the dopaminergic function during the "fluid" and still responsive state of the early withdrawn maladaptive synapses may help in the treatment of alcohol addiction.</p>

<p>Breast cancer patients using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as an adjuvant therapy often report side effects, including hot flashes, mood changes, and cognitive impairment. Despite long-term use in humans, little is known about the effects of continuous AI administration on the brain and cognition. We used a primate model of human cognitive aging, the common marmoset, to examine the effects of a 4-week daily administration of the AI letrozole (20 μg, p.o.) on cognition, anxiety, thermoregulation, brain estrogen content, and hippocampal pyramidal cell physiology. Letrozole treatment was administered to both male and female marmosets and reduced peripheral levels of estradiol (E2), but unexpectedly increased E2 levels in the hippocampus. Spatial working memory and intrinsic excitability of hippocampal neurons were negatively affected by the treatment possibly due to increased hippocampal E2. While no changes in hypothalamic E2 were observed, thermoregulation was disrupted by letrozole in females only, indicating some impact on hypothalamic activity. These findings suggest adverse effects of AIs on the primate brain and call for new therapies that effectively prevent breast cancer recurrence while minimizing side effects that further compromise quality of life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used as an adjuvant therapy for estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer and are associated with side effects, including hot flashes, depression/anxiety, and memory deficits severe enough for many women to discontinue this life-saving treatment. AIs are also used by men, yet sex differences in the reported side effects have not been systematically studied. We show that AI-treated male and female marmosets exhibit behavioral changes consistent with these CNS symptoms, as well as elevated hippocampal estradiol and compromised hippocampal physiology. These findings illustrate the need for (1) a greater understanding of the precise mechanisms by which AIs impact brain function and (2) the development of new treatment approaches for breast cancer patients that minimize adverse effects on the brain.</p>

<p>Alpha-band (8–12 Hz) EEG activity has been linked to visual attention since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed over the hemisphere contralateral to a to-be-attended location, suggesting that alpha serves as a mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate that alpha also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity was recorded from a group of healthy male and female human subjects in two visual search experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed the N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient EEG response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of attention on visual targets. We found that the visual search targets triggered both an N2pc component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was greatest over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which we call "target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression" or TELAS). In Experiment 1, both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However, these two lateralized effects had different time courses and they responded differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism and also that TELAS and N2pc reflect a related but separable neural mechanism of visuospatial attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The very first EEG studies demonstrated that alpha-band (8–12 Hz) EEG oscillations are suppressed when people attend to visual information and more recent research has shown that cuing an individual to expect a target at a specific location produces lateralized suppression in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, lateralized alpha may serve as a preparatory mechanism. In the present study, we found that a similar lateralized alpha effect is triggered by the appearance of a visual target even though the location could not be anticipated, demonstrating that alpha also serves as an active mechanism of target processing. Moreover, we found that alpha lateralization can be dissociated from other lateralized measures of target selection, indicating that it reflects a distinct mechanism of attention.</p>

<p>Sleep loss is associated with increased obesity risk, as demonstrated by correlations between sleep duration and change in body mass index or body fat percentage. Whereas previous studies linked this weight gain to disturbed endocrine parameters after sleep deprivation or restriction, neuroimaging studies revealed upregulated neural processing of food rewards after sleep loss in reward-processing areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. To address this ongoing debate between hormonal versus hedonic factors underlying sleep-loss-associated weight gain, we rigorously tested the association between sleep deprivation and food cue processing using high-resolution fMRI and assessment of hormones. After taking blood samples from 32 lean, healthy, human male participants, they underwent fMRI while performing a neuroeconomic, value-based decision-making task with snack food and trinket rewards following a full night of habitual sleep and a night of sleep deprivation in a repeated-measures crossover design. We found that des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were increased after sleep deprivation compared with habitual sleep. Despite similar hunger ratings due to fasting in both conditions, participants were willing to spend more money on food items only after sleep deprivation. Furthermore, fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food-reward-specific upregulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala–hypothalamic coupling after a single night of sleep deprivation. Behavioral and fMRI results were not significantly correlated with changes in acyl, des-acyl, or total ghrelin concentrations. Our results suggest that increased food valuation after sleep loss might be due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epidemiological studies suggest an association between overweight and reduced nocturnal sleep, but the relative contributions of hedonic and hormonal factors to overeating after sleep loss are a matter of ongoing controversy. Here, we tested the association between sleep deprivation and food cue processing in a repeated-measures crossover design using fMRI. We found that willingness to pay increased for food items only after sleep deprivation. fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food-reward-specific upregulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala-hypothalamic coupling after a single night of sleep deprivation. However, there was no evidence for hormonal modulations of behavioral or fMRI findings. Our results suggest that increased food valuation after sleep loss is due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.</p>

<p>We consider the problem of predicting eye movement goals from local field
potentials (LFP) recorded through a multielectrode array in the macaque
prefrontal cortex. The monkey is tasked with performing memory-guided saccades
to one of eight targets during which LFP activity is recorded and used to train
a decoder. Previous reports have mainly relied on the spectral amplitude of the
LFPs as a feature in the decoding step to limited success, while neglecting the
phase without proper theoretical justification. This paper formulates the
problem of decoding eye movement intentions in a statistically optimal
framework and uses Gaussian sequence modeling and Pinsker's theorem to generate
minimax-optimal estimates of the LFP signals which are later used as features
in the decoding step. The approach is shown to act as a low-pass filter and
each LFP in the feature space is represented via its complex Fourier
coefficients after appropriate shrinking such that higher frequency components
are attenuated; this way, the phase information inherently present in the LFP
signal is naturally embedded into the feature space. The proposed complex
spectrum-based decoder achieves prediction accuracy of up to $94\%$ at
superficial electrode depths near the surface of the prefrontal cortex, which
marks a significant performance improvement over conventional power
spectrum-based decoders.

<p>We conduct a novel imaging genetics study of the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and genetic data
obtained from 112 subjects, where each subject is classified as either
cognitively normal (CN), as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or as
having Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) is fit to the
rs-fMRI time series in order to estimate a directed network representing
effective brain connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), a key
network commonly known to be active when the brain is at rest. These networks
are then related to genetic data and Alzheimer's disease in the first
genome-wide association study to use DCM as a neuroimaging phenotype.
</p>
<p>Our proposed pipeline is comprised of four sequential analyses linked
together with the objective of shedding light on the relationship between brain
connectivity and genetics in relation to disease. In the first stage, we
examine differences in effective brain connectivity across disease groups. In
the second analysis we relate the probability of disease to genetics and obtain
a set of priority single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially related to
disease. In the third analysis we investigate how effective brain connectivity
is related to the set of priority SNPs obtained in the second study. In the
fourth and final analysis we examine longitudinal data on changes with respect
to MCI and AD through a classifier in order to determine how well disease
progression can be predicted from the combination of effective brain
connectivity and genetic data. Our new pipeline for connectome genetics has
general applicability and its specific application to the ADNI study motivates
a number of future studies in this nascent area.

<p>A growing number of neuromorphic spiking neural network processors that
emulate biological neural networks create an imminent need for methods and
tools to enable them to solve real-world signal processing problems. Like
conventional neural networks, spiking neural networks are particularly
efficient when trained on real, domain specific data. However, their training
requires overcoming a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical
nature. This tutorial elucidates step-by-step the problems typically
encountered when training spiking neural networks, and guides the reader
through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the
spiking setting. To that end, it gives an overview of existing approaches and
provides an introduction to surrogate gradient methods, specifically, as a
particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned
challenges.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>SLC13A3</i> encodes the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/dicarboxylate cotransporter 3, which imports inside the cell 4 to 6 carbon dicarboxylates as well as N‐acetylaspartate (NAA). SLC13A3 is mainly expressed in kidney, in astrocytes, and in the choroid plexus. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with acute, reversible (and recurrent in one) neurological deterioration during a febrile illness. Both patients exhibited a reversible leukoencephalopathy and a urinary excretion of α‐ketoglutarate (αKG) that was markedly increased and persisted over time. In one patient, increased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid NAA and dicarboxylates (including αKG) were observed. Extensive workup was unsuccessful, and a genetic cause was suspected.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Our teams were connected through GeneMatcher.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>WES analysis revealed variants in <i>SLC13A3</i>. A homozygous missense mutation (p.Ala254Asp) was found in the first patient. The second patient was heterozygous for another missense mutation (p.Gly548Ser) and an intronic mutation affecting splicing as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed in muscle tissue (c.1016 + 3A &gt; G). Mutations and segregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with wild‐type and mutant SLC13A3 indicated that the missense mutations caused a marked reduction in the capacity to transport αKG, succinate, and NAA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SLC13A3 deficiency causes acute and reversible leukoencephalopathy with marked accumulation of αKG. Urine organic acids (especially αKG and NAA) and <i>SLC13A3</i> mutations should be screened in patients presenting with unexplained reversible leukoencephalopathy, for which SLC13A3 deficiency is a novel differential diagnosis.</p>

Abstract<p>Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release was investigated in this study. Using in vivo microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested if the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The present study provides important information on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the exacerbating effects of E2 on addictive behavior by showing blockage of E2 receptors or mGlu5 reduces E2-induced potentiation of DA release in the rat striatum following by amphetamine injections. Our data suggest targeting E2 receptors or mGluRs could have treatment potentials for E2-related disorders in areas such as, but not limited to, drug addiction.</p>

Abstract
<p>The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR); therefore, S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded one to two weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The <i>in vitro</i> laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) revealed that Layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from Layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits.</p>

Abstract
<p>Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal hippocampal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.</p>

Abstract
<p>The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address whether the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre-positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking (UM) in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.</p>

Abstract
<p>Preclinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge, we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) of male and female rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during SA; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Transthyretin (TTR)‐related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in <i>TTR</i>. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR‐FAP Val30Met families.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at <i>ATXN1</i>, <i>ATXN2</i>, <i>ATXN3</i>, <i>ATXN7</i>, <i>TBP, ATN1</i>, <i>HTT</i>, <i>JPH3</i>, <i>AR</i>, and <i>DMPK</i>) was assessed by single and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family‐centered approach, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between family members.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>For <i>ATXN2</i>, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met, decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = −8.81 to −2.19, <i>p</i> = 0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Length of normal repeats at <i>ATXN2</i> may modify AO in TTR‐FAP Val30Met and may function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of <i>ATXN2</i> in RNA metabolism and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow‐up of presymptomatic carriers. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251–258.</b></p>

<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐β (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer disease pathology. We previously showed that OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1 to 4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance. Ann Neurol 2018 <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:291–295.</b></p>

<p>Amyloid‐β transmission has been described in patients both with and without iatrogenic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; however, there is little information regarding the clinical impact of this acquired amyloid‐β pathology during life. Here, for the first time, we describe in detail the clinical and neuroimaging findings in 3 patients with early onset symptomatic amyloid‐β cerebral amyloid angiopathy following childhood exposure to cadaveric dura (by neurosurgical grafting in 2 patients and tumor embolization in a third). Our observations provide further in vivo evidence that cerebral amyloid angiopathy might be caused by transmission of amyloid‐β seeds (prions) present in cadaveric dura and have diagnostic relevance for younger patients presenting with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults (OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 Pittsburg compound B [PiB]<sup>+</sup>, age = 77.6 ± 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) and 19 PiB<sup>+</sup> patients with AD (age = 63.1 ± 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow‐up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and cross‐modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or <i>APOE</i>. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow‐up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid‐negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo tau‐PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Alexander Shakeel Bates, Jasper Janssens, Gregory SXE Jefferis, Stein Aerts</p><div><p>At around 150 000 neurons, the adult <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> central nervous system is one of the largest species, for which a complete cellular catalogue is imminent. While numerically much simpler than mammalian brains, its complexity is still difficult to parse without grouping neurons into consistent types, which can number 1–1000 cells per hemisphere. We review how neuroanatomical and gene expression data are being used to discover neuronal types at scale. The correlation among multiple co-varying neuronal properties, including lineage, gene expression, morphology, connectivity, response properties and shared behavioral significance is essential to the definition of neuronal cell type. Initial studies comparing morphological and transcriptomic definitions of neuronal type suggest that these are highly consistent, but there is much to do to match these approaches brain-wide. Matched single-cell transcriptomic and morphological data provide an effective reference point to integrate other data types, including connectomics data. This will significantly enhance our ability to make functional predictions from brain wiring diagrams as well facilitating molecular genetic manipulation of neuronal types.</p></div>

<p>Modern neuroscience is currently limited in its capacity to perform long
term, wide-field measurements of neuron electromagnetics with nanoscale
resolution. Quantum microscopy using the nitrogen vacancy centre (NV) can
provide a potential solution to this problem with electric and magnetic field
sensing at nano-scale resolution and good biocompatibility. However, the
performance of existing NV sensing technology does not allow for studies of
small mammalian neurons yet. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem by engineering NV quantum sensors in diamond nanopillar arrays. The
pillars improve light collection efficiency by guiding excitation/emission
light, which improves sensitivity. More importantly, they also improve the size
of the signal at the NV by removing screening charges as well as coordinating
the neuron growth to the tips of the pillars where the NV is located. Here, we
provide a growth study to demonstrate coordinated neuron growth as well as the
first simulation of nano-scopic neuron electric and magnetic fields to assess
the enhancement provided by the nanopillar geometry.

<p>Ablation studies have been widely used in the field of neuroscience to tackle
complex biological systems such as the extensively studied Drosophila central
nervous system, the vertebrate brain and more interestingly and most
delicately, the human brain. In the past, these kinds of studies were utilized
to uncover structure and organization in the brain, i.e. a mapping of features
inherent to external stimuli onto different areas of the neocortex. considering
the growth in size and complexity of state-of-the-art artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and the corresponding growth in complexity of the tasks that
are tackled by these networks, the question arises whether ablation studies may
be used to investigate these networks for a similar organization of their inner
representations. In this paper, we address this question and performed two
ablation studies in two fundamentally different ANNs to investigate their inner
representations of two well-known benchmark datasets from the computer vision
domain. We found that features distinct to the local and global structure of
the data are selectively represented in specific parts of the network.
Furthermore, some of these representations are redundant, awarding the network
a certain robustness to structural damages. We further determined the
importance of specific parts of the network for the classification task solely
based on the weight structure of single units. Finally, we examined the ability
of damaged networks to recover from the consequences of ablations by means of
recovery training. We argue that ablations studies are a feasible method to
investigate knowledge representations in ANNs and are especially helpful to
examine a networks robustness to structural damages, a feature of ANNs that
will become increasingly important for future safety-critical applications.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Jeremy S Dittman</p><div><p>Nervous systems are built on synaptic connections, and our understanding of these complex compartments has deepened over the past quarter century as the diverse fields of genetics, molecular biology, physiology, and biochemistry each made significant in-roads into synaptic function. On the presynaptic side, an evolutionarily conserved core fusion apparatus constructed from a handful of proteins has emerged, with Unc13 serving as a hub that coordinates nearly every aspect of synaptic transmission. This review briefly highlights recent studies on diverse aspects of Unc13 function including roles in SNARE assembly and quality control, release site building, calcium channel proximity, and short-term synaptic plasticity.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Elizabeth A Williams, Gáspár Jékely</p><div><p>The marine annelid <em>Platynereis dumerilii</em> is an invertebrate laboratory model for developmental biology and neuroscience. Its larval stages are small and transparent, enabling whole-body analyses of cell-type diversity and neuronal circuits. Here, we review the diversity of neuronal cell types in <em>Platynereis</em>. A variety of approaches have been used to identify cell types in <em>Platynereis</em> including whole-body gene expression atlases, single-cell RNA-seq and whole-body connectomics through serial EM reconstruction. The function of several cell types and neuronal circuits has also been analysed with experimental approaches. <em>Platynereis</em> has aspects of biology and cell types that are absent from the major invertebrate model organisms (<em>C. elegans</em> and <em>Drosophila</em>) including ciliary locomotion, noradrenergic neurons and ciliary photoreceptor cells.</p></div>

Conflicting reports about whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in humans raise questions about its significance for human health and the relevance of animal models. Drawing upon published data, I review species’ neurogenesis rates across the lifespan and propose that accelerated neurodevelopmental timing is consistent with lower rates of neurogenesis in adult primates and humans. Nonetheless, protracted neurogenesis may produce populations of neurons that retain plastic properties for long intervals, and have distinct functions depending on when in the lifespan they were born.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Daniel J Miller, Aparna Bhaduri, Nenad Sestan, Arnold Kriegstein</p><div><p>The cerebral cortex is the hallmark of the mammalian nervous system, and its large size and cellular diversity in humans support our most sophisticated cognitive abilities. Although the basic cellular organization of the cortex is conserved across mammals, cells have diversified during evolution. An increasingly integrated taxonomy of cell types, especially with the advent of single-cell transcriptomic data, has revealed an unprecedented variety of human cortical cell subtypes. Here, we broadly review the cellular composition and diversity of the mammalian brain, and how progenitor pools generate cell subtypes during development. We then discuss human cortical cells that are distinct from rodent cells, as well as the challenges and advantages of using model systems to study human cell types in health and disease.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Laurie D Cohen, Noam E Ziv</p><div><p>Neuronal proteostasis is uniquely challenged by the extraordinary architecture of neurons, the vast number of synapses they form, and the need to precisely preserve function at individual synapses. Quantitative information on protein lifetimes can provide clues as to how these challenges are met. Advances in proteomics and mass spectrometry, which now enable comprehensive lifetime estimations for thousands of proteins, suggest that neuronal and synaptic protein lifetimes are unusually long, with half-lives typically ranging from days to weeks, even months and beyond for certain protein families. Half-lives <em>in vivo</em> are several-fold longer than those in cell culture, tend to cluster for proteins belonging to multimolecular complexes, are affected by developmental stage, and possibly by environmental conditions and activity levels.</p></div>

Microglia provide immune surveillance of the CNS. They display diverse behaviors, including nondirectional and directed motility of their processes, phagocytosis of targets such as dying neurons or superfluous synapses, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines. Many of these functions are mediated by ion channels and cell surface receptors, the expression of which varies with the many morphological and functional states that microglial cells can adopt. Recent progress in understanding microglial function has been facilitated by applying classical cell physiological techniques in situ, such as patch-clamping and live imaging, and cell-specific transcriptomic analyses.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Differences in brain networks and underlying white matter abnormalities have been suggested to underlie symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, robustly characterizing microstructural white matter differences has been challenging. In the present study, we applied an analytic technique that calculates structural metrics specific to differently-oriented fiber bundles within a voxel, termed “fixels”. Fixel-based analyses were used to compare diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 individuals with ASD (mean age = 16.8 years) and 27 typically developing age-matched controls (mean age = 16.9 years). Group comparisons of fiber density (FD) and bundle morphology were run on a fixel-wise, tract-wise, and global white matter (GWM) basis. We found that individuals with ASD had reduced FD, suggestive of decreased axonal count, in several major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, right arcuate fasciculus, and right uncinate fasciculus, as well as a GWM reduction. Secondary analyses assessed associations with social impairment in participants with ASD, and showed that lower FD in the splenium of the CC was associated with greater social impairment. Our findings suggest that reduced FD could be the primary microstructural white matter abnormality in ASD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Optic nerve (ON) injury is an established model of axonal injury which results in retrograde degeneration and death of retinal ganglion cells as well anterograde loss of transmission and Wallerian degeneration of the injured axons. While the local impact of ON crush has been extensively documented we know comparatively little about the functional changes that occur in higher visual structures such as primary visual cortex (V1). We explored the extent of adult cortical plasticity using ON crush in aged mice. V1 function of the contralateral hemisphere was assessed longitudinally by intrinsic signal imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging before and after ON crush. Functional imaging demonstrated an immediate shift in V1 ocular dominance towards the ipsilateral, intact eye, due to the expected almost complete loss of responses to contralateral eye stimulation. Surprisingly, within 2 weeks we observed a delayed increase in ipsilateral eye responses. Additionally, spontaneous activity in V1 was reduced, similar to the lesion projection zone after retinal lesions. The observed changes in V1 activity indicate that severe ON injury in adulthood evokes cortical plasticity not only cross-modally but also within the visual cortex; this plasticity may be best compared with that seen after retinal lesions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primate visual system contains myriad feedback projections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas, an architecture that has been implicated in the top-down modulation of early visual areas during working memory and attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that these feedback projections also modulate early visual cortical activity during the planning of visually guided actions. We show, across three separate human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving object-directed movements, that information related to the motor effector to be used (i.e., limb, eye) and action goal to be performed (i.e., grasp, reach) can be selectively decoded—prior to movement—from the retinotopic representation of the target object(s) in early visual cortex. We also find that during the planning of sequential actions involving objects in two different spatial locations, that motor-related information can be decoded from both locations in retinotopic cortex. Together, these findings indicate that movement planning selectively modulates early visual cortical activity patterns in an effector-specific, target-centric, and task-dependent manner. These findings offer a neural account of how motor-relevant target features are enhanced during action planning and suggest a possible role for early visual cortex in instituting a sensorimotor estimate of the visual consequences of movement.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (<span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span>) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. However, rs3918242's effects on <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression were not replicable in cell lines or brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 genotype is related not to <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression, but rather to expression of <span style="font-style: italic;">SLC12A5</span>, a nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 298), functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 554), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 190). We found rs3918242 was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the relationship of <span style="font-style: italic;">SLC12A5</span> with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disease.</span>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Andrew C Halley, Leah Krubitzer</p><div><p>A central question in comparative neurobiology concerns how evolution has produced brains with expanded neocortices, composed of more areas with unique connectivity and functional properties. Some mammalian lineages, such as primates, exhibit exceptionally large cortices relative to the amount of sensory inputs from the dorsal thalamus, and this expansion is associated with a larger number of distinct cortical areas, composing a larger proportion of the cortical sheet. We propose a link between the organization of the neocortex and its expansion relative to the size of the dorsal thalamus, based on a combination of work in comparative neuroanatomy and experimental research.</p></div>

In the inner ear, the deflection of hair bundles, the sensory organelles of hair cells, activates mechanically-gated channels (MGCs). Hair bundles monitor orientation of the head, its angular and linear acceleration, and detect sound. Force applied to MGCs is shaped by intrinsic hair-bundle properties, by the mechanical load on the bundle, and by the filter imparted by the environment of the hair bundle. Channel gating and adaptation, the ability of the bundle to reset its operating point, contribute to hair-bundle mechanics.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Fabian Rentzsch, Celina Juliano, Brigitte Galliot</p><div><p>Cnidarians shared a common ancestor with bilaterians more than 600 million years ago. This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.</p></div>
