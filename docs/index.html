              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The 5:2 diet does not increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis or enhance spatial memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                New neurones are generated throughout life in the mammalian brain in a process known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Since this phenomenon grants a high degree of neuroplasticity influencing learning and memory and mood related behaviour, identifying factors that regulate AHN may be important for ameliorating age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Calorie restriction (CR), in the absence of malnutrition, has been shown to enhance AHN and improve hippocampal-dependent memory, mediated by the stomach hormone, ghrelin. Intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary strategy offering more flexibility than conventional CR, also promotes aspects of AHN. The 5:2 diet is a popular form of IF linked to a range of health benefits, however its effects on AHN and spatial memory are not well characterised. We hypothesised that the 5:2 diet would enhance AHN in a ghrelin-dependent manner. To assess this, we used immunohistochemistry to quantify new adult-born neurones and new neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampal DG of adolescent and adult wild-type and mice lacking the ghrelin receptor following six weeks on a 5:2 diet. We report an age-related decline in neurogenic processes and identify a novel role for ghrelin-receptor in regulating the formation of new adult born NSCs in an age-dependent manner. However, the 5:2 diet did not affect new neurone or NSC formation in the DG. Consistent with this finding the 5:2 diet did not alter performance on a spatial learning and memory task. These data suggest that the 5:2 diet used in this study does not increase AHN or improve associated spatial memory function.

	<p>Background: Parasellar chondrosarcomas are extremely rare. This study describes the characteristics of parasellar chondrosarcoma and analyzes the risk factors and prognosis based on the resection degree. Methods: Fifteen patients with pathologically diagnosed parasellar chondrosarcoma were retrospectively analyzed for the clinical data, surgical methods, and prognosis to identify relationships between the surgical resection degree, tumor recurrence, and imaging characteristics. Results: Twelve patients had eye dysfunction and ptosis. Differentiation from other parasellar tumors by imaging is difficult. The preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score positively correlated with the tumor resection degree (p = 0.026) and negatively correlated with the maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.001). Tumor recurrence negatively correlated with the resection degree (p = 0.009). The postoperative KPS score positively correlated with the preoperative KPS score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and tumor resection degree (p = 0.026), and negatively correlated with the maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.016) and age (p = 0.047). An improved KPS score positively correlated with the tumor resection degree (p = 0.039). Patients who underwent total resection of the chondrosarcoma had longer progression-free survival than those who underwent partial resection (p = 0.0322). Conclusion: Parasellar chondrosarcomas are difficult to resect completely. Preoperative KPS score is an important factor for the degree of resection. KPS score, age, maximum tumor diameter, and resection degree may be important prognostic factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Surround Inhibition Mediates Pain Relief by Low Amplitude Spinal Cord Stimulation: Modeling and Measurement</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Low-frequency (&lt;200 Hz), subperception spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a novel modality demonstrating therapeutic efficacy for treating chronic neuropathic pain. When stimulation parameters were carefully titrated, patients experienced rapid onset (seconds&ndash;minutes) pain relief without paresthesia, but the mechanisms of action are unknown. Using an integrated computational model and in vivo measurements in urethane-anesthetized rats, we quantified how stimulation parameters (placement, pulse width, frequency, and amplitude) influenced dorsal column (DC) axon activation and neural responses in the dorsal horn (DH). Both modeled and recorded DC axons responded with irregular spiking patterns in response to low-amplitude SCS. Maximum inhibition of DH neurons occurred at ~80% of the predicted sensory threshold in both modeled and recorded neurons, and responses were strongly dependent on spatially targeting of stimulation, i.e., the complement of DC axons activated, and on stimulation parameters. Intrathecal administration of bicuculline shifted neural responses to low-amplitude stimulation in both the model and experiment, suggesting that analgesia is dependent on segmental GABAergic mechanisms. Our results support the hypothesis that low-frequency subperception SCS generates rapid analgesia by activating a small number of DC axons which inhibit DH neuron activity via surround inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Working Memory Recruits Two Functionally Distinct Alpha Rhythms in Posterior Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oscillatory activity in the human brain is dominated by posterior alpha oscillations (8&ndash;14 Hz), which have been shown to be functionally relevant in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Although posterior alpha oscillations are commonly considered a single oscillator anchored at an individual alpha frequency (~10 Hz), previous work suggests that individual alpha frequency reflects a spatial mixture of different brain rhythms. In this study, we assess whether independent component analysis (ICA) can disentangle functionally distinct posterior alpha rhythms in the context of visual short-term memory retention. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded in 33 subjects while performing a visual working memory task. Group analysis at sensor level suggested the existence of a single posterior alpha oscillator that increases in power and decreases in frequency during memory retention. Conversely, single-subject analysis of independent components revealed the existence of two dissociable alpha rhythms: one that increases in power during memory retention (Alpha1) and another one that decreases in power (Alpha2). Alpha1 and Alpha2 rhythms were differentially modulated by the presence of visual distractors (Alpha1 increased in power while Alpha2 decreased) and had an opposite relationship with accuracy (positive for Alpha1 and negative for Alpha2). In addition, Alpha1 rhythms showed a lower peak frequency, a narrower peak width, a greater relative peak amplitude and a more central source than Alpha2 rhythms. Together, our results demonstrate that modulations in posterior alpha oscillations during short-term memory retention reflect the dynamics of at least two distinct brain rhythms with different functions and spatiospectral characteristics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Simple and Efficient 3D-Printed Superfusion Chamber for Electrophysiological and Neuroimaging Recordings In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>In vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> experimentation in the central nervous system are effective approaches to study its functioning. Manipulations <I>in vitro</I> are characterized by easy experimental control and stable experimental conditions. However, transferring these advantages to <I>in vivo</I> research remains technically and ethically challenging, preventing many research teams from acquiring critical recordings in their animal models. In order to transfer the benefits of <I>in vitro</I> experimentation to <I>in vivo</I> experimentation, we developed a suite of 3D-printed tools (a superfusion chamber with an independent brain presser and animal stand). Using the immature rat barrel cortex as a model, we show that our set of tools (further "superfusion preparation") provides stable conditions for electrophysiological and neuroimaging recordings in the neonatal rat neocortex <I>in vivo</I>. Highly correlated intracellular and extracellular activity was recorded during spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, supporting the possibility of simultaneous long-lasting electrophysiological recordings from a single cortical column <I>in vivo</I>. The optical intrinsic signal of evoked cortical responses was also recorded from the skull-free neocortex, suggesting the effective combination of the superfusion preparation with neuroimaging approaches. Modulation of immature activity by epicortical application of pharmacological agents via superfusion equally supports the use of the superfused cortex preparation in pharmacological screening. In addition to high efficiency (in affordability, reliability, and ease of use <I>in vivo</I>), the 3D-printed set of tools developed should reduce animal use, supporting the 3Rs principle (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) of ethical use of animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HCN2 Ion Channels Drive Pain in Rodent Models of Migraine</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migraine is believed to be initiated by neuronal activity in the CNS, that triggers excitation of nociceptive trigeminal ganglion (TG) nerve fibers innervating the meninges and thus causes a unilateral throbbing headache. Drugs that precipitate or potentiate migraine are known to elevate intracellular levels of the cyclic nucleotides cAMP or cGMP, while anti-migraine treatments couple to signaling pathways that reduce cAMP or cGMP, suggesting an involvement of these cyclic nucleotides in migraine. Members of the HCN ion channel family are activated by direct binding of cAMP or cGMP, suggesting in turn that a member of this family may be a critical trigger of migraine. Here, we show that pharmacological block or targeted genetic deletion of HCN2 abolishes migraine-like pain in three rodent migraine models (in both sexes). Induction of migraine-like pain in these models triggered expression of the protein C-FOS, a marker of neuronal activity, in neurons of the trigeminocervical complex (TCC), where TG neurons terminate, and C-FOS expression was reversed by peripheral HCN2 inhibition. HCN2 block <I>in vivo</I> inhibited both evoked and spontaneous neuronal activity in nociceptive TG neurons. The NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) caused an increase in cGMP in the TG <I>in vivo</I>. Exposing isolated TG neurons to GTN caused a rightward shift in the voltage dependence of HCN currents and thus increased neuronal excitability. This work identifies HCN2 as a novel target for the development of migraine treatments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Migraine is believed to be initiated by localized excitability of neurons within the CNS, but the most disturbing symptom, the characteristic throbbing migraine headache pain, is widely agreed to be caused by activity in afferent pain-sensitive (nociceptive) nerve fibers of the trigeminal nerve. Using a variety of preclinical models of migraine, we identify the HCN2 ion channel as the molecular source of trigeminal hyperexcitability in migraine and we show that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of HCN2 can relieve migraine-like pain symptoms. The work highlights the HCN2 ion channel as a potential pharmacological target for the development of novel analgesics effective in migraine.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Morphological Determinants of Cell-to-Cell Variations in Action Potential Dynamics in Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Action potential (AP) shape is a critical electrophysiological parameter, in particular because it strongly modulates neurotransmitter release. As it greatly varies between neuronal types, AP shape is also used to distinguish neuronal populations. For instance, AP duration ranges from hundreds of microseconds in cerebellar granule cells to 2-3 ms in SNc dopaminergic (DA) neurons. While most of this variation across cell types seems to arise from differences in the voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels expressed, a few studies suggested that dendritic morphology also affects AP shape. AP duration also displays significant variability in a same neuronal type, although the determinants of these variations are poorly known. Using electrophysiological recordings, morphological reconstructions, and realistic Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley modeling, we investigated the relationships between dendritic morphology and AP shape in rat SNc DA neurons from both sexes. In this neuronal type where the axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), the duration of the somatic AP could be predicted from a linear combination of the ABD and non-ABDs' complexities. Dendrotomy experiments and simulation showed that these correlations arise from the causal influence of dendritic topology on AP duration, due in particular to a high density of sodium channels in the somatodendritic compartment. Surprisingly, computational modeling suggested that this effect arises from the influence of sodium currents on the decaying phase of the AP. Consistent with previous findings, these results demonstrate that dendritic morphology plays a major role in defining the electrophysiological properties of SNc DA neurons and their cell-to-cell variations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Action potential (AP) shape is a critical electrophysiological parameter, in particular because it strongly modulates neurotransmitter release. AP shape (e.g., duration) greatly varies between neuronal types but also within a same neuronal type. While differences in ion channel expression seem to explain most of AP shape variation across cell types, the determinants of cell-to-cell variations in a same neuronal type are mostly unknown. We used electrophysiological recordings, neuronal reconstruction, and modeling to show that, because of the presence of sodium channels in the somatodendritic compartment, a large part of cell-to-cell variations in somatic AP duration in substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons is explained by variations in dendritic topology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Nedd4 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Pathway Inhibits Robo1 Repulsion and Promotes Commissural Axon Guidance across the Midline</a></h4>

              
                <p>Commissural axons initially respond to attractive signals at the midline, but once they cross, they become sensitive to repulsive cues. In insects and mammals, negative regulation of the surface expression of Roundabout (Robo) receptors prevents premature response to Slit. We previously identified two mammalian Nedd4 interacting proteins, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2, that act analogously to <I>Drosophila</I> Commissureless (Comm) to recruit mammalian Robo1 to late endosomes. However, whether Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases are required for Ndfip-mediated Robo1 regulation and midline axon crossing <I>in vivo</I> is not known. Here, we show using <I>in vitro</I> biochemical techniques and genetic analysis using embryonic mice of either sex that Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 are specifically required for Robo1 regulation and spinal commissural axon guidance. Biochemical data indicate that Robo1, Ndfip and Nedd4 form a ternary protein complex that depends on the presence of Ndfip, and these interactions are required for Robo1 endosomal sorting, ubiquitylation and degradation. Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 are expressed in commissural neurons in the developing spinal cord, and conditional deletion of Nedd4-1 or Nedd4-2 results in dose-dependent defects in midline crossing. We propose that Nedd4 E3 Ubiquitin ligases and their adaptor proteins Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 constitute a vital intracellular trafficking pathway required to downregulate Robo1 and promote midline crossing of commissural axons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During the development of the nervous system, many neurons extend their axons across the midline to establish circuits that are important for sensory, motor and cognitive functions. In order to cross the midline, axon responses to midline-derived cues must be precisely regulated. Here, we characterize an important intracellular trafficking pathway that regulates the membrane expression of the conserved Roundabout (Robo) axon guidance receptor- the receptor for the midline repellant Slit. We show that Nedd4 E3 Ubiquitin ligases and their Ndfip adapter proteins inhibit premature responses to Slit by promoting Robo degradation in precrossing commissural neurons in the developing spinal cord.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Dynamics of Neural Responses in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including subadditive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low contrast. These phenomena are often studied independently. Here, we demonstrate these phenomena within the same experiment and model the underlying neural computations with a single computational model. We extracted time-varying responses from electrocorticographic recordings from patients presented with stimuli that varied in duration, interstimulus interval (ISI) and contrast. Aggregating data across patients from both sexes yielded 98 electrodes with robust visual responses, covering both earlier (V1&ndash;V3) and higher-order (V3a/b, LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of neural responses exhibit several nonlinear features. Peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and longer stimulus durations, the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs, and response latency decreases with increasing contrast. These features are accurately captured by a computational model composed of a small set of canonical neuronal operations, that is, linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and a delayed divisive normalization. We find that an increased normalization term captures both contrast- and adaptation-related response reductions, suggesting potentially shared underlying mechanisms. We additionally demonstrate both changes and invariance in temporal response dynamics between earlier and higher-order visual areas. Together, our results reveal the presence of a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics in the human visual cortex and demonstrate that a simple model captures these dynamics at millisecond resolution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory inputs and neural responses change continuously over time. It is especially challenging to understand a system that has both dynamic inputs and outputs. Here, we use a computational modeling approach that specifies computations to convert a time-varying input stimulus to a neural response time course, and we use this to predict neural activity measured in the human visual cortex. We show that this computational model predicts a wide variety of complex neural response shapes, which we induced experimentally by manipulating the duration, repetition, and contrast of visual stimuli. By comparing data and model predictions, we uncover systematic properties of temporal dynamics of neural signals, allowing us to better understand how the brain processes dynamic sensory information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Unusually Slow Spike Frequency Adaptation in Deep Cerebellar Nuclei Neurons Preserves Linear Transformations on the Subsecond Timescale</a></h4>

              
                <p>Purkinje cells (PCs) are spontaneously active neurons of the cerebellar cortex that inhibit glutamatergic projection neurons within the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) that provide the primary cerebellar output. Brief reductions of PC firing rapidly increase DCN neuron firing. However, prolonged reductions of PC inhibition, as seen in some disease states, certain types of transgenic mice, during optogenetic suppression of PC firing, and in acute slices of the cerebellum, do not lead to large, sustained increases in DCN firing. Here we test whether DCN neurons undergo spike frequency adaptation that could account for these properties. We perform current-clamp recordings at near physiological temperature in acute brain slices from mice of both sexes to examine how DCN neurons respond to prolonged depolarizations. DCN neuron adaptation is exceptionally slow and bidirectional. A depolarizing current step evokes large initial increases in firing that decay to ~20% of the initial increase within ~10 s. We find that spike frequency adaptation in DCN neurons is mediated by a novel mechanism that is independent of the most promising candidates, including calcium entry and Na<sup>+</sup>-activated potassium channels mediated by <I>Slo2.1</I> and <I>Slo2.2</I>. Slow adaptation allows DCN neurons to gradually and bidirectionally adapt to prolonged currents but to respond linearly to current injection on rapid timescales. This suggests that an important consequence of slow adaptation is that DCN neurons respond linearly to the rate of PC firing on rapid timescales but adapt to slow firing rate changes of PCs on long timescales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excitatory neurons in the cerebellar nuclei provide the primary output from the cerebellum. This study finds that these neurons exhibit very slow bidirectional spike frequency adaptation that has important implications for cerebellar function. This mechanism allows neurons in the cerebellar nuclei to adapt to long-lasting changes in synaptic drive while also remaining responsive to short-term changes in excitatory or inhibitory drive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attractor-like Dynamics in the Subicular Complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Distinct computations are performed at multiple brain regions during the encoding of spatial environments. Neural representations in the hippocampal, entorhinal, and head direction (HD) networks during spatial navigation have been clearly documented, while the representational properties of the subicular complex (SC) are relatively underexplored, although it has extensive anatomic connections with various brain regions involved in spatial information processing. We simultaneously recorded single units from different subregions of the SC in male rats while they ran clockwise on a centrally placed textured circular track (four different textures, each covering a quadrant), surrounded by six distal cues. The neural activity was monitored in standard sessions by maintaining the same configuration between the cues, while in cue manipulation sessions, the distal and local cues were either rotated in opposite directions to create a mismatch between them or the distal cues were removed. We report a highly coherent neural representation of the environment and a robust coupling between the HD cells and the spatial cells in the SC, strikingly different from previous reports of coupling between cells from co-recorded sites. Neural representations were (1) originally governed by the distal cues under local&ndash;distal cue-conflict conditions, (2) controlled by the local cues in the absence of distal cues, and (3) governed by the cues that are perceived to be stable. We propose that such attractor-like dynamics in the SC might play a critical role in the orientation of spatial representations, thus providing a "reference map" of the environment for further processing by other networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subicular complex (SC) receives major inputs from the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, and head direction (HD) information directly from the HD system. Using cue-conflict experiments, we studied the hierarchical representation of the local and distal cues in the SC to understand its role in the cognitive map, and report a highly coherent neural representation with robust coupling between the HD cells and the spatial cells in different subregions of the SC exhibiting attractor-like dynamics unaffected by the cue manipulations, strikingly different from previous reports of coupling between cells from co-recorded sites. This unique feature may allow the SC to function as a single computational unit during the representation of space, which may serve as a reference map of the environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Encoding of Emotional Valence and Intensity in the Monkey Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies have suggested that the primate amygdala plays an essential role in processing the emotional valence and intensity of visual stimuli, which is necessary for determining whether to approach or avoid a stimulus. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the evaluation of emotional value remain unknown. In the present study, we trained male macaque monkeys to perform an operant conditioning task in which fractal visual patterns were associated with three different amounts of air puff delivered to the cheek (negative) or liquid reward (positive). After confirming that the monkeys successfully differentiated the emotional valence and intensity of the visual stimuli, we analyzed neuronal responses to the stimuli in the amygdala. Most amygdala neurons conveyed information concerning the emotional valence and/or intensity of the visual stimuli, and the majority of those conveying information about emotional valence responded optimally to negative stimuli. Further, some amygdala neurons conveyed information related to both emotional valence and intensity, whereas a small portion conveyed information related to emotional intensity alone. These results indicate that the primate amygdala encodes both emotional valence and intensity, highlighting its important role in the avoidance of dangerous stimuli and animal survival.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Evaluating the emotional value of visual stimuli is essential for animal survival, especially in primates. Emotional value is estimated from the emotional valence and intensity of stimuli, and evidence indicates that the amygdala is likely to play a major role in processing these types of information. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to examine the responses of neurons in the monkey amygdala to visual stimuli that differ in emotional valence and intensity simultaneously. Our data suggest that the amygdala plays an important role in the evaluation of emotional stimuli and in the decision to escape negative and harmful stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Support for Contributions of Utility and Narrative Processing of Evidence in Juror Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Efforts to explain complex human decisions have focused on competing theories emphasizing utility and narrative mechanisms. These are difficult to distinguish using behavior alone. Both narrative and utility theories have been proposed to explain juror decisions, which are among the most consequential complex decisions made in a modern society. Here, we asked jury-eligible male and female subjects to rate the strength of a series of criminal cases while recording the resulting patterns of brain activation. We compared patterns of brain activation associated with evidence accumulation to patterns of brain activation derived from a large neuroimaging database to look for signatures of the cognitive processes associated with different models of juror decision-making. Evidence accumulation correlated with multiple narrative processes, including reading and recall. Of the cognitive processes traditionally viewed as components of utility, activation patterns associated with uncertainty, but not value, were more active with stronger evidence. Independent of utility and narrative, activations linked to reasoning and relational logic also correlated with increasing evidence. Hierarchical modeling of cognitive processes associated with evidence accumulation supported a more prominent role for narrative in weighing evidence in complex decisions. However, utility processes were also associated with evidence accumulation. These complementary findings support an emerging view that integrates utility and narrative processes in complex decisions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The last decade has seen a sharply increased interest in narrative as a central cognitive process in human decision-making and as an important factor in the evolution of human societies. However, the roles of narrative versus utility models of decision-making remain hotly debated. While available models frequently produce similar behavioral predictions, they rely on different cognitive processes and so their roles can be separated using the right neural tests. Here, we use brain imaging during mock juror decisions to show that cognitive processes associated with narrative, and to a lesser extent utility, were engaged while subjects evaluated evidence. These results are consistent with interactions between narrative and utility processes during complex decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Existence of the StartReact Effect Implies Reticulospinal, Not Corticospinal, Inputs Dominate Drive to Motoneurons during Voluntary Movement</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reaction time is accelerated if a loud (startling) sound accompanies the cue&mdash;the "StartReact" effect. Animal studies revealed a reticulospinal substrate for the startle reflex; StartReact may similarly involve the reticulospinal tract, but this is currently uncertain. Here we trained two female macaque monkeys to perform elbow flexion/extension movements following a visual cue. The cue was sometimes accompanied by a loud sound, generating a StartReact effect in electromyogram response latency, as seen in humans. Extracellular recordings were made from antidromically identified corticospinal neurons in primary motor cortex (M1), from the reticular formation (RF), and from the spinal cord (SC; C5&ndash;C8 segments). After loud sound, task-related activity was suppressed in M1 (latency, 70&ndash;200 ms after cue), but was initially enhanced (70&ndash;80 ms) and then suppressed (140&ndash;210 ms) in RF. SC activity was unchanged. In a computational model, we simulated a motoneuron pool receiving input from different proportions of the average M1 and RF activity recorded experimentally. Motoneuron firing generated simulated electromyogram, allowing reaction time measurements. Only if &ge;60% of motoneuron drive came from RF (&le;40% from M1) did loud sound shorten reaction time. The extent of shortening increased as more drive came from RF. If RF provided &lt;60% of drive, loud sound lengthened the reaction time&mdash;the opposite of experimental findings. The majority of the drive for voluntary movements is thus likely to originate from the brainstem, not the cortex; changes in the magnitude of the StartReact effect can measure a shift in the relative importance of descending systems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our results reveal that a loud sound has opposite effects on neural spiking in corticospinal cells from primary motor cortex, and in the reticular formation. We show that this fortuitously allows changes in reaction time produced by a loud sound to be used to assess the relative importance of reticulospinal versus corticospinal control of movement, validating previous noninvasive measurements in humans. Our findings suggest that the majority of the descending drive to motoneurons producing voluntary movement in primates comes from the reticulospinal tract, not the corticospinal tract.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Effort Reinforces Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans routinely learn the value of actions by updating their expectations based on past outcomes &ndash; a process driven by reward prediction errors (RPEs). Importantly, however, implementing a course of action also requires the investment of effort. Recent work has revealed a close link between the neural signals involved in effort exertion and those underpinning reward-based learning, but the behavioral relationship between these two functions remains unclear. Across two experiments, we tested healthy male and female human participants (<I>N</I> = 140) on a reinforcement learning task in which they registered their responses by applying physical force to a pair of hand-held dynamometers. We examined the effect of effort on learning by systematically manipulating the amount of force required to register a response during the task. Our key finding, replicated across both experiments, was that greater effort increased learning rates following positive outcomes and decreased them following negative outcomes, which corresponded to a differential effect of effort in boosting positive RPEs and blunting negative RPEs. Interestingly, this effect was most pronounced in individuals who were more averse to effort in the first place, raising the possibility that the investment of effort may have an adaptive effect on learning in those less motivated to exert it. By integrating principles of reinforcement learning with neuroeconomic approaches to value-based decision-making, we show that the very act of investing effort modulates one's capacity to learn, and demonstrate how these functions may operate within a common computational framework.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent work suggests that learning and effort may share common neurophysiological substrates. This raises the possibility that the very act of investing effort influences learning. Here, we tested whether effort modulates teaching signals in a reinforcement learning paradigm. Our results showed that effort resulted in more efficient learning from positive outcomes and less efficient learning from negative outcomes. Interestingly, this effect varied across individuals, and was more pronounced in those who were more averse to investing effort in the first place. These data highlight the importance of motivational factors in a common framework of reward-based learning, which integrates the computational principles of reinforcement learning with those of value-based decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Uncoupling Protein-1 Modulates Anxiety-Like Behavior in a Temperature-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>A strong bidirectional link between metabolic and psychiatric disorders exists; yet, the molecular basis underlying this interaction remains unresolved. Here we explored the role of the brown adipose tissue (BAT) as modulatory interface, focusing on the involvement of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), a key metabolic regulator highly expressed in BAT, in the control of emotional behavior. Male and female constitutive UCP-1 knock-out (KO) mice were used to investigate the consequences of UCP-1 deficiency on anxiety-related and depression-related behaviors under mild thermogenic (23&deg;C) and thermoneutral (29&deg;C) conditions. UCP-1 KO mice displayed a selective enhancement of anxiety-related behavior exclusively under thermogenic conditions, but not at thermoneutrality. Neural and endocrine stress mediators were not affected in UCP-1 KO mice, which showed an activation of the integrated stress response alongside enhanced fibroblast-growth factor-21 (FGF-21) levels. However, viral-mediated overexpression of FGF-21 did not phenocopy the behavioral alterations of UCP-1 KO mice and blocking FGF-21 activity did not rescue the anxiogenic phenotype of UCP-1 KO mice. No effects of surgical removal of the intrascapular BAT on anxiety-like behavior or FGF-21 levels were observed in either UCP-1 KO or WT mice. We provide evidence for a novel role of UCP-1 in the regulation of emotions that manifests as inhibitory constraint on anxiety-related behavior, exclusively under thermogenic conditions. We propose this function of UCP-1 to be independent of its activity in the BAT and likely mediated through a central role of UCP-1 in brain regions with converging involvement in energy and emotional control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this first description of a temperature-dependent phenotype of emotional behavior, we propose uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), the key component of the thermogenic function of the brown adipose tissue, as molecular break controlling anxiety-related behavior in mice. We suggest the involvement of UCP-1 in fear regulation to be mediated through its expression in brain regions with converging roles in energy and emotional control. These data are important and relevant in light of the largely unexplored bidirectional link between metabolic and psychiatric disorders, which has the potential for providing insight into novel therapeutic strategies for the management of both conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CSF1R-Mediated Myeloid Cell Depletion Prolongs Lifespan But Aggravates Distinct Motor Symptoms in a Model of Multiple System Atrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the CNS-resident macrophages and member of the myeloid lineage, microglia fulfill manifold functions important for brain development and homeostasis. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, they have been implicated in degenerative and regenerative processes. The discovery of distinct activation patterns, including increased phagocytosis, indicated a damaging role of myeloid cells in multiple system atrophy (MSA), a devastating, rapidly progressing atypical parkinsonian disorder. Here, we analyzed the gene expression profile of microglia in a mouse model of MSA (<I>MBP29-h</I>&alpha;<I>-syn</I>) and identified a disease-associated expression profile and upregulation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 (<I>Csf1</I>). Thus, we hypothesized that CSF1 receptor-mediated depletion of myeloid cells using PLX5622 modifies the disease progression and neuropathological phenotype in this mouse model. Intriguingly, sex-balanced analysis of myeloid cell depletion in <I>MBP29-h</I>&alpha;<I>-syn</I> mice revealed a two-faced outcome comprising an improved survival rate accompanied by a delayed onset of neurological symptoms in contrast to severely impaired motor functions. Furthermore, PLX5622 reversed gene expression profiles related to myeloid cell activation but reduced gene expression associated with transsynaptic signaling and signal release. While transcriptional changes were accompanied by a reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, striatal neuritic density was increased upon myeloid cell depletion in <I>MBP29-h</I>&alpha;<I>-syn</I> mice. Together, our findings provide insight into the complex, two-faced role of myeloid cells in the context of MSA emphasizing the importance to carefully balance the beneficial and adverse effects of CSF1R inhibition in different models of neurodegenerative disorders before its clinical translation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myeloid cells have been implicated as detrimental in the disease pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy. However, long-term CSF1R-dependent depletion of these cells in a mouse model of multiple system atrophy demonstrates a two-faced effect involving an improved survival associated with a delayed onset of disease and reduced inflammation which was contrasted by severely impaired motor functions, synaptic signaling, and neuronal circuitries. Thus, this study unraveled a complex role of myeloid cells in multiple system atrophy, which indicates important functions beyond the previously described disease-associated, destructive phenotype and emphasized the need of further investigation to carefully and individually fine-tune immunologic processes in different neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from budu, a West Sumatra fish fermentation product, and their ability to produce exopolysaccharides [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Probiotics are instrumental in maintaining the equilibrium of the gut microbiota and improving the health of the human body. This study examined the presence and physiological features, including the ability to produce exopolysaccharides, of lactic acid bacteria from fermented Tenggiri (Scomberomorus guttatus) and Talang (Chorinemus spp.) fish, also known as budu fish. Methods: Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from budu fish. These bacteria were characterized to determine tolerance to gastric pH values, growth curve, inhibitory ability against pathogenic bacteria, and ability to produce exopolysaccharides and to perform a molecular identification. Results: Twenty-nine lactic acid bacteria isolates from budu fish were determined to be of the Pediococcus species. Assessment of the physiological characteristics showed that Pediococcus sp. had a high acidifying activity and could grow at a pH between 2 and 11; the pH of the supernatant after 36 hours of incubation was 4.49. In terms of inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria, Pediococcus sp. demonstrated an inhibitory diameter of 20.5 mm against Escherichia coli, 23.0 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, and 21.0 mm against Salmonella thypi. The Pediococcus sp. strain produced exopolysaccharides ranging from 870 to 1910 mg/l and had 100% similarity with Pediococcus pentosaceus strain 4942. Conclusions: This study confirmed the presence of Pediococcus pentosaceus strain 4942 in budu fish, which can be used as a new probiotic based on its capabilities to kill pathogenic bacteria and produce exopolysaccharide compounds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development and validation of sonological classification and scoring system for uterine adenomyosis: A pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adenomyosis is a common disorder in women of reproductive age. The gold standard for diagnosis is histopathological examination of hysterectomy specimen. However, only a small percentage of women undergo surgery as treatment is primarily hormonal. Non-invasive methods of diagnosis include transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Patient management in adenomyosis is often based on ultrasonographic diagnosis alone, highlighting the importance of a uniform, reproducible, clinically relevant and validated sonological classification and scoring system. Although a few investigators have proposed classification and scoring system for diagnosis of adenomyosis, none of those have been validated yet. This study aimed to propose and validate a new sonological classification and scoring system for adenomyosis. Methods: This was a prospective observational pilot study. A new sonological classification and scoring system of adenomyosis was proposed based on topography, type, size and extent, which was validated by comparing the sonological reporting with histopathological reporting. The main outcome measures that were measured were rate of agreement (Cohen’s kappa) between the findings of sonologist and pathologist; and diagnostic accuracy of the sonological classification of adenomyosis. Results: This pilot study included 30 women who underwent hysterectomy over a time period of one year with ultrasonographic diagnosis of adenomyosis. The rate of agreement (Cohen’s kappa) between the findings of sonologist and pathologist showed substantial agreement (0.703) for topography and almost perfect agreement for type (0.896), extent (0.892) and size (0.898). Conclusions: Our newly proposed sonological classification and scoring system for adenomyosis is valid and can be used for clinical application in interpersonal communication between clinicians, to prognosticate patients about the disease severity, to assess the candidates for surgical management and in further studies to correlate with symptoms severity and effectiveness of medical therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A2TEA: Identifying trait-specific evolutionary adaptations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Plants differ in their ability to cope with external stresses (e.g., drought tolerance). Genome duplications are an important mechanism to enable plant adaptation. This leads to characteristic footprints in the genome, such as protein family expansion. We explore genetic diversity and uncover evolutionary adaptation to stresses by exploiting genome comparisons between stress tolerant and sensitive species and RNA-Seq data sets from stress experiments. Expanded gene families that are stress-responsive based on differential expression analysis could hint at species or clade-specific adaptation, making these gene families exciting candidates for follow-up tolerance studies and crop improvement. Software: Integration of such cross-species omics data is a challenging task, requiring various steps of transformation and filtering. Ultimately, visualization is crucial for quality control and interpretation. To address this, we developed A2TEA: Automated Assessment of Trait-specific Evolutionary Adaptations, a Snakemake workflow for detecting adaptation footprints in silico. It functions as a one-stop processing pipeline, integrating protein family, phylogeny, expression, and protein function analysis. The pipeline is accompanied by an R Shiny web application that allows exploring, highlighting, and exporting the results interactively. This allows the user to formulate hypotheses regarding the genomic adaptations of one or a subset of the investigated species to a given stress. Conclusions: While our research focus is on crops, the pipeline is entirely independent of the underlying species and can be used with any set of species. We demonstrate pipeline efficiency on real-world datasets and discuss the implementation and limits of our analysis workflow as well as planned extensions to its current state. The A2TEA workflow and web application are publicly available at: https://github.com/tgstoecker/A2TEA.Workflow and https://github.com/tgstoecker/A2TEA.WebApp, respectively.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and glia are the two main cell classes in the nervous systems of most animals. Although functionally distinct, neurons and glia are both characterized by multiple branching arbors stemming from the cell bodies. Glial processes are generally known to form smaller trees than neuronal dendrites. However, the full extent of morphological differences between neurons and glia in multiple species and brain regions has not yet been characterized, nor is it known whether these cells can be reliably distinguished based on geometric features alone. Here, we show that multiple supervised learning algorithms deployed on a large database of morphological reconstructions can systematically classify neuronal and glial arbors with nearly perfect accuracy and precision. Moreover, we report multiple morphometric properties, both size related and size independent, that differ substantially between these cell types. In particular, we newly identify an individual morphometric measurement, Average Branch Euclidean Length that can robustly separate neurons from glia across multiple animal models, a broad diversity of experimental conditions, and anatomical areas, with the notable exception of the cerebellum. We discuss the practical utility and physiological interpretation of this discovery.</p>

                Pomrenze et al. investigate how dynorphin and kappa opioid receptors promote social interaction deficits during protracted opioid withdrawal. They find that kappa receptors reduce social interaction during opioid abstinence by suppressing 5-HT release in the NAc, uncovering a neural mechanism that contributes to sociability deficits associated with opioid use disorder.

High- and low-intensity ST36 stimulation control immunity by activating the sympathetic-splenic and vagal-adrenal axes, respectively. These complex interactions between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems depict novel functional models of autonomic organization for neuromodulation.

                Protein lifetime in synapses is important for brain development and aging, learning, and memory. The authors show that synapses with diverse protein lifetimes are differentially distributed on neurons and in brain regions and that this architecture changes throughout the lifespan and is impacted in a model of autism and schizophrenia.

                In this study, Tauzin et al. report that the third dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong humoral responses against VOCs in naïve individuals, regardless of the interval between the first two doses. However, these responses remain lower than those induced by hybrid immunity.

                Bates et al. investigate viral neutralization, antibody glycosylation and Fc-mediated effector functions from BNT162b2. Neutralization and antibody-dependent natural killer cell activation correlate. Vaccine-specific IgG display distinct glycosylation patterns with afucosylation and sialylation associating with natural killer cell activation. These antibody properties collectively diminish in those ≥65 years old.

                The fates of infected cells can affect viral pathogenesis. Zhu et al. show that the upregulation of ZBTB7A can convert a cytolytic human coronavirus infection to a persistent, homeostatic one. Continued work in this area may ultimately explain the divergence of clinical presentations associated with respiratory viral infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contextual effects in sensorimotor adaptation adhere to associative learning rules</a></h4>

              
                Traditional associative learning tasks focus on the formation of associations between salient events and arbitrary stimuli that predict those events. This is exemplified in cerebellar-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, where arbitrary cues such as a light or tone act as conditioning stimuli (CSs) that predict aversive sensations at the cornea (unconditioned stimulus, US). Here we ask if a similar framework could be applied to another type of cerebellar-dependent sensorimotor learning – sensorimotor adaptation. Models of sensorimotor adaptation posit that the introduction of an environmental perturbation results in an error signal that is used to update an internal model of a sensorimotor map for motor planning. Here we take a step towards an integrative account of these two forms of cerebellar-dependent learning, examining the relevance of core concepts from associative learning for sensorimotor adaptation. Using a visuomotor adaptation reaching task, we paired movement-related feedback (US) with neutral auditory or visual contextual cues that served as conditioning stimuli (CSs). Trial-by-trial changes in feedforward movement kinematics exhibited three key signatures of associative learning: Differential conditioning, sensitivity to the CS-US interval, and compound conditioning. Moreover, after compound conditioning, a robust negative correlation was observed between responses to the two elemental CSs of the compound (i.e., overshadowing), consistent with the additivity principle posited by theories of associative learning. The existence of associative learning effects in sensorimotor adaptation provides a proof-of-concept for linking cerebellar-dependent learning paradigms within a common theoretical framework.

                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the entry of leukocytes and potentially harmful substances from the circulation into the central nervous system (CNS). While BBB defects are a hallmark of many neurological disorders, the cellular heterogeneity at the neurovascular interface and the mechanisms governing neuroinflammation are not fully understood. Through single cell RNA sequencing of non-neuronal cell populations of the murine cerebral cortex during development, adulthood, ageing and neuroinflammation, we identify reactive endothelial venules (REVs), a compartment of specialised post-capillary endothelial cells (ECs) that are characterized by consistent expression of cell adhesion molecules, preferential leukocyte transmigration, association with perivascular macrophage populations, and endothelial activation initiating CNS immune responses. Our results provide novel insights into the heterogeneity of the cerebral vasculature and a useful resource for the molecular alterations associated with neuroinflammation and ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Broad-scale variation in human genetic diversity levels is predicted by purifying selection on coding and non-coding elements</a></h4>

              
                Analyses of genetic variation in many taxa have established that neutral genetic diversity is shaped by natural selection at linked sites. Whether the mode of selection is primarily the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles (selective sweeps) or purifying selection on deleterious mutations (background selection) remains unknown, however. We address this question in humans by fitting a model of the joint effects of selective sweeps and background selection to autosomal polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project. After controlling for variation in mutation rates along the genome, a model of background selection alone explains ~60% of the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale. Adding the effects of selective sweeps driven by adaptive substitutions to the model does not improve the fit, and when both modes of selection are considered jointly, selective sweeps are estimated to have had little or no effect on linked neutral diversity. The regions under purifying selection are best predicted by phylogenetic conservation, with ~80% of the deleterious mutations affecting neutral diversity occurring in non-exonic regions. Thus, background selection is the dominant mode of linked selection in humans, with marked effects on diversity levels throughout autosomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chronic Ca2+ imaging of cortical neurons with long-term expression of GCaMP-X</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals reflect acute changes in membrane excitability (e.g. responses to stimuli), and also mediate intracellular signaling cascades that normally take longer time to manifest (e.g., regulations of transcription). In both cases, chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging has been often desired, but largely hindered by unexpected cytotoxicity intrinsic to GCaMP, a popular series of genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators. Here, we demonstrate the performance of GCaMP-X in chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with long-term probe expression in cortical neurons, which has been designed to eliminate the unwanted interactions between conventional GCaMP indicators and endogenous (apo)calmodulin-binding proteins. By expressing in live adult mice at high levels over an extended time frame, GCaMP-X indicators showed less damage and improved performance in two-photon imaging of acute Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to whisker deflection or spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations. Chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data (³1 month) were acquired from cultured cortical neurons expressing GCaMP-X, unveiling that spontaneous/local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients would progressively develop into autonomous/global Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Besides the morphological indices of neurite length and soma size, the major metrics of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup>, including rate, amplitude and synchrony were also examined along with the multiple stages (from neonatal to mature) during neural development. Dysregulations of both neuritogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were observed typically in 2-3 weeks, which were exacerbated by stronger or prolonged expression of GCaMP. In comparison, neurons expressing GCaMP-X exhibited significantly less damage. By varying the timepoints of virus infection or drug induction, GCaMP-X outperformed GCaMP similarly in cultured mature neurons. These data altogether highlight the unique importance of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> to morphology and health of neurons, presumably underlying the differential performance between GCaMP-X and GCaMP. In summary, GCaMP-X provides a viable option for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging applications involving long-time and/or high-level expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Murine endothelial serine palmitoyltransferase 1 (SPTLC1) is required for vascular development and systemic sphingolipid homeostasi</a></h4>

              
                Serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of sphingolipids (SL), is needed for embryonic development, physiological homeostasis, and response to stress. The functions of <i>de novo</i> SL synthesis in vascular endothelial cells (EC), which line the entire circulatory system, are not well understood. Here we show that the <i>de novo</i> SL synthesis in EC not only regulates vascular development but also maintains circulatory and peripheral organ SL levels. Mice with an endothelial-specific gene knockout of SPTLC1 (<i>Sptlc1</i> ECKO), an essential subunit of the SPT complex, exhibited reduced EC proliferation and tip/stalk cell differentiation, resulting in delayed retinal vascular development. In addition, <i>Sptlc1</i> ECKO mice had reduced retinal neovascularization in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Mechanistic studies suggest that EC SL produced from the <i>de novo</i> pathway are needed for lipid raft formation and efficient VEGF signaling. Post-natal deletion of the EC <i>Sptlc1</i> also showed rapid reduction of several SL metabolites in plasma, red blood cells, and peripheral organs (lung and liver) but not in the retina, part of the central nervous system (CNS). In the liver, EC <i>de novo</i> SL synthesis was important for acetaminophen-induced rapid ceramide elevation and hepatotoxicity. These results suggest that EC-derived SL metabolites are in constant flux between the vasculature, circulatory elements, and parenchymal cells of non-CNS organs. Taken together, our data point to the central role of the endothelial SL biosynthesis in maintaining vascular development, neovascular proliferation, non-CNS tissue metabolic homeostasis, and hepatocyte response to stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The individuality of shape asymmetries of the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetries of the cerebral cortex are found across diverse phyla and are particularly pronounced in humans, with important implications for brain function and disease. However, many prior studies have confounded asymmetries due to size with those due to shape. Here, we introduce a novel approach to characterize asymmetries of the whole cortical shape, independent of size, across different spatial frequencies using magnetic resonance imaging data in three independent datasets. We find that cortical shape asymmetry is highly individualized and robust, akin to a cortical fingerprint, and identifies individuals more accurately than size-based descriptors, such as cortical thickness and surface area, or measures of inter-regional functional coupling of brain activity. Individual identifiability is optimal at coarse spatial scales (~37 mm wavelength), and shape asymmetries show scale-specific associations with sex and cognition, but not handedness. While unihemispheric cortical shape shows significant heritability at coarse scales (~65 mm wavelength), shape asymmetries are determined primarily by subject-specific environmental effects. Thus, coarse-scale shape asymmetries are highly personalized, sexually dimorphic, linked to individual differences in cognition, and are primarily driven by stochastic environmental influences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Depletion or cleavage of cohesin during anaphase differentially affects chromatin structure and segregation</a></h4>

              
                Chromosome segregation requires both the separation of sister chromatids and the sustained condensation of chromatids during anaphase. In yeast cells, cohesin is not only required for sister chromatid cohesion but also plays a major role determining the structure of individual chromatids in metaphase. Separase cleavage is thought to remove all cohesin complexes from chromosomes to initiate anaphase. It is thus not clear how the length and organisation of segregating chromatids is maintained during anaphase in the absence of cohesin. Here we show that degradation of cohesin at the anaphase onset causes aberrant chromatid segregation. Hi-C analysis on segregating chromatids demonstrates that cohesin depletion causes loss of intrachromatid organisation.  Surprisingly, TEV-mediated cleavage of cohesin does not dramatically disrupt chromatid organisation in anaphase, explaining why bulk segregation is achieved. In addition, we identified a small pool of cohesin complexes bound to telophase chromosomes in wildtype cells and show that they play a role in the organisation of centromeric regions. Our data demonstrates that in yeast cells cohesin function is not over in metaphase, but extends to the anaphase period when chromatids are segregating.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The cardiopharyngeal mesoderm contributes to lymphatic vessel development in mouse</a></h4>

              
                Lymphatic vessels are crucial for tissue homeostasis and immune responses in vertebrates. Recent studies have demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) arise from both venous sprouting (lymphangiogenesis) and de novo production from non-venous origins (lymphvasculogenesis), which is similar to blood vessel formation through angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. However, the contribution of LECs from non-venous origins to lymphatic networks is considered to be relatively small. Here, we identify the <i>Islet1</i> (<i>Isl1</i>)-expressing cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (CPM) as a non-venous origin of craniofacial and cardiac LECs. Genetic lineage tracing with <i>Isl1<sup>Cre/+</sup></i> and <i>Isl1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></i> mice suggested that a subset of CPM cells gives rise to LECs. These CPM-derived LECs are distinct from venous-derived LECs in terms of their developmental processes and anatomical locations. Later, they form the craniofacial and cardiac lymphatic vascular networks in collaboration with venous-derived LECs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are two major sources of LECs, the cardinal vein and the CPM. As the CPM is evolutionarily conserved, these findings may improve our understanding of the evolution of lymphatic vessel development across species. Most importantly, our findings may provide clues to the pathogenesis of lymphatic malformations, which most often develop in the craniofacial and mediastinal regions.

                PIEZO2 mechanosensitive channels are required for normal touch sensation. However, PIEZO2 channels are almost completely blocked at negative resting membrane potentials. We show that PIEZO2 voltage-block can be relieved by mutations at a conserved Arginine (R2756) which dramatically sensitizes the channel to mechanical stimuli. We generated Piezo2R2756H/R2756H and Piezo2R2756K/R2756K knock-in mice to ask how voltage regulates the endogenous mechanosensitivity of sensory neurons. Surprisingly, mechanosensitive currents in nociceptors, neurons that detect noxious mechanical stimuli, were substantially sensitized in Piezo2 knock-in mice, but touch receptors were largely unaffected. Piezo2 knock-in mice were hypersensitive to noxious mechanical stimuli as their nociceptors acquired properties similar to ultrasensitive touch receptors. Thus, mechanical pain sensitivity can be tuned by voltage-block of PIEZO2 channels, a channel property potentially amenable for pharmacological modulation.

                Comprehensive analysis of tissue composition has so far been limited to ex vivo approaches. Here, we introduce NuClear (Nucleus-instructed tissue composition using deep learning), an approach combining in vivo two-photon imaging of histone 2B-eGFP-labeled cell nuclei with subsequent deep learning-based identification of cell types from structural features of the respective cell nuclei. This allowed us to classify all cells per imaging volume (0.25 mm3 containing ~25000 cells) and identify their position in 3D space in a non-invasive manner using only a single label. NuClear opens a window to study changes in relative abundance and location of all major brain cell types in individual mice over extended time periods, enabling comprehensive studies of changes in cellular composition in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Calcium transients in nNOS neurons underlie distinct phases of the neurovascular response to barrel cortex activation in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS), a Ca2+ dependent enzyme, is expressed by distinct populations of neocortical neurons. Although neuronal NO is well known to contribute to the blood flow increase evoked by neural activity, the relationships between nNOS neurons activity and vascular responses in the awake state remain unclear. We imaged the barrel cortex in awake, head-fixed mice through a chronically implanted cranial window. The Ca2+ indicator GCaMP7f was expressed selectively in nNOS neurons using adenoviral gene transfer in nNOScre mice. Air-puffs directed at the contralateral whiskers or spontaneous motion induced Ca2+ transients in 30.2 {+/-} 2.2% or 51.6 {+/-} 3.3% of nNOS neurons, respectively, and evoked local arteriolar dilation. The greatest dilatation (14.8 {+/-} 1.1%) occurred when whisking and motion occurred simultaneously. Ca2+ transients in individual nNOS neurons and local arteriolar dilation showed various degrees of correlation, which was strongest when the activity of whole nNOS neuron ensemble was examined. We also found that some nNOS neurons became active immediately prior to arteriolar dilation, while others were activated gradually after arteriolar dilatation. Discrete nNOS neuron subsets may contribute either to the initiation or to the maintenance of the vascular response, suggesting a previously unappreciated temporal specificity to the role of NO in neurovascular coupling.

                Accumulating evidence supports the involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) system in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, it is currently unknown whether GI alterations arise as a consequence of central nervous system (CNS) pathology or play a causal role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The GI mucus system is a possible mediator of GI dyshomeostasis in neurological disorders as CNS controls mucus production and secretion via the efferent arm of the brain-gut axis. The aim was to use a brain-first model of sporadic AD induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ-icv) to dissect the efferent (i.e. brain-to-gut) effects of isolated central neuropathology on the GI mucus system. Quantification and morphometric analysis of goblet cell mucigen granules revealed altered GI mucus secretion in the AD model possibly mediated by the insensitivity of AD goblet cells to neurally-evoked mucosal secretion confirmed by ex vivo cholinergic stimulation of isolated duodenal rings. The dysfunctional efferent control of the GI mucus secretion results in altered biochemical composition of the mucus associated with reduced glycoprotein aggregation and binding capacity in vitro. Finally, functional consequences of the reduced barrier-forming capacity of the AD mucus are demonstrated using the in vitro two-compartment caffeine diffusion interference model. Isolated central AD-like neuropathology results in the loss of efferent control of GI homeostasis via the brain-gut axis characterized by the insensitivity to neurally-evoked mucosal secretion, altered mucus constitution, and reduced barrier-forming capacity potentially increasing the susceptibility of STZ-icv rat model of AD to GI and systemic inflammation induced by intraluminal toxins, microorganisms, and drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">What moves when mice move a single whisker to touch? Individuality and stereotypy in behavior</a></h4>

              
                A key function of the brain is to move the body through a rich, complex environment. When rodents engage their environment, they move their whiskers as they extract tactile information. Even though the study of whisking has a long history, the details of what mice move when they move a whisker actively to touch are still unknown. Here we trained head fixed mice in a simple go-cue task to move a whisker on one side of the face to touch a sensor and tracked facial movements. Our analysis shows that mice specifically control the movement of the whisker they use to touch and that as they move their whiskers, they move their nose and apply forces on the head-post in a manner that reflects the behavioral epoch. Importantly, mice controlled the setpoint, amplitude and frequency of movement of whiskers bilaterally and individually. Additionally, even though mice achieved the goal of the task -- to touch the sensor within 2 seconds -- how they did so, how they coordinated movement of the nose and forces on head post with movement of individual whiskers was stereotyped, specific and related to the distance they needed to move a whisker to touch the sensor. Our work shows how stereotyped mouse behavior can be, and it emphasizes both the level of fine motor control mice can exert over individual whiskers and the extent of facial movements in a goal directed whisking-to-touch task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impact of acute complex exercise on inhibitory control and brain activation: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of literature demonstrates that a single bout of exercise benefits executive function. While the acute effect of simple exercises like walking, running, and cycling has been well investigated, it is less clear how complex exercise, which requires open skills and various motions, impacts executive function and brain activation. Therefore, we compared the acute effects of a complex exercise on inhibitory control and brain activation with those of a simple exercise using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-four young right-hand dominant adults (9 women) completed three interventions: badminton, running, and a seated rest control condition for 10 min each. During each intervention, oxygen uptake and heart rate were monitored. A Stroop task composed of neutral and incongruent conditions was administrated before and after each intervention. An fNIRS system recorded hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex to evaluate brain activation during the Stroop task. The intensities of badminton and running were comparable. Performance on the Stroop task was significantly improved after badminton, specifically in the incongruent condition relative to in the neutral condition. On the other hand, neither running nor seated rest affected performance in the Stroop task. The fNIRS measures indicated that badminton and running had no significant influence on brain activation. These results show that a single bout of complex exercise enhances inhibitory control without increasing brain activation compared to simple exercise, suggesting that an acute complex exercise induces neural efficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic remodeling of the retina in a Zebrafish model of Retinitis Pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Inherited retinal degenerative diseases such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) result in progressive loss of photoreceptors until an individual is completely blind. A hallmark of these diseases is progressive structural and functional remodeling of the remaining retinal neurons as rod photoreceptors are lost. While many studies focus on regenerative or bionic therapies to restore vision, extensive remodeling of retinal cell types throughout the course of retinal degenerative diseases stands as a barrier for successful implementation of these strategies. As a window onto the molecular basis of remodeling, we have performed a comparative analysis of single-cell transcriptome data from adult Zebrafish retina of wild-type and a P23H mutant rhodopsin model of RP. In addition to providing a benchmark atlas of retinal cell type transcriptomes in the wild-type adult Zebrafish retina, we find transcriptional changes in essentially all retinal cell types in the P23H model. Increased oxidative stress is evident not only in the rods but also in cones, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and to a lesser extent in amacrine and bipolar cells. Metabolic changes increasing oxidative metabolism and glycolysis are found in rods and cones, while evidence of increased activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is found in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Evidence of synaptic remodeling is found throughout the retina, with changes to increase synaptic transmission in photoreceptors and bipolar cells, increased ionotropic glutamate receptors in amacrine and ganglion cells, and dendritic and axon remodeling throughout. Surprisingly, RPE, cones and bipolar cells in the P23H retinas also have increased expression of genes involved in circadian rhythm regulation. While this model system undergoes continuous regeneration, ongoing remodeling impacts the entire retina. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis provides a molecular road map to understand how the retina remodels in the context of chronic retinal degeneration with ongoing regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct effects of disease-associated TREM2 R47H/+ and T66M mutations on iPSC-derived microglia.</a></h4>

              
                Genetic findings have highlighted key roles for microglia in the pathology of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Distinct mutations in the microglial protein TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) are associated with different forms of neurodegeneration in humans; R47H/+ mutations increase AD risk, while loss-of-function mutations such as TREM2 T66M result in more severe forms of neurodegeneration. We employed gene editing and stem cell models to gain insight into the effects of these mutations on human iPSC-derived microglia. We found divergent effects of TREM2 R47H/+ and T66M mutations on gene expression, with R47H/+ cells exhibiting a pro-inflammatory gene expression signature. Both the TREM2 R47H/+ and T66M mutations caused similar impairments in microglial movement and the uptake of multiple substrates, while R47H/+ microglia were hyper-responsive to inflammatory stimuli, consistent with their gene expression signature. We developed an in vitro laser-induced injury model in neuron-microglia co-cultures, finding an impaired injury response by TREM2 R47H/+ microglia. Furthermore, in xenotransplantation experiments, mouse brains transplanted with TREM2 R47H/+ microglia exhibited reduced synaptic density. Consistently, we observed upregulation of multiple complement cascade components in TREM2 R47H/+ microglia, suggesting that inappropriate synaptic pruning may underlie the effect. Thus, these findings identify shared and distinct effects of these two TREM2 mutations on microglial gene expression and function. While the TREM2 T66M mutation impairs microglial movement and uptake processes, the TREM2 R47H/+ mutation additionally confers multiple potentially detrimental effects on human microglia, likely to underlie its association with AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid Cell Type-Specific Nascent Proteome Labeling in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Controlled protein synthesis is required to regulate gene expression and is often carried out in a cell type-specific manner. Protein synthesis is commonly measured by labeling the nascent proteome with amino acid analogs or isotope-containing amino acids. These methods have been difficult to implement in vivo as they require lengthy amino acid replacement procedures. O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) is a puromycin analog that incorporates into nascent polypeptide chains. Through its terminal alkyne, OPP can be conjugated to a fluorophore-azide for directly visualizing nascent protein synthesis, or to a biotin-azide for capture and identification of newly-synthesized proteins. To achieve cell type-specific OPP incorporation, we developed phenylacetyl-OPP (PhAc-OPP), a puromycin analog harboring an enzyme-labile blocking group that can be removed by Penicillin G acylase (PGA). Here, we show that cell type-specific PGA expression in Drosophila can be used to achieve OPP labeling of newly synthesized proteins in targeted cell populations within the brain. Following a brief 2-hour incubation of intact brains with PhAc-OPP, we observe robust imaging and affinity purification of OPP-labeled nascent proteins in PGA-targeted cell populations. We apply this method to show a pronounced age-related decline in neuronal protein synthesis in the fly brain, demonstrating the capability to quantitatively capture in vivo protein synthesis states using PhAc-OPP. This method, which we call POPPi (PGA-dependent OPP incorporation), should be applicable for rapidly visualizing protein synthesis and identifying nascent proteins synthesized under diverse physiological and pathological conditions with cellular specificity in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Huntingtin is essential for synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Huntingtin (HTT), an exceptionally large protein with hundreds of interacting partners within the central nervous system, has been extensively studied due to its role in Huntington's disease (HD) pathology. HD is a monogenic disorder caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which results in the production of a pathogenic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein, and toxic effects of this mutant protein in the context of HD have been well-established. Less-established, however, is the role of wild type HTT (wtHTT) in the adult brain, particularly in areas outside the corticostriatal pathway. wtHTT has previously been suggested to play a vital role in cellular functions that promote synapse homeostasis, such as fast axonal transport of synaptic cargo, vesicle replenishment and receptor localization and stability. Synaptic dysfunction precedes and predicts cell death in many neurodegenerative diseases including HD (termed synaptopathies) and whether proper synaptic transmission can be maintained without wtHTT in extrastriatal brain areas such as the hippocampus remains unknown. Consequences of wtHTT reduction in the adult brain are of particular importance as clinical trials for many non-selective HTT-lowering therapies for HD are underway, which are unable to distinguish between mHTT and wtHTT, and therefore reduce levels of both proteins. We investigated the consequences of wtHTT loss of function in the CA3-CA1 pathway of the adult hippocampus using a conditional knockout mouse model and found that 1-2 month deletion of wtHTT in excitatory hippocampal neurons inhibits post-tetanic potentiation and completely abolishes NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in these animals. These data reveal a novel role of wtHTT as an essential regulator of short- and long-term plasticity in the adult hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atypical NMDA Receptors Limit Synaptic Plasticity in the Adult Ventral Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) assemble as functionally diverse heterotetramers. Incorporation of the GluN3A subunit into NMDARs alters conventional NMDAR properties by reducing both magnesium sensitivity and calcium permeability. GluN1 together with GluN3A can also form functional receptors that lack a glutamate binding site and instead serve as excitatory glycine receptors (eGlyRs). GluN3A expression is high in early development but naturally declines to low levels in most brain regions by adulthood. Interestingly, GluN3A expression remains elevated in the CA1 of the adult ventral hippocampus (VH), but not in the dorsal hippocampus (DH). The DH and VH are now well-understood to play very different functional roles, with the DH being primarily involved in cognitive functions and the VH in emotional processing. Why GluN3A persists in the adult VH, and the impact its presence has on glutamatergic neurotransmission in the VH is currently unknown. Here, we show that GluN3A remains elevated both at synaptic and extrasynaptic locations in the adult VH, assembling as GluN1/GluN2/GluN3A NMDARs with reduced magnesium sensitivity, as well as GluN1/GluN3A eGlyRs. By comparing various synaptic properties in the DH and VH of wild-type (WT) and GluN3A knockout (KO) mice, we demonstrate that GluN3A persistence in the VH attenuates glutamate release, limits postsynaptic calcium influx through NMDARs, and reduces the magnitude of NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation. In comparison, GluN3A KO had relatively little effect on these same properties in the DH. In all, our data demonstrate that GluN3A persistence in the VH represents a key modulator of VH excitability and therefore may play a central role in emotional processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ion Gradient-driven Bifurcations of a Multi-Scale Neuronal Model</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic limitations within the brain frequently arise in the context of aging and disease. As the largest consumers of energy within the brain, ion pumps that maintain the neuronal membrane potential are the most affected when energy supply becomes limited. To characterize the effects of such limitations, we analyze the ion gradients present in the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model. We show the existence and locations of Neimark-Sacker and period-doubling bifurcations in the sodium, calcium, and potassium reversal potentials, and demonstrate that these bifurcations form physiologically relevant bounds of ion gradient variability. Within these bounds, we show how depolarization of the gradients will cause decreased neural activity. We also show that the depolarization of ion gradients decreases inter-regional coherence, causing a shift in the critical point at which the coupling occurs and thereby inducing loss of synchrony between regions. In this way, we show that the Larter-Breakspear model captures ion gradient variability present at the microscale level and propagates these changes to the macroscale effects congruent with those observed in human neuroimaging studies.

                The entorhinal cortex is involved in establishing enduring visuo-auditory associative memory in the neocortex. Here we explored the mechanisms underlying this synaptic plasticity related to projections from the visual and entorhinal cortices to the auditory cortex, using optogenetics of dual pathways. High-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) of the visuo-auditory projection did not induce long-term potentiation (LTP). However, after pairing with sound stimulus, the visuo-auditory inputs were potentiated following either infusion of cholecystokinin (CCK) or HFLS of the entorhino-auditory CCK-expressing projection. Combining retrograde tracing and RNAscope in situ hybridization, we show that CCK expression is higher in entorhinal cortex neurons projecting to the auditory cortex than in those originating from the visual cortex. In the presence of CCK, potentiation in the neocortex occurred when the pre-synaptic input arrived 200 ms before post-synaptic firing, even after just five trials of pairing. Behaviorally, inhibition of CCK signaling blocked the generation of associative memory. Our results indicate that neocortical visuo-auditory association is formed through heterosynaptic plasticity, which depends on release of CCK in the neocortex mostly from entorhinal afferents.

                Background: Women are at increased risk for psychosocial stress-related anxiety disorders, yet mechanisms regulating this risk are unknown. Psychosocial stressors activate microglia, and the resulting neuroimmune responses that females exhibit heightened sensitivity to may serve as an etiological factor in their elevated risk. However, studies examining the role of microglia during stress in females are lacking. Methods: Microglia were manipulated in the stress-sensitive locus coeruleus (LC) of female rats in the context of social stress in two ways. First, intra-LC lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0 or 3g/side, n=5-6/group), a potent TLR4 agonist and microglial activator, was administered. One hour later, rats were exposed to control or an aggressive social defeat encounter between two males (WS, 15-min). In a separate study, females were treated with intra-LC or intra-central amygdala mannosylated liposomes containing clodronate (m-CLD; 0 or 25g/side, n=13-14/group), a compound toxic to microglia. WS-evoked burying, cardiovascular responses, and sucrose preference were measured. Brain and plasma cytokines were quantified, and cardiovascular telemetry assessed autonomic balance. Results: Intra-LC LPS augmented the WS-induced burying response and increased plasma corticosterone and interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). Further, the efficacy and selectivity of microinjected m-CLD was determined. In the context of WS, intra-LC m-CLD attenuated the hypervigilant burying response during WS as well as the accumulation of intra-LC IL-1{beta}. Intra-central amygdala m-CLD had no effect on witness stress-evoked behavior. Conclusions: These studies highlight an innovative method for depleting microglia in a brain region specific manner and indicate that microglia in the LC differentially regulate hypervigilant WS-evoked behavioral and autonomic responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artificial neural network language models align neurally and behaviorally with humans even after a developmentally realistic amount of training</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks have emerged as computationally plausible models of human language processing. A major criticism of these models is that the amount of training data they receive far exceeds that of humans during language learning. Here, we use two complementary approaches to ask how the models ability to capture human neural and behavioral responses to language is affected by the amount of training data. First, we evaluate GPT-2 models trained on 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, or 1 billion tokens against two fMRI benchmarks and one behavioral (reading times) benchmark. Because children are exposed to approximately 100 million words during the first 10 years of life, we consider the 100 million token model developmentally plausible. Second, we test the performance of a GPT-2 model that is trained on a 9 billion dataset to reach state-of-the-art next-word prediction performance against the same human benchmarks at different stages during training. Across both approaches, we find that (i) the models trained on a developmentally plausible amount of data already achieve near-maximal performance in capturing neural and behavioral responses to language. Further, (ii) lower perplexity (a measure of next-word prediction performance) is associated with stronger alignment with the human benchmarks, suggesting that models that have received enough training to achieve sufficiently high next word prediction performance also acquire human-like representations of the linguistic input. In tandem, these findings establish that although some training is necessary for the models ability to predict human responses to language, a developmentally realistic amount of training (~100 million tokens) may suffice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Geometric constraints on human brain function</a></h4>

              
                The brain's anatomy constrains its function, but precisely how remains unclear. Here, we show that human cortical and subcortical activity, measured with magnetic resonance imaging under spontaneous and diverse task-evoked conditions, can be parsimoniously understood as resulting from excitations of fundamental, resonant modes of the brain's geometry (i.e., its shape) rather than of its complex inter-regional connectivity, as classically assumed. We then use these modes to show that task-evoked activations across >10,000 brain maps are not confined to focal areas, as widely believed, but instead excite brain-wide modes with wavelengths spanning >60 mm. Finally, we confirm theoretical predictions that the close link between geometry and function is explained by a dominant role for wave-like dynamics, showing that such dynamics can reproduce numerous canonical spatiotemporal properties of spontaneous and evoked recordings. Our findings challenge prevailing views of brain function and identify a previously under-appreciated role of brain geometry that is predicted by a unifying and physically principled approach.

	<p>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a subtype of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with a seasonal pattern. Although it is a pathological condition limited to specific seasons of the year, during the symptomatic period, patients may experience a significant impairment of well-being and daily quality of life as a result of the depressed mood, associated with other symptoms defined as atypical of MDD. While extensive evidence of memory deficits has been found in MDD, explicit memory impairments in SAD are insufficiently studied. This study aims to investigate the cognitive processing of emotional stimuli in women with SAD, in particular the interplay between emotions and declarative memory. One hundred and twenty young women, screened from an initial number of 1125 university students, were divided into two groups, an experimental one that included 60 medically untreated women affected by &amp;amp;ldquo;winter type SAD&amp;amp;rdquo; and a control group of 60 non-SAD women. Different subjects were randomly submitted to two types of audio&amp;amp;ndash;visual stories, neutral or arousal, and then their memory performances were analyzed by means of a free-recall test and a recognition memory test. In both the free-recall test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.008) and in the recognition memory test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002), the SAD group showed impaired memory performances. Taken together, our novel key findings suggest that SAD is characterized by impairment in declarative memory and attentional bias for emotional negative stimuli.</p>

	<p>Impulsive behaviour is a key characteristic of mania in bipolar disorder (BD). However, there is mixed evidence as to whether impulsivity is a trait feature of the disorder, present in the euthymic state in the absence of mania. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine whether impulsivity is elevated in euthymic BD in comparison to controls. Electronic databases were searched for papers published until April 2022 reporting data on a self-report or behavioural measure of impulsivity in a euthymic BD group and a healthy control group. In total, 46 studies were identified. Euthymic BD showed significantly higher levels of self-reported impulsivity compared to controls (large effect size). Euthymic BD also showed significantly higher levels of impulsivity on response inhibition and inattention tasks, with moderate and large effect sizes, respectively. Only two studies measured delay of gratification, finding no significant differences between groups. Our results suggest impulsivity may be a trait feature of BD, however longitudinal cohort studies are required to confirm whether elevated impulsivity is present before illness onset. Future research should establish whether cognitive interventions are beneficial in improving impulsivity in BD.</p>

	<p>Stimulation-induced inhibition is one of the important effects of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) utilized by the therapy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat certain neurological diseases such as epilepsy. In order to explore the stimulation sites to induce inhibition, this study investigated the activation effect of HFS of efferent fibers on the local inhibitory interneurons (IN). Antidromic HFS (A-HFS) of 100 Hz pulses was applied for 2 min at the efferent fibers&amp;amp;mdash;the alveus (i.e., the axons of pyramidal neurons) in the hippocampal CA1 region of anesthetized rats. Single unit spikes of INs in local feedback inhibitory circuits, as well as antidromically-evoked population spikes (APS) of pyramidal neurons, were recorded simultaneously in the CA1 region upstream of the stimulation site. Results showed that during the late 60 s of A-HFS, with a substantial suppression in APS amplitudes, the mean firing rate of INs was still significantly greater than the baseline level even when the A-HFS was applied with a weak pulse intensity of 0.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.05 mA (9 rats). With a strong pulse intensity of 0.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.08 mA (10 rats), the mean firing rate of INs was able to keep at a high level till the end of A-HFS. In addition, the mean latency of IN firing was significantly prolonged during the sustained A-HFS, indicating that alterations had been generated in the pathway to activate INs by the stimulations at efferent fibers. The results suggested that HFS at efferent fibers with various stimulation intensities can modulate the firing of local inhibitory neurons. The finding provides new clues for selecting stimulation sites to enhance inhibition in neural circuits by DBS.</p>

	<p>Low-grade glioma (LGG) is a highly aggressive disease in the skull. On the other hand, anoikis, a specific form of cell death induced by the loss of cell contact with the extracellular matrix, plays a key role in cancer metastasis. In this study, anoikis-related genes (ANRGs) were used to identify LGG subtypes and to construct a prognostic model for LGG patients. In addition, we explored the immune microenvironment and enrichment pathways between different subtypes. We constructed an anoikis-related gene signature using the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohort and investigated the differences between different risk groups in clinical features, mutational landscape, immune cell infiltration (ICI), etc. Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analysis showed that the characteristics of ANRGs in the high-risk group were associated with poor prognosis in LGG patients. The risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor. The high-risk group had higher ICI, tumor mutation load (TMB), immune checkpoint gene expression, and therapeutic response to immune checkpoint blockers (ICB). Functional analysis showed that these high-risk and low-risk groups had different immune statuses and drug sensitivity. Risk scores were used together with LGG clinicopathological features to construct a nomogram, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) showed that the model could enable patients to benefit from clinical treatment strategies.</p>

	<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been used to construct functional connectivity (FC) in the brain for the diagnosis and analysis of brain disease. Current studies typically use the Pearson correlation coefficient to construct dynamic FC (dFC) networks, and then use this as a network metric to obtain the necessary features for brain disease diagnosis and analysis. This simple observational approach makes it difficult to extract potential high-level FC features from the representations, and also ignores the rich information on spatial and temporal variability in FC. In this paper, we construct the Latent Space Representation Network (LSRNet) and use two stages to train the network. In the first stage, an autoencoder is used to extract potential high-level features and inner connections in the dFC representations. In the second stage, high-level features are extracted using two perspective feature parses. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to extract spatial and temporal features from the local perspective. Convolutional neural networks extract global high-level features from the global perspective. Finally, the fusion of spatial and temporal features with global high-level features is used to diagnose brain disease. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to the ANDI rs-fMRI dataset, and the classification accuracy reaches 84.6% for NC/eMCI, 95.1% for NC/AD, 80.6% for eMCI/lMCI, 84.2% for lMCI/AD and 57.3% for NC/eMCI/lMCI/AD. The experimental results show that the method has a good classification performance and provides a new approach to the diagnosis of other brain diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: Most cases of hemifacial spasm result from mechanical compression at the root exit zone of the facial nerve by vascular loops, and only a few cases are caused by vestibular schwannoma. Case presentation: We report a case of symptomatic hemifacial spasm induced by a small vestibular schwannoma that was totally resected. A 64-year-old man was admitted to our department with a 14-month history of symptomatic right-sided hemifacial spasm. During the process of microvascular decompression, no definite vessel was found to compress the facial nerve. By further exploration of regions other than root exit zone, a small vestibular schwannoma compressing the internal auditory canal portion of facial nerve from the ventral side was discovered. Resection of the tumor was then conducted. The symptoms of hemifacial spasm disappeared immediately after surgery. Conclusions: We should be aware that magnetic resonance imaging is not always precise and perhaps misses some miniature lesions due to present image technique limitations. A small vestibular schwannoma might be the reason for HFS, although preoperative magnetic resonance tomography angiography showed possible vascular compression at the facial nerve root. More importantly, a full-length exploration of the facial nerve is in urgent need to find potential compression while performing microvascular decompression for HFS patients.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The molecular circadian clock can be found throughout the body and is essential for the synchronizing cellular physiology with the 24 h day. However, the role of the clock in regulating the regenerative potential of the brain has not been explored. We report here that murine NG2-glia, the largest population of proliferative cells in the mature central nervous system, rhythmically express circadian clock genes in a 24 h period, including the critical clock component <I>Bmal1</I> RNA and BMAL1 protein. Interestingly, daily NG2-glia proliferation preferentially occurs during the time of day in which <I>Bmal1</I> expression is high, while conditional knockout of <I>Bmal1</I> decreases both cortical NG2-glia density and cellular proliferation. Furthermore, in a neurotrauma model, we show that pathology-induced NG2-glia proliferation is also dependent on <I>Bmal1</I> expression. Because circadian rhythm disturbances are common in neurologic disorders across the life span, including in traumatic brain injury, these findings bear significant implications for cellular regeneration in brain injuries and disease.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity (NACA) in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that NACA influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple <I>in vivo</I> caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathologic models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Characteristics and Impact of the rNST GABA Network on Neural and Behavioral Taste Responses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), the initial CNS site for processing gustatory information, is comprised of two major cell types, glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Although many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. To directly compare the response characteristics of both inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons, we recorded from mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. We observed that chemosensitive profiles of GABAergic taste neurons (G+<SUB>TASTE</SUB>) were similar to non-GABA taste neurons (G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB>) but had much lower response rates. We further observed a novel subpopulation of GABA cells located more ventrally in the nucleus that were unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+<SUB>UNR</SUB>), suggesting pathways for inhibition initiated by centrifugal sources. This preparation also allowed us to determine how optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impacted the taste responses of G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB> neurons. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB> neurons across all qualities and chemosensitive types of neurons. Although the tuning curves of identified G-<SUB>TASTE</SUB> were modestly sharpened, the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the impacts of conservation volunteering on participant wellbeing: a systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Volunteers and citizen scientists have become an essential element of most nature conservation and restoration activities due to lack of resources but also due to the wish to engage and interact with local communities where conservation activities take place. Environmental or conservation volunteering is also considered to be a key resource in achieving much needed, ambitious nature restoration programs. Practical conservation work and various forms of environmental enhancement along with recreational and therapeutic use of natural or green and blue spaces have been studied for some time. The value of volunteers and the work is widely acknowledged but few studies have been carried out on the impacts of participating on the volunteers themselves. Using this protocol, a study will be undertaken to assess how impacts of participation have been assessed and reported in the literature; what these reported impacts are; how these are related to reported barriers and motivations for volunteering and whether they are affected by the region or country of study. Methods: This paper will identify studies that have described and assessed impacts of conservation and restoration volunteering on participants at an individual level, with a specific focus on physical, mental or societal wellbeing of individuals. Representative studies were sought from major search engines and relevant stakeholder publications, including both peer-reviewed and ‘grey literature’ in predominantly English language publications, published between 2000 and 2020. A priori inclusion criteria consisted of those publications and reports on studies with volunteer and community participants and which described impacts of, motivations for and barriers to participation. After a critical appraisal, a total of 105 articles were selected for further analysis to provide a narrative and mixed methods synthesis of the evidence base.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reduction of chickens use to perform in vitro pre-screening of novel anticoccidials by miniaturisation and increased throughput of the current Eimeria tenella compound-screening model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We have developed an in vitro model for the evaluation of potential anticoccidial properties of novel compounds aimed to control chicken coccidiosis, a costly disease for the poultry industry. This disease is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria (Apicomplexa), and it is mainly controlled by chemoprophylaxis with ionophores and chemical anticoccidials; however, there is an overall agreement about the limitation of these traditional drugs and the need to improve current methods of control. Anticoccidial activities of novel compounds is currently evaluated by expensive experiments that involve large numbers of chickens. The use of our in vitro model for the pre-screening of essential oils led to a reduction of 67% of the chickens used in the in vivo trials for validation. Eimeria parasites can only complete their life cycle in their animal host, therefore chickens are required for their propagation as they cannot be propagated in vitro. In this study, we describe how further optimisation of this in vitro model by miniaturisation can have an additional impact in reduction of the number of chickens used for the generation of parasite stocks for provision of the in vitro model. We have estimated that the use of one chicken could support the evaluation of 10 compounds with a 96-well plate format versus only two compounds with a 24-well plate format, which means an 80% reduction in chicken use. In this study we have proved that the miniaturisation into a 96-well plate format perfectly mimics the invasion and replication observed before in the 24-well plate format. In addition, the 96-well plate format has allowed the simultaneous pre-screening of higher numbers of anticoccidial drugs at different concentrations following streamlined protocols in a more cost-effective way, factors that are beneficial for a wider uptake of the model by other researchers investigating anticoccidial compounds.

                Background: Little is known about psychosocial characteristics, including loneliness, anxiety, and depression, present in preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between these psychosocial characteristics and amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal older adults with and without preclinical AD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A global Clinical Dementia Rating® Scale score of 0 was required for enrollment. Cortical amyloid burden was measured using [11C] Pittsburgh compound B or [18F]-Florbetapir PET tracers. Centiloids were used to synchronize measures. Demographic characteristics and measures of loneliness, anxiety, and depression were collected via self-report. Spearman’s correlation was used to examine relationships between amyloid and psychosocial characteristics. Results: The 108 participants had a mean age of 75.0 and an average amyloid burden of 22.2. Higher amyloid accumulation was significantly associated with greater loneliness. Conclusions: Additional research is needed with a larger, more diverse sample to examine these psychosocial characteristics in preclinical AD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolated from contaminated areas of Majengo slum in Meru County, Kenya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern today. Infections by the antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli, including enteropathogenic as well as enterotoxigenic strains have been reported as a major cause of deaths, especially among young children in low- and middle-income countries. This has been augmented by antimicrobial misuse, over the counter availability and poor sanitation especially in low income areas. This study aimed at characterizing antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli isolated from sanitation environments of the Majengo slum in Meru County, Kenya Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 61 samples from soil, water and drains swabs. These were tested against five antimicrobial drugs by the Kirby disk diffusion method. Results: A total of 42 (69%) of the samples had Escherichia coli. These recorded antimicrobial drug susceptibility as follows: Out of the five antimicrobial agents used, ceftazidime 28 (66.67%) showed the highest sensitivity followed by ciprofloxacin 26 (61.90%) and imepenem 25 (59.52%) respectively. cefotaxime and cefoxitin showed least sensitivity at 14 (33.33%) and 13 (30.95%) respectively. In intermediate imepenem and ciprofloxacin were the highest with 12 (28.57%) followed by cefotaxime 10 (23.81%). The least intermediate was observed in ceftazidime and cefoxitin both at 7 (16.67%).  The highest resistance was observed in cefoxitin 22 (52.38%), followed by cefotaxime at 18 (42.86%). Ciprofloxacin, imepenem and ceftazidime had the lowest resistance 4 (9.52%), 5 (11.91%) and 7 (16.67%) respectively. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant to the study.   Conclusions: This study showed that Escherichia coli isolated from Majengo is pathogenic and resistant to antibiotics. Detection of Escherichia coli poses a great risk in the spread of resistant strains in human. Proper sanitation and hygiene awareness practices should be provided through education to the residents of this area.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-the Thai Translation (ASEX-Thai): Reliability and validity in Thai patients with mental disorders [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sexual dysfunction is common among patients with mental disorders but receives less clinical attention, especially in Thailand and other Asian countries. The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-the Thai Translation (ASEX-Thai), a self-rated, brief, questionnaire is a potential tool for screening for sexual dysfunction in this population. Our study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of ASEX-Thai in Thai patients with mental disorders. Methods: We enrolled 202 patients from an outpatient psychiatric department at a tertiary hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Demographic data, clinical data, and diagnosis of sexual dysfunction were assessed. ASEX-Thai was done, and we analyzed the test’s psychometric properties.  Results: Most participants were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (48%). There was a positive correlation between the ASEX-Thai and sexual dysfunction diagnosis (r = 0.402, p < 0.001). The KMO coefficient was 0.77 and Barlett’s sphericity test was significant (χ 2 = 409.76, p<0.001). A score of ≥ 17 points of the ASEX-Thai was the most suitable for sexual dysfunction screening (sensitivity 77.23 %, and specificity 58.42 %). For reliability, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (0.831) showed good internal consistency. Conclusions: The ASEX-Thai is a valid and reliable self-rated questionnaire for screening for sexual dysfunction among Thai patients with mental disorders. The test could help clinicians to evaluate this undetected condition and deliver proper interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Concentration fluctuations in growing and dividing cells: Insights into the emergence of concentration homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chen Jia, Abhyudai Singh, Ramon Grima</p>

Intracellular reaction rates depend on concentrations and hence their levels are often regulated. However classical models of stochastic gene expression lack a cell size description and cannot be used to predict noise in concentrations. Here, we construct a model of gene product dynamics that includes a description of cell growth, cell division, size-dependent gene expression, gene dosage compensation, and size control mechanisms that can vary with the cell cycle phase. We obtain expressions for the approximate distributions and power spectra of concentration fluctuations which lead to insight into the emergence of concentration homeostasis. We find that (i) the conditions necessary to suppress cell division-induced concentration oscillations are difficult to achieve; (ii) mRNA concentration and number distributions can have different number of modes; (iii) two-layer size control strategies such as sizer-timer or adder-timer are ideal because they maintain constant mean concentrations whilst minimising concentration noise; (iv) accurate concentration homeostasis requires a fine tuning of dosage compensation, replication timing, and size-dependent gene expression; (v) deviations from perfect concentration homeostasis show up as deviations of the concentration distribution from a gamma distribution. Some of these predictions are confirmed using data for <i>E. coli</i>, fission yeast, and budding yeast.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dual STDP processes at Purkinje cells contribute to distinct improvements in accuracy and speed of saccadic eye movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lorenzo Fruzzetti, Hari Teja Kalidindi, Alberto Antonietti, Cristiano Alessandro, Alice Geminiani, Claudia Casellato, Egidio Falotico, Egidio D’Angelo</p>

Saccadic eye-movements play a crucial role in visuo-motor control by allowing rapid foveation onto new targets. However, the neural processes governing saccades adaptation are not fully understood. Saccades, due to the short-time of execution (20–100 ms) and the absence of sensory information for online feedback control, must be controlled in a ballistic manner. Incomplete measurements of the movement trajectory, such as the visual endpoint error, are supposedly used to form internal predictions about the movement kinematics resulting in predictive control. In order to characterize the synaptic and neural circuit mechanisms underlying predictive saccadic control, we have reconstructed the saccadic system in a digital controller embedding a spiking neural network of the cerebellum with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules driving parallel fiber—Purkinje cell long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD). This model implements a control policy based on a dual plasticity mechanism, resulting in the identification of the roles of LTP and LTD in regulating the overall quality of saccade kinematics: it turns out that LTD increases the accuracy by decreasing visual error and LTP increases the peak speed. The control policy also required cerebellar PCs to be divided into two subpopulations, characterized by burst or pause responses. To our knowledge, this is the first model that explains in mechanistic terms the visual error and peak speed regulation of ballistic eye movements in forward mode exploiting spike-timing to regulate firing in different populations of the neuronal network. This elementary model of saccades could be extended and applied to other more complex cases in which single jerks are concatenated to compose articulated and coordinated movements.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Distinct phosphorylation states of mammalian CaMKIIβ control the induction and maintenance of sleep</a></h4>

Ueda</p>

The reduced sleep duration previously observed in <i>Camk2b</i> knockout mice revealed a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)β as a sleep-promoting kinase. However, the underlying mechanism by which CaMKIIβ supports sleep regulation is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that activation or inhibition of CaMKIIβ can increase or decrease sleep duration in mice by almost 2-fold, supporting the role of CaMKIIβ as a core sleep regulator in mammals. Importantly, we show that this sleep regulation depends on the kinase activity of CaMKIIβ. A CaMKIIβ mutant mimicking the constitutive-active (auto)phosphorylation state promotes the transition from awake state to sleep state, while mutants mimicking subsequent multisite (auto)phosphorylation states suppress the transition from sleep state to awake state. These results suggest that the phosphorylation states of CaMKIIβ differently control sleep induction and maintenance processes, leading us to propose a “phosphorylation hypothesis of sleep” for the molecular control of sleep in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A prebiotic basis for ATP as the universal energy currency</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Silvana Pinna, Cäcilia Kunz, Aaron Halpern, Stuart A. Harrison, Sean F. Jordan, John Ward, Finn Werner, Nick Lane</p>

ATP is universally conserved as the principal energy currency in cells, driving metabolism through phosphorylation and condensation reactions. Such deep conservation suggests that ATP arose at an early stage of biochemical evolution. Yet purine synthesis requires 6 phosphorylation steps linked to ATP hydrolysis. This autocatalytic requirement for ATP to synthesize ATP implies the need for an earlier prebiotic ATP equivalent, which could drive protometabolism before purine synthesis. Why this early phosphorylating agent was replaced, and specifically with ATP rather than other nucleoside triphosphates, remains a mystery. Here, we show that the deep conservation of ATP might reflect its prebiotic chemistry in relation to another universally conserved intermediate, acetyl phosphate (AcP), which bridges between thioester and phosphate metabolism by linking acetyl CoA to the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP. We confirm earlier results showing that AcP can phosphorylate ADP to ATP at nearly 20% yield in water in the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions. We then show that Fe<sup>3+</sup> and AcP are surprisingly favoured. A wide range of prebiotically relevant ions and minerals failed to catalyse ADP phosphorylation. From a panel of prebiotic phosphorylating agents, only AcP, and to a lesser extent carbamoyl phosphate, showed any significant phosphorylating potential. Critically, AcP did not phosphorylate any other nucleoside diphosphate. We use these data, reaction kinetics, and molecular dynamic simulations to infer a possible mechanism. Our findings might suggest that the reason ATP is universally conserved across life is that its formation is chemically favoured in aqueous solution under mild prebiotic conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MOG and AQP4 Antibodies among Children with Multiple Sclerosis and Controls</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG among patients with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) and healthy controls, to determine whether seropositive cases fulfilled their respective diagnostic criteria, to compare characteristics and outcomes in children with POMS versus MOG-IgG-associated disease (MOGAD), and identify clinical features associated with final diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with POMS and healthy controls were enrolled at 14 US sites through a prospective case–control study on POMS risk factors. Serum AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG were assessed using live cell-based assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AQP4-IgG was negative among all 1,196 participants, 493 with POMS and 703 healthy controls. MOG-IgG was positive in 30 of 493 cases (6%) and zero controls. Twenty-five of 30 patients positive with MOG-IgG (83%) had MOGAD, whereas 5 of 30 (17%) maintained a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) on re-review of records. MOGAD cases were more commonly in female patients (21/25 [84%] vs 301/468 [64%]; <i>p</i> = 0.044), younger age (mean = 8.2 ± 4.2 vs 14.7 ± 2.6 years; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), more commonly had initial optic nerve symptoms (16/25 [64%] vs 129/391 [33%]; <i>p</i> = 0.002), or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM; 8/25 [32%] vs 9/468 [2%]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and less commonly had initial spinal cord symptoms (3/20 [15%] vs 194/381 [51%]; <i>p</i> = 0.002), serum Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) positivity (11/25 [44%] vs 445/468 [95%]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), or cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (5/25 [20%] vs 243/352 [69%]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG were not identified among healthy controls confirming their high specificity for pediatric central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease. Five percent of those with prior POMS diagnoses ultimately had MOGAD; and none had AQP4-IgG positivity. Clinical features associated with a final diagnosis of MOGAD in those with suspected MS included initial ADEM phenotype, younger age at disease onset, and lack of EBV exposure.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Systemic Metabolic Alteration Dependent on the Thyroid‐Liver Axis in Early PD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by initial involvement of the olfactory bulb/amygdala or autonomic nerves followed by nigral degeneration. Although autonomic innervation strictly regulates multiorgan systems, including endocrine functions, circulation, and digestion, how dysautonomia in PD affects systemic metabolism has not been identified. In this study, we tried to estimate the pathogenic linkage of PD by nuclear medicine techniques, trans-omic analysis of blood samples, and cultured cell experiments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thyroid mediastinum ratio of <sup>123</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy was measured in 1,158 patients with PD. Furthermore, serum exosome miRNA transcriptome analysis and plasma metabolome analysis followed by trans-omic analysis were performed in patients with de novo PD and age-matched healthy control persons. Additionally, thyroid hormone was administered to skeletal muscle and liver derived cells to evaluate the effect of hypothyroidism for these organs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sympathetic denervation of thyroid correlating with its cardiac denervation was confirmed in 1,158 patients with PD by MIBG scintigraphy. Among patients with drug-naïve PD, comprehensive metabolome analysis revealed decreased levels of thyroxine and insufficient fatty acid β-oxidation, which positively correlate with one another. Likewise, both plasma metabolome data and transcriptome data of circulating exosomal miRNAs, revealed specific enrichment of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) axis. Finally, association of thyroid hormone with PPARα-dependent β-oxidation regulation was confirmed by in vitro experiments.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that interorgan communications between the thyroid and liver are disorganized in the early stage of PD, which would be a sensitive diagnostic biomarker for PD. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Actigraphy enables home screening of REM behavior disorder in Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a potentially harmful, often overlooked sleep disorder affecting up to 70% of Parkinson's disease patients. Current diagnosis relies on nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive and cumbersome exam requiring specific clinical expertise. Here, we explored the use of wrist actigraphy to enable automatic RBD diagnoses in home settings.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty-six Parkinson's patients underwent two-week home wrist actigraphy, followed by two in-lab evaluations. Patients were classified as RBD vs. non-RBD based on dream enactment history and video-polysomnography. We comprehensively characterized patients’ movement patterns during sleep using actigraphic signals. We then trained machine learning classification algorithms to discriminate patients with or without RBD using the most relevant features. Classification performance was quantified with respect to clinical diagnosis, separately for in-lab and at-home recordings. Performance was further validated in a control group of non-PD patients with other sleep conditions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>To characterize RBD, actigraphic features extracted from both (i) individual movement episodes and (ii) global nocturnal activity were critical. RBD patients were more active overall, and exhibited movements that were shorter, of higher magnitude, and more scattered in time. Using these features, our classification algorithms reached an accuracy of 92.9±8.16% during in-clinic tests. When validated on home recordings in Parkinson's patients, accuracy reached 100% over a two-week window, and was 94.4% in non-PD control patients. Features showed robustness across tests and conditions.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>These results open new perspectives for faster, cheaper, and more regular screening of sleep disorders, both for routine clinical practice and clinical trials.</p>

                Cytokine storms, oxidative stress, and hyperglycemia can enhance the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, T2D may change the functional and structural heart. However, some signaling pathways, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, can play in T2D, and various pathomechanics and pathophysiology involved in T2D are not understood. Moreover, it is well documented that the non-coding RNAs are potentially pivotal molecules in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death signaling pathways. Hence, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs may have vital roles in oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolism, T2D, and cardiovascular systems. Non-coding RNAs can target hub gene networks and suppress or trigger various cascades. Furthermore, lifestyle is the other factor that may affect the prevalence of T2D. A sedentary lifestyle and excessive sitting can enhance inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyperglycemia. Here, we attempt to comprehend the role of hub genes, non-coding RNAs, and unhealthy lifestyles on the pathomechanics and pathophysiology of diabetic vascular complications.

                Background: This article provides an assessment of the sustainability of Russian regions’ financial systems. The study is based on the methods of generalization and synthesis, correlation-regression analysis, and multivariate classification. Since the structure of the regional financial system is complex, several works are devoted to studying its sustainability issues. The relevance of the study topic is confirmed by the lack of a systematic approach to assessing the integral index of sustainability and the possibility of using various tools in determining the complex indicator. Methods: This  methodology with application of mathematical statistics methods makes it possible to assess the financial system sustainability in four sectors, to include the leading indicators in the assessment, and to identify regions with extreme values of debt burden indicators. The method was tested for the regions of the Northwestern Federal District (NWFD) for the period 2010 - 2019  to classify the regions according to three levels of debt sustainability. Data collection from the 1st January to 30th April 2022 included statistical data from government open internet sources, sectors studied relate to government, and municipal budgets in the NWFD. Authors analyzed regional debt sustainability indicators and identified themes in the field of sustainability studies for the NWFD. Results: An increased level of financial system sustainability was observed among the  NWFD regions in the corporative and personal finance sectors, indicating a significant contribution of businesses and households to maintaining the balance and sustainability of the financial system in Russia as a whole. The results of the study also identified that the NWFD regions belong to three clusters: cluster 1 - high debt sustainability; cluster 2 - medium debt sustainability; and cluster 3 - low debt sustainability. Conclusions: The study results allowed the identification of regions with a constantly high level of debt, financial, and corporative sustainability.

                In a recent study, Zhang, Roy, and colleagues have shown that neurons in the parafascicular (PF) thalamus project to three distinct neural structures in the basal ganglia. The neural circuits identified in the study were associated with specific motor and non-motor symptoms in a Parkinson’s disease (PD) mouse model. The findings provide potential actionable therapeutic targets for this disease.

                Kim et al. show that the transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC) regulates YAP1 expression in human cancer. CIC-mediated YAP1 suppression occurs through non-consensus GGAA repeat motifs. CIC loss increases YAP1 expression to drive tumor progression. YAP inhibition in CIC-deficient cancers overcomes drug resistance and limits tumor growth.
