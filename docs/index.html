                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individual heterogeneity within societies provides opportunities to test hypotheses about adaptive neural investment in the context of group cooperation. Here we explore neural investment in defense specialist soldiers of the eusocial stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>) which are age sub-specialized on distinct defense tasks and have an overall higher lifetime task repertoire than other sterile workers within the colony. Consistent with predicted behavioral demands, soldiers had higher relative visual (optic lobe) investment than non-soldiers but only during the period when they were performing the most visually demanding defense task (hovering guarding). As soldiers aged into the less visually demanding task of standing guarding this difference disappeared. Neural investment was otherwise similar across all colony members. Despite having larger task repertoires, soldiers had similar absolute brain size and smaller relative brain size compared to other workers, meaning that lifetime task repertoire size was a poor predictor of brain size. Both high behavioral specialization in stable environmental conditions and reassignment across task groups during a crisis occur in <i>T. angustula</i>. The differences in neurobiology we report here are consistent with these specialized but flexible defense strategies. This work broadens our understanding of how neurobiology mediates age and morphological task specialization in highly cooperative societies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Ultrastructural analysis of the morphological phenotypes of microglia associated with neuro‐inflammatory cues</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that are responsible for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. There is a plethora of evidence to suggest that microglia display distinct phenotypes that are associated with the alteration of cell morphology under varying environmental cues. However, it has not been fully explored how the varying states of microglial activation are linked to the alteration of microglia morphology, especially in the microdomain. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuro-inflammatory cues. To address this, a human cell line of microglia was stimulated by anti-inflammatory (IL-4), pro-inflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ, Aβ + TNF-α). The resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain were analyzed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Our findings demonstrated that microglial activation under pro-inflammatory and AD-cues were closely linked to changes not only in cell shape, but also in cell surface topography and higher-order branching of processes. Furthermore, our results revealed that microglia under pro-inflammatory cues exhibited unique morphological features involving cell-to-cell contact and the formation of vesicle-like structures. Our study provides insight into the fine details of microglia morphology associated with varying status of microglial activation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-linked suppression of lipoxin A4 mediates cognitive deficits in mice and humans</a></h4>

              
                Age increases the risk for cognitive impairment and is the single major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. The pathophysiological processes triggered by aging that render the brain vulnerable to dementia involve, at least in part, changes in inflammatory mediators. Here we show that lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a lipid mediator of inflammation resolution known to stimulate endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, is reduced in the aging central nervous system. We demonstrate that genetic suppression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), the enzyme mediating LXA4 synthesis, promotes learning impairment in mice. Conversely, administration of exogenous LXA4 attenuated cytokine production and memory loss induced by inflammation in mice. We further show that cerebrospinal fluid LXA4 is reduced in patients with dementia and positively associates with memory performance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and AD-linked amyloid-{beta}. Our findings suggest that reduced LXA4 levels may lead to vulnerability to age-related cognitive disorders and that promoting LXA4 signaling may comprise an effective strategy to prevent early cognitive decline in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">New neurons in old brains: A cautionary tale for the analysis of neurogenesis in post-mortem tissue.</a></h4>

              
                Adult neurogenesis has primarily been examined in two key regions in the mammalian brain, the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. The proliferation and integration of newly generated neurons has been observed widely in adult mammalian species including the human hippocampus. Recent high-profile studies have suggested however, that this process is considerably reduced in humans, occurring in children but declining rapidly and nearly completely in the adult brain. In comparison, rodent studies also show age-related decline but a greater degree of proliferation of new neurons in adult animals. Here, we examine whether differences in tissue fixation, rather than biological difference in human versus rodent studies might account for the diminished levels of neurogenesis sometimes observed in the human brain. To do so we analyzed neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rats that were either perfusion-fixed or the brains extracted and immersion-fixed at various post-mortem intervals. We observed an interaction between animal age and the time delay between death and tissue fixation. While similar levels of neurogenesis were observed in young rats regardless of fixation, older rats had significantly fewer labeled neurons when fixation was not immediate. Furthermore, the morphological detail of the labeled neurons was significantly reduced in the delayed fixation conditions at all ages. This study highlights critical concerns that must be considered when using post-mortem tissue to quantify adult neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliable population utility signal from diverse economic value coding in orbitofrontal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Economic value encapsulates the subjective combination of reward magnitude and probability. We investigated the mechanism for subjective value computation in single neurons using an economic axiomatic approach. We found that single neurons in the macaque orbitofrontal cortex, known to be sensitive to reward magnitude and probability, encode the economic value functions (utility and probability weighting) in a heterogeneous manner, such that the activity of individual neurons did not match the animal's choices. However, the utility and probability weighting code from a population of these varied neurons reliably matched the animals' choices and risk attitudes. Thus, the neuronal population code for economic value amounted to a distributional representation of the formal economic functions. With a diverse single-unit economic value code converging into a reliable population-level utility code, this scheme suggests a brain mechanism for the flexible accommodation of multiple choice patterns and risk attitudes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maternal diet disrupts the placenta-brain axis in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                High maternal weight is associated with a number of detrimental outcomes in offspring, including increased susceptibility to neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and communicative disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorders). Despite widespread acknowledgement of sex-biases in the prevalence, incidence, and age of onset of these disorders, few studies have investigated potential sex-biased mechanisms underlying disorder susceptibility. Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate how maternal high-fat diet causes perinatal inflammation that influences sex-specific behavioral outcomes in offspring. In male high-fat diet offspring, increased macrophage toll like receptor 4 signaling results in excess phagocytosis of serotonin neurons in the developing dorsal raphe nucleus, decreasing serotonin bioavailability in the fetal and adult brain. Bulk sequencing from a large cohort of matched first trimester human fetal brain, placenta, and maternal decidua samples reveals sex-specific transcriptome-wide changes in placenta and brain tissue. Further, we find that fetal brain serotonin is significantly negatively correlated with maternal triglyceride accumulation (a proxy for dietary fat content) in male pregnancies only. These findings uncover a fundamental mechanism through which maternal diet may increase offspring susceptibility for neuropsychiatric disorder development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher-order interaction of brain microstructural and functional connectome</a></h4>

              
                Despite a relatively fixed anatomical structure, the human brain can support rich cognitive functions, triggering particular interest in investigating structure-function relationships. Myelin is a vital brain microstructure marker, yet the individual microstructure-function relationship is poorly understood. Here, we explore the brain microstructure-function relationships using a higher-order framework. Global (network-level) higher-order microstructure-function relationships negatively correlate with male participants' personality scores and decline with aging. Nodal (node-level) higher-order microstructure-function relationships are not aligned uniformly throughout the brain, being stronger in association cortices and lower in sensory cortices, showing gender differences. Notably, higher-order microstructure-function relationships are maintained from the whole-brain to local circuits, which uncovers a compelling and straightforward principle of brain structure-function interactions. Additionally, targeted artificial attacks can disrupt these higher-order relationships, and the main results are robust against several factors. Together, our results increase the collective knowledge of higher-order structure- function interactions that may underlie cognition, individual differences, and aging.

                Animal locomotion is hypothesized to be controlled by a central pattern generator in the spinal cord. Experiments and models show that rhythm generating neurons and genetically determined network properties could sustain oscillatory output activity suitable for locomotion. However, current CPG models do not explain how a spinal cord circuitry, which has the same basic genetic plan across species, can adapt to control the different biomechanical properties and locomotion patterns existing in these species. Here we demonstrate that rhythmic and alternating movements in pendulum models can be learned by a monolayer spinal cord circuitry model using the BCM learning rule, which has been previously proposed to explain learning in the visual cortex. These results provide an alternative theory to CPG models, because rhythm generating neurons and genetically defined connectivity are not required in our model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The overlapping modular organization of human brain functional networks across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Previous lifespan studies have demonstrated that the brain functional modular organization would change along with the adult lifespan. Yet, they assumed mutual exclusion among functional modules, ignoring convergent evidence for the existence of modular overlap. To reveal how age affects the overlapping functional modular organization, this study applied a detection algorithm requiring no prior knowledge of the resting-state fMRI data of a healthy cohort (N = 570, 18-88 years). Age-related regression analyses found a linear decrease in the overlapping modularity and the similarity of modular structure and overlapping node (i.e., region involved in multiple modules) distribution. The number of overlapping nodes increased with age, but the increment was distributed unevenly. In addition, across the adult lifespan and within each age group, the nodal overlapping probability consistently exhibited positive correlations with both functional gradient and flexibility. Further, we showed that the influence of age on memory-related cognitive performance might be explained by the change in the overlapping functional modular organization. Together, our results revealed age-related decreased segregation from the perspective of brain functional overlapping modular organization, providing new insight into the adult lifespan change in brain function and its influence on cognitive performance.

                Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) relieves many motor symptoms of Parkinson Disease (PD), but its underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Since its advent, three major theories have been proposed: (1) DBS inhibits the STN and basal ganglia output; (2) DBS antidromically activates motor cortex; and (3) DBS disrupts firing dynamics within the STN. Previously, stimulation-related electrical artifacts limited mechanistic investigations using electrophysiology. We used electrical artifact-free calcium imaging to investigate activity in basal ganglia nuclei during STN DBS in parkinsonian mice. To test whether the observed changes in activity were sufficient to relieve motor symptoms, we then combined electrophysiological recording with targeted optical DBS protocols. Our findings suggest that STN DBS exerts its therapeutic effect through the disruption of STN dynamics, rather than inhibition or antidromic activation. These results provide insight into optimizing PD treatments and establish an approach for investigating DBS in other neuropsychiatric conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurotransmission and neuromodulation systems in the learning and memory network of Octopus vulgaris</a></h4>

              
                The vertical lobe (VL) in the octopus brain plays an essential role in its sophisticated learning and memory. Early anatomical studies suggested that the VL is organized in a fan-out fan-in connectivity matrix comprising only three morphologically identified neuron types; input axons from the superior frontal lobe (SFL) innervating en passant millions of small amacrine interneurons (AMs) which converge sharply onto large VL output neurons (LNs). Recent physiological studies confirmed the feedforward excitatory connectivity: a glutamatergic synapse at the first SFL-to-AM synaptic layer and a cholinergic AM-to-LNs synapse. SFL-to-AMs synapses show a robust hippocampal-like activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmitter release. 5-HT, octopamine, dopamine and nitric oxide modulate short- and long-term VL synaptic plasticity. Here we present a comprehensive histolabeling study to better characterize the neural elements in the VL. We generally confirmed glutamatergic SFLs and cholinergic AMs. Intense labeling for NOS activity in the AMs neurites fitted with the NO-dependent presynaptic LTP mechanism at the SFL-to-AM synapse. New discoveries here reveal more heterogeneity of the VL neurons than previously thought. GABAergic AMs suggest a subpopulation of inhibitory interneurons in the first input layer. Clear GABA labeling in the cell bodies of LNs supported an inhibitory VL output yet the LNs co-expressed FMRFamide-like neuropeptides suggesting an additional neuromodulatory role of the VL output. Furthermore, a group of LNs was glutamatergic. A new cluster of cells organized in a deep nucleus showed rich catecholaminergic labeling and may play a role in intrinsic neuromodulation. In situ hybridization and immunolabeling allowed characterization and localization of a rich array of neuropeptides and neuromodulatores, likely involved in reward/punishment signals. This analysis of the fast transmission system, together with the newly found cellular elements helps integrate behavioral, physiological, pharmacological and connectome findings into a more comprehensive understanding of an efficient learning and memory network

                Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) is a set of birth defects caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy. Microcephaly is its main feature, but other brain abnormalities are found in CZS patients, such as ventriculomegaly, brain calcifications, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Many studies have focused on microcephaly, but it remains unknown how ZIKV infection leads to callosal malformation. To tackle this issue, we infected mouse embryos in utero with Brazilian ZIKV and found that they are born with a reduction in callosal area and density of callosal neurons. ZIKV infection also causes a density reduction of PH3+ cells, intermediate progenitor cells and SATB2+ neurons. Moreover, axonal tracing revealed that callosal axons are reduced and misrouted. Also, ZIKV infected cultures show a reduction of callosal axon length. GFAP labelling showed that in utero infection compromises glial cells responsible for midline axon guidance. The RNA-Seq data from infected brains identified downregulation of axon guidance and axonogenesis related genes. In sum, we showed that ZIKV infection impairs critical steps of corpus callosum formation by disrupting not only neurogenesis but also axon guidance and growth across the midline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-state functional connectivity of social brain regions predicts motivated dishonesty</a></h4>

              
                Motivated dishonesty is a typical social behavior varying from person to person. Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is capable of identifying unique patterns from functional connectivity (FC) between brain networks. To identify the relevant neural patterns and build an interpretable model to predict dishonesty, we scanned 8-min rsfMRI before an information-passing task. In the task, we employed monetary rewards to induce dishonesty. We applied both connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis to examine the association between FC and dishonesty. CPM indicated that the stronger FC between fronto-parietal and default mode networks can predict a higher dishonesty rate. The ROIs were set in the regions involving four cognitive processes (self-reference, cognitive control, reward valuation, and moral regulation). The ROI analyses showed that a stronger FC between these regions and the prefrontal cortex can predict a higher dishonesty rate. Our study offers an integrated model to predict dishonesty with rsfMRI, and the results suggest that the frequent motivated dishonest behavior may require a higher engagement of social brain regions.

                Technical advances in artificial manipulation of neural activity have precipitated a surge in studying the causal contribution of brain circuits to cognition and behavior. However, complexities of neural circuits challenge interpretation of experimental results, necessitating theoretical frameworks for systematic explorations. Here, we take a step in this direction, using, as a testbed, recurrent neural networks trained to perform a perceptual decision. We show that understanding the computations implemented by network dynamics enables predicting the magnitude of perturbation effects based on changes in the network's phase plane. Inactivation effects are weaker for distributed network architectures, are more easily discovered with non-discrete behavioral readouts (e.g., reaction times), and vary considerably across multiple tasks implemented by the same circuit. Finally, networks that can "learn" during inactivation recover function quickly, often much faster than the original training time. Our framework explains past empirical observations by clarifying how complex circuits compensate and adapt to perturbations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Self-Organization of Spatio-Temporal Pattern Selectivity</a></h4>

              
                Spiking model neurons can be set up to respond selectively to specific spatio-temporal spike patterns by optimization of their input weights. It is unknown, however, if existing synaptic plasticity mechanisms can achieve this temporal mode of neuronal coding and computation. Here it is shown that changes of synaptic efficacies which tend to balance excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs can make neurons sensitive to particular input spike patterns. Simulations demonstrate that a combination of Hebbian mechanisms, hetero-synaptic plasticity and synaptic scaling is sufficient for self-organizing sensitivity for spatio-temporal spike patterns that repeat in the input. In networks inclusion of hetero-synaptic plasticity leads to specialization and faithful representation of pattern sequences by a group of target neurons. Pattern detection is found to be robust against a range of distortions and noise. Furthermore, the resulting balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs protects the memory for a specific pattern from being overwritten during ongoing learning when the pattern is not present. These results not only provide an explanation for experimental observations of balanced excitation and inhibition in cortex but also promote the plausibility of precise temporal coding in the brain.

                The preservation of cognitive function into old age is a public health priority. Cerebral hypoperfusion is a hallmark of dementia but its impact on maintaining cognitive ability across the lifespan is less clear. We investigated the relationship between baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response during a fluid reasoning task in a population-based adult lifespan cohort (N=227, age 18-88 years). As age differences in baseline CBF could lead to non-neuronal contributions to the BOLD signal, we introduced commonality analysis to neuroimaging, in order to dissociate performance-related CBF effects from the physiological confounding effects of CBF on the BOLD response. Accounting for CBF, we confirmed that performance- and age-related differences in BOLD responses in the multiple-demand network (MDN) implicated in fluid reasoning. Differences in baseline CBF across the lifespan explained not only performance-related BOLD responses, but also performance-independent BOLD responses. Our results suggest that baseline CBF is important for maintaining cognitive function, while its non-neuronal contributions to BOLD signals reflect an age-related confound. Maintaining perfusion into old age may serve to support brain function with behavioural advantage, regulating brain health.

                The comprehensive integration of structural and functional connectivity data is required for the accurate modeling of brain functions. While resources for studying structural connectivity of non-human primate marmoset brains already exist, their integration with functional connectivity data has remained unavailable. Therefore, we present a comprehensive resource for marmoset brain mapping, which integrates the largest awake resting-state fMRI dataset to date (39 marmosets, 709 runs, and 12053 mins), cellular-level neuronal-tracing dataset (52 marmosets and 143 injections), and multi-resolution diffusion MRI dataset. The combination of these data into the same MRI space allowed us to 1). map the fine-detailed functional networks and cortical parcellations; 2). develop a deep-learning-based parcellation generator to preserve the topographical organization of functional connectivity and reflect individual variabilities; 3). investigate the structural basis underlying functional connectivity by computational modeling. Our resource will broadly model the marmoset brain architecture and facilitate future comparative and translational studies of primate brains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Real-time Image Denoising of Mixed Poisson-Gaussian Noise in Fluorescence Microscopy Images using ImageJ</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescence microscopy imaging speed is fundamentally limited by the measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To improve image SNR for a given image acquisition rate, computational denoising techniques can be used to suppress noise. However, analytical techniques to estimate a denoised image from a single frame are either computationally expensive or rely on simple noise statistical models. These models assume Poisson or Gaussian noise statistics, which are not appropriate for many fluorescence microscopy applications that contain quantum shot noise and electronic Johnson-Nyquist noise, and therefore a mixture of Poisson and Gaussian noise. In this paper, we show convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on mixed Poisson and Gaussian noise images to overcome the limitations of existing image denoising methods. The trained CNN is presented as an open-source ImageJ plugin that performs instant image denoising (within tens of milliseconds) with superior performance (~8.1 dB SNR improvement) compared to the conventional fluorescence microscopy denoising methods. The method is validated on external datasets with out-of-distribution noise and contrast from the training data and consistently achieves high performance (>8dB) denoising in less time than other fluorescence microscopy denoising methods.

                Microglial phagocytosis is rapidly emerging as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. An efficient removal of cellular debris is necessary to prevent buildup damage of neighbor neurons and the development of an inflammatory response. As the brain professional phagocytes, microglia are equipped with an array of mechanisms that enable them to recognize and degrade several types of cargo, including neurons undergoing apoptotic cell death. While microglia are very competent phagocytes of apoptotic cells under physiological conditions, here we report their dysfunction in mouse and monkey (Macaca fascicularis and Callithrix jacchus) models of stroke by transient occlusion of the medial cerebral artery (tMCAo). The impairment of both engulfment and degradation was related to energy depletion triggered by oxygen and nutrients deprivation (OND), which led to reduced process motility, lysosomal depletion, and the induction of a protective autophagy response in microglia. Basal autophagy, which is in charge of removing and recycling intracellular elements, was critical to maintain microglial physiology, including survival and phagocytosis, as we determined both in vivo and in vitro using knock-out models of autophagy genes and the autophagy inhibitor MRT68921. Notably, the autophagy inducer rapamycin partially prevented the phagocytosis impairment induced by tMCAo in vivo but not by OND in vitro. These results suggest a more complex role of microglia in stroke than previously acknowledged, classically related to the inflammatory response. In contrast, here we demonstrate the impairment of apoptotic cell phagocytosis, a microglial function critical for brain recovery. We propose that phagocytosis is a therapeutic target yet to be explored and provide evidence that it can be modulated in vivo using rapamycin, setting the stage for future therapies for stroke patients.

                Invasive tract-tracing studies in rodents implicate a direct connection between the subiculum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) as a key component of neural pathways mediating hippocampal regulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. A clear characterisation of the connections linking the subiculum and BNST in humans and non-human primates is lacking. To address this, we first delineated the projections from the subiculum to the BNST using anterograde tracers injected into macaque monkeys, revealing evidence for a monosynaptic subiculum-BNST projection involving the fornix. Second, we used in vivo diffusion MRI tractography in macaques and humans to demonstrate substantial subiculum complex connectivity to the BNST in both species. This connection was primarily mediated through the fornix, with additional connectivity via the amygdala, consistent with rodent anatomy. Third, utilising the twin-based nature of our human sample, we found that microstructural properties of these tracts are moderately heritable (h2 ~ 0.5). In a final analysis, we found no evidence of any significant association between subiculum complex-BNST tract microstructure and indices of perceived stress/dispositional negativity and alcohol use, derived from principal component analysis decomposition of self-report data. We did, however, find subiculum complex-BNST tract microstructure associations with BMI, age, and sex. Our findings address a key translational gap in our knowledge of the neurocircuitry regulating stress.

                We demonstrate a simple, low-cost two-photon microscope design with both galvo-galvo and resonant-galvo scanning capabilities. We quantify and compare the signal-to-noise ratios and imaging speeds of the galvo-galvo and resonant-galvo scanning modes when used for murine neurovascular imaging. The two scanning modes perform as expected under shot-noise limited detection and are found to achieve comparable signal-to-noise ratios. Resonant-galvo scanning is capable of reaching desired signal-to-noise ratios using less acquisition time when higher excitation power can be used. Given equal excitation power and total pixel dwell time between the two methods, galvo-galvo scanning outperforms resonant-galvo scanning in image quality when detection deviates from being shot-noise limited.

                Electrophysiological biomarkers reflecting the pathological activities in the basal ganglia are essential to gain an etiological understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) and develop a method of diagnosing and treating the disease. Previous studies that explored electrophysiological biomarkers in PD have focused mainly on oscillatory or periodic activities such as beta and gamma oscillations. Emerging evidence has suggested that the nonoscillatory, aperiodic component reflects the firing rate and synaptic current changes corresponding to cognitive and pathological states. Nevertheless, it has never been thoroughly examined whether the aperiodic component can be used as a biomarker that reflect pathological activities in the basal ganglia in PD. In this study, we examined the parameters of the aperiodic component and tested its practicality as an electrophysiological biomarker of pathological activity in PD. We found that a set of aperiodic parameters, aperiodic offset and exponent, were significantly decreased by the nigrostriatal lesion. To further prove the usefulness of the parameters as biomarkers, acute levodopa treatment reverted the aperiodic offset. We then compared the aperiodic parameters with a previously established periodic biomarker of PD, beta frequency oscillation. We found a moderately significant negative correlation with beta power. Finally, taking the aperiodic parameters into account, we could significantly improve the beta power-based prediction of pathological activities in the basal ganglia, demonstrating the validity of these parameters as biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural brain connectivity predicts acute pain after mild traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Mild traumatic brain injury, mTBI, is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with acute pain manifesting as one of its most debilitating symptoms. Understanding acute post-injury pain is important since it is a strong predictor of long-term outcomes. In this study, we imaged the brains of 172 patients with mTBI, following a motorized vehicle collision and used a machine learning approach to extract white matter structural and resting state fMRI functional connectivity measures to predict acute pain. Stronger white matter tracts within the sensorimotor, thalamic-cortical, and default-mode systems predicted 20% of the variance in pain severity within 72 hours of the injury. This result generalized in two independent groups: 39 mTBI patients and 13 mTBI patients without whiplash symptoms. White matter measures collected at 6-months after the collision still predicted mTBI pain at that timepoint (n = 36). These white-matter connections were associated with two nociceptive psychophysical outcomes tested at a remote body site - namely conditioned pain modulation and magnitude of suprathreshold pain-, and with pain sensitivity questionnaire scores. Our validated findings demonstrate a stable white-matter network, the properties of which determine a significant amount of pain experienced after acute injury, pinpointing a circuitry engaged in the transformation and amplification of nociceptive inputs to pain perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse roles of MeCP2 in the specification and maintenance of midbrain dopamine phenotype.</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are associated with locomotor and psychiatric disorders. DA neuronal phenotype is specified in ancestral progenitors and maintained throughout differentiation. Here we demonstrate that premature MeCP2 expression prevents DA progenitors from acquiring DA phenotype through interfering NURR1 transactivation. By contrast, the maintenance of DA phenotype is not affected by MeCP2 overexpression in DA neurons. By analyzing the DNA methylation and MeCP2 binding to the promoter of DA phenotype gene tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) along differentiation, we show that Th expression is determined by TET1-mediated de-methylation of NURR1 binding sites within Th promoter. Premature MeCP2 dominates the DNA binding of these sites thereby blocking TET1 function in DA progenitors, whereas TET1 prevents excessive MeCP2 binding in DA neurons. Finally, we show that targeted de-methylation in DA progenitors protects phenotype specification from premature MeCP2 expression, whereas targeted methylation disturbs phenotype maintenance in MeCP2-overexpressed DA neurons. These findings demonstrate MeCP2 as a novel determining factor for DA neuronal phenotype and function.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor decline and the aggregation of -synuclein protein. Growing evidence suggests that -synuclein aggregates may spread from neurons of the digestive tract to the brain in a prion-like manner. While rodent models have recapitulated gut-to-brain -synuclein transmission, animal models that are amenable to high-throughput investigations are needed to facilitate the discovery of disease mechanisms. Here we describe the first C. elegans models in which feeding with -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) induced prion-like dopamine neuron degeneration and seeding of aggregation of human -synuclein expressed in the host. PFF acceleration of -synuclein aggregation in C. elegans muscle cells was associated with a progressive motor deficit, whereas feeding with -synuclein monomer produced much milder effects. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the C. elegans syndecan sdn-1, and enzymes involved in heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthesis, afforded protection from PFF-induced seeding of aggregation and toxicity, as well as dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This work offers new models by which to investigate gut-derived -synuclein spreading and propagation of disease.

                Dynamics of excitable cells and networks depend on the membrane time constant, set by membrane resistance and capacitance. Whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of ionic conductances are routine in electrophysiology, experimental control over capacitance remains a challenge. Here, we present capacitance clamp, an approach that allows to mimic a modified capacitance in biological neurons via an unconventional application of the dynamic clamp technique. We first demonstrate the feasibility to quantitatively modulate capacitance in a mathematical neuron model and then confirm the functionality of capacitance clamp in in vitro experiments in granule cells of rodent dentate gyrus with up to threefold virtual capacitance changes. Clamping of capacitance thus constitutes a novel technique to probe and decipher mechanisms of neuronal signaling in ways that were so far inaccessible to experimental electrophysiology.

                Voluntary movements are accompanied by increased oscillatory activity or synchronization in the gamma range (> 25.5 Hz) within the sensorimotor system. Despite the extensive literature about movement-related gamma synchronization, the specific role of gamma oscillations for movement control is still debated. In this study, we characterized movement-related gamma oscillatory dynamics and its relationship with movement characteristics based on 256-channels EEG recordings in 64 healthy subjects while performing fast and uncorrected reaching movements to targets located at three distances. We found that movement-related gamma synchronization occurred during both movement planning and execution, albeit with different gamma peak frequencies and topographies. Also, the amplitude of gamma synchronization in both planning and execution increased with target distance. Additional analysis of phase coherence revealed a gamma-coordinated long-range network involving occipital, frontal and central regions during movement execution. Gamma synchronization amplitude and phase coherence pattern reliably predicted peak velocity amplitude and timing, thus suggesting that cortical gamma oscillations play a significant role in the selection of appropriate kinematic parameters during planning and in their implementation during movement execution.

                Objectives: Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain. Brain injury can activate the microglia and induce its directional migration towards injury sites for exerting immune functions. While extracellular ATP released from the injury site mediates the directionality of activated microglia's migration, what endows activated microglia with migration capability remains largely unexplored. Methods: In the present study, we used the larval zebrafish as an in vivo model to visualize the dynamics of both morphology and Ca2+ activity of microglia during its migration evoked by local brain injury. Results: We found that, in response to local injury, activated microglia exhibited an immediate Ca2+ transient and later elevated Ca2+ bursts frequency during its migration towards the local injury site (P < 0.01). Furthermore, suppression of Ca2+ activities significantly retarded microglial migration (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Thus, our study suggests that intracellular Ca2+ activity is required for activated microglia's migration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The use of principal component analysis to measure fundamental cognitive processes in neuropsychological data</a></h4>

              
                For years, dissociation studies on neurological single cases were the dominant method to infer fundamental cognitive functions in neuropsychology. In contrast, the association between deficits was considered to be of less epistemological value and even misleading. Still, principal component analysis (PCA), an associational method for dimensionality reduction, recently became popular for the identification of fundamental functions. The current study evaluated the ability of PCA to identify the fundamental variables underlying a battery of measures. Synthetic data were simulated to resemble typical neuropsychological data, including varying dissociation patterns. In most experiments, PCA succeeded to measure the underlying target variables with high up to almost perfect precision. However, this success relied on additional factor rotation. Unroated PCA struggled with the dependence of data and often failed. On the other hand, the performance of rotated factor solutions required single measures that anchored the rotation. When no test scores existed that primarily and precisely measured each underlying target variable, rotated solutions also failed their intended purpose. Further, the dimensionality of the simulated data was consistently underestimated. Commonly used strategies to estimate the number of meaningful factors appear to be inappropriate for neuropsychological data. Finally, simulations suggested a high potential of PCA to denoise data, with factor rotation providing an additional filter function. This can be invaluable in neuropsychology, where measures are often inherently noisy, and PCA can be superior to common compound measures - such as the arithmetic mean - in the measurement of variables with high reliability. In summary, PCA appears to be a powerful tool in neuropsychology that is well capable to infer fundamental cognitive functions with high precision, but the typical structure of neuropsychological data places clear limitations and a risk of a complete methodological failure on the method.

                Schizophrenia has a complex etiology and symptomatology that is difficult to untangle. After decades of research, important advancements towards a central biomarker are still lacking. One of the missing pieces is a better understanding of how non-linear neural dynamics are altered in this patient population. In this study, the resting-state neuromagnetic signals of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls were analyzed in the framework of criticality. When biological systems like the brain are in a state of criticality, they are thought to be functioning at maximum efficiency (e.g., optimal communication and storage of information) and with maximum adaptability to incoming information. Here, we assessed the self-similarity and multifractality of resting-state brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography in patients with schizophrenia patients and in matched controls. Our analysis showed a clear ascending, rostral to caudal gradient of self-similarity values in healthy controls, and an opposite gradient for multifractality (descending values, rostral to caudal). Schizophrenia patients had similar, although attenuated, gradients of self-similarity and multifractality values. Statistical tests showed that patients had higher values of self-similarity than controls in fronto-temporal regions, indicative of more regularity and memory in the signal. In contrast, patients had less multifractality than controls in the parietal and occipital regions, indicative of less diverse singularities and reduced variability in the signal. In addition, supervised machine-learning, based on logistic regression, successfully discriminated the two groups using measures of self-similarity and multifractality as features. Our results provide new insights into the baseline cognitive functioning of schizophrenia patients by identifying key alterations of criticality properties in their resting-state brain data.

                Interoceptors, sensory neurons that monitor internal organs and states, are essential for physiological homeostasis and generating internal perceptions. Here we describe a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of interoceptors of the mouse lung, defining 10 molecular subtypes that differ in developmental origin, myelination, receptive fields, terminal morphologies, and cell contacts. Each subtype expresses a unique but overlapping combination of sensory receptors that detect diverse physiological and pathological stimuli, and each can signal to distinct sets of lung cells including immune cells, forming a local neuroimmune interaction network. Functional interrogation of two mechanosensory subtypes reveals exquisitely-specific homeostatic roles in breathing, one regulating inspiratory time and the other inspiratory flow. The results suggest that lung interoceptors encode diverse and dynamic sensory information rivaling that of canonical exteroceptors, and this information is used to drive myriad local cellular interactions and enable precision control of breathing, while providing only vague perceptions of organ states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PatchWarp: Corrections of non-uniform image distortions in two-photon calcium imaging data by patchwork affine transformations</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon microscopy has been widely used to record the activity of populations of individual neurons at high spatial resolution in behaving animals. The ability to perform imaging for an extended period of time allows the investigation of activity changes associated with behavioral states and learning. However, imaging often accompanies shifts of the imaging field, including rapid (~100ms) translation and slow, spatially non-uniform distortion. To combat this issue and obtain a stable time series of the target structures, motion correction algorithms are commonly applied. However, typical motion correction algorithms are limited to full field translation of images and are unable to correct non-uniform distortions. Here, we developed a novel algorithm, PatchWarp, to robustly correct slow image distortion for calcium imaging data. PatchWarp is a two-step algorithm with rigid and non-rigid image registrations. To correct non-uniform image distortions, it splits the imaging field and estimates the best affine transformation matrix for each of the subfields. The distortion-corrected subfields are stitched together like a patchwork to reconstruct the distortion-corrected imaging field. We show that PatchWarp robustly corrects image distortions of calcium imaging data collected from various cortical areas through glass window or GRIN lens with a higher accuracy than existing non-rigid algorithms. Furthermore, it provides a fully automated method of registering images from different imaging sessions for longitudinal neural activity analyses. PatchWarp improves the quality of neural activity analyses and would be useful as a general approach to correct image distortions in a wide range of disciplines.

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to death and disability, resulting in an enormous individual and socio-economic challenges. Despite huge efforts, there are still controversies on treatment strategies and early outcome estimation. We evaluate current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TBI according to their fulfillment of the CONSORT (Consolidated Statement of Reporting Trials) statement’s criteria as a marker of transparency and the quality of study planning and realization. A PubMed search for RCTs on TBI (January 2014–December 2019) was carried out. After screening of the abstracts (n = 1.926), the suitable full text manuscripts (n = 72) were assessed for the fulfillment of the CONSORT criteria. The mean ratio of consort statement fulfillment was 59% (±13%), 31% of the included studies (n = 22) complied with less than 50% of the CONSORT criteria. Citation frequency was moderately related to ratio of CONSORT item fulfillment (r = 0.4877; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and citation frequency per year (r = 0.5249; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The ratio of CONSORT criteria fulfillment was associated with the impact factor of the publishing journal (r = 0.6428; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Essential data for study interpretation, such as sample size determination (item 7a), participant flow (item 13a) as well as losses and exclusions (item 13b), were only reported in 53%, 60% and 63%, respectively. Reporting and methodological aspects in RCTs on TBI still may be improved. Thus, the interpretation of study results may be hampered due to methodological weaknesses.</p>

	<p>One of the core problems for people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is the impairment of their ability to walk, which can be severely restrictive in everyday life. Therefore, monitoring of ambulatory function is of great importance to be able to effectively counteract disease progression. An extensive gait analysis, such as the Dresden protocol for multidimensional walking assessment, covers several facets of walking impairment including a 2-min walk test, in which the distance taken by the patient in two minutes is measured by an odometer. Using this approach, it is questionable how precise the measuring methods are at recording the distance traveled. In this project, we investigate whether the current measurement can be replaced by a digital measurement method based on accelerometers (six Opal sensors from the Mobility Lab system) that are attached to the patient’s body. We developed two algorithms using these data and compared the validity of these approaches using the results from 2-min walk tests from 562 pwMS that were collected with a gold-standard odometer. In 48.4% of pwMS, we detected an average relative measurement error of less than 5%, while results from 25.8% of the pwMS showed a relative measurement error of up to 10%. The algorithm had difficulties correctly calculating the walking distances in another 25.8% of pwMS; these results showed a measurement error of more than 20%. A main reason for this moderate performance was the variety of pathologically altered gait patterns in pwMS that may complicate the step detection. Overall, both algorithms achieved favorable levels of agreement (r = 0.884 and r = 0.980) with the odometer. Finally, we present suggestions for improvement of the measurement system to be implemented in the future.</p>

	<p>One fundamental principle of the brain functional organization is the elaboration of sensory information for the specification of action plans that are most appropriate for interaction with the environment. Using an incidental go/no-go priming paradigm, we have previously shown a facilitation effect for the execution of a walking-related action in response to far vs. near objects/locations in the extrapersonal space, and this effect has been called “macro-affordance” to reflect the role of locomotion in the coverage of extrapersonal distance. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of such an effect by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from 30 human participants during the same paradigm. The results of a whole-brain analysis indicated a significant modulation of the event-related potentials (ERPs) both during prime and target stimulus presentation. Specifically, consistent with a mechanism of action anticipation and automatic activation of affordances, a stronger ERP was observed in response to prime images framing the environment from a far vs. near distance, and this modulation was localized in dorso-medial motor regions. In addition, an inversion of polarity for far vs. near conditions was observed during the subsequent target period in dorso-medial parietal regions associated with spatially directed foot-related actions. These findings were interpreted within the framework of embodied models of brain functioning as arising from a mechanism of motor-anticipation and subsequent prediction error which was guided by the preferential affordance relationship between the distant large-scale environment and locomotion. More in general, our findings reveal a sensory-motor mechanism for the processing of walking-related environmental affordances.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV) changes in insulo-opercular epilepsy (IOE) and after insulo-opercular surgery. Methods: We analyzed 5-min resting HRV of IOE patients before and after surgery. Patients’ SUDEP-7 risk inventory scores were also calculated. Results were compared with age- and sex-matched patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and healthy individuals. Results: There were no differences in HRV measurements between IOE, TLE, and healthy control groups (and within each IOE group and TLE group) in preoperative and postoperative periods. In IOE patients, the SUDEP-7 score was positively correlated with pNN50 (percentage of successive RR intervals that differ by more than 50 ms) (p = 0.008) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive RR interval differences) (p = 0.019). We stratified IOE patients into those whose preoperative RMSSD values were below (Group 1a = 7) versus above (Group 1b = 9) a cut-off threshold of 31 ms (median value of a healthy population from a previous study). In group 1a, all HRV values significantly increased after surgery. In group 1b, time-domain parameters significantly decreased postoperatively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that in IOE, HRV may be either decreased in parasympathetic tone or increased globally in both sympathetic and parasympathetic tones. We found no evidence that insulo-opercular surgeries lead to major autonomic dysfunction when a good seizure outcome is reached. The increase in parasympathetic tone observed preoperatively may be of clinical concern, as it was positively correlated with the SUDEP-7 score.</p>

Some social insect species exhibit the unusual population-level pattern of split sex ratio, wherein some colonies specialize in...

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Accurate Localization of Linear Probe Electrode Arrays across Multiple Brains</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recently developed probes for extracellular electrophysiological recordings have large numbers of electrodes on long linear shanks. Linear electrode arrays, such as Neuropixels probes, have hundreds of recording electrodes distributed over linear shanks that span several millimeters. Because of the length of the probes, linear probe recordings in rodents usually cover multiple brain areas. Typical studies collate recordings across several recording sessions and animals. Neurons recorded in different sessions and animals thus have to be aligned to each other and to a standardized brain coordinate system. Here, we evaluate two typical workflows for localization of individual electrodes in standardized coordinates. These workflows rely on imaging brains with fluorescent probe tracks and warping 3D image stacks to standardized brain atlases. One workflow is based on tissue clearing and selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), whereas the other workflow is based on serial block-face two-photon (SBF2P) microscopy. In both cases electrophysiological features are then used to anchor particular electrodes along the reconstructed tracks to specific locations in the brain atlas and therefore to specific brain structures. We performed groundtruth experiments, in which motor cortex outputs are labeled with ChR2 and a fluorescence protein. Light-evoked electrical activity and fluorescence can be independently localized. Recordings from brain regions targeted by the motor cortex reveal better than 0.1-mm accuracy for electrode localization, independent of workflow used.</p>

                Background: Vancomycin is an antibiotic of growing importance in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections; with a particular emphasis on its value in the fight against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Increasing reports of Vancomycin resistance have raised concerns about the effectiveness of this drug. Drug utilization evaluation has an important role in controlling rational use of antibiotics to prevent the emergence of resistance. Methods: We conducted a retrospective 6-months study at Jafar Ibn Auf pediatric hospital. Data including patient's demographics, diagnosis, Dosage regimen, and treatment duration were reviewed. The concordance of practice with the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) guidelines and principles of antibiotic therapy was assessed. Results: 127 medical records were reviewed in this study. Sepsis (29%) and Pneumonia (19.6%) were the most common indications. Culture test was requested in 20.5% of patients. Monitoring of serum creatinine was carried in 81.1% of patients. Based on HICPAC guidelines vancomycin was administered appropriately in 67.7% percent of cases. Considering the infusion rate, most of patients with specific order were received vancomycin in 1 hour. Conclusions: The results showed that vancomycin was used empirically without subsequent adjustment of the antimicrobial agent according to culture and sensitivity data and lack of paying enough attention to the infusion rate and serum creatinine monitoring.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Binding free energy decomposition and multiple unbinding paths of buried ligands in a PreQ1 riboswitch</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guodong Hu, Huan-Xiang Zhou</p>

Riboswitches are naturally occurring RNA elements that control bacterial gene expression by binding to specific small molecules. They serve as important models for RNA-small molecule recognition and have also become a novel class of targets for developing antibiotics. Here, we carried out conventional and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, totaling 153.5 μs, to characterize the determinants of binding free energies and unbinding paths for the cognate and synthetic ligands of a PreQ<sub>1</sub> riboswitch. Binding free energy analysis showed that two triplets of nucleotides U6-C15-A29 and G5-G11-C16, contribute the most to the binding of the cognate ligands, by hydrogen bonding and by base stacking, respectively. Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are essential in stabilizing the binding pocket. For the synthetic ligands, the hydrogen-bonding contributions of the U6-C15-A29 triplet are significantly compromised, and the bound state resembles the apo state in several respects, including the disengagement of the C15-A14-A13 and A32-G33 base stacks. The bulkier synthetic ligands lead to significantly loosening of the binding pocket, including extrusion of the C15 nucleobase and a widening of the C15-C30 groove. Enhanced-sampling simulations further revealed that the cognate and synthetic ligands unbind in almost opposite directions. Our work offers new insight for designing riboswitch ligands.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic divisive normalization circuits explain and predict change detection in monkey area MT</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Udo A. Ernst, Xiao Chen, Lisa Bohnenkamp, Fingal Orlando Galashan, Detlef Wegener</p>

Sudden changes in visual scenes often indicate important events for behavior. For their quick and reliable detection, the brain must be capable to process these changes as independently as possible from its current activation state. In motion-selective area MT, neurons respond to instantaneous speed changes with pronounced transients, often far exceeding the expected response as derived from their speed tuning profile. We here show that this complex, non-linear behavior emerges from the combined temporal dynamics of excitation and divisive inhibition, and provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis. A central prediction derived from this investigation is that attention increases the steepness of the transient response irrespective of the activation state prior to a stimulus change, and irrespective of the sign of the change (i.e. irrespective of whether the stimulus is accelerating or decelerating). Extracellular recordings of attention-dependent representation of both speed increments and decrements confirmed this prediction and suggest that improved change detection derives from basic computations in a canonical cortical circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the spatial and temporal constrains of the GABAergic influence on neuronal excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aniello Lombardi, Heiko J. Luhmann, Werner Kilb</p>

GABA (γ-amino butyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain that can mediate depolarizing responses during development or after neuropathological insults. Under which conditions GABAergic membrane depolarizations are sufficient to impose excitatory effects is hard to predict, as shunting inhibition and GABAergic effects on spatiotemporal filtering of excitatory inputs must be considered. To evaluate at which reversal potential a net excitatory effect was imposed by GABA (E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup>), we performed a detailed in-silico study using simple neuronal topologies and distinct spatiotemporal relations between GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs.
These simulations revealed for GABAergic synapses located at the soma an E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> close to action potential threshold (E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup>), while with increasing dendritic distance E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> shifted to positive values. The impact of GABA on AMPA-mediated inputs revealed a complex temporal and spatial dependency. E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> depends on the temporal relation between GABA and AMPA inputs, with a striking negative shift in E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> for AMPA inputs appearing after the GABA input. The spatial dependency between GABA and AMPA inputs revealed a complex profile, with E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> being shifted to values negative to E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup> for AMPA synapses located proximally to the GABA input, while for distally located AMPA synapses the dendritic distance had only a minor effect on E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup>. For tonic GABAergic conductances E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> was negative to E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup> over a wide range of g<sub>GABA</sub><sup>tonic</sup> values. In summary, these results demonstrate that for several physiologically relevant situations E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> is negative to E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup>, suggesting that depolarizing GABAergic responses can mediate excitatory effects even if E<sub>GABA</sub> did not reach E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup>.

Many vaccine candidates with promising results in preclinical testing fail in human trials. New complex human tissue models have the potential to improve the predictability of vaccine safety and efficacy in human clinical trials.

There is a need for better models to improve preclinical testing of vaccines. This Perspective article argues that advanced mucosal human tissue models could present a solution to this pressing problem in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">FERONIA and microtubules independently contribute to mechanical integrity in the Arabidopsis shoot</a></h4>

To survive, cells must constantly resist mechanical stress. In plants, this involves the reinforcement of cell walls, notably through microtubule-dependent cellulose deposition. How wall sensing might contribute to this response is unknown. Here, we tested whether the microtubule response to stress acts downstream of known wall sensors. Using a multistep screen with 11 mutant lines, we identify FERONIA (FER) as the primary candidate for the cell’s response to stress in the shoot. However, this does not imply that FER acts upstream of the microtubule response to stress. In fact, when performing mechanical perturbations, we instead show that the expected microtubule response to stress does not require FER. We reveal that the <i>feronia</i> phenotype can be partially rescued by reducing tensile stress levels. Conversely, in the absence of both microtubules and FER, cells appear to swell and burst. Altogether, this shows that the microtubule response to stress acts as an independent pathway to resist stress, in parallel to FER. We propose that both pathways are required to maintain the mechanical integrity of plant cells.

                <p>by Andreas Sagner, Isabel Zhang, Thomas Watson, Jorge Lazaro, Manuela Melchionda, James Briscoe</p>

The molecular mechanisms that produce the full array of neuronal subtypes in the vertebrate nervous system are incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence of a global temporal patterning program comprising sets of transcription factors that stratifies neurons based on the developmental time at which they are generated. This transcriptional code acts throughout the central nervous system, in parallel to spatial patterning, thereby increasing the diversity of neurons generated along the neuraxis. We further demonstrate that this temporal program operates in stem cell−derived neurons and is under the control of the TGFβ signaling pathway. Targeted perturbation of components of the temporal program, Nfia and Nfib, reveals their functional requirement for the generation of late-born neuronal subtypes. Together, our results provide evidence for the existence of a previously unappreciated global temporal transcriptional program of neuronal subtype identity and suggest that the integration of spatial and temporal patterning mechanisms diversifies and organizes neuronal subtypes in the vertebrate nervous system.

                Background: Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is critical to enhancing the ability to control commercial activities and results in a competitive advantage when combined with an organisation's existing competitive advantages. However, our practise review reveals that end users resist ERP implementation because the resulting changes will alter the current status quo. The implementation of an ERP system in an organisation is complex as it affects multiple areas of the business. Resistance to change is cited as a factor of ERP failure. Methods: In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review using Transfield’s five stages and established a conceptual framework for ERP system implementation in science and technology parks (STPs). Articles collected from Emerald, Science Direct, ProQuest and Scopus databases between 1st June 2021 and 15th June 2021. Two authors were assigned to check the suitability of the articles in order to avoid risk of bias. Articles were analysed based on components of a research paper and the data was tabulated using MS Excel. Results: Only eight papers (0.011% of all the papers) appeared when we searched for papers related to ERP with a focus on post ERP Implementation, end-user behaviours, organisational performance, and the accelerated SAP (system application and product) methodology. We found that there are hardly any articles on ERP post implementations in STP context particularly based on the evaluation part of accelerated SAP.   Conclusions: Results indicate the lack of studies in this field, particularly those addressing issues related to STP. This study attempted to broaden the understanding of the ERP's effectiveness, particularly in terms of an organisation's operational performance.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Natural History of Leigh Syndrome: A Study of Disease Burden and Progression</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This observational cohort study aims to quantify disease burden over time, establish disease progression rates, and identify factors that may determine the disease course of Leigh syndrome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy-two Leigh syndrome children who completed the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) at baseline at 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–7.6) and follow-up assessments at 7.5 years (IQR = 3.7–11.0) in clinics were enrolled. Eighty-two percent of this cohort had a confirmed genetic diagnosis, with pathogenic variants in the <i>MT-ATP6</i> and <i>SURF1</i> genes being the most common cause. The total NPMDS scores denoted mild (0–14), moderate (15–25), and severe (&gt;25) disease burden. Detailed clinical, neuroradiological, and molecular genetic findings were also analyzed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median total NPMDS scores rose significantly (<i>Z</i> = −6.9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and the percentage of children with severe disease burden doubled (22% → 42%) over 2.6 years of follow-up. Poor function (especially mobility, self-care, communication, feeding, and education) and extrapyramidal features contributed significantly to the disease burden (<i>τ</i>
<sub>b</sub> ≈ 0.45–0.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). These children also deteriorated to wheelchair dependence (31% → 57%), exclusive enteral feeding (22% → 46%), and one-to-one assistance for self-care (25% → 43%) during the study period. Twelve children (17%) died after their last NPMDS scores were recorded. These children had higher follow-up NPMDS scores (disease burden; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and steeper increase in NPMDS score per annum (disease progression; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Other predictors of poor outcomes include <i>SURF1</i> gene variants (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and bilateral caudate changes on neuroimaging (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study has objectively defined the disease burden and progression of Leigh syndrome. Our analysis has also uncovered potential influences on the trajectory of this neurodegenerative condition. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 impact: Customised economic stimulus package recommender system using machine learning techniques [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Malaysian government reacted to the pandemic’s economic effect with the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to cushion the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) impact on households. The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled “Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,” collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques—Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes—were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance.  Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP. These models can be used to design customised ESPs that can effectively manage the financial burden of low-income households.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HIV index testing services in urban Lusaka: a retrospective review of medical records [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As the proportions of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who do not know their HIV infection status decrease, reaching the remaining few who are asymptomatic and not in contact with the health care system becomes a critical challenge. Therefore, reaching the first 90 of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets will require effective and efficient HIV testing approaches. The number of PLHIV who know their HIV status and who receive antiretroviral therapy could increase by the expansion of index testing services. Methods: This project was a retrospective study looking at medical records of HIV positive clients who were elicited for index testing between October and December 2019. It was conducted in three high volume health facilities in Matero Urban sub-district 3 in Lusaka, Zambia. Results: The HIV test outcomes for index contacts were as follows: 452 index contacts (53.5%) tested HIV negative, 113 index contacts (13.4%) tested HIV positive, 108 index contacts (12.8%) were known HIV positive, and 172 index contacts (20.4%) were not yet tested for HIV. Of the 113 contacts who tested HIV positive, 90 index contacts started anti-retroviral therapy within 7 days (79.6%). The total number of 845 contacts were elicited from 604 index clients, giving a low elicitation ratio of 1:1.4. There was not much difference between gender for elicited contacts (423 men and 422 women). A total number of 565 index contacts were eligible for HIV test. 113 of them tested HIV positive, representing a positivity yield of 20%. Pearson Chi-Square test value was 0.498 and the p value was 0.481. This result is not significant since p value (0.481) is greater than the designated alpha level (0.05). Conclusions: HIV programs need to explore and address barriers to HIV partner testing services to avoid over-testing and maximize HIV case identification (thus, improving HIV testing positivity yield).

     alt="Microstructural profiles of thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity in patients with disorder of consciousness"/>
<p>Using the fixel-based analysis, we investigated white matter abnormalities of the thalamocortical connectivity in patients with disorder of consciousness. Altered connections were mainly connected to the middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and sensorimotor cortices and were mainly attributed to the microstructural changes in axonal density.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity are crucial for consciousness; however, their microstructural changes in patients with a disorder of consciousness (DOC) have not yet been thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we applied the novel fixel-based analysis to comprehensively investigate the thalamus-related microstructural abnormalities in 10 patients with DOC using 7-T diffusion-weighted imaging data. We found that compared to healthy controls, patients with DOC showed reduced fiber density (FD) and fiber density and cross-section (FDC) in the mediodorsal, anterior, and ventral anterior thalamic nuclei, while fiber-bundle cross-section (FC) was not significantly altered in the thalamus. Impaired thalamocortical connectivity in the DOC cohort was mainly connected to the middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and sensorimotor cortices, including the precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus, with predominant microstructural abnormalities in FD and FDC. Correlation analysis showed that FC of the right mediodorsal thalamus was negatively correlated with the level of consciousness. Our results suggest that microstructural abnormalities of thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity in DOC were mainly attributed to axonal injury. In particular, the microstructural integrity of the thalamus is a vital factor in consciousness generation.</p>

                Background: COVID-19 has shaken countries at all levels, putting public health at risk. Global efforts have allocated funding for the development of research for the development of vaccines, digital tools, epidemiologic, social, and economic studies. Although these efforts have been developed worldwide, not all countries have prioritized the same topics and may have a different impact on solving problems and containing the spread of COVID-19. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted with secondary data of "Special Projects COVID-19” in order to analyze the prioritization of proposals and projects to Peruvian needs in the face of pandemic. Two calls were made by the Peruvian research council (CONCyTec); the first with five areas and the second with seven. The global amounts financed by each call were 342,857 USD (1,200,000 soles) and 700,000 USD (1,750,000 soles), respectively. Results: A total of 1,101 research projects were presented, 600 (54.5%) in the first call. In this call, 176 (29.3%) projects were from technological development and innovation and 29 were winners (with a global budget of 1,711,907.25 USD /6,077,270.75 soles). In the second call, 120 (23.9%) projects were from the area of Social and economic research and 21 were winners (global budget of 1,284,002.25 USD/558,208.55 soles) (p=0.043). The largest proportion of winning projects in both calls was 12 (41.4%) in Technological developments and innovation, then five (17.2%) each in telehealth and mobile health, and epidemiological and social studies. Across both calls, 214 (55.8%) and 160 (51.9%) projects were of private organizations and universities, respectively. Conclusions: This research shows ~2% of rapid response "Special Projects COVID-19” were financed by the CONCyTec call with over a million dollars of funds. Although the main topics were technological innovation, detection systems, and vaccines, these priorities have not had a global impact on the epidemiological development of the pandemic in Peru.

                RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely adopted affordable method for large scale gene expression profiling. However, user-friendly and versatile tools for wet-lab biologists to analyse RNA-seq data beyond standard analyses such as differential expression, are rare. Especially, the analysis of time-series data is difficult for wet-lab biologists lacking advanced computational training. Furthermore, most meta-analysis tools are tailored for model organisms and not easily adaptable to other species. With RNfuzzyApp, we provide a user-friendly, web-based R shiny app for differential expression analysis, as well as time-series analysis of RNA-seq data. RNfuzzyApp offers several methods for normalization and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, providing easy-to-use toolboxes, interactive plots and downloadable results. For time-series analysis, RNfuzzyApp presents the first web-based, fully automated pipeline for soft clustering with the Mfuzz R package, including methods to aid in cluster number selection, cluster overlap analysis, Mfuzz loop computations, as well as cluster enrichments. RNfuzzyApp is an intuitive, easy to use and interactive R shiny app for RNA-seq differential expression and time-series analysis, offering a rich selection of interactive plots, providing a quick overview of raw data and generating rapid analysis results. Furthermore, its assignment of orthologs, enrichment analysis, as well as ID conversion functions are accessible to non-model organisms.

                Increasing cases of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, requires healthcare systems to provide essential palliative care for critically ill patients and their families. With the rapid onset and often accelerated deterioration in patients with acute conditions, palliative and supportive care for these patients have different characteristics compared to those for chronic diseases. Furthermore, providing end-of life services for critically ill patients with acute diseases and their families to ensure good death for the patients, will also have its own challenges. This scoping review aims to explore the concept of palliative care and good death for acute diseases. This scoping review will be conducted using the Arksey and O’Malley's framework for scoping reviews: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data, collating, summarizing, reporting results, and conducting consultation. All original research with a focus on palliative care and good death due to acute diseases will be included. This review will include all original research designs published between the period of 2000–2021 that describe a measure of palliative care management for and good death due to acute diseases. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies will be included in order to consider different aspects of healthcare services. This review will also include guidelines and gray literature on palliative care and good deaths. The search will be conducted through PubMed, Scopus Database, and ScienceDirect using the key terms related to acute disease palliative care and the concept of good death due to acute diseases. Two authors will screen the titles and abstracts of the studies. Two authors will review the full text of selected studies independently and extract the data. All selected studies will be synthesized qualitatively, and the results will be consulted with experts through discussion and depict the current concept of palliative care and good death in acute diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Sequential and efficient neural-population coding of complex task information</a></h4>

              
                In mice performing a complex decision-making task, Koay et al. find that cortical neural populations jointly encode multiple task variables from sensory to cognitive in a way that approximately cancels out time-dependent behavioral correlations between variables. They show that dynamic encoding functions are theoretically implementable with static task-input synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The molecular appearance of native TRPM7 channel complexes identified by high-resolution proteomics</a></h4>

              
                The transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7) is a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein consisting of ion channel and protein kinase domains. TRPM7 plays a fundamental role in the cellular uptake of divalent cations such as Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and thus shapes cellular excitability, plasticity and metabolic activity. The molecular appearance and operation of TRPM7 channel complexes in native tissues have remained unresolved. Here, we investigated the subunit composition of endogenous TRPM7 channels in rodent brain by multi-epitope affinity purification and high-resolution quantitative MS analysis. We found that native TRPM7 channels are high molecular-weight multi-protein complexes that contain the putative metal transporter proteins CNNM1-4 and a small G-protein ARL15. Heterologous reconstitution experiments confirmed the formation of TRPM7/CNNM/ARL15 ternary complexes and indicated that complex formation effectively and specifically impacts TRPM7 activity. These results open up new avenues towards a mechanistic understanding of the cellular regulation and function of TRPM7 channels.

                Glucose is the mandatory fuel for the brain, yet the relative contribution of glucose and lactate for neuronal energy metabolism is unclear. We found that increased lactate, but not glucose concentration, enhances the spiking activity of neurons of the cerebral cortex. Enhanced spiking was dependent on ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels formed with KCNJ11 and ABCC8 subunits, which we show are functionally expressed in most neocortical neuronal types. We also demonstrate the ability of cortical neurons to take-up and metabolize lactate. We further reveal that ATP is produced by cortical neurons largely via oxidative phosphorylation and only modestly by glycolysis. Our data demonstrate that in active neurons, lactate is preferred to glucose as an energy substrate, and that lactate metabolism shapes neuronal activity in the neocortex through K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Our results highlight the importance of metabolic crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes for brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A conserved neuropeptide system links head and body motor circuits to enable adaptive behavior</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators promote adaptive behaviors that are often complex and involve concerted activity changes across circuits that are often not physically connected. It is not well understood how neuromodulatory systems accomplish these tasks. Here we show that the <i>C. elegans</i> NLP-12 neuropeptide system shapes responses to food availability by modulating the activity of head and body wall motor neurons through alternate G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) targets, CKR-1 and CKR-2. We show <i>ckr-2</i> deletion reduces body bend depth during movement under basal conditions. We demonstrate CKR-1 is a functional NLP-12 receptor and define its expression in the nervous system. In contrast to basal locomotion, biased CKR-1 GPCR stimulation of head motor neurons promotes turning during local searching. Deletion of <i>ckr-1 </i>reduces head neuron activity and diminishes turning while specific <i>ckr-1</i> overexpression or head neuron activation promote turning. Thus, our studies suggest locomotor responses to changing food availability are regulated through conditional NLP-12 stimulation of head or body wall motor circuits.

                Sensory and behavioral plasticity are essential for animals to thrive in changing environments. As key effectors of intracellular calcium signaling, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) can bridge neural activation with the many regulatory processes needed to orchestrate sensory adaptation, including by relaying signals to the nucleus. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism controlling the cell activation-dependent nuclear translocation of CMK-1, the <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog of mammalian CaMKI/IV, in thermosensory neurons <i>in vivo</i>. We show that an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration elevation is necessary and sufficient to favor CMK-1 nuclear import. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to CMK-1 increases its affinity for IMA-3 importin, causing a redistribution with a relatively slow kinetics, matching the timescale of sensory adaptation. Furthermore, we show that this mechanism enables the encoding of opposite nuclear signals in neuron types with opposite calcium-responses and that it is essential for experience-dependent behavioral plasticity and gene transcription control <i>in vivo</i>. Since CaMKI/IV are conserved regulators of adaptable behaviors, similar mechanisms could exist in other organisms and for other sensory modalities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selective sorting of microRNAs into exosomes by phase-separated YBX1 condensates</a></h4>

              
                Exosomes may mediate cell-to-cell communication by transporting various proteins and nucleic acids to neighboring cells. Some protein and RNA cargoes are significantly enriched in exosomes. How cells efficiently and selectively sort them into exosomes remains incompletely explored. Previously we reported that YBX1 is required in sorting of miR-223 into exosomes. Here we show that YBX1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) <i>in vitro </i>and in cells. YBX1 condensates selectively recruit miR-223 <i>in vitro</i> and into exosomes secreted by cultured cells. Point mutations that inhibit YBX1 phase separation impair the incorporation of YBX1 protein into biomolecular condensates formed in cells, and perturb miR-233 sorting into exosomes. We propose that phase separation-mediated local enrichment of cytosolic RNA binding proteins and their cognate RNAs enables their targeting and packaging by vesicles that bud into multivesicular bodies. This provides a possible mechanism for efficient and selective engulfment of cytosolic proteins and RNAs into intraluminal vesicles which are then secreted as exosomes from cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning induces coordinated neuronal plasticity of metabolic demands and functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The neurobiological basis of learning is reflected in adaptations of brain structure, network organization and energy metabolism. However, it is still unknown how different neuroplastic mechanisms act together and if cognitive advancements relate to general or task-specific changes. To address these questions, we tested how hierarchical network interactions contribute to improvements in the performance of a visuo-spatial processing task by employing simultaneous PET/MR neuroimaging before and after a 4-week learning period. We combined functional PET with metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM) to infer directional interactions across brain regions and subsequently performed simulations to disentangle the role of functional network dynamics and glucose metabolism. As a result, learning altered the top-down regulation of the salience network onto the occipital cortex, with increases in MCM at resting-state and decreases during task execution. Accordingly, a higher divergence between resting-state and task-specific effects was associated with better cognitive performance, indicating that these adaptations are complementary and both required for successful skill learning. Simulations further showed that changes at resting-state were dependent on glucose metabolism, whereas those during task performance were driven by functional connectivity between salience and visual networks. Referring to previous work, we suggest that learning establishes a metabolically expensive skill engram at rest, whose retrieval serves for efficient task execution by minimizing prediction errors between neuronal representations of brain regions on different hierarchical levels.

	<p>Background: The efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional improvement remains unclear. The latest published randomized controlled trials have supported the potential benefits of interlimb-coordinated training to enhance gait function. Upper limb functional recovery may also benefit from interlimb-coordinated training since most everyday activities require the coordinated use of both hands to complete a task. This study investigates the efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional recovery over a short-medium term period. Methods: A total of 226 acute stroke patients will be recruited from four centres over four years. Patients will be randomly allocated to either conventional therapy or conventional therapy plus interlimb-coordinated training. Outcomes will be recorded at baseline, after 2 weeks of intervention, and at 3- and 6-months post-intervention. Gait speed is the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include Fugl–Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test, Action Research Arm Test, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion: The results of this trial will provide an in-depth understanding of the efficacy of early interlimb-coordinated intervention on gait and upper functional rehabilitation and how it may relate to the neural plasticity process.</p>

	<p>Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a few milliseconds after this cortical activity following electrical stimulation (ES) result in an inhibition comparable to that by TMS alone; this is called short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). Cortical activity is observed after mechanical tactile stimulation (MS) and is affected by the number of stimuli by ES. We determined the effects of somatosensory stimulus methods and multiple conditioning stimuli on SAI in 19 participants. In experiment 1, the interstimulus intervals between the conditioning stimulation and TMS were 25, 27 and 29 ms for ES and 28, 30 and 32 ms for MS. In experiment 2, we used 1, 2, 3 and 4 conditioning stimulations of ES and MS. The interstimulus interval between the ES or MS and TMS was 27 or 30 ms, respectively. In experiment 1, MEPs were significantly decreased in both the ES and MS conditions. In experiment 2, MEPs after ES were significantly decreased in all conditions. Conversely, MEPs after MS were significantly decreased after one stimulus and increased after four stimulations, indicating the SAI according to the number of stimuli. Therefore, the somatosensory stimulus methods and multiple conditioning stimuli affected the SAI.</p>

	<p>Stroke causes balance dysfunction, leading to decreased physical activity and increased falls. Thus, effective balance exercises are needed to improve balance dysfunction. This single-blind, single-center randomized controlled trial evaluated the long-term and continuous effects of balance exercise using a real-time postural feedback system to improve balancing ability safely. Thirty participants were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups; 11 in each group completed the final evaluation. The effect of the intervention was evaluated by muscle strength of knee extension, physical performance (short physical performance battery, the center of pressure trajectory length per second, and Timed Up and Go test [TUG]), and self-reported questionnaires (modified Gait Efficacy Scale [mGES] and the Fall Efficacy Scale) at pre (0 week), post (6-week), and at follow-up (10-week) visits. The TUG and mGES showed a significant interactive (group * time) effect (p = 0.007 and p = 0.038, respectively). The intervention group showed significant decreasing time to perform TUG from pre- to post-intervention (p = 0.015) and pre-intervention to follow-up (p = 0.016); mGES showed a significant change from pre-intervention to follow-up (p = 0.036). Thus, balance exercise using a real-time postural feedback system can confer a positive effect on the walking ability in patients with chronic stroke and increase their self-confidence in gait performance.</p>

	<p>Although the cerebellum has long been believed to be involved uniquely in sensorimotor processes, recent research works pointed to its participation in a wide range of cognitive predictive functions. Here, we review the available evidence supporting a generalized role of the cerebellum in predictive computation. We then discuss the anatomo-physiological properties that make the cerebellum the ideal hub of the predictive brain. We further argue that cerebellar involvement in cognition may follow a continuous gradient, with higher cerebellar activity occurring for tasks relying more on predictive processes, and outline the empirical scenarios to probe this hypothesis.</p>

	<p>Extensive research has demonstrated that eye-tracking tasks can effectively indicate cognitive impairment. For example, lab-based eye-tracking tasks, such as the antisaccade task, have robustly distinguished between people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and healthy older adults. Due to the neurodegeneration associated with AD, people with AD often display extended saccade latencies and increased error rates on eye-tracking tasks. Although the effectiveness of using eye tracking to identify cognitive impairment appears promising, research considering the utility of eye tracking during naturalistic tasks, such as reading, in identifying cognitive impairment is limited. The current review identified 39 articles assessing eye-tracking distinctions between people with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls when completing naturalistic task (reading, real-life simulations, static image search) or a goal-directed task involving naturalistic stimuli. The results revealed that naturalistic tasks show promising biomarkers and distinctions between healthy older adults and AD participants, and therefore show potential to be used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. However, only twelve articles included MCI participants and assessed the sensitivity of measures to detect cognitive impairment in preclinical stages. In addition, the review revealed inconsistencies within the literature, particularly when assessing reading tasks. We urge researchers to expand on the current literature in this area and strive to assess the robustness and sensitivity of eye-tracking measures in both AD and MCI populations on naturalistic tasks.</p>

	<p>The capacity for subjective time in humans encompasses the perception of time’s unfolding from moment to moment, as well as the ability to traverse larger temporal expanses of past- and future-oriented thought via mental time travel. Disruption in time perception can result in maladaptive outcomes—from the innocuous lapse in timing that leads to a burnt piece of toast, to the grievous miscalculation that produces a traffic accident—while disruption to mental time travel can impact core functions from planning appointments to making long-term decisions. Mounting evidence suggests that disturbances to both time perception and mental time travel are prominent in dementia syndromes. Given that such disruptions can have severe consequences for independent functioning in everyday life, here we aim to provide a comprehensive exposition of subjective timing dysfunction in dementia, with a view to informing the management of such disturbances. We consider the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning changes to both time perception and mental time travel across different dementia disorders. Moreover, we explicate the functional implications of altered subjective timing by reference to two key and representative adaptive capacities: prospective memory and intertemporal decision-making. Overall, our review sheds light on the transdiagnostic implications of subjective timing disturbances in dementia and highlights the high variability in performance across clinical syndromes and functional domains.</p>

	<p>Sport-related concussion is a serious public health issue affecting millions of individuals each year. Among the many negative side effects, emotional symptoms, such as stress, are some of the most common. Stress management is repeatedly cited by expert groups as an important intervention for this population. It was shown that music has relaxing effects, reducing stress through the activation of brain areas involved in emotions and pleasure. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of a music-listening intervention compared with silence on experimentally induced stress in concussed and non-concussed athletes. To this aim, four groups of athletes (non-concussed music, non-concussed silence, concussed music, and concussed silence) performed the Trier Social Stress Test, for which both physiological (skin conductance level) and self-reported stress measurements were taken. No significant difference was found in the pattern of stress recovery for self-reported measurements. However, the skin conductance results showed greater and faster post-stress recovery after listening to music compared with silence for concussed athletes only. Taken together, these results suggest that music could be an efficient stress management tool to implement in the everyday life of concussed athletes to help them prevent stress accumulation.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a frequent disorder with serious adverse health consequences in people with Down syndrome (DS). This study aims to evaluate and classify sleep and physical activity (PA) characteristics in adults with DS. Methods: Forty participants with DS wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days to measure physical activity and sleep–wake patterns. The corresponding data were also obtained by survey and polysomnography. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is calculated from the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep according to international guidelines. Results: Polysomnography showed SDB based on AHI in 95% of adults: 50% had severe SDB, 22.5% presented moderate and 22.5% mild SDB, predominantly in males. They had poor sleep quality (80.1%) and low PA levels. Using statistical classification methods, we observed three clusters with two opposite profiles. Clusters 2 and 3 showed low PA indices (daily steps: 5719 and 5310, respectively) and severe SDB (AHI = 33.6 and 55.5 events/h), high age and high gonial angle. Cluster 1 showed high PA (mean count of daily steps: 6908) and mild to moderate SDB (AHI = 16.8 events/h), low age and low gonial angle. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are different profiles (age, gender, obesity, gonial angle) that are associated with SDB in adults with DS. These results suggest that this may represent important factors to consider when planning health promotion and prevention.</p>

	<p>Background: Evidence indicates that exercise holds the potential to counteract neurodegeneration experienced by persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), which is in part believed to be mediated through increases in neurotrophic factors. There is a need to summarize the existing evidence on exercise-induced effects on neurotrophic factors alongside neuroprotection in pwMS. Aim: To (1) systematically review the evidence on acute (one session) and/or chronic (several sessions) exercise-induced changes in neurotrophic factors in pwMS and (2) investigate the potential translational link between exercise-induced changes in neurotrophic factors and neuroprotection. Methods: Five databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Sport Discus) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effects of exercise (all modalities included) on neurotrophic factors as well as measures of neuroprotection if reported. The quality of the study designs and the exercise interventions were assessed by use of the validated tool TESTEX. Results: From N = 337 identified studies, N = 14 RCTs were included. While only N = 2 of the identified studies reported on the acute changes in neurotrophic factors, all N = 14 RCTs reported on the chronic effects, with N = 9 studies revealing between-group differences in favor of exercise. This was most prominent for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with between-group differences in favor of exercise being observed in N = 6 out of N = 12 studies. Meta-analyses were applicable for three out of 10 different identified neurotrophic factors and revealed that exercise can improve the chronic levels of BDNF (delta changes; N = 9, ES = 0.78 (0.27; 1.28), p = 0.003, heterogeneity between studies) and potentially also ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (N = 3, ES = 0.24 (−0.07; 0.54), p = 0.13, no heterogeneity between studies) but not nerve growth factor (NGF) (N = 4, ES = 0.28 (−0.55; 1.11), p = 0.51, heterogeneity between studies). Indicators of neuroprotection (e.g., with direct measures of brain structure assessed by MRI) were assessed in N = 3 of the identified studies only, with N = 2 partly supporting and thus indicating a potential translational link between increases in neurotrophic factors and neuroprotection. Conclusion: The present study reveals that exercise can elicit improvements in chronic levels of BDNF in pwMS, whereas the effects of exercise on chronic levels of other neurotrophic factors and on acute levels of neurotrophic factors in general, along with a potential translational link (i.e., with exercise-induced improvements in neurotropic factors being associated with or even mediating neuroprotection), are sparse and inconclusive. There is a need for more high-quality studies that assess neurotrophic factors (applying comparable methods of blood handling and analysis) concomitantly with neuroprotective outcome measures.

	<p>Background/Problem: Standard neurorehabilitation and gait training has not proved effective in restoring normal gait coordination for many stroke survivors. Rather, persistent gait dyscoordination occurs, with associated poor function, and progressively deteriorating quality of life. One difficulty is the array of symptoms exhibited by stroke survivors with gait deficits. Some researchers have addressed lower limb weakness following stroke with exercises designed to strengthen muscles, with the expectation of improving gait. However, gait dyscoordination in many stroke survivors appears to result from more than straightforward muscle weakness. Purpose: Thus, the purpose of this case study is to report results of long-duration gait coordination training in an individual with initial good strength, but poor gait swing phase hip/knee and ankle coordination. Methods: Mr. X was enrolled at &amp;amp;gt;6 months after a left hemisphere ischemic stroke. Gait deficits included a ‘stiff-legged gait’ characterized by the absence of hip and knee flexion during right mid-swing, despite the fact that he showed good initial strength in right lower limb quadriceps, hamstrings, and ankle dorsiflexors. Treatment was provided 4 times/week for 1.5 h, for 12 weeks. The combined treatment included the following: motor learning exercises designed for coordination training of the lower limb; functional electrical stimulation (FES) assisted practice; weight-supported coordination practice; and over-ground and treadmill walking. The FES was used as an adjunct to enhance muscle response during motor learning and prior to volitional recovery of motor control. Weight-supported treadmill training was administered to titrate weight and pressure applied at the joints and to the plantar foot surface during stance phase and pre-swing phase of the involved limb. Later in the protocol, treadmill training was administered to improve speed of movement during the gait cycle. Response to treatment was assessed through an array of impairment, functional mobility, and life role participation measures. Results: At post-treatment, Mr. X exhibited some recovery of hip, knee, and ankle coordination during swing phase according to kinematic measures, and the stiff-legged gait was resolved. Muscle strength measures remained essentially constant throughout the study. The modified Ashworth scale showed improved knee extensor tone from baseline of 1 to normal (0) at post-treatment. Gait coordination overall improved by 12 points according to the Gait Assessment and Intervention Tool, Six Minute Walk Test improved by 532′, and the Stroke Impact Scale improved by 12 points, including changes in daily activities; mobility; and meaningful activities. Discussion: Through the combined use of motor learning exercises, FES, weight-support, and treadmill training, coordination of the right lower limb improved sufficiently to exhibit a more normal swing phase, reducing the probability of falls, and subsequent downwardly spiraling dysfunction. The recovery of lower limb coordination during swing phase illustrates what is possible when strength is sufficient and when coordination training is targeted in a carefully titrated, highly incrementalized manner. Conclusions/Contribution to the Field: This case study contributes to the literature in several ways: (1) illustrates combined interventions for gait training and response to treatment; (2) provides supporting case evidence of relationships among knee flexion coordination, swing phase coordination, functional mobility, and quality of life; (3) illustrates that strength is necessary, but not sufficient to restore coordinated gait swing phase after stroke in some stroke survivors; and (4) provides details regarding coordination training and progression of gait training treatment for stroke survivors.</p>

	<p>Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most debilitating motor symptoms experienced by patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), as it can lead to falls and a reduced quality of life. Evidence supports an association between FOG severity and cognitive functioning; however, results remain debatable. PD patients with (PDFOG+, n = 41) and without FOG (PDFOG–, n = 39) and control healthy subjects (n = 41) participated in this study. The NIH toolbox cognition battery, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the interval timing task were used to test cognitive domains. Measurements were compared between groups using multivariable models and adjusting for covariates. Correlation analyses, linear regression, and mediation models were applied to examine relationships among disease duration and severity, FOG severity, and cognitive functioning. Significant differences were observed between controls and PD patients for all cognitive domains. PDFOG+ and PDFOG– exhibited differences in Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) test, interval timing task, and MoCA scores. After adjusting for covariates in two different models, PDFOG+ and PDFOG– differed in both MoCA and DCCS scores. In addition, significant relationships between FOG severity and cognitive function (MoCA, DCCS, and interval timing) were also found. Regression models suggest that FOG severity may be a predictor of cognitive impairment, and mediation models show the effects of cognitive impairment on the relationship between disease severity and FOG severity. Overall, this study provides insight into the relationship between cognitive and FOG severity in patients with PD, which could aid in the development of therapeutic interventions to manage both.</p>

	<p>Rugby Union is a popular sport played by males and females worldwide, from junior to elite levels. The highly physical skill of tackling occurs every few seconds throughout a match and various injuries associated with tackling are relatively common. Of particular interest are head injuries that result in a concussion. Recently, repeated non-injurious head impacts in sport have attracted the attention of researchers interested in brain health. Therefore, this study assessed head movement during repeated rugby tackle drills among experienced Rugby Union players. Experienced male and female participants performed 15 1-on-1 tackles in a motion analysis laboratory to measure the head movements of the ball carrier and tackler during each tackle, using three-dimensional motion capture. The average peak acceleration of the head for ball carriers was 28.9 ± 24.08 g and 36.67 ± 28.91 g for the tacklers. This study found that the type of head impacts common while performing a tackle in Rugby Union are similar to those experienced by soccer players during heading, which has been found to alter brain function that lasts hours after the event. This has important implications for player health and suggests that mitigation strategies should be considered for Rugby Union.</p>

<p>Glutamate is packaged in vesicles via two main vesicular transporter (VGLUT) proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, which regulate its storage and release from synapses of excitatory neurons. Studies in rodents, primates, <i>ferrets</i>, and tree shrews suggest that these transporters may identify distinct subsets of excitatory projections in visual structures, particularly in thalamocortical pathways where they tend to correlate with modulatory and driver projections, respectively. Despite being a well-studied model of thalamocortical connectivity, little is known about their expression pattern in the cat visual system. To expand current knowledge on their distribution and how they correlated with known driver and modulator projecting sites, we examined the protein expression patterns of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the visual thalamus of the cat (lateral geniculate nucleus and the pulvinar complex). We also studied their expression pattern in relevant visual structures projecting to or receiving significant thalamic projections, such <i>as</i> the primary visual cortex and the superior colliculus. Our results indicate that both VGLUTs are consistently present throughout the cat visual system and show laminar or nuclei specificity in their distribution, which suggests, as in other species, that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 represent distinct populations of glutamatergic projections.</p>

<p>The central connections of the pallial nuclei of the adult zebrafish were examined by means of carbocyanine dye tracing, showing specialized afferent and efferent projections and indicating a modular organization for different neural processes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the connections (connectome) of the adult zebrafish pallium using carbocyanine dye tracing and ancillary anatomical methods. The everted zebrafish pallium (dorsal telencephalic area, D) is composed of several major zones (medial, lateral, dorsal, central, anterior, and posterior) distinguishable by their topography, cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry, and genoarchitecture. Our comprehensive study reveals poor interconnectivity between these pallial areas, especially between medial (Dm), lateral/dorsal (Dl, Dd), and posterior (Dp) regions. This suggests that the zebrafish pallium has dedicated modules for different neural processes. Pallial connections with extrapallial regions also show compartmental organization. Major extratelencephalic afferents come from preglomerular nuclei (to Dl, Dd, and Dm), posterior tuberal nucleus (to Dm), and lateral recess nucleus (to Dl). The subpallial (ventral, V) zones dorsal Vv, Vd, and Vs, considered homologues of the striatum, amygdala, and pallidum, are mainly afferent to Dl/Dd and Dp. Regarding the efferent pathways, they also appear characteristic of each pallial region. Rostral Dm projects to the dorsal entopeduncular nucleus. Dp is interconnected with the olfactory bulbs. The central region (Dc) defined here receives mainly projections from Dl–Dd and projects toward the pretectum and optic tectum, connections, which help to delimiting Dc. The connectome of the adult pallium revealed here complements extant studies on the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, and may be useful for neurogenetic studies performed during early stages of development. The connectome of the zebrafish pallium was also compared with the pallial connections reported in other teleosts, a large group showing high pallial diversity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prior Acoustic Trauma Alters Type II Afferent Activity in the Mouse Cochlea</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Auditory stimuli travel from the cochlea to the brainstem through type I and type II cochlear afferents. While type I afferents convey information about the frequency, intensity, and timing of sounds, the role of type II afferents remains unresolved. Limited recordings of type II afferents from cochlear apex of prehearing rats reveal they are activated by widespread outer hair cell stimulation, ATP, and by the rupture of nearby outer hair cells. Altogether, these lines of evidence suggest that type II afferents sense loud, potentially damaging levels of sound. To explore this hypothesis further, calcium imaging was used to determine the impact of acoustic trauma on the activity of type II cochlear afferents of young adult mice of both sexes. Two known marker genes (<I>Th</I>, <I>Drd2</I>) and one new marker gene (<I>Tac1</I>), expressed in type II afferents and some other cochlear cell types, drove GCaMP6f expression to reveal calcium transients in response to focal damage in the organ of Corti in all turns of the cochlea. Mature type II afferents responded to acute photoablation damage less often but at greater length compared with prehearing neurons. In addition, days after acoustic trauma, acute photoablation triggered a novel response pattern in type II afferents and surrounding epithelial cells, delayed bursts of activity occurring minutes after the initial response subsided. Overall, calcium imaging can report type II afferent responses to damage even in mature and noise-exposed animals and reveals previously unknown tissue hyperactivity subsequent to acoustic trauma.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein–ACE2 interaction by in silico drug repurposing [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new coronavirus discovered that appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, causes COVID-19 disease which have resulted in cases similar to SARS-atypical pneumonia. Worldwide, around 116 million cases and 2.57 million deaths are reported with new cases and increasing mortality every day. To date, there is no specific commercial treatment to control the infection. Repurpose drugs targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor represents an alternative strategy to block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 protein S and forestall virus adhesion, internalization, and replication in the host cell. Methods: We performed a rigid molecular docking using the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of S protein (RBD S1)-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6VW1) interaction site and 1,283 drugs FDA approved. The docking score, frequency of the drug in receptor site, and interactions at the binding site residues were used as analyzing criteria. Results: This research yielded 40 drugs identified as a potential inhibitor of RBD S1-ACE2 interaction. Among the inhibitors, compounds such as ipratropium, formoterol, and fexofenadine can be found. Specialists employ these drugs as therapies to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and virtually any respiratory infection. Conclusions: Our results will serve as the basis for in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the potential use of those drugs to generate affordable and convenient therapies to treat COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptual design of smart multi-farm produce dehydrator using a low-cost programmable logic controller and raspberry pi [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acceptable food processing techniques require the removal of water contents from the crop or food sample without destroying the nutritional qualities of the food sample. This poses a strict requirement on the dehydrator or oven that will be used in the dehydrating techniques to have the ability to control both temperature and humidity of its drying chamber. Methods: This work centres on how an autonomous multi-farm produce dehydrator that can also serve as an oven can be designed with a raspberry pi and a low-cost programmable logic controller (PLC). The dehydrator gives the users the flexibility to control both the drying chamber’s temperature and humidity from its web interface via a mobile device or the dehydrator’s HMI. Heat energy from the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) is used so that the dehydrator can be readily available for commercial or industrial use.  The small electricity required to power the electronics devices is obtained from the hybrid power solution with an electric energy source from either the mains electricity supply or solar.. The design was tested by creating an operation profile from the proposed web application for the dehydrator. The operation trend was analysed from the web application’s Trendlines page. Results: The report showed that both the temperature and humidity of the dehydrator could be controlled, and access to historical operation data will give insight to the user on how to create a better operation profile. Conclusion: The setup described in this work, when implemented was able to produce a dehydrator/oven whose temperature and humidity can be perfectly controlled and its generated heat is evenly distributed in its drying chamber to ensure efficient and effective drying techniques use in crop preservation and food processing.

                Currently, the studies on sexual abuse trauma, and resilience in Confucian survivors are still limited. The purpose of this study is to explore the resilience of Confucian women after sexual abuse trauma to provide evidence to support in counseling and psychotherapy practices. The article describes the resiliency story of a Vietnamese Confucian female survivor who was abused by her brother from the age of 8 to 16. The life history approach used in qualitative narrative research was applied in this study. The researcher identified two factors that strongly influence the survivor’s resilience: (1) the effectiveness of passive education in the general education curriculum is oriented to both competence and quality development; and (2) an authentic understanding of the core Confucian philosophical doctrine: the neutrality and the self-nurture. Based on the findings, we propose a 7-stage flow diagram of a Confucian women's resilience following sexual abuse. These findings provide a new approach to psychological counseling for female survivors of any religion by using Confucian philosophy and contribute to the impact of studies on religious and spiritual factors affecting the resilience of sexual abuse survivors.

                This study sought to determine the effect of fermented medicinal herbs (FMH), i.e. cutchery (Kaempferia galanga), turmeric (Curcuma longa) and curcuma (Curcuma xanthorrhiza) in combination with molasses and probiotic drink (Yakult), administered orally on the hematological and physiological profile of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). A complete randomized design (CRD) experiment was used with four levels of treatments, namely P0 (control), P1 (FMH 100 mL/kg), P2 (FMH 200 mL/kg) and P3 (FMH 300 mL/kg) of feed. The fish were kept in a farm in cages at 75 fish/m3 and fed with the experimental diets for 60 days. The results revealed that FMH (P2) dietary administration improved hematological and physiological profile of catfish, i.e total erythrocytes of 2.81 x 106 cells/mm3, hematocrit values of 39.00%, hemoglobin levels of 10.73 g/dL, total leukocytes of 11.41 x 104 cells/mm3, blood glucose 97.33 mg/dL, and total serum protein 4.10 mg/dL compared to controls with 1.89 x 106 cells/mm3, 32.33 %, g/dL, 9.67 x 104 cells/mm3, 67.33 mg/dL, and total serum protein of 3.10 mg/dL, respectively. Moreover, the diet improved special growth rate, feed conversion ratio, feed efficiency and the survival rate of catfish. The hematological and physiological profile of catfish improvement are considered to be due to the content of secondary metabolites of FMH, namely curcuminoids, vitamin C, essential oils, tannins, and flavonoids, which trigger immunostimulation. The presence of curcuminoids provide an antioxidant effect on cell membranes reducing erythrocyte cell membrane damage due to oxidation. Similarly, flavonoids are natural antioxidants, which are credited with the ability of reducing free radicals and anti-free radicals.

The growing number of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data presents a unique opportunity to study the combined impact of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded genetic variation in complex disease. Mitochondrial DNA variants and in particular, heteroplasmic variants, are critical for determining human disease severity. While there are approaches for obtaining mitochondrial DNA variants from NGS data, these software do not account for the unique characteristics of mitochondrial genetics and can be inaccurate even for homoplasmic variants. We introduce MitoScape, a novel, big-data, software for extracting mitochondrial DNA sequences from NGS. MitoScape adopts a novel departure from other algorithms by using machine learning to model the unique characteristics of mitochondrial genetics. We also employ a novel approach of using rho-zero (mitochondrial DNA-depleted) data to model nuclear-encoded mitochondrial sequences. We showed that MitoScape produces accurate heteroplasmy estimates using gold-standard mitochondrial DNA data. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the most common tools for obtaining mtDNA variants from NGS and showed that MitoScape had superior performance to compared tools in every statistically category we compared, including false positives and false negatives. By applying MitoScape to common disease examples, we illustrate how MitoScape facilitates important heteroplasmy-disease association discoveries by expanding upon a reported association between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial haplogroup T in men (adjusted p-value = 0.003). The improved accuracy of mitochondrial DNA variants produced by MitoScape will be instrumental in diagnosing disease in the context of personalized medicine and clinical diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Memories in a network with excitatory and inhibitory plasticity are encoded in the spiking irregularity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Júlia V. Gallinaro, Claudia Clopath</p>

Cell assemblies are thought to be the substrate of memory in the brain. Theoretical studies have previously shown that assemblies can be formed in networks with multiple types of plasticity. But how exactly they are formed and how they encode information is yet to be fully understood. One possibility is that memories are stored in silent assemblies. Here we used a computational model to study the formation of silent assemblies in a network of spiking neurons with excitatory and inhibitory plasticity. We found that even though the formed assemblies were silent in terms of mean firing rate, they had an increased coefficient of variation of inter-spike intervals. We also found that this spiking irregularity could be read out with support of short-term plasticity, and that it could contribute to the longevity of memories.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A conserved expression signature predicts growth rate and reveals cell & lineage-specific differences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhisheng Jiang, Serena F. Generoso, Marta Badia, Bernhard Payer, Lucas B. Carey</p>

Isogenic cells cultured together show heterogeneity in their proliferation rate. To determine the differences between fast and slow-proliferating cells, we developed a method to sort cells by proliferation rate, and performed RNA-seq on slow and fast proliferating subpopulations of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse fibroblasts. We found that slowly proliferating mESCs have a more naïve pluripotent character. We identified an evolutionarily conserved proliferation-correlated transcriptomic signature that is common to all eukaryotes: fast cells have higher expression of genes for protein synthesis and protein degradation. This signature accurately predicted growth rate in yeast and cancer cells, and identified lineage-specific proliferation dynamics during development, using <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> scRNA-seq data. In contrast, sorting by mitochondria membrane potential revealed a highly cell-type specific mitochondria-state related transcriptome. mESCs with hyperpolarized mitochondria are fast proliferating, while the opposite is true for fibroblasts. The mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor antimycin affected slow and fast subpopulations differently. While a major transcriptional-signature associated with cell-to-cell heterogeneity in proliferation is conserved, the metabolic and energetic dependency of cell proliferation is cell-type specific.

Emergent response properties of sensory neurons depend on circuit connectivity and somatodendritic processing. Neurons of the barn owl’s external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) display emergence of spatial selectivity. These neurons use interaural time difference (ITD) as a cue for the horizontal direction of sound sources. ITD is detected by upstream brainstem neurons with narrow frequency tuning, resulting in spatially ambiguous responses. This spatial ambiguity is resolved by ICx neurons integrating inputs over frequency, a relevant processing in sound localization across species. Previous models have predicted that ICx neurons function as point neurons that linearly integrate inputs across frequency. However, the complex dendritic trees and spines of ICx neurons raises the question of whether this prediction is accurate. Data from <i>in vivo</i> intracellular recordings of ICx neurons were used to address this question. Results revealed diverse frequency integration properties, where some ICx neurons showed responses consistent with the point neuron hypothesis and others with nonlinear dendritic integration. Modeling showed that varied connectivity patterns and forms of dendritic processing may underlie observed ICx neurons’ frequency integration processing. These results corroborate the ability of neurons with complex dendritic trees to implement diverse linear and nonlinear integration of synaptic inputs, of relevance for adaptive coding and learning, and supporting a fundamental mechanism in sound localization.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DNA methylation-based classifier and gene expression signatures detect BRCAness in osteosarcoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maxim Barenboim, Michal Kovac, Baptiste Ameline, David T. W. Jones, Olaf Witt, Stefan Bielack, Stefan Burdach, Daniel Baumhoer, Michaela Nathrath</p>

Although osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare cancer, it is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. BRCAness is a phenotypical trait in tumors with a defect in homologous recombination repair, resembling tumors with inactivation of BRCA1/2, rendering these tumors sensitive to poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Recently, OS was shown to exhibit molecular features of BRCAness. Our goal was to develop a method complementing existing genomic methods to aid clinical decision making on administering PARPi in OS patients. OS samples with DNA-methylation data were divided to BRCAness-positive and negative groups based on the degree of their genomic instability (n = 41). Methylation probes were ranked according to decreasing variance difference between two groups. The top 2000 probes were selected for training and cross-validation of the random forest algorithm. Two-thirds of available OS RNA-Seq samples (n = 17) from the top and bottom of the sample list ranked according to genome instability score were subjected to differential expression and, subsequently, to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The combined accuracy of trained random forest was 85% and the average area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.95. There were 449 upregulated and 1,079 downregulated genes in the BRCAness-positive group (fdr < 0.05). GSEA of upregulated genes detected enrichment of DNA replication and mismatch repair and homologous recombination signatures (FWER < 0.05). Validation of the BRCAness classifier with an independent OS set (n = 20) collected later in the course of study showed AUC of 0.87 with an accuracy of 90%. GSEA signatures computed for this test set were matching the ones observed in the training set enrichment analysis. In conclusion, we developed a new classifier based on DNA-methylation patterns that detects BRCAness in OS samples with high accuracy. GSEA identified genome instability signatures. Machine-learning and gene expression approaches add new epigenomic and transcriptomic aspects to already established genomic methods for evaluation of BRCAness in osteosarcoma and can be extended to cancers characterized by genome instability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The experience of teaching introductory programming skills to bioscientists in Brazil</a></h4>

Computational biology has gained traction as an independent scientific discipline over the last years in South America. However, there is still a growing need for bioscientists, from different backgrounds, with different levels, to acquire programming skills, which could reduce the time from data to insights and bridge communication between life scientists and computer scientists. Python is a programming language extensively used in bioinformatics and data science, which is particularly suitable for beginners. Here, we describe the conception, organization, and implementation of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data. This workshop has been organized by graduate and undergraduate students and supported, mostly in administrative matters, by experienced faculty members since 2017. The workshop was conceived for teaching bioscientists, mainly students in Brazil, on how to program in a biological context. The goal of this article was to share our experience with the 2020 edition of the workshop in its virtual format due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare and contrast this year’s experience with the previous in-person editions. We described a hands-on and live coding workshop model for teaching introductory Python programming. We also highlighted the adaptations made from in-person to online format in 2020, the participants’ assessment of learning progression, and general workshop management. Lastly, we provided a summary and reflections from our personal experiences from the workshops of the last 4 years. Our takeaways included the benefits of the learning from learners’ feedback (LLF) that allowed us to improve the workshop in real time, in the short, and likely in the long term. We concluded that the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data is a highly effective workshop model for teaching a programming language that allows bioscientists to go beyond an initial exploration of programming skills for data analysis in the medium to long term.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules on writing clean and reliable open-source scientific software</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Haley Hunter-Zinck, Alexandre Fioravante de Siqueira, Váleri N. Vásquez, Richard Barnes, Ciera C. Martinez</p>

Functional, usable, and maintainable open-source software is increasingly essential to scientific research, but there is a large variation in formal training for software development and maintainability. Here, we propose 10 “rules” centered on 2 best practice components: clean code and testing. These 2 areas are relatively straightforward and provide substantial utility relative to the learning investment. Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load for both the initial developer and subsequent contributors; this allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors. Clean coding styles make software code more amenable to testing, including unit tests that work best with modular and consistent software code. Unit tests interrogate specific and isolated coding behavior to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity; unit tests also implicitly provide example usages of code. Other forms of testing are geared to discover erroneous behavior arising from unexpected inputs or emerging from the interaction of complex codebases. Although conforming to coding styles and designing tests can add time to the software development project in the short term, these foundational tools can help to improve the correctness, quality, usability, and maintainability of open-source scientific software code. They also advance the principal point of scientific research: producing accurate results in a reproducible way. In addition to suggesting several tips for getting started with clean code and testing practices, we recommend numerous tools for the popular open-source scientific software languages Python, R, and Julia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing network propagation for multi-omics data integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Konstantina Charmpi, Manopriya Chokkalingam, Ronja Johnen, Andreas Beyer</p>

Network propagation refers to a class of algorithms that integrate information from input data across connected nodes in a given network. These algorithms have wide applications in systems biology, protein function prediction, inferring condition-specifically altered sub-networks, and prioritizing disease genes. Despite the popularity of network propagation, there is a lack of comparative analyses of different algorithms on real data and little guidance on how to select and parameterize the various algorithms. Here, we address this problem by analyzing different combinations of network normalization and propagation methods and by demonstrating schemes for the identification of optimal parameter settings on real proteome and transcriptome data. Our work highlights the risk of a ‘topology bias’ caused by the incorrect use of network normalization approaches. Capitalizing on the fact that network propagation is a regularization approach, we show that minimizing the bias-variance tradeoff can be utilized for selecting optimal parameters. The application to real multi-omics data demonstrated that optimal parameters could also be obtained by either maximizing the agreement between different omics layers (e.g. proteome and transcriptome) or by maximizing the consistency between biological replicates. Furthermore, we exemplified the utility and robustness of network propagation on multi-omics datasets for identifying ageing-associated genes in brain and liver tissues of rats and for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression. Overall, this work compares different network propagation approaches and it presents strategies for how to use network propagation algorithms to optimally address a specific research question at hand.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Respiration modulates oscillatory neural network activity at rest</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel S. Kluger, Joachim Gross</p>

Despite recent advances in understanding how respiration affects neural signalling to influence perception, cognition, and behaviour, it is yet unclear to what extent breathing modulates brain oscillations at rest. We acquired respiration and resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from human participants to investigate if, where, and how respiration cyclically modulates oscillatory amplitudes (2 to 150 Hz). Using measures of phase–amplitude coupling, we show respiration-modulated brain oscillations (RMBOs) across all major frequency bands. Sources of these modulations spanned a widespread network of cortical and subcortical brain areas with distinct spectrotemporal modulation profiles. Globally, delta and gamma band modulations varied with distance to the head centre, with stronger modulations at distal (versus central) cortical sites. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive mapping of RMBOs across the entire brain, highlighting respiration–brain coupling as a fundamental mechanism to shape neural processing within canonical resting state and respiratory control networks (RCNs).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Acquisition of ionic copper by the bacterial outer membrane protein OprC through a novel binding site</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Satya Prathyusha Bhamidimarri, Tessa R. Young, Muralidharan Shanmugam, Sandra Soderholm, Arnaud Baslé, Dirk Bumann, Bert van den Berg</p>

Copper, while toxic in excess, is an essential micronutrient in all kingdoms of life due to its essential role in the structure and function of many proteins. Proteins mediating ionic copper import have been characterised in detail for eukaryotes, but much less so for prokaryotes. In particular, it is still unclear whether and how gram-negative bacteria acquire ionic copper. Here, we show that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> OprC is an outer membrane, TonB-dependent transporter that is conserved in many Proteobacteria and which mediates acquisition of both reduced and oxidised ionic copper via an unprecedented CxxxM-HxM metal binding site. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutant OprC variants with silver and copper suggest that acquisition of Cu(I) occurs via a surface-exposed “methionine track” leading towards the principal metal binding site. Together with whole-cell copper quantitation and quantitative proteomics in a murine lung infection model, our data identify OprC as an abundant component of bacterial copper biology that may enable copper acquisition under a wide range of conditions.

                Background: Health technology assessment (HTA) is an effective tool for supporting priority setting (PS) in health. Stakeholder groups need to understand HTA appropriate to their role and to interpret and critique the evidence produced. We aimed to rapidly assess current health system priorities and policy areas of demand for HTA in Sub-Saharan Africa, and identify key gaps in data and skills to inform targeted capacity building. Methods: We revised an existing survey, delivered it to 357 participants, then analysed responses and explored key themes. Results: There were 51 respondents (14%, 30 full completions) across 14 countries. HTA was considered an important and valuable PS tool with a key role in the design of health benefits packages, clinical guideline development, and service improvement. Medicines were identified as a technology type that would especially benefit from the application of HTA. Using HTA to address safety issues (e.g. low-quality medicines) and value for money concerns was particularly highlighted. The perceived availability and accessibility of suitable local data to support HTA varied widely but was mostly considered inadequate and limited. Respondents also noted a need for training support in research methodology and data gathering. Conclusions: While important in raising awareness of HTA as a tool for PS, this study had a low response rate, and that respondents were self-selected. A more refined survey will be developed to support engagement strategies and capacity building.

He presented with hypertension and limb edema. Urinalysis revealed an active urine sediment with glomerular proteinuria at 1.5 g/24h and the renal biopsy identified mesangial IgA Nephropathy. Chest tomography scans showed signs of silicosis. The patient received Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors with stable renal function. To our knowledge, the association of silicosis-IgA nephropathy has rarely been reported in the literature. This case highlights the effect of chronic exposure to silica dust and its association with both silica and renal disease.

                Background The evaluation of nutrient variability plays a crucial role in accessing soil potentials and practical intervention responses in rice production systems. Synthetic fertilizer applications and cultivation practices are considered key factors affecting nutrient dynamics and availability. Here, we assessed the nutrient dynamics in surface, subsurface water and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Methods We implemented a field experiment (200 m 2) in the 2018 wet season and the 2019 dry season in a triple rice-cropping field. Eight samples of surface water, subsurface water (30–45 cm), and topsoil (0–20 cm) were collected and analysed during the rice-growing seasons. Results The results showed that N-NH 4+, P-PO 43- and total P peaks were achieved after fertilizing. Irrespective of seasons, the nutrient content in surface water was always greater than that of subsurface water (P<0.001), with the exception of N-NO 3-, which was insignificant (P>0.05). When comparing the wet and dry seasons, nutrient concentrations exhibited minor differences (P>0.05). Under conventional rice cultivation, the effects of synthetic fertilizer topdressing on the total N, soil organic matter (SOM), and total P were negligible in the soil. Higher rates of N fertilizer application did not significantly increase soil N-NH 4+, total N, yet larger P fertilizer amounts substantially enhanced soil total P (P<0.001). Conclusions Under conventional rice cultivation, N-NH 4+, P-PO 43- and total P losses mainly occur through runoff rather than leaching. While N-NO 3- loss is similar in surface water and subsurface water. Notably, nutrient content in soil was high; whilst SOM was seen to be low-to-medium between seasons. Future work should consider the nutrient balance and dynamic simulation in the lowland soil of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta’s paddy fields.

                Background - Many factors affect student performance such as the individual’s background, habits, absenteeism and social activities. Using these factors, corrective actions can be determined to improve their performance. This study looks into the effects of these factors in predicting student performance from a data mining approach. This study presents a data mining approach in identify significant factors and predict student performance, based on two datasets collected from two secondary schools in Portugal. Methods – In this study, two datasets collected from two secondary schools in Portugal. First, the data used in the study is augmented to increase the sample size by merging the two datasets. Following that, data pre-processing is performed and the features are normalized with linear scaling to avoid bias on heavy weighted attributes.  The selected features are then assigned into four groups comprising of student background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features. Next, Boruta feature selection is performed to remove irrelevant features. Finally, the classification models of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) origins are designed and their performances evaluated. Results - The models were trained and evaluated on an integrated dataset comprising 1044 student records with 33 features, after feature selection. The classification was performed with SVM, NB and MLP with 60-40 and 50-50 train-test splits and 10-fold cross validation. GridSearchCV was applied to perform hyperparameter tuning. The performance metrics were accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score. SVM obtained the highest accuracy with scores of 77%, 80%, 91% and 90% on background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features respectively in 50-50 train-test splits for binary classification (pass or fail). SVM also obtained highest accuracy for five class classification (grade A, B, C, D and F) with 39%, 38%, 73% and 71% for the four categories respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An intelligent decision support system for crop yield prediction using hybrid machine learning algorithms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In recent times, digitization is gaining importance in different domains of knowledge such as agriculture, medicine, recommendation platforms, the Internet of Things (IoT), and weather forecasting. In agriculture, crop yield estimation is essential for improving productivity and decision-making processes such as financial market forecasting, and addressing food security issues. The main objective of the article is to predict and improve the accuracy of crop yield forecasting using hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: This article proposes hybrid ML algorithms that use specialized ensembling methods such as stacked generalization, gradient boosting, random forest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Stacked generalization is a new model which learns how to best combine the predictions from two or more models trained on the dataset. To demonstrate the applications of the proposed algorithm, aerial-intel datasets from the github data science repository are used. Results: Based on the experimental results done on the agricultural data, the following observations have been made. The performance of the individual algorithm and hybrid ML algorithms are compared using cross-validation to identify the most promising performers for the agricultural dataset.  The accuracy of random forest regressor, gradient boosted tree regression, and stacked generalization ensemble methods are 87.71%, 86.98%, and 88.89% respectively. Conclusions: The proposed stacked generalization ML algorithm statistically outperforms with an accuracy of 88.89% and hence demonstrates that the proposed approach is an effective algorithm for predicting crop yield. The system also gives fast and accurate responses to the farmers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Isolated, unilateral oculomotor palsy with anti-GQ1b antibody following COVID-19 vaccination [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Neurological complications following vaccinations are extremely rare, but cannot be eliminated. Here, we report the first case of unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP) with anti-GQ1b antibody after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine. A 65-year-old man developed diplopia and ptosis in the right eye 17 days after vaccination, without preceding infection. Neurological examination revealed mild blepharoptosis, limitation of adduction, and vertical gaze on the right side. Increased levels of anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibody in the serum and albuminocytologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid were detected. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed swelling and enhancement of the right oculomotor nerve. The patient was diagnosed with right ONP accompanied with anti-GQ1b antibody, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy for 5 days was administered. The limitation of adduction and vertical gaze improved, and ptosis markedly resolved after IVIG treatment. Given the temporal sequence of disease progression, laboratory findings, and a favorable response to IVIG, a causal relationship cannot be ruled out between the occurrence of ONP and COVID-19 immunization. Since immunomodulatory treatments significantly hasten the recovery and minimize the residual symptoms in anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome, clinicians should be aware of this clinical condition following COVID-19 vaccination.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fa5b23c1-7e26-4d3e-9877-fb5700bf3ff4/cne25269-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Do crocodiles have a zona incerta?"/>
<p>A zona incerta is a feature common to all known mammalian brains but characters to identify it rely mainly on its location and, in particular, its relationship to the thalamic reticular nucleus. In <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, the neuronal morphology of the entopeduncular nucleus, a nucleus closely associated with but separate from the thalamic reticular nucleus complex was examined. This neuronal aggregate is suggested to be the crocodilian counterpart of the zona incerta of mammals.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In mammals, the zona incerta is thought to be involved in a number of behaviors: visceral activity, arousal, attention, and posture and locomotion. These diverse and complex features suggested that the zona incerta functions as a global or integrative node. Nevertheless, despite multiple investigations into its anatomy, physiology, and behavior in a variety of mammals, no specific character identifies the zona incerta besides its appearance in fiber-stained material and its relationship to surrounding structures. One such structure is the thalamic reticular nucleus whose caudal pole often contains some intermingled cells of the zona incerta. In crocodilians, the entopeduncular nucleus (ep) abuts the caudal pole of the thalamic reticular nucleus and displays different immunohistochemical properties and soma size when compared with neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus itself. To determine if neurons in the ep differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, the ep was investigated using Golgi methodology. The morphology and soma size of neurons in the ep differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus and indicated that these two areas are indeed separate neuronal aggregates. Based on these data and the known relationships of the zona incerta to surrounding structures in mammals, the ep of crocodilians is suggested to be the counterpart of the zona incerta of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for prophylactic treatment in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with severe hemophilia often present with painful joint and soft tissue bleeding which may restrict them from their daily activities. The current standard of care still relies on a regular prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII), which has a high daily treatment burden. Recently, rurioctocog alfa pegol, a third-generation recombinant FVIII with a modification in its polyethylene glycol (PEG) component, has been developed. Several trials have studied this synthetic drug as bleeding prophylaxis in severe hemophilia A. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA guidelines. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, and CINAHL (via EBSCOhost). Study qualities were assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Modified Jadad scales. Results: Four studies involving 517 previously treated severe hemophilia A patients were included in this study. The pooled mean of total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and hemostatic efficacy was 2.59 (95% CI = 2.04–3.14) and 92% (95% CI = 85%–97%), respectively. Only 30 (2.3%) non-serious and one (1.4%) serious adverse events were considered related to rurioctocog alfa pegol treatment. At the end of the studies, no development of FVIII inhibitory antibodies was observed. None of the developed binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG was correlated to the treatment efficacy and safety. Conclusions: Despite the limited availability of direct comparison studies, our analyses indicate that rurioctocog alfa pegol could serve as a safe and effective alternative for bleeding prophylaxis in previously treated hemophilia A patients. Moreover, it appears to have low immunogenicity, which further increases the safety profile of the drug in such clinical conditions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. While autoimmunity has been postulated to be pathophysiologically important in SFN, few autoantibodies have been described. We aimed to identify autoantibodies associated with idiopathic SFN (iSFN) by a novel high-throughput protein microarray platform that captures autoantibodies expressed in native conformational state.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sera from 58 SFN patients and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were screened against more than 1,600 immune-related antigens. Fluorescent unit readout and post-assay imaging were performed followed by composite data normalization, and protein fold change (pFC) analysis. Analysis of an independent validation cohort of 33 SFN patients against the same 20 HC was conducted to identify reproducible proteins in both cohorts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine autoantibodies were screened with statistical significance and pFC criteria in both cohorts, with at least 50% change in serum levels. Three proteins showed consistently high fold changes in main and validation cohorts - MX1 (FC = 2.99 and 3.07, <i>p</i> = 0.003 and q = 0.076 respectively), DBNL (FC = 2.11 and 2.16, <i>p</i> =0.009 and q = &lt;0.003 respectively), and KRT8 (FC = 1.65 and 1.70, <i>p</i> = 0.043 and q &lt;0.003 respectively). Further subgroup analysis into iSFN and secondary causes of SFN (sSFN) in the main cohort showed that MX1 is higher in iSFN compared to sSFN (FC = 1.61 vs. 0.106, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel autoantibodies MX1, DBNL and KRT8 are found in iSFN. MX1 may allow diagnostic subtyping of iSFN patients.</p>

                Microglia play a major role in certain neuropathological conditions. In a recent paper, Reusch et al. demonstrated how signaling pathways downstream of cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) converge in these cells. The findings suggest that CB2 receptors play a permissive role in microglia activation mediated by TLRs.

                Dopamine is a key neuromodulator for the control of striatal circuit function. Banerjee et al. show that evoked dopamine secretion occurs at release hotspots that contain active zone proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A small, computationally flexible network produces the phenotypic diversity of song recognition in crickets</a></h4>

              
                How neural networks evolved to generate the diversity of species-specific communication signals is unknown. For receivers of the signals one hypothesis is that novel recognition phenotypes arise from parameter variation in computationally flexible feature detection networks. We test this hypothesis in crickets, where males generate and females recognize the mating songs with a species-specific pulse pattern, by investigating whether the song recognition network in the cricket brain has the computational flexibility to recognize different temporal features. Using electrophysiological recordings from the network that recognizes crucial properties of the pulse pattern on the short timescale in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, we built a computational model that reproduces the neuronal and behavioral tuning of that species. An analysis of the model's parameter space reveals that the network can provide all recognition phenotypes for pulse duration and pause known in crickets and even other insects. Phenotypic diversity in the model is consistent with known preference types in crickets and other insects, and arise from computations that likely evolved to increase energy efficiency and robustness of pattern recognition. The model's parameter to phenotype mapping is degenerate-different network parameters can create similar changes in the phenotype-which likely supports evolutionary plasticity. Our study suggests that computationally flexible networks underlie the diverse pattern recognition phenotypes and we reveal network properties that constrain and support behavioral diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Branched ubiquitin chain binding and deubiquitination by UCH37 facilitate proteasome clearance of stress-induced inclusions</a></h4>

              
                UCH37, also known as UCHL5, is a highly conserved deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that associates with the 26S proteasome. Recently it was reported that UCH37 activity is stimulated by branched ubiquitin chain architectures. To understand how UCH37 achieves its unique debranching specificity, we performed biochemical and NMR structural analyses and found that UCH37 is activated by contacts with the hydrophobic patches of both distal ubiquitins that emanate from a branched ubiquitin. In addition, RPN13, which recruits UCH37 to the proteasome, further enhances branched-chain specificity by restricting linear ubiquitin chains from having access to the UCH37 active site. In cultured human cells under conditions of proteolytic stress, we show that substrate clearance by the proteasome is promoted by both binding and deubiquitination of branched polyubiquitin by UCH37. Proteasomes containing UCH37(C88A), which is catalytically inactive, aberrantly retain polyubiquitinated species as well as the RAD23B substrate shuttle factor, suggesting a defect in recycling of the proteasome. These findings provide a foundation to understand how proteasome degradation of substrates modified by a unique ubiquitin chain architecture is aided by a DUB.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mitochondrial iron transporter ABCB7 is required for B cell development, proliferation, and class switch recombination in mice</a></h4>

              
                Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are cofactors essential for the activity of numerous enzymes including DNA polymerases, helicases, and glycosylases. They are synthesized in the mitochondria as Fe-S intermediates and are exported to the cytoplasm for maturation by the mitochondrial transporter ABCB7. Here, we demonstrate that ABCB7 is required for bone marrow B cell development, proliferation, and class switch recombination, but is dispensable for peripheral B cell homeostasis in mice. Conditional deletion of ABCB7 using Mb1-cre resulted in a severe block in bone marrow B cell development at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of ABCB7 did not alter expression of transcription factors required for B cell specification or commitment. While increased intracellular iron was observed in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells, this did not lead to increased cellular or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, ferroptosis, or apoptosis. Interestingly, loss of ABCB7 led to replication-induced DNA damage in pro-B cells, independent of VDJ recombination, and these cells had evidence of slowed DNA replication. Stimulated ABCB7-deficient splenic B cells from CD23-cre mice also had a striking loss of proliferation and a defect in class switching. Thus, ABCB7 is essential for early B cell development, proliferation, and class switch recombination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Opioid antagonism modulates wanting-related frontostriatal connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical accounts distinguish between motivational ('wanting') and hedonic ('liking') dimensions of rewards. Previous animal and human research linked wanting and liking to anatomically and neurochemically distinct brain mechanisms, but it remains unknown how the different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems interact in processing distinct reward dimensions. Here, we assessed how pharmacological manipulations of opioid and dopamine receptor activation modulate the neural processing of wanting and liking in humans in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Reducing opioid receptor activation with naltrexone selectively reduced wanting of rewards, which on a neural level was reflected by stronger coupling between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the striatum under naltrexone compared with placebo. In contrast, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission with amisulpride revealed no robust effects on behavior or neural activity. Our findings thus provide insights into how opioid receptors mediate neural connectivity related to specifically motivational, not hedonic, aspects of rewards.

                Lost sensations, such as touch, could be restored by microstimulation (MiSt) along the sensory neural substrate. Such neuroprosthetic sensory information can be used as feedback from an invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic arm/hand, such that tactile and proprioceptive feedback from the sensorized robotic arm/hand is directly given to the BMI user. Microstimulation in the human somatosensory thalamus (Vc) has been shown to produce somatosensory perceptions. However, until recently, systematic methods for using thalamic stimulation to evoke naturalistic touch perceptions were lacking. We have recently presented rigorous methods for determining a mapping between ventral posterior lateral thalamus (VPL) MiSt, and neural responses in the somatosensory cortex (S1), in a rodent model (Choi et al., 2016; Choi and Francis, 2018). Our technique minimizes the difference between S1 neural responses induced by natural sensory stimuli and those generated via VPL MiSt. Our goal is to develop systems that know what MiSt will produce a given neural response and possibly a more natural "sensation." To date, our optimization has been conducted in the rodent model and simulations. Here we present data from simple non-optimized thalamic MiSt during peri-operative experiments, where we MiSt in the VPL of macaques with a somatosensory system more like humans. We implanted arrays of microelectrodes across the hand area of the macaque S1 cortex as well as in the VPL thalamus. Multi and single-unit recordings were used to compare cortical responses to natural touch and thalamic MiSt in the anesthetized state. Post stimulus time histograms were highly correlated between the VPL MiSt and natural touch modalities, adding support to the use of VPL MiSt towards producing a somatosensory neuroprosthesis in humans.

                Successful behavior relies on the ability to use information obtained from past experience to predict what is likely to occur in the future. A salient example of predictive encoding comes from the vertebrate retina, where neural circuits encode information that can be used to estimate the trajectory of a moving object. Predictive computations should be a general property of sensory systems, but the features needed to identify these computations across neural systems are not well understood. Here, we identify several properties of predictive computations in the primate retina that likely generalize across sensory systems. These features include calculating the derivative of incoming signals, sparse signal integration, and delayed response suppression. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how the brain carries out predictive computations and identify features that can be used to recognize these computations throughout the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Infant Sleep Electroencephalographic Marker of Thalamocortical Connectivity Predicts Behavioral Outcome in Late Infancy</a></h4>

              
                Infancy represents a critical period during which thalamocortical brain connections develop and mature. Deviations in the maturation of thalamocortical connectivity are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. There is a lack of early biomarkers to detect and localize neuromaturational deviations, which can be overcome with mapping through high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) assessed in sleep. Specifically, slow waves and spindles in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are generated by the thalamocortical system, and their characteristics, slow wave slope and spindle density, are closely related to neuroplasticity and learning. Recent studies further suggest that information processing during sleep underlying sleep-dependent learning is promoted by the temporal coupling of slow waves and spindles, yet slow wave-spindle coupling remains unexplored in infancy. Thus, we evaluated three potential biomarkers: 1) slow wave slope, 2) spindle density, and 3) the temporal coupling of slow waves with spindles. We use hdEEG to first examine the occurrence and spatial distribution of these three EEG features in healthy infants and second to evaluate a predictive relationship with later behavioral outcomes. We report four key findings: First, infants' EEG features appear locally: slow wave slope is maximal in occipital and frontal areas, whereas spindle density is most pronounced frontocentrally. Second, slow waves and spindles are temporally coupled in infancy, with maximal coupling strength in the occipital areas of the brain. Third, slow wave slope, spindle density, and slow wave-spindle coupling are not associated with concurrent behavioral status (6 months). Fourth, spindle density in central and frontocentral regions at age 6 months predicts later behavioral outcomes at 12 and 24 months. Neither slow wave slope nor slow wave-spindle coupling predict behavioral development. Our results propose spindle density as an early EEG biomarker for identifying thalamocortical maturation, which can potentially be used for early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders in infants. These findings are complemented by our companion paper that demonstrates the linkage of spindle density to infant nighttime movement, framing the possible role of spindles in sensorimotor microcircuitry development. Together, our studies suggest that early sleep habits, thalamocortical maturation, and behavioral outcome are closely interwoven. A crucial next step will be to evaluate whether early therapeutic interventions may be effective to reverse deviations in identified individuals at risk.

                Dogma holds that Toxoplasma gondii persists in neurons because neurons cannot clear intracellular parasites, even with IFN-{gamma} stimulation. As several recent studies questioned this idea, we used primary murine neuronal cultures from wild-type and transgenic mice in combination with IFN-{gamma} stimulation and parental and transgenic parasites to reassess IFN-{gamma} dependent neuronal clearance of intracellular parasites. We found that neurons respond to IFN-{gamma} and that a subset of neurons clear intracellular parasites via immunity regulated GTPases. Whole neuron reconstructions from mice infected with parasites that trigger neuron GFP expression only after full invasion revealed that ~40% of these T. gondii-invaded neurons no longer harbor parasites. Finally, IFN-{gamma} stimulated human stem cell derived neurons showed a ~ 50% decrease in parasite infection rate when compared to unstimulated cultures. This work highlights the capability of human and murine neurons to mount cytokine-dependent anti-T. gondii defense mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An essential role for a discrete parasubthalamic nucleus subpopulation in appetite suppression</a></h4>

              
                Food intake behavior is regulated by a network of appetite-inducing and appetite-suppressing neuronal populations throughout the brain. The parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a relatively unexplored population of neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, has been hypothesized to regulate appetite due to its connectivity with other anorexigenic neuronal populations and because these neurons express Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, following a meal. However, the individual cell types that make up the PSTN are not well characterized, nor are their functional roles in food intake behavior. Here we identify and distinguish between two discrete PSTN subpopulations, those that express tachykinin-1 (PSTNTac1 neurons) and those that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PSTNCRH neurons), and use a panel of genetically encoded tools in mice to show that PSTNTac1 neurons play an essential role in appetite suppression. Both subpopulations increase activity following a meal and in response to administration of the anorexigenic hormones amylin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTNTac1, but not PSTNCRH neurons, reduces the appetite-suppressing effects of these hormones. Consistently, optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of PSTNTac1 neurons, but not PSTNCRH neurons, is sufficient to reduce food intake in hungry mice. PSTNTac1 and PSTNCRH neurons project to distinct downstream brain regions, and stimulation of PSTNTac1 projections to individual anorexigenic populations reduces food consumption. Taken together, these results reveal the functional properties and projection patterns of distinct PSTN cell types and demonstrate an essential, anorexigenic role for PSTNTac1 neurons in the hormonal and central regulation of appetite.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Realistic alpha oscillations and transient responses in a cortical microcircuit model</a></h4>

              
                Neural-mass modeling of neural population data (EEG, ECoG, or LFPs) has shown promise both in elucidating the neural processes underlying cortical rhythms and changes in brain state, as well as offering a framework for testing the interplay between these rhythms and information processing. Models of cortical alpha rhythms (8 - 12 Hz) and their impact in visual sensory processing have been at the forefront of this effort, with the Jansen-Rit being one of the more popular models in this domain. The Jansen-Rit model, however, fails in reproducing key physiological observations including the level of inputs that cortical neurons receive and their responses to visual transients. To address these issues we generated a neural mass model that complies better with synaptic mediated dynamics, intrinsic alpha behavior, and produces realistic responses. The model is robust to many changes in parameter values but critically depends on the ratio of excitation to inhibition, producing response transients whose features are dependent on this ratio and alpha phase and power. The model is sufficiently flexible so as to be able to easily replicate the range of low frequency oscillations observed in different studies. Consistent with experimental observations, we find phase-dependent response dynamics to both visual and electrical stimulation using this model. The model suggests that stimulation facilitates alpha at particular phases and suppresses it in others due to a phase dependent lag in inhibitory responses. Hence, the model generates insight into the physiological parameters responsible for intrinsic oscillations and testable hypotheses regarding the interactions between visual and electrical stimulation on those oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sequence learning attenuates cortical responses in both frontal and perceptual cortices in early infancy</a></h4>

              
                Prior work using a variety of imaging modalities has found that the frontal lobe is involved in higher-order sequential and statistical learning in young infants. Separate lines of work have found evidence of modulation of posterior sensory cortices during and after learning tasks. How do these processes relate together? Here, we build from a well-regarded EEG task that found evidence that the frontal lobe of young infants tracked higher-order sequential information (Basirat et al., 2014) and ask whether posterior perceptual cortices respond differentially to predictable vs. unpredictable sequences as well. First, replicating and extending past work, we found evidence of frontal lobe involvement in this task. Second, consistent with our hypotheses, we found that there is a corresponding attenuation of neural responses in the posterior perceptual cortices (temporal and occipital) to predictable compared to unpredictable audiovisual sequences. This study provides convergent evidence that the frontal lobe is crucial for higher-level learning in young infants but that it likely works as part of a large, distributed network of regions to modulate infant neural responses as a result of learning. Overall, this work challenges the view that the infant brain is not dynamic and disconnected, lacking in long-range neural connections. Instead, this paper reveals patterns of a highly dynamic and interconnected infant brain that change rapidly as a result of new, learnable experiences.

                Mammalian hearing involves the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) of sound-induced fluid waves in the cochlea. Essential to this process are the specialised sensory cochlear cells, the inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). While genetic hearing loss is highly heterogeneous, understanding the requirement of each gene will lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of hearing and also to therapeutic opportunities for deafness. The Neuroplastin (Nptn) gene, which encodes two protein isoforms Np55 and Np65, is required for hearing, and homozygous loss-of-function mutations that affect both isoforms lead to profound deafness in mice. Here we have utilised several distinct mouse models to elaborate upon the spatial, temporal, and functional requirement of Nptn for hearing. While we demonstrate that both Np55 and Np65 are present in cochlear cells, characterisation of a Np65-specific mouse knockout shows normal hearing thresholds indicating that Np65 is functionally redundant for hearing. In contrast, we find that Nptn-knockout mice have significantly reduced maximal MET currents and MET channel open probabilities in mature OHCs, with both OHCs and IHCs also failing to develop fully mature basolateral currents. Furthermore, comparing the hearing thresholds and IHC synapse structure of Nptn-knockout mice with those of mice that lack Nptn only in IHCs and OHCs shows that the majority of the auditory deficit is explained by hair cell dysfunction, with abnormal afferent synapses contributing only a small proportion of the hearing loss. Finally, we show that continued expression of NEUROPLASTIN in OHCs of adult mice is required for membrane localisation of Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase 2 (PMCA2), which is essential for hearing function. Moreover, Nptn haploinsufficiency phenocopies Atp2b2 (encodes PMCA2) mutations, with heterozygous Nptn-knockout mice exhibiting hearing loss through genetic interaction with the Cdh23ahl allele. Together, our findings provide further insight to the functional requirement of Neuroplastin for mammalian hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-frequency changes in single-trial visual evoked potentials for unattended stimuli in chronic schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Patients with schizophrenia reveal changes in information processing associated with external stimuli, which is reflected in the measurements of brain evoked potentials. We discuss actual knowledge on electro- (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) changes in schizophrenia. The commonly used averaging technique entails the loss of information regarding the generation of evoked responses. We propose a methodology to describe single-trial (non-averaged) visual evoked potentials (VEP) using spectral and statistical analyses. We analysed EEG data registered in the O1-Cz and O2-Cz leads during unattended pattern-reversal stimulation, collected from a group of adult patients with chronic schizophrenia, and compared them to those of healthy individuals. Short-time single-trial VEP were transformed to the frequency domain using the FFT algorithm. Changes of the spectral power were visualized using spectrograms which were created by stacking single-trial spectra across all trials. Measures of the absolute and the relative spectral power were calculated and compared statistically. In schizophrenia, the energy density of VEP oscillations is shifted towards higher (gamma) frequencies, compared to healthy individuals. These differences are statistically significant in all analysed frequency bands for the relative power. This indicates distorted early processing of visual stimuli in schizophrenia. The presented observations complement the knowledge on gamma oscillations acquired from computationally more complex methods of time--frequency analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biophysical and Architectural Mechanisms of Subthalamic Theta under Response Conflict</a></h4>

              
                The cortico-basal ganglia circuit is needed to suppress prepotent actions and to facilitate controlled behavior. Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus [STN] exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal [STN-Globus Pallidus externus (GPe)] network, and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN "conflict detector" units, due to an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.

                Non-human primates, especially rhesus macaques, have been a dominant model to study sensorimotor control of the upper limbs. Indeed, human and macaques have similar hands and homologous neural circuits to mediate manual behavior. However, few studies have systematically and quantitatively compared the manual behaviors of the two species. Such comparison is critical for assessing the validity of using the macaque sensorimotor system as a model of its human counterpart. In this study, we systematically compared the prehensile behaviors of humans and rhesus macaques using an identical experimental setup. We found human and macaque prehension kinematics to be generally similar but with a few subtle differences. Humans and macaques have similar major axes of movements and similar kinematics subspaces. Human grasps are more object-specific and the movement of human digits are less correlated with each other. Monkeys demonstrate more stereotypical grasping behaviors that are common across all grasp conditions. Our results bolster the use of the macaque model to understand the neural mechanisms of manual dexterity.

                Many age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are characterised by abundant inclusions of amyloid filaments. Filamentous inclusions of the proteins tau, amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), -synuclein and TDP-43 are the most common. Here, we used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination to show that residues 120-254 of the lysosomal type II transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) also form amyloid filaments in the human brain. We solved cryo-EM structures of TMEM106B filaments from the brains of 22 individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, including sporadic and inherited tauopathies, A{beta}-amyloidoses, synucleinopathies and TDP-43opathies, as well as from the brains of two neurologically normal individuals. We observed three different TMEM106B folds, with no clear relationship between folds and diseases. The presence of TMEM106B filaments correlated with that of a 29 kDa sarkosyl-insoluble fragment of the protein on Western blots. The presence of TMEM106B filaments in the brains of older, but not younger, neurologically normal individuals indicates that they form in an age-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural Basis for pH-Gating of the K+ Channel TWIK1 at the Selectivity Filter</a></h4>

              
                TWIK1 is a widely expressed pH-gated two-pore domain K+ channel (K2P) that contributes to cardiac rhythm generation and insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. TWIK1 displays unique properties among K2Ps including low basal activity and inhibition by extracellular protons through incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of TWIK1 in lipid nanodiscs at high and low pH that reveal a novel gating mechanism at the K+ selectivity filter. At high pH, TWIK1 adopts an open conformation. At low pH, protonation of an extracellular histidine results in a cascade of conformational changes that close the channel by sealing the top of the selectivity filter, displacing the helical cap to block extracellular ion access pathways, and opening gaps for lipid block of the intracellular cavity. These data provide a mechanistic understanding for extracellular pH-gating of TWIK1 and show how diverse mechanisms have evolved to gate the selectivity filter of K+ channels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Audiovisual task switching rapidly modulates sound encoding in mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                In everyday behavior, sensory systems are in constant competition for attentional resources, but the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms of modality-selective attention remain largely uninvestigated. We conducted translaminar recordings in mouse auditory cortex (AC) during an audiovisual (AV) attention shifting task. Attending to sound elements in an AV stream reduced both pre-stimulus and stimulus-evoked spiking activity, primarily in deep layer neurons. Despite reduced spiking, stimulus decoder accuracy was preserved, suggesting improved sound encoding efficiency. Similarly, task-irrelevant probe stimuli during intertrial intervals evoked fewer spikes without impairing stimulus encoding, indicating that these attention influences generalized beyond training stimuli. Importantly, these spiking reductions predicted trial-to-trial behavioral accuracy during auditory attention, but not visual attention. Together, these findings suggest auditory attention facilitates sound discrimination by filtering sound-irrelevant spiking in AC, and that the deepest cortical layers may serve as a hub for integrating extramodal contextual information.
