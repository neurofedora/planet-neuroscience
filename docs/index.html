              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23776">Convergent transcriptomic and neuroimaging signature of Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.23776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multi-factorial neurodevelopmental disorder, whose causes are still poorly understood. Effective therapies to reduce all the heterogeneous symptoms of the disorder do not exists yet, but behavioural programs started at a very young age may improve the quality of life of the patients. For this reason, many efforts have been dedicated to the research of a reliable biomarker for early diagnosis. Machine learning approaches to distinguish ASDs from healthy controls based on their brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) have been plagued by the problem of confounders, showing poor classification performance and inconsistency in the biomarker definition. Brain transcriptomics studies, instead, showed some converging results, but being based on data that can be acquired only post-mortem they are not useful for diagnosis. In this work, using an imaging transcriptomics approach, the following results have been obtained.
  1) A deep learning based classifier resilient to confounders and able to exploit the temporal dimension of resting state functional MRIs has been developed, reaching an AUC of 0.89 on an independent test set.
  2) Five gene network modules involved in ASD have been identified, by analyzing brain transcriptomics data of subjects with ASD and healthy controls.
  3) By comparing the brain regions relevant for the classifier obtained in the first step and the brain-wide gene expression profiles of the modules of interest obtained in the second step, it has been proved that the regions that characterize ASD brain at the neuroimaging level are those in which four out of the five gene modules take a significantly high absolute value of expression.
  These results prove that, despite the heterogeneity of the disorder, it is possible to identify a neuroimaging-based biomarker of ASD, confirmed by transcriptomics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24125">Weak but influential: Nonlinear contributions of structural connectivity to human cognitive abilities and brain functions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.24125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse human cognitive abilities are rooted in brain structural connectivity which has weights spanning several orders of magnitude. However, due to false-positive challenges in tractography, weak connectivity has been often treated as noise and ignored - despite its prevalence across mammalian brains. Here we show that weak connectivity significantly predicts human cognitive abilities and supports brain functions through amplification of its small weight in a nonlinear manner. Using the Human Connectome Project dataset (n=999) and multiple tractography algorithms, we constructed the whole-brain structural connectivity with heterogeneous weights of streamline numbers. We found that weak connectivity involves high individual variability and significantly predicts general cognitive ability and memory in individuals, and it is also critical for whole-brain dynamic simulation and structure-function coupling. Importantly, fusing two post-tractography filtering methods of streamlines potentially results in more reliable connectivity that preserves weak links and outperforms conventional thresholding in predicting cognitive abilities and functional connectivity. At the network level, weak connectivity expands the operational capacity of brain networks to enhance both global integration and fine-grained segregation, thereby supporting a functional balance essential for cognitive abilities. Finally, we identified a specific type of weak connectivity mainly linking visual/motor to limbic areas with negative gene co-expression, which has a disproportionately large impact on cognitive predictions and network dynamics.

                arXiv:2505.24790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neurotechnology enable precise spatiotemporal patterns of microstimulations with single-cell resolution. The choice of perturbation sites must satisfy two key criteria: efficacy in evoking significant responses and selectivity for the desired target effects. This choice is currently based on laborious trial-and-error procedures, unfeasible for sequences of multi-site stimulations. Efficient methods to design complex perturbation patterns are urgently needed. Can we design a spatiotemporal pattern of stimulation to steer neural activity and behavior towards a desired target? We outline a method for achieving this goal in two steps. First, we identify the most effective perturbation sites, or hubs, only based on short observations of spontaneous neural activity. Second, we provide an efficient method to design multi-site stimulation patterns by combining approaches from nonlinear dynamical systems, control theory and data-driven methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using multi-site stimulation patterns in recurrent network models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23917">Representational Difference Explanations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.23917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for discovering and visualizing the differences between two learned representations, enabling more direct and interpretable model comparisons. We validate our method, which we call Representational Differences Explanations (RDX), by using it to compare models with known conceptual differences and demonstrate that it recovers meaningful distinctions where existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques fail. Applied to state-of-the-art models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an effective and explainable tool for contrasting model representations.

                arXiv:2505.24673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has introduced the concept of finite-time scaling to characterize bifurcation diagrams at finite times in deterministic discrete dynamical systems, drawing an analogy with finite-size scaling used to study critical behavior in finite systems. In this work, we extend the finite-time scaling approach in several key directions. First, we present numerical results for 1D maps exhibiting period-doubling bifurcations and discontinuous transitions, analyzing selected paradigmatic examples. We then define two observables, the finite-time susceptibility and the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, that also display consistent scaling near bifurcation points. The method is further generalized to special cases of 2D maps including the 2D Chialvo map, capturing its bifurcation between a fixed point and a periodic orbit, while accounting for discontinuities and asymmetric periodic orbits. These results underscore fundamental connections between temporal and spatial observables in complex systems, suggesting new avenues for studying complex dynamical behavior.

                arXiv:2501.02333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the causal interactions in some brain tasks, such as face processing, remains a challenging and ambiguous process for researchers. In this study, we address this issue by employing a novel causal discovery method -Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity (DAGMA)- to investigate the causal structure of the brain's face-selective network and gain deeper insights into its mechanism. Using fMRI data of natural movie stimuli, we extract causal network of face-selective regions and analyze how frames containing faces influence this network. Specifically, our findings reveal that the presence of faces in the stimuli, causally affects the number of identified connections within the network. Additionally, our results highlight the crucial role of subcortical regions in satisfying causal sufficiency, emphasizing it's importance in causal studies of brain. This study provides a new perspective on understanding the causal architecture of the face-selective network of the brain, motivating further research on neural causality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18117">Multi-Modal Spectral Parametrization Method (MMSPM) for analyzing EEG activity with distinct scaling regimes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.18117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aperiodic neural activity has been the subject of intense research interest lately as it could reflect on the cortical excitation/inhibition ratio, which is suspected to be affected in numerous clinical conditions. This phenomenon is characterized via the aperiodic scaling exponent $\beta$, equal to the spectral slope following log-log transformation of power spectra. Despite recent progress, however, most current methods do not take into consideration the plausible multimodal nature in the power spectra of neurophysiological recordings - i.e., $\beta$ might be different in low- ($\beta_{lo}$) and high-frequency ($\beta_{hi}$) regimes -, especially in case of $|\beta_{lo}|>|\beta_{hi}|$. Here we propose an algorithm, the multi-modal spectral parametrization method (MMSPM) that aims to account for this issue. MMSPM estimates $\beta_{lo}$ and $\beta_{hi}$ separately using a constrained, piece-wise regression technique, and also assesses if they are significantly different or instead the spectrum is indeed unimodal and can be characterized simply with broadband $\beta$. Here we present the MMSPM algorithm and evaluate its performance in silico on simulated power spectra. Then, we use MMSPM on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from 19 young, healthy volunteers, as well as on a separate dataset of EEG recordings from 30 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy controls, and demonstrate that broadband (0.1-100 Hz and 0.5-45 Hz) EEG spectra can indeed present a bimodality pattern with significantly steeper low-range ($<\sim2$ Hz) and flatter high-range scaling regimes (i.e., $|\beta_{lo}|>|\beta_{hi}|$).
  Clinical relevance: The MMSPM method characterizes aperiodic neural activity in distinct scaling regimes, which can be relevant in numerous pathological conditions such as dementia or schizophrenia.

Abstract: This article critically examines the foundational principles of contemporary AI methods, exploring the limitations that hinder its potential. We draw parallels between the modern AI landscape and the 20th-century Modern Synthesis in evolutionary biology, and highlight how advancements in evolutionary theory that augmented the Modern Synthesis, particularly those of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, offer insights that can inform a new design paradigm for AI. By synthesizing findings across AI and evolutionary theory, we propose a pathway to overcome existing limitations, enabling AI to achieve its aspirational goals.

Abstract: Understanding how neuronal networks reorganize in response to external stimuli and give rise to behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods often fail to capture the evolving structure of neural connectivity in ways that capture its relationship to behavior, especially in dynamic, uncertain, or high-dimensional settings with sufficient resolution or interpretability. We introduce the Temporal Attention-enhanced Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Network (TAVRNN), a novel framework that models time-varying neuronal connectivity by integrating probabilistic graph learning with temporal attention mechanisms. TAVRNN learns latent dynamics at the single-unit level while maintaining interpretable population-level representations, to identify key connectivity patterns linked to behavior. TAVRNN generalizes across diverse neural systems and modalities, demonstrating state-of-the-art classification and clustering performance. We validate TAVRNN on three diverse datasets: (1) electrophysiological data from a freely behaving rat, (2) primate somatosensory cortex recordings during a reaching task, and (3) biological neurons in the DishBrain platform interacting with a virtual game environment. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic embedding techniques, revealing previously unreported relationships between adaptive behavior and the evolving topological organization of neural networks. These findings demonstrate that TAVRNN offers a powerful and generalizable approach for modeling neural dynamics across experimental and synthetic biological systems. Its architecture is modality-agnostic and scalable, making it applicable across a wide range of neural recording platforms and behavioral paradigms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24161">Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.24161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making through neuromorphic hardware, making them compelling for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. Recent studies in this field directly replace Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by SNNs in existing RL frameworks, overlooking whether the RL algorithm is suitable for SNNs. However, most RL algorithms in continuous control are designed tailored to ANNs, including the target network soft updates mechanism, which conflict with the discrete, non-differentiable dynamics of SNN spikes. We identify that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training in continuous control tasks. To bridge this gap between discrete SNN and continuous control, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The continuous and differentiable dynamics of the proxy target enable smooth updates, bypassing the incompatibility of SNN spikes, stabilizing the RL algorithms. Since the proxy network operates only during training, the SNN retains its energy efficiency during deployment without inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that compared to vanilla SNNs, the proxy target framework enables SNNs to achieve up to 32% higher performance across different spiking neurons. Notably, we are the first to surpass ANN performance in continuous control with simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This work motivates a new class of SNN-friendly RL algorithms tailored to SNN's characteristics, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

Abstract: Deep Learning, driven by neural networks, has led to groundbreaking advancements in Artificial Intelligence by enabling systems to learn and adapt like the human brain. These models have achieved remarkable results, particularly in data-intensive domains, supported by massive computational infrastructure. However, deploying such systems in Aerospace, where real time data processing and ultra low latency are critical, remains a challenge due to infrastructure limitations. This paper proposes a novel concept: the Airborne Neural Network a distributed architecture where multiple airborne devices each host a subset of neural network neurons. These devices compute collaboratively, guided by an airborne network controller and layer specific controllers, enabling real-time learning and inference during flight. This approach has the potential to revolutionize Aerospace applications, including airborne air traffic control, real-time weather and geographical predictions, and dynamic geospatial data processing. By enabling large-scale neural network operations in airborne environments, this work lays the foundation for the next generation of AI powered Aerospace systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13898">Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.

                arXiv:2505.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

">Redundancy masking and the compression of information in the brain</a></h4>

              
                The visual world is inherently complex, presenting far more information than a human visual system can process in full. To manage this overload, the visual brain employs several mechanisms. One mechanism that possibly contributes to the reduction of information is redundancy masking (RM): the reduction of the number of perceived items in repeating patterns. For example, when three identical lines are presented in the periphery, observers often perceive only two. The underlying neural mechanisms of RM remain unclear. Here, we use steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to examine whether redundancy-masked items are neurally suppressed or integrated with neighboring items. Three identical arcs (quarter-circles; 0.44{degrees} line width) were presented in the periphery (eccentricities: 17.3{degrees}, 19.5{degrees}, and 21.7{degrees}), each tagged with a unique frequency. Participants maintained central fixation, monitored via a gaze-contingent control, and reported the number of arcs they predominantly perceived after each 10s trial. We analyzed baseline-corrected amplitudes at each tagged frequency and calculated signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for fundamental and intermodulation (IM) components, separating trials by behavioral responses (RM: 2 items perceived, non-RM: 3 items perceived). Fundamental frequency comparisons revealed that the outer arc elicited higher SSVEP responses than the inner and middle one under RM, with no significant differences between arcs under non-RM. However, fundamental frequency SNRs did not differ between RM and non-RM perceptions. When we compared IM SNRs, the middle and outer arc's combination was significantly higher during RM compared to non-RM, suggesting increased neural integration between them. These results indicate that RM involves a loss of conscious access to visual information, yet corresponding neural signals are not entirely suppressed. Instead, the neural signatures we found suggest the integration with neighboring elements across space and time. We suggest that redundancy-masked items - although unavailable for conscious report- are still observed in the neural signatures of RM.

We hypothesize that semantic memories are altered in a similar way when retrieval draws on a core dimension of conceptual knowledge: semantic granularity. Each level, from accessing a concept via unique perceptual features to its thematic context, shapes the retrieval route used to access semantic memories. This study tests whether semantic granularities used to retrieve a concept influences its reactivation during later recognition. Human participants learned and retrieved novel word-image pairs while undergoing fMRI. Following encoding, items were retrieved via one of three semantic levels: item, category, or theme. Later, participants accessed the memories in recognition and cued recall tests. Although behavioral memory performance was matched across conditions, neural activity during recognition varied based on prior retrieval history. Recognition patterns could be classified according to prior retrieval granularity in ventral temporal cortex for both remembered and non-remembered concepts, and in the hippocampus for remembered concepts only. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed bilateral clusters along the ventral visual stream, from early visual cortex to fusiform gyrus, where retrieval history was decodable. Representational similarity analyses showed that category-level retrieval increased pattern consistency in early visual cortex and pattern reactivation in ventral temporal cortex, while item-level retrieval enhanced memory trace distinctiveness in visual word form area. Theme-level retrieval increased activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that how we access a concept leaves a detectable trace on subsequent neural reactivation, subtly shaping how conceptual knowledge is organized in the brain.

">Distributed learning across fast and slow neural systems supports efficient motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation is a fundamental aspect of motor learning. Intelligent systems must adapt to perturbations in the environment while simultaneously maintaining stable memories. Classic work has argued that this trade-off could be resolved by complementary learning systems operating at different speeds; yet the mechanisms enabling coordination between slow and fast systems remain unknown. Here, we propose a multi-region distributed learning model in which learning is shared between two populations of neurons with distinct roles and structures: a recurrent 'controller' network which stores a slowly evolving memory, and a feedforward 'adapter' network that rapidly learns to respond to perturbations in the environment. In our model, supervised learning in the adapter produces a predictive error signal that simultaneously tutors consolidation in the controller through a local plasticity rule. Our model offers insight into the mechanisms that may support distributed computations in the motor cortex and cerebellum during motor adaptation.

">D1/D5 Receptor Activation Promotes Long-Term Potentiation and Synaptic Tagging/Capture in Hippocampal Area CA2</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal area CA2 plays an important role in social memory formation. However, CA2 is characterised by plasticity-resistant Schaffer collateral-CA2 (SC-CA2) synapses and highly plastic entorhinal cortex-CA2 (EC-CA2) synapses. Despite abundant dopaminergic input, the relationship between dopamine signalling and area CA2 synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. Here, we show that SKF-38393-mediated Dopamine D1-like receptor (dopamine D1 and D5 receptors) activation differentially primes CA2 inputs in an NMDAR and protein synthesis-dependent manner. We defined an inverted-U shape relationship between SKF-38393 concentration and EC-CA2 potentiation. Additionally, we observed a priming effect on SC-CA2 plasticity with 50M SKF-38393, relieving plasticity resistance. We also demonstrated that this effect follows canonical protein kinase A (PKA) signalling. Collectively, our results show that D1R activation primes the CA2 for synaptic plasticity. Thus, we propose a link between neuropsychiatric diseases related to impaired dopamine transmission and deficits in hippocampus-dependent social memory.

">Nucleus accumbens neuron subtype translatome signatures in socially stress females</a></h4>

              
                Background: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a reward circuitry hub associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic stress in rodents. While transcriptional adaptations in NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor 1(D1) or dopamine receptor 2 (D2) and adenosine 2a receptor (A2A) are well characterized in socially stressed male rodents, there is less knowledge of MSN subtype adaptations in socially stressed females. Methods: Chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS) was performed in female D1-Cre-RiboTag and A2A-Cre-RiboTag mice. After stress, mice were separated into high- and low-social interactors with a three Chamber Social Interaction test. Following isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA, MSN subtype-specific gene expression profiles were determined with RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis (DEG) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Consensus WGCNA with male mouse social defeat stress and clinically relevant human transcriptomic datasets was performed to examine the translational sex-specific molecular signatures. Results: 9 DEGs in D1-MSNs and 630 in A2A-MSNs were identified in female stress groups (FDR < 0.05). D1-MSN DEGs were mostly upregulated in CWDS low vs high interactors and were enriched for functions related to energy homeostasis and cell adhesion. A2A-MSN DEGs upregulated in low interactors involved structural molecules while downregulated genes involved neurotransmission. WGCNA identified 9 significant D1- and 5 significant A2A-MSN modules related to cell structure, protein synthesis, synapse and mitochondria. The most impacted modules from each subtype (based on DEG count) were enriched for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and regulated by the Nf1 transcription factor. Consensus module analysis identified a module significantly associated with social stress in a sex- and subtype-specific manner in both mice and humans enriched for genes involved in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Conclusion: Chronic social stress-induced sex-specific molecular signatures were uncovered in female subjects. Consensus modules across stress and clinical populations implicate alterations in MSN subtypes could contribute to MDD signatures among female populations.

">Uncovering the invisible giant: Amyloid β plaques and their proposed association with waste removal in Alzheimer-affected human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                According to the prevalent 'Amyloid Hypothesis,' the underlying cause for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer Disease (AD) is attributed to the accumulation of misfolded Amyloid {beta} and tau protein in the form of extracellular sticky plaques and neurofibrillary tangles respectively. These protein accumulations are thought to be caused by impaired waste removal. In an alternative hypothesis, we have proposed the existence of an extensive glial canal system that is likely formed by myelinated aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-expressing tanycytes and removes cellular waste from the hippocampal formation. Here, we demonstrate that tanycyte-derived waste-internalizing receptacles are immunoreactive for A{beta} and emanate from specialized nucleus-like organelles in the following referred to as 'tanysomes.' Utilizing RNA-scope in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that these receptacle-forming tanysomes express RNA for AQP4 and the A{beta}-related genes, amyloid precursor protein, and presenilin 1. These findings suggest that A{beta} is likely synthesized where receptacle formation is observed and that A{beta} may play an important structural role in receptacle formation. In AD-affected hippocampus excessive amounts of A{beta}-immunoreactive waste receptacles emerge from tanysomes and have the appearance of plaques in A{beta}-immunolabeled hippocampus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same receptacle-forming organelles exhibit strong immunolabeling for hyperphosphorylated tau protein in AD-affected tissue. We postulate that both proteins may play important structural roles in waste uptake and that hypertrophic swelling of impaired tanycytes in AD-affected brain may be due to obstructions of this extensive interconnected glial canal system.

">Peripheral anatomy and central connectivity of proprioceptive sensory neurons in the Drosophila wing</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in electron microscopy (EM) and automated image segmentation have produced synaptic wiring diagrams of the Drosophila central nervous system. A limitation of existing fly connectome datasets is that most sensory neurons are excised during sample preparation, creating a gap between the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we bridge this gap by reconstructing wing sensory axons from the Female Adult Nerve Cord (FANC) EM dataset and mapping them to peripheral sensory structures using genetic tools and light microscopy. We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching. The peripheral location and central projections of wing sensory neurons are stereotyped across flies, allowing this wing proprioceptor atlas and genetic toolkit to guide analysis of other fly connectome datasets.

">Atypical antipsychotics alter microglial functions via astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles</a></h4>

              
                A limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of atypical antipsychotics has hindered efforts to develop the next generation of treatments for schizophrenia. In particular, there has been little investigation of how medications like clozapine and olanzapine modulate human non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Recent postmortem and serum-based studies suggest that schizophrenia etiology involves dysregulated cellular communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs). Astrocytes are a major source of these EVs and are strongly implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia by convergent data from human postmortem, brain imaging, RNA-sequencing, and genome-wide association studies. We hypothesized that clozapine and olanzapine can affect microglia biology indirectly via astrocytic secretion of EVs. We used in vitro cellular models with primary human astrocytes and PBMC-derived microglial-like cells to investigate the downstream impact of isolated astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) on microglial phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia, including microglial phagocytosis, motility, and morphology. To model microglia-mediated synaptic pruning in vitro, we utilized image-based quantification of microglia engulfment of isolated human synaptosomes. We found that treatment with ADEVs reduced microglial synaptosome phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. This reduction was reversed upon addition of ADEVs isolated from astrocytes treated with norclozapine or olanzapine. ADEVs isolated from clozapine-treated astrocytes increased microglial motility, indicating that clozapine alters microglial surveillance activity without affecting phagocytosis through these ADEVs. Together, these results suggest that atypical antipsychotics have distinct and indirect impact on microglia biology mediated by ADEVs. These results highlight a potentially critical role for ADEVs in regulating glial cell communication and suggest they may be promising therapeutic targets for next-generation antipsychotic development.

">Peptides alleviate cognitive impairment by inhibiting and disassembling amyloid-beta aggregates in Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devasting neurodegenerative disorder characterized by beta-amyloid formation, further exacerbated by RIPK1/RIPK3 necrosome-induced programmed necrosis (necroptosis). We previously showed that the RIPK1/RIPK3 necrosome forms a functional amyloid complex using its RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs). Here, we discovered that the core RIPK1/RIPK3 necrosome shares strikingly structural similarity to the C-terminal region of beta-amyloid (Ab-42), and the RHIM-derived tetrapeptides (IQIG or VQVG) directly inhibit Ab aggregation, disassemble preformed Ab fibrils (PFFs), and reduce RIPK1 polymerization. Also, the peptides exhibit effective membrane permeability and could reduce Ab-40 or Ab-42-induced neural death and TNFa-induced necroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. IQIG and VQVG injected by ICV increase learning and memory abilities by reducing Ab plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. Mechanistically, the peptides directly interact with A{beta} to block Ab aggregation and alleviate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Strikingly, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the peptides-treated AD transgenic mice restored neuronal homeostasis with increased GABAergic neurons and decreased glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, total cell-cell interaction strength increased while the AD risk gene Apoe expression decreased in the specific oligodendrocyte subtype of peptides-treated AD mice. Thus, our findings revealed that the peptides could improve cognition and memory capabilities and serve as promising structural templates for potential drugs against AD.

">Rab2 and Arl8/BORC control retrograde axonal transport of dense core vesicles via Syd/dJIP3/4 and RUFY dynein adaptors</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles (DCVs) are generated in the neuronal cell body and circulate throughout the axonal arbor to supply distal release sites. This circulation depends on the anterograde kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motors and the retrograde dynein-dynactin motor. While kinesin-3 is recruited to DCVs with the aid of the small GTPase Arl8, it is unclear how dynein and kinesin-1 are recruited and regulated. Here we show that DCV motility in Drosophila (fruit flies) depends on the dynein and kinesin-1 adaptor Sunday Driver/dJIP3/4(Syd) and the novel dynein adaptor RUFY. Syd and RUFY bind each other; moreover, Syd binds the DCV-located GTPase Rab2 that controls retrograde DCV transport, and RUFY binds Arl8. Disruption of Rab2, Syd, RUFY, dynein, and the Arl8 activator BORC all produce a similar DCV axonal transport phenotype characterized by axonal accumulation of immobile DCVs and a selective reduction in retrograde DCV flux. Our data suggest a model where dynein is recruited and activated by a complex of Syd and RUFY, which is anchored to DCVs by a Rab2- and Arl8-dependent mechanism. Lastly, we show that loss of Rab2 results in missorting of the DCV membrane proteins VMAT and Synaptotagmin-, similar to the reported effect of Rab2 deletion on the sorting of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins. However, disruption of Syd, RUFY or dynein does not phenocopy the Rab2 specific VMAT sorting defect, suggesting that Rab2 employs separate effectors in DCV biogenesis and motility.

">EEG reveals how space acts as a late heuristic of time</a></h4>

              
                To compensate for its sensory intangibility, humans often rely on spatial metaphors, gestures, and visual tools to represent the passage of time. These spatial tools, i.e. heuristics, range from everyday practices, such as directional hand gestures to indicate past or future events, to more abstract scientific conceptualizations such as the curving of space-time in the theory of relativity. Despite this widespread spatialization of time, it remains unclear to what extent space is an inherent component of the neural representation of time and its role in monitoring temporal durations. Here, we combine EEG-behavioral methods and neural network models of optimal decision-making to show that space is a late compensatory mechanism of time representation recruited when faster and non-spatial timekeeping mechanisms are suboptimally engaged. EEG analyses reveal a cascade-like process: spatial engagement in timekeeping follows the insufficient non-spatial encoding of time intervals, leading to delayed decisions on their length and slower response selection. Computational modelling further indicates that trial-by-trial fluctuations in the spatialization of time are explained by stochastic variations in the activity of the dopaminergic/noradrenergic (DA/NE) system and its interaction with the anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide the first clear evidence of when, why, and how the brain recruits spatial mechanisms in the service of temporal processing and demonstrate that non-spatial and spatial timekeeping systems can be dissociated at both behavioural and electrophysiological levels.

">Lysosomal stress induces amyloid-β aggregate release and reactive transformation in human astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are essential for brain homeostasis and are involved in amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) clearance, but whether they can produce and release A{beta} aggregates remains unclear. Using human iPSC-derived astrocytes, we show that astrocytes cell autonomously generate small, diffusible A{beta} aggregates under baseline conditions. By combining ultrasensitive single-molecule imaging (DNA-PAINT) and immunoassays, we detect intracellular aggregates and their release into the media. Notably, lysosomal membrane damage induced by L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) significantly increases A{beta} aggregate secretion without altering their size or morphology. Transcriptomic analysis and cytokine profiling reveal that lysosomal stress triggers a reactive astrocyte phenotype marked by upregulation of inflammatory genes and secreted cytokines. These findings suggest that astrocytes are not merely passive A{beta} scavengers but can actively contribute to extracellular A{beta} accumulation under lysosomal stress. Our study highlights astrocytes as active players in Alzheimer's disease pathology.

">Recovery of retinal terminal fields after traumatic brain injury: evidence of collateral sprouting and sexual dimorphism</a></h4>

              
                The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair. Little is known about repair of pathways/circuits after traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in disruption of connectivity. Here we utilize a mouse model of diffuse traumatic axonal injury (Impact-acceleration TBI) in order to explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and synapses were genetically labeled via AAV transduction, while anterograde and transsynaptic tracers were used to mark terminals and postsynaptic cells. Functional connectivity and visual integrity were assessed by monitoring c-Fos expression following light stimulation and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Our findings demonstrate that, although TAI results in approximately a 50% loss of RGC axons and terminals, surviving RGCs generate collateral sprouting, a form of compensatory branching of surviving axons, that restores terminal density to pre-injury levels. Transsynaptic tracing and c-Fos mapping confirmed the reestablishment of connectivity, which was also associated with significant improvements in visual function as measured by pVEPs. Interestingly, the recovery process exhibited sexual dimorphism, with female mice showing delayed or incomplete repair. Moreover, collateral sprouting proceeded normally in Sarm1 knockout mice, evidence of some independence from Wallerian degeneration. Our findings show that collateral sprouting may be an important mechanism of circuit repair in TAI independent of Wallerian degeneration and may represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions.

">A Minimal Physiological Model of Perceptual Suppression and Breakthrough in Visual Rivalry</a></h4>

              
                Visual rivalry paradigms provide a powerful tool for probing the mechanisms of visual awareness and perceptual suppression. While the dynamics and determinants of perceptual switches in visual rivalry have been extensively studied and modeled, recent advances in experimental design - particularly those that quantify the depth and variability of perceptual suppression - have outpaced the development of computational models. Here we extend an existing dynamical model of binocular rivalry to encompass two novel experimental paradigms: a threshold detection variant of binocular rivalry, and tracking continuous flash suppression. Together, these tasks provide complementary measures of the dynamics and magnitude of perceptual suppression. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a single mechanism, competitive (hysteretic) inhibition between slowly adapting monocular populations, can account for the suppression depth findings across both paradigms. This unified model offers a foundation for the development of a quantitative theory of perceptual suppression in visual rivalry.

">Effects of Natural Lithium and Lithium Isotopes on Voltage Gated Sodium Channel Activity in SH-SY5Y and IPSC Derived Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Although lithium (Li) is a widely used treatment for bipolar disorder, its exact mechanisms of action remain elusive. Research has shown that the two stable Li isotopes, which differ in their mass and nuclear spin, can induce distinct effects in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Since sodium (Na+) channels are the primary pathway for Li+ entry into cells, we examined how Li+ affects the current of Na+ channels using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Our findings indicate that mammalian Na+ channels in both neuronal models studied here display no selectivity between Na+ and Li+, unlike previously reported bacterial Na+ channels. We observed differences between the two neuronal models in three measured parameters (Vhalf, Gmax, z). We saw no statistically significant differences between any ions in SHSY-5Y cells, but small differences in the half-maximum activation potential (Vhalf) between Na+ and 6Li+ and between 7Li+ and 6Li+ were found in iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Although Na+ channels are widely expressed and important in neuronal function, the very small differences observed in this work suggest that Li+ regulation through Na+ channels is likely not the primary mechanism underlying Li+ isotope differentiation.

">Protective role of Cannabidiol against nicotine pouch-induced seizure aggravation and alterations in brain glymphatic biomarkers.</a></h4>

              
                Nicotine pouches are increasingly popular as a smokeless alternative to tobacco, yet their long-term neurological effects remain poorly understood. In this preclinical study, we investigated the time-dependent impact of oral nicotine pouch exposure on seizure susceptibility, glymphatic function, and neuroinflammation in mice, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhaled cannabidiol (CBD). Using the Racine scale, we found that acute nicotine exposure transiently reduced seizure severity, while chronic exposure significantly exacerbated seizures and impaired glymphatic integrity, as evidenced by downregulation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Chronic nicotine also elevated circulating levels of HMGB1 and IL-6, indicating sustained systemic inflammation. Notably, inhaled CBD reversed these pathological changes, reducing seizure severity, restoring AQP4 expression, and normalizing inflammatory markers. Molecular analyses further revealed upregulation of BDNF and c-FOS with chronic nicotine exposure, which was also mitigated by CBD. In conclusion, these findings suggest that while nicotine pouches may confer short-term neurophysiological modulation, chronic use poses significant risks for seizure vulnerability and glymphatic dysfunction. Inhaled CBD demonstrates strong neuroprotective potential and may serve as a promising therapeutic approach for individuals exposed to prolonged nicotine use.

">Overexpression of DnaJ chaperones in ameliorating toxicities associated with FUS and TDP-43</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease. It primarily affects the motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and eventual death of patients. Various factors, such as genetics, environment, age, etc, are involved in the etiopathogenesis of ALS. As ALS is a highly challenging and complex disease that involves various pathogeneses linked with progressive motor neuron degeneration, it is difficult to have a single therapeutic target against this disease. ALS mutants of TDP-43 and FUS are showing slow growth as well as protein aggregation in the cytoplasm in yeast. Our study involves cloning of 38 Drosophila DnaJ domain chaperones and overexpressing them in a yeast ALS model. After the interaction of mutants TDP-43 and FUS with the DnaJ domain chaperones, they were categorized into suppressors and enhancers. The major hits on our screen were CG7872, Hsc70-4, and Mrj, which rescued TDP-43 toxicity by reducing the protein aggregation and slow growth in yeast cells. In the FUS, slow growth and protein aggregation is reduced with the chaperones CG32641 and CG6693, resulting in a lowering of the FUS toxicity. On the other hand, chaperones CG2911, CG2790, and CG8476 in the presence of TDP-43 overexpression, grow more slowly with increasing punctae in yeast cells. These chaperones increase the toxicity of TDP-43. Similarly, in FUS, Hsc20, CG7130, CG2911, and JdpC also showed a slow growth phenotype and increased protein aggregation in yeast cells. These chaperones enhance the toxicity of FUS. This screening will enhance our understanding of ALS, and the chaperones identified in this study can serve as neuroprotective agents for ALS.

">Opposing effects of H2A.Z on memory, transcription and pathology in male and female Alzheimer's disease mice and patients</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that disproportionately impacts women, but underlying mechanisms for sex-divergent outcomes are unknown. Here, we show that the histone variant H2A.Z is a novel sex-specific regulator of AD in human patients and AD model mice. Specifically, H2A.Z binding in chromatin declines in female and increases in male AD patients, indicating opposite patterns of AD-related H2A.Z dysregulation in each sex. These sex differences were recapitulated in the 5xFAD model of AD, in which females accumulated H2A.Z at early disease stages and lost H2A.Z as the disease progressed, suggesting that H2A.Z occupancy shifts with advancing disease. Males showed no change in H2A.Z binding in early disease, but exhibited increased binding as disease progressed, albeit to a lesser extent than females. Consistent with sex-specific H2A.Z dysregulation, H2A.Z depletion produced sex-specific changes in gene expression, whereby H2A.Z was more repressive in female than male mice and in 5xFAD than in WT males, suggesting that H2A.Z's role in transcription is altered with disease state. Moreover, H2A.Z depletion improved memory and AD pathology in females, while impairing memory and worsening pathology in male mice. Together, these data suggest that H2A.Z is protective in males and detrimental in females with AD, with key implications for sex-specific therapeutic targeting of chromatin factors.

">Pyruvate kinase activates SARM1 to exacerbate axonal degeneration in diabetic peripheral neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a prevalent and disabling complication of diabetes, characterized by progressive axonal degeneration. However, the molecular link between hyperglycemia and axon injury remains unclear. Here, we identify pyruvate kinase M (PKM) as a direct metabolic activator of the NADase SARM1 under high-glucose conditions. Proteomic and biochemical analyses reveal that PKM binds the TIR domain of SARM1 via its C-terminal region, allosterically enhancing NADase activity independently of PKM's glycolytic role. In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, hyperglycemia strengthens the PKM-SARM1 interaction, driving NAD+ depletion, axonal fragmentation, and sensory dysfunction. Genetic depletion of PKM protects against streptozotocin-induced neuropathy, preserving nerve fiber density, restoring NAD+ levels, and alleviating mechanical allodynia. Most notably, we developed Pep-SP1, a competitive inhibitory peptide derived from residues 645-655 of the SARM1 TIR domain, which selectively disrupts the PKM-SARM1 interaction without impairing PKM metabolism or SARM1 catalytic activity. Systemic delivery of Pep-SP1 attenuates axonal degeneration and improves sensory outcomes in diabetic mice. By targeting a disease-potentiating interface, we expand therapeutic strategies beyond catalytic and allosteric inhibition, offering a mechanistically distinct avenue for axon protection with broad relevance to metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders.

">Abnormal synaptic proteomes, impaired neural ensembles, and defective behaviors in autism mouse models are ameliorated by dietary intervention with nutrient mixtures</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of heterogeneous, behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental conditions influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we show that nutrients--an important environmental factor--can modulate synaptic proteomes, reconfigure neural ensembles, and improve social behaviors in ASD mouse genetic models. We analyzed Tbr1+/- mice, a well-established model of ASD, using proteomic approaches and in vivo calcium imaging. Synaptic and metabolic proteomes were found to be sensitive to Tbr1 haploinsufficiency. Our results also revealed that Tbr1 haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine--all nutrients known to regulate synapse formation and activity--were then combined into supplement cocktails and administered to Tbr1+/- mice. This treatment altered synaptic and metabolic proteomes and normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA in Tbr1+/- mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement cocktails containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of Tbr1+/- mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in Nf1+/- and Cttnbp2+/M120I mice, two additional ASD mouse models. Thus, our findings reveal aberrant neural connectivity in the BLA of Tbr1+/- mice and indicate that dietary supplementation with zinc, BCAA, and/or serine offers a safe and accessible approach to mitigate neural connectivity and social behaviors across multiple ASD models.

">A Movement-Independent Signature of Urgency During Human Perceptual Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain adjust its decision processes to ensure timely decision completion? Computational modelling and electrophysiological investigations have pointed to dynamic 'urgency' processes that serve to progressively reduce the quantity of evidence required to reach choice commitment as time elapses. To date, such urgency dynamics have been observed exclusively in neural signals that accumulate evidence for a specific motor plan. Across three complementary experiments, we show that a classic ERP component, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), also traces dynamic urgency but exhibits unique properties not observed in effector-selective signals. Firstly, it provides a representation of urgency alone, growing only as a function of time and not evidence strength. Secondly, when choice reports must be withheld until a response cue, the CNV peaks and decays long before response execution, mirroring the early termination dynamics of a motor-independent evidence accumulation signal. These properties suggest that the brain may use urgency signals not only to expedite motor planning but also to hasten cognitive deliberation. These data demonstrate that urgency processes operate in a variety of perceptual choice scenarios and that they can be monitored in a model-independent manner via non-invasive brain signals.

">Movement sonification during haptic exploration shifts emotional outcome without altering texture perception</a></h4>

              
                Adding movement sonification to haptic exploration can change the perceptual outcome of a textured surface through multisensory processing. We hypothesized that auditory-evoked emotions would influence the appraisal of textured surfaces, with corresponding changes reflected in cortical excitability. Participants actively rubbed two different textured surfaces (slippery and rough) either without movement sonification, or with pleasant or disagreeable movement sonification. We found that sounds, whether agreeable or disagreeable, did not change the texture appraisal. However, the less pleasant surface was associated with a stronger negative hedonic valence, particularly when paired with disagreeable movement sonification. Time frequency analyses of EEG activities revealed a significant reduction in beta-band power [15-25 Hz] within the source-estimated sensorimotor and superior posterior parietal cortices when contrasting both pleasant and unpleasant sound with the silent touch. This suggests that the primary somatosensory cortices together with the superior parietal regions participated in the audio-tactile binding, with both pleasant and unpleasant sounds. In addition, we observed a significant increase in beta-band power in medial visual areas, specifically when disagreeable movement sonification was paired with tactile exploration. This may reflect a disengagement of visual cortical processing, potentially amplifying auditory-driven emotional responses and intensifying the perceived unpleasantness of the explored surfaces.

">Basal forebrain volume is associated with cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired older adults at varying genetic risk for Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: The primary cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex arises from the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), a group of magnocellular neurons clustered within the posterior basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS). Postmortem and in vivo neuroimaging studies have demonstrated significant neuronal loss and BFCS atrophy, most prominently in the nbM, in both mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimers disease (AD). However, less is known surrounding the relationship between accumulating Alzheimers pathology, BFCS atrophy, and cognition during early preclinical stages of AD. Methods: The current study investigates the relationship between sub-structural BFCS volume and cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged individuals at varying genetic risk for AD. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 50-65 with a first-degree family history for AD were genetically screened to select three groups: APOE genotype e4e4 (n=15), e3e4 (n=15), and e3e3 (n=15), matched for age and sex. Participants underwent imaging with [11C]PiB PET and structural 3T MRI. Distribution volumes ratios (DVR) with a whole cerebellum reference region were calculated for [11C]PiB PET analyses. BFCS sub-structural volumes were obtained from regions of interest generated from the SPM8 Anatomy Toolbox (Ch1-3, Ch4). Results: BFCS amyloid burden was highest among APOE e4e4 homozygotes (Ch1-3, F(2, 42)=3.26, P=0.048; Ch4, F(2, 42)=3.82, P= 0.03). Ch4(nbM), but not Ch1-3 volume, was found to be inversely associated with global amyloid burden (Pearson r=-0.40, P=0.007). Exploratory analyses in groups stratified by amyloid positivity demonstrated reduced Ch4 volume (P=0.032) and significant inverse associations between Ch4 volume and amyloid burden (Pearson r = -0.70, P=0.02) in amyloid+ participants. Medial temporal lobe (MTL) volumes were neither significantly different between amyloid+ vs. amyloid- participants nor were they associated with global amyloid burden in either amyloid+ participants, amyloid- participants, or the pooled sample. Conclusions: We observed nbM (Ch4), but not MTL volume, to be significantly inversely associated with cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired, amyloid+, older adults at varying genetic risk for AD. These findings provide further in vivo evidence suggesting BFCS (specifically nbM) atrophy may precede medial temporal atrophy in the preclinical stage of AD and that nbM atrophy is an early structural correlate of AD pathogenesis.

">Motor impairment and adaptation in a novel non-human primate model of internal capsule infarct</a></h4>

              
                Loss of distal hand and finger control is among the most disabling consequences of stroke. Functional outcomes are typically worse when infarcts involve subcortical white matter tracts, particularly the internal capsule, yet most preclinical stroke models target cortical regions. To address this gap, we developed a non-human primate model of internal capsule infarct using stereotactically guided endothelin-1 injections to disrupt descending fibers from the primary motor cortex hand area. Serial structural and diffusion MRI, along with histology, confirmed subcortical infarcts centered on the targeted white matter region with no apparent cortical involvement. Motor function was assessed pre- and post-infarct using a joystick-based center-out task (proximal forelimb control) and a Kluver board task (distal forelimb control). Animals exhibited variable impairments in proximal function and consistent post-infarct deficits in distal function, including reduced contralesional hand use, longer retrieval time, and increased in-well digit flexions. One animal showed mild post-infarct impairment and the smallest lesion, highlighting that this model reflects inter-individual differences in infarct size and functional outcome as seen in human subcortical stroke. In contrast, the other two animals developed a compensatory wrist-extended posture on the Kluver board task by 4 weeks post-infarct, which stabilized the hand and enabled improved digit flexion. Incorporating this behavioral adaptation into statistical models improved prediction of motor performance. The observed adaptation may have drawn on spared corticospinal output pathways, allowing animals to re-engage pre-existing motor routines to perform the retrieval. While future studies may benefit from ethologically relevant tasks to further elucidate such adaptations, findings from this study recapitulate key features of human subcortical stroke, including persistent distal motor deficits and emergence of adaptive motor strategies. By combining precise lesioning, longitudinal imaging, and detailed behavioral analysis, this model provides a translationally oriented platform for studying white matter stroke mechanisms and evaluating interventions that promote functional recovery.

">Reduced susceptibility to experimentally-induced complex visual hallucinations with age</a></h4>

              
                Visual hallucinations occur across many clinical conditions, but can also be induced experimentally in healthy individuals, using high-frequency flicker (Ganzflicker) and sensory deprivation (Ganzfeld). It is unclear how hallucinatory proneness changes across the lifespan, with prior questionnaire-based studies showing mixed results. As factors such as multi-sensory acuity loss and relatively increased reliance on prior knowledge may increase as we age, and these are considered risk factors for hallucination proneness, we hypothesised that reported decreases in hallucinations might reflect stigma-related underreporting. We therefore sought to measure hallucination proneness in 44 healthy adults spanning the adult lifespan (younger age group; n=22; age 19-39 years, mean: 27.2, SD: 5.5; older age group n=22; age 59-79 years, mean: 68.0, SD: 5.8), quantifying the tendency to experience complex and simple hallucinations in an experimental environment designed to elicit hallucinations. We find that reports of complex hallucinations (those representing objects, scenes, etc) are lower in older adults than in younger adults, both in real time and retrospectively. None of our measured cognitive or sensory measures (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perceptual reorganisation, imagery vividness, memory inhibition, and suggestibility) mediate this relationship. We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology.

">Locomotion-induced neural activity independent of auditory feedback in the mouse inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence indicates that the auditory pathway integrates movement-related signals with auditory input, yet the precise sources and mechanisms of this integration across various processing levels are incompletely understood. The inferior colliculus (IC), a major midbrain hub in the auditory pathway, shows widespread modulation of neural activity during locomotion, indicating that auditory neurons at this level are sensitive to ongoing movement. However, in hearing animals, it has been challenging to dissociate auditory feedback from other motor-related signals. In this study, to isolate non-auditory contributions, we recorded IC neural activity during locomotion in deafened mice, thereby eliminating all auditory feedback through both air and bone conduction. Even in the absence of auditory input, IC neurons exhibited robust, bidirectional modulation during locomotion. Timing analysis using electromyography revealed both predictive and feedback components relative to locomotion onset. Furthermore, the timing and direction of modulation varied considerably across different locomotion bouts, suggesting convergence of multiple non-auditory inputs. These findings demonstrate that non-auditory, movement-related signals significantly shape auditory midbrain activity through both predictive and feedback mechanisms.

">Prevalence and modulation of rat off-track head-scanning on linear tracks: possible implications for representational and dynamical properties of hippocampal place cells</a></h4>

              
                (Re)mapping of different environments by hippocampal place cells is thought to reflect incidental learning. Rat head scanning is a spontaneous and presumed investigatory behavior that can trigger the onset of firing locations in place cells. This behavior was studied on (quasi-)circular tracks, and it was speculated that off-track head scans might have been overlooked or inadvertently discouraged in studies employing more common apparatus. To better understand the general prevalence and significance of off-track scanning, we investigated it in rats running laps on linear tracks in rooms featuring visual landmarks. Rats scanned along the entire length of the track, even in highly familiar conditions and when they were rewarded only at the two ends of the track (albeit less than rats rewarded throughout the track), demonstrating that co-localized rewards are not necessary for the occurrence of this behavior. Scanning rate increased markedly in a novel room and then declined steeply during each daily session in this room over 3 days. Partial daily boosts transiently counteracted this decline, producing a seesaw profile that is reminiscent of previous observations on rat rearing or place cell plasticity. Moreover, the remapping that place cells are known to undergo in similar context changes could conceivably be facilitated by the putative surge of new place fields induced by increased scanning. Hence, investigatory behaviors could be causally involved in the representational and dynamic properties of hippocampal representations. Addressing these possibilities could help uncover the learning processes governing the incidental creation and update of a cognitive map.

">Characterising Structural Brain Connectivity of Patients with First Episode of Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Schizophrenia is associated with widespread neuroanatomical abnormalities affecting both grey matter and white matter (WM). Early symptoms are often linked to dysfunctions in the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe. This study aims to clarify WM alterations in early-stage psychosis and elucidate the role of structural connectivity (SC) in its pathophysiology. STUDY DESIGN: We analysed SC derived from diffusion MRI in 127 patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia (FES group), compared with healthy controls. Focusing on the fronto-parietal-temporal network, we examined SC across three hierarchical levels: network, node, and connection. SC metrics were compared between groups using 3-factor ANCOVA, accounting for relevant covariates. We also investigated associations between SC metrics and core positive symptoms using non-parametric correlations. RESULTS: The FES group showed significantly reduced average SC strength and global efficiency within the fronto-parietal-temporal network. At the nodal level, SC strength was significantly lower in the left inferior and middle temporal gyri (L.ITG, L.MTG), and in the right inferior parietal gyrus (R.IPG) and temporal pole (R.TP). No significant group differences emerged at the connection level. Notably, SC strength in the R.IPG was negatively correlated with Conceptual Disorganisation scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal global and regional SC disruptions in early psychosis, particularly in areas supporting cognitive, language, and executive functions. The observed association between R.IPG connectivity and Conceptual Disorganisation supports the link between disrupted SC and formal thought disorder, reinforcing the role of impaired structural integration in early psychosis.

">Dexmedetomidine produces more sleep-like brain activity compared to propofol</a></h4>

              
                Introduction. Dexmedetomidine is a selective 2-adrenergic agonist used as an anesthesia adjunct to produce a state of sleep-like sedation. However, how brain activity compares quantitatively during dexmedetomidine anesthesia to that during natural sleep, and thus just how "sleep-like" dexmedetomidine anesthesia is, remains unclear. Previously, we showed that the general anesthetic propofol is associated with changes in connectivity and cortical network structure comparable to those observed during sleep. Here, we compare the effects on brain activity of dexmedetomidine, propofol, and sleep quantitatively using intracranial encephalographic (iEEG) recordings in human research participants. Methods. iEEG recordings were obtained in 34 epilepsy patients being evaluated for potential seizure resection surgery. Band power and functional connectivity (alpha weighted phase lag index, gamma envelope correlations) and network entropy were measured in recordings during task-free ("resting state") periods just prior to surgery during anesthesia with either dexmedetomidine or propofol, and during overnight sleep. Anesthesia stage (wake, sedated, unresponsive) was determined using the Observer's Assessment of Arousal and Sedation. Sleep was staged using standard polysomnography. Results. As expected, significant differences in delta power were observed during dexmedetomidine and propofol as well as during sleep. However, the magnitude of changes in delta power were smaller and regionally heterogeneous for propofol compared to dexmedetomidine and sleep. Functional connectivity changes were comparable between dexmedetomidine, propofol, and natural sleep. Significant changes in network entropy were observed for dexmedetomidine, propofol, and sleep, but changes were larger for propofol compared to dexmedetomidine and sleep. Quantitative comparisons between changes in delta power and network entropy suggest that unresponsiveness under dexmedetomidine produces a similar brain state to that observed during N2 sleep. Conclusions. While delta power, functional connectivity, and network entropy all showed changes during propofol, dexmedetomidine, and sleep, the magnitudes of these changes suggest that dexmedetomidine is more similar than propofol to sleep, specifically to N2 sleep.

">Four-dimensional neural space for moral inference</a></h4>

              
                Intuitive moral inference enables us to evaluate moral situations and judge their rightness or wrongness. Although Moral Foundations Theory provides a framework for understanding moral inference, its underlying neural basis remains unclear. To capture spontaneous neural activity during moral inference, participants were instructed to watch a film rich in moral content without making explicit judgments while undergoing fMRI scanning. Independent participants evaluated the moment-to-moment presence of twenty moral dimensions in the film. Correlation and consensus cluster analyses revealed four independent main moral dimensions: virtue, vice, hierarchy, and rebellion. While each dimension exhibited unique neural activation patterns, the temporoparietal junction and inferior parietal lobe were activated across all types of moral inference. These findings establish the low-dimensional nature for the neural basis of intuitive moral inference in everyday settings.

<p>In this study, we found that astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout in male mice led to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence, disrupting neurotransmitter receptor expression and synaptic proteins, impairing neuroregeneration. Urolithin A and S1P inhibitor PF429242 alleviated these effects, highlighting HSP60's role in CNS health and potential therapeutic targets.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function in astrocytes and has a significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) health. However, how HSP60 regulates the mitochondrial function of astrocytes to inhibit neuroregeneration remains unknown. In this study, we generated astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout male mice to investigate the consequences of HSP60 deficiency. Firstly, our results confirmed that HSP60 deficiency caused abnormal expression of mitochondrial function-related genes, causing significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggered cellular senescence in astrocytes. Moreover, the alterations of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) expression suggested a disruption in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the increased levels of site-1 protease (S1P), truncated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (truncated-BDNF), and synaptophysin indicate synaptic structural and functional impairments. Expectedly, our findings demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in astrocytes, leading to altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the cortex, as well as reduced neuronal numbers and neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus after the deletion of HSP60 in astrocytes of the male mice. Notably, Urolithin A (UA) and the S1P inhibitor, PF429242, were found to alleviate astrocyte senescence and promote neuronal regeneration by inhibiting truncated BDNF expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that HSP60 deficiency in astrocytes induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence via the S1P/truncated-BDNF pathway, resulting in disrupted neurotransmitter receptor expression, synaptic protein alterations, and impaired neuroregeneration. These insights underscored the importance of HSP60 in CNS health and provided promising avenues for developing treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Immune pathways and cell types that protect against neurodegenerative processes with aging remain poorly understood. Sulka et al. demonstrate that the innate immune adaptor, STING, provides essential protection against blood-brain barrier breaches and neuromotor deficits during physiological aging. Furthermore, microglial STING is sufficient to protect against these aspects of age-associated decline.

                Background Flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in Malaysia with major social, economic, and psychological consequences. Compared to material and logistical preparedness, the psychological aspects of disaster management are not given much emphasis. Methods This conceptual paper employs a systematic literature review to understand the factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. The literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Directory of Open Access Journals, Supplemental Index and Google Scholar with keywords including “disaster preparedness, flood, natural disaster and psychological preparedness”. Articles were included if they focused on preparedness towards disasters as well as examined coping mechanisms, perceptions and preparedness behaviours in the context of flood-related crises and excluded if they lack methodological rigor. The review synthesized findings using a thematic analysis approach, identifying psychological resilience and coping strategies in flood-affected populations, the role of social support networks in preparedness and recovery as well as mental health implications of floods, including anxiety, trauma, and post-disaster recovery. This synthesis informed the development of a conceptual model to address factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. According to contemporary theories of catastrophe risk reduction and psychological resilience, critical variables included are risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social support. Results It was proposed that these factors work together to determine an individual’s psychological preparedness, enhancing their ability to cope with the psychological and emotional strain of a flood disaster. Conclusions By offering these perspectives, the study contributes to the limited academic discussion on psychological preparedness in Malaysia, which aims to improve the psychological resilience of communities vulnerable to flooding. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological preparedness into existing disaster management strategies to reduce the overall damage caused by floods.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics short-read RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Emerging long-read RNA sequencing technologies are discussed as a complement to short-read methods, promising reduced deconvolution needs and further innovation.

                Background Human males and females show differences in the incidence of neutrophil-associated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, and differences in neutrophil physiological responses such as responses to infection, tissue damage, and chemotactic factors. However, little is known about the basis of sex-based differences in human neutrophils. Methods Starting with human neutrophils from healthy donors, we used RNA-seq to examine total RNA profiles, RNAs not associated with ribosomes and thus not being translated, RNAs in monosomes, and RNAs in polysomes and thus heavily translated. Results There were sex-based differences in the levels of RNAs across free RNA, monosome, and polysome fractions. Male neutrophils had increased levels of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins in the free RNA fractions, indicating low levels of translation. The polysomes of male neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and cell activation. The polysomes of female neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs associated the regulation of metabolic processes, cytokine responses, and mitochondrial proteins. Conclusions These data indicate that male and female neutrophils have different expression patterns and different translation efficiency of some mRNAs. This may contribute to the observed sex-based differences in neutrophil behavior and neutrophil-associated disease incidence and severity.

                <p>Lactate plays an important role in brain energy metabolism. It contributes to normal brain development and to neuroprotection in diabetic hypoglycemia, but its role in neonatal hypoglycemia is unclear. Moreover, lactate can work as a signaling substance via the lactate receptor HCAR1 (Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1). Recent studies indicate that HCAR1 is protective in mouse models of neonatal hypoxic ischemia and has a role in metabolic regulation in glial cells during hypoglycemia. Here we have studied potential impacts of HCAR1 on axonal and myelin development in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum of young (P21) wild-type (WT) mice and HCAR1 KO mice and in cortical organotypic brain slice cultures. The HCAR1 KO mice showed lower axonal area relative to WT in both cortex and corpus callosum. However, the myelin area was unaffected by HCAR1 KO. Using particle and colocalization analysis, we show that HCAR1 KO predominantly reduces axonal size in unmyelinated axons. Using an organotypic brain slice model of neonatal hypoglycemia, we find that lactate protects both axonal and myelin development in hypoglycemia, partially via HCAR1. Lastly, live imaging with a pH-sensitive dye on acute cortical brain slices indicates that cellular lactate uptake is influenced by HCAR1. In conclusion, our findings support a role of HCAR1 in axonal development and in lactate&rsquo;s protective effects in hypoglycemia.</p>

                <p>by Inmaculada Villanueva-Baxarias, Anna Pellisé-Tintoré, María Pérez-Rodríguez, Laura Nogué, Pooja Vaziraani, Iris Soveral, Fàtima Crispi, Olga Gómez, Patricia Garcia-Canadilla, Oscar Camara, Bart Bijnens, Gabriel Bernardino</p>

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a common congenital heart defect characterized by aortic narrowing. Prenatally, it has mild hemodynamic effects as right ventricular disproportion and ductus arteriosus (DA) dilation occur as adaptive mechanisms, but their impact on CoA hemodynamics remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we built a closed 0D computational model of fetal circulation and simulated different CoA cardiovascular remodeling patterns, including aortic isthmus (AoI) narrowing, ventricular disproportion, and DA dilation. Our results showed mild AoI narrowing (80% of reference diameter) required up to 1.7 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 115% DA dilation to maintain physiological pressures, wall shear stresses, and organ perfusion. In contrast, severe narrowing (20% of reference AoI diameter) required up to 5 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 125% DA dilation, highlighting the necessity of co-occurrence of prenatal ventricular disproportion and DA dilation to compensate for AoI narrowing. These physiological regions were validated with ultrasonographic measurements from 7 controls and 9 CoA patients. We compared blood pressures, velocities, and volumetric flow rates across different fetoplacental anatomical sites. AoI velocity showed a delayed retrograde flow peak and increased antegrade diastolic velocity with greater AoI narrowing, which may aid in diagnosing CoA. Minimal differences were observed in other velocities and pressures. Volumetric flow rates across varying degrees of AoI narrowing decreased in the AoI and mitral and aortic valves, remained stable in the middle cerebral and umbilical arteries, and increased in the DA and tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Therefore, we corroborated that in fetal CoA a redistribution of blood flow occurs to ensure perfusion of the brain and placenta, without a significant alteration in fetal hemodynamics (blood pressure and velocities) except for increased diastolic velocities in the AoI.

                <p>by Katharina Waury, Stefan Lelieveld, Sanne Abeln, Henk-Jan van den Ham</p>

Repertoire sequencing allows us to investigate the antibody-mediated immune response. The clustering of sequences is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, aiding in the identification of functionally related antibodies. The conventional clustering approach of clonotyping relies on sequence information, particularly CDRH3 sequence identity and V/J gene usage, to group sequences into clonotypes. It has been suggested that the limitations of sequence-based approaches to identify sequence-dissimilar but functionally converged antibodies can be overcome by using structure information to group antibodies. Recent advances have made structure-based methods feasible on a repertoire level. However, so far, their performance has only been evaluated on single-antigen sets of antibodies. A comprehensive comparison of the benefits and limitations of structure-based tools on realistic and diverse repertoire data is missing. Here, we aim to explore the promise of structure-based clustering algorithms to replace or augment the standard sequence-based approach, specifically by identifying low-sequence identity groups. Two methods, SAAB+ and SPACE2, are evaluated against clonotyping. We curated a dataset of well-annotated pairs of antibodies that show high overlap in epitope residues and thus bind the same region within their respective antigen. This set of antibodies was introduced into a simulated repertoire to compare the performance of clustering approaches on a diverse antibody set. Our analysis reveals that structure-based methods do group more antibodies together compared to clonotyping. However, it also highlights the limitations associated with the need for same-length CDR regions by SPACE2. This work thoroughly compares the utility of different clustering methods and provides insights into what further steps are required to effectively use antibody structural information to group immune repertoire data.

Bacteria encode a wide range of antiphage systems and a subset of these proteins are homologous to components of the human innate immune system. Mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NLRs) and bacterial NLR-related proteins use a central NACHT domain to link detection of infection with initiation of an antimicrobial response. Bacterial NACHT proteins provide defense against both DNA and RNA phages. Here we investigate the mechanism of phage detection by the bacterial NLR-related protein bNACHT25 in <i>E. coli</i>. bNACHT25 was specifically activated by <i>Emesvirus</i> ssRNA phages and analysis of MS2 phage escaper mutants that evaded detection revealed a critical role for Coat Protein (CP). A genetic assay showed CP was sufficient to activate bNACHT25 but the two proteins did not directly interact. Instead, we found bNACHT25 requires the host chaperone DnaJ to detect CP and protect against phage. Our data support a model in which bNACHT25 detects a wide range of phages using an indirect mechanism that may involve guarding a host cell process rather than binding a specific phage-derived molecule.

Malaria parasites survive in human erythrocytes by importing and digesting hemoglobin within a specialized organelle, the digestive vacuole (DV). Although chloroquine and other antimalarials act within the DV, the routes used by drugs, ions, and amino acids to cross the DV membrane remain poorly understood. Here, we used single DV patch-clamp to identify a novel large conductance anion channel as the primary conductive pathway on this organelle in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the most virulent human pathogen. This Big Vacuolar Anion Channel (BVAC) is primarily open at the DV resting membrane potential and undergoes complex voltage-dependent gating. Ion substitution experiments implicate promiscuous anion flux with Cl<sup>−</sup> being the primary charged substrate under physiological conditions. Conductance and gating are unaffected by antimalarials targeting essential DV activities and are conserved on parasites with divergent drug susceptibility profiles, implicating an unexploited antimalarial target. A conditional knockdown strategy excluded links to PfCRT and PfMDR1, two drug-resistance transporters with poorly defined transport activities. We propose that BVAC functions to maintain electroneutrality during H<sup>+</sup> uptake, allowing DV acidification and efficient hemoglobin digestion. The channel also facilitates amino acid salvage, providing essential building blocks for parasite growth. Direct transport measurements at the DV membrane provide foundational insights into vacuolar physiology, should help clarify antimalarial action and drug resistance, and will guide therapy development against the parasite’s metabolic powerhouse.

                Background The management of organic waste generated in municipal marketplaces has gained increasing prominence over the last two decades due to its critical impact on urban sustainability, public health, and the environment. This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research trends in this area, based on 260 publications indexed in Scopus between 2000 and 2023. Methods This study employed a comprehensive bibliometric method using both quantitative and network analysis approaches. Publications were retrieved from Scopus database using a structured search equation incorporating keywords related to organic waste, municipal marketplaces, and waste management strategies. The final dataset included 260 publications spanning from 2000 to 2023, including original research articles, systematic reviews, book chapters, and conference proceedings. Data were processed using Bibliometrix R-package for productivity metrics (annual scientific output, author productivity, journal impact) and VOSviewer for visualization of bibliographic networks. Co-authorship patterns were analyzed at both author and country levels to find collaboration structures. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was conducted to map thematic clusters and research trends. Additionally, a strategic diagram was constructed to categorize research themes based on relevance to the field and degree of development. Results The findings show a notable surge in publications since 2016, driven by circular economic policies, climate change mitigation efforts, and the demand for sustainable urban solutions. Key authors include Zurbrügg, Tilley, Mpanang’ombe, and Zhang, with significant contributions to composting technologies, waste valorization, and bioenergy solutions. Leading journals such as Journal of Cleaner Production (Q1, IF 2023: 9.7), Sustainability (Switzerland) (Q2, IF 2023: 3.3), and Biocycle (Q4, IF 2023: 0.02) have been pivotal in disseminating interdisciplinary research. Conclusions This analysis reveals a global collaborative effort to optimize organic waste management but identifies persistent challenges, including limited integration in developing regions and fragmented co-authorship networks. The study highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches and fair knowledge transfer to develop scalable, context-specific solutions that enhance urban sustainability.

                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.087, p = 0.001). Social support was significantly related to Academic stress (β = 0.117, p = 0.031) and self-efficacy (β =0.088, p = 0.021). However, both social support (β = 0.099, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.646, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.012, CI [0.002, 0.024], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.057, CI [0.006, 0.111], p = 0.068). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-539/v1?src=rss">Study of the coverage and the impact of the chemoprevention of seasonal malaria in Niger from 2013 to 2022: systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose Malaria remains a public health problem in Niger, especially among children under the age of five. To combat this scourge, since 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), a strategy based on the administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP-AQ) during the period of high transmission. This systematic review assesses the coverage, efficacy, and challenges of SMC in Niger between 2013 and 2022, analyzing its impact on malaria morbidity and mortality. Materials and methods The PRISMA guidelines were used to ensure a rigorous and comprehensive recording of the systematic review process. Through searches in five different databases, articles were imported into Zotero software, then transferred to the Covidence application, where data processing was carried out. The selected articles were independently evaluated by two reviewers. These included studies that assessed coverage, malaria incidence, and the impact of SMC. Studies published in French and English were included. Data extraction from the included studies was performed, and a quality assessment was conducted, including an evaluation of the risk of bias. Results Among the six studies, three assessed SMC coverage in all eight regions of Niger while also evaluating side effects. They showed high overall coverage but low coverage in some areas. Another study examined the impact in terms of the incidence of complicated malaria, malaria-related hospitalization, and mortality. Another publication revealed that antibody responses against the blood and pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum were higher in the area where SMC was implemented. Conclusions This study demonstrates that SMC has a significant impact on reducing malaria incidence. Although there is high overall coverage, variations exist, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. Few adverse events were reported. However, very few studies are available, highlighting the need for additional research in Niger to better understand this strategy.

                Background The significance of household transmission of hepatitis B virus infection has been identified in different studies. Higher disease related knowledge among Hepatitis B patients improves the practice of transmission prevention and screening of household contacts. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of household transmission prevention among people with chronic hepatitis B attending a liver clinic at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Ethiopia. Methods A single center cross-sectional study among 229 hepatitis B patients visiting liver clinic for follow up service was undertaken in 2021. Data were collected using a structured interviewer guided questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods in SPSS 26. Results Mean age of respondents was 40 years, 68% were male, 65% of respondents scored ≥75 (defined as a high knowledge). In adjusted linear regression, age <40 years, presence of additional infected household members and disease duration >3 years were associated with higher knowledge score (R2= 0.106, F=8.936, P<0.001). Only 38.6% of participants scoring ≥6 (defined as good prevention practice). In Adjusted logistic regression, factors associated with poor practice were; low level of education (OR: 5.218; 95%CI: 1.34-20.23; p=0.017), being on anti HBV treatment (OR: 3.582; 95%CI: 1.04-12.33; p=0.043) and duration of follow up at TASH <2 years (OR: 2.93; 95%CI: 1.14-7.55; p=0.025). Conclusion In contrast to overall good knowledge, largely poor implementation of prevention practices and misunderstandings about transmission through air, kissing, and eating utensils were seen in a significant proportion of participants. Based on the results, any educational programs planned for this population should give special attention to the implementation of recommended prevention practices than simple awareness creation, with priority given to those with low education, <2 years on follow-up, and those on anti-hepatitis B treatment.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In sleep apnea, repeated hypovolemic ventilation or apnea in sleep leads to intermittent hypoxia (IH) of the brain. Thus, the impacts of sleep apnea on the brain need to be investigated. In this study, a mouse model with sleep-associated chronic IH and behavior tests was used to evaluate how IH impacts brain function and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and locus coeruleus. In an open-field test, mice subjected to chronic IH (5%–21% oxygen) for 10 and 20 days exhibited a significant decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity compared to the room air (RA, 21% oxygen) control mice. In the Y-maze test, the ability to recognize novel and familiar arms was similar between groups. In immunostaining of the brains of IH mice, TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus were significantly reduced compared to RA mice. Furthermore, in the brains of mice with decreased TH-positive neurons induced by IH, the expression of hippocampal neurons has not been affected. In the analysis of glial cells, in IH group mice, a significant increase of microglia was found in the substantia nigra, VTA, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus compared to the RA mice. These findings suggest that there is a loss of TH-containing neurons and neuronal inflammation in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus under chronic IH. Our findings provide precise evidence for the loss of TH-containing neurons in the setting of chronic IH mouse models, which can provide relevant empirical observations for clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether a machine learning model of voxel level [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) data could predict progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology, as well as outperform currently available biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred and thirty-seven autopsied patients with PSP (n = 42) and other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 95) who underwent antemortem [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose PET and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analyzed. A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate. The secondary models found the combination of thalamus and dentate to have the highest accuracy (0.89) and F-score (0.81). The optimized secondary model showed the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-scores (0.86) in the test dataset and outperformed the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (0.81 and 0.70, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results suggest that glucose hypometabolism in the thalamus and cerebellar dentate have the highest potential for predicting PSP pathology. Our optimized machine learning model outperformed the best currently available biomarker to predict PSP pathology. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The neurobiology of human stress-related disorders remains poorly understood, necessitating novel models and new model organisms to advance translational research in this field. Complementing rodent studies, the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) is a useful model species for stress-related disorders. Here, we develop two novel experimental models of stress-related brain disorders, based on repeated prolonged exposure to predators or on chronic unpredictable stress in adult zebrafish. The ability of both models to recapitulate human stress in these fish was assessed behaviorally, in the novel tank and the plus maze (anxiety, locomotor, and cognitive tests), as well as by analyzing the baseline levels of cortisol, a common neuroendocrine biomarker of stress. Overall, anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test was seen in both stressed groups, whereas poor learning and higher anxiety were observed in the plus maze test in predator-exposed fish, paralleling clinical cognitive and affective symptoms. Elevated cortisol in both stressed zebrafish further resembled neuroendocrine deficits seen in stress-related disorders clinically. Finally, the evoked behavioral and endocrine stress symptoms were rescued by treatment with two popular, clinically active antidepressant drugs, fluoxetine and paroxetine. Collectively, these models successfully recapitulated in zebrafish several key aspects of clinical stress-related disorders, further supporting the utility of these fish for translational stress research and anti-stress drug development.</p>

                Hirani et al. show how androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)-induced crosstalk between oncogenic cell signaling pathways, driven by BCL2, contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This finding underscores the potential of BCL2-targeted combination therapeutics to block or delay the transition from castration-sensitive prostate cancer to CRPC induced by ADT.

                Loss-of-function MDA5 variants increase the risk of chronic inflammation but protect against autoimmune disease. Singh et al. show that autoimmune-protective variants impair MDA5 signaling via different mechanisms, including loss of RNA binding and increased ATPase activity. By tuning MDA5 signaling, variants offer a trade-off between antiviral activity and autoimmune disease protection.

                Peng et al. show that naive retina-specific T cells encountering antigen in the immune-privileged eye differentiate into distinct regulatory vs. anergic phenotypes from a common precursor. These findings reveal a key checkpoint and provide novel insights into ocular immune privilege, suggesting strategies for immunomodulation in autoimmunity, cancer, and beyond.

                Qi Chen et al. systematically characterized human TRIM family proteins, revealing widespread condensate and specific co-condensate formation. Multivalent interactions across TRIM proteins, mainly involving the coiled-coil domain, lead to condensate formation. TRIM condensates could modulate E3 ligase activity and regulate cilia assembly and microtubule stability.

                Using ribosome profiling, Shukla et al. characterize dynamic translational regulation of maternal mRNAs during the first four cell cycles of C. elegans development. Their findings demonstrate how post-transcriptional mechanisms, including OMA-1-mediated regulation, contribute to protein expression changes in early embryonic development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93621">Inhibition of mitochondrial protein import and proteostasis by a pro-apoptotic lipid</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria-mediated cell death is critically regulated by bioactive lipids derived from sphingolipid metabolism. The lipid aldehyde trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex) induces mitochondrial dysfunction from yeast to humans. Here, we apply unbiased transcriptomic, functional genomics, and chemoproteomic approaches in the yeast model to uncover the principal mechanisms and biological targets underlying this lipid-induced mitochondrial inhibition. We find that loss of Hfd1 fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase function efficiently sensitizes cells for t-2-hex inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Excess of t-2-hex causes a profound transcriptomic response with characteristic hallmarks of impaired mitochondrial protein import, like activation of mitochondrial and cytosolic chaperones or proteasomal function and severe repression of translation. We confirm that t-2-hex stress induces rapid accumulation of mitochondrial pre-proteins and protein aggregates and subsequent activation of Hsf1- and Rpn4-dependent gene expression. By saturated transposon mutagenesis, we find that t-2-hex tolerance requires an efficient heat shock response and specific mitochondrial and ER functions and that mutations in ribosome, protein, and amino acid biogenesis are beneficial upon t-2-hex stress. We further show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of protein translation causes t-2-hex resistance, indicating that loss of proteostasis is the predominant consequence of the pro-apoptotic lipid. Several TOM subunits, including the central Tom40 channel, are lipidated by t-2-hex in vitro and mutation of accessory subunits Tom20 or Tom70 confers t-2-hex tolerance. Moreover, the Hfd1 gene dose determines the strength of t-2-hex mediated inhibition of mitochondrial protein import, and Hfd1 co-purifies with Tom70. Our results indicate that the transport of mitochondrial precursor proteins through the outer mitochondrial membrane is sensitively inhibited by the pro-apoptotic lipid and thus represents a hotspot for pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101236">ACVR2A facilitates trophoblast cell invasion through TCF7/c-JUN pathway in pre-eclampsia progression</a></h4>

              
                Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious pregnancy disorder linked to genetic factors, particularly the ACVR2A gene, which encodes a receptor involved in the activin signaling pathway and plays a critical role in reproductive processes. Transcriptomic data analysis and experimental verification confirmed a downregulation of ACVR2A expression in placental tissues from PE patients. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was employed to investigate the effect of ACVR2A gene deletion on trophoblast cells using the HTR8/SVneo and JAR cell lines. Deletion of ACVR2A inhibits trophoblastic migration, proliferation, and invasion, underscoring its pivotal role in cellular function. RNA-seq data analysis unveiled an intricate regulatory network influenced by ACVR2A gene knockout, especially in the TCF7/c-JUN pathway. By employing RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, a potential association between ACVR2A and the TCF7/c-JUN pathway was hypothesized and confirmed. The complexity of PE onset and the significance of genetic factors were emphasized, particularly the role of the ACVR2A gene identified in genome-wide association study. This study established a robust foundation for delving deeper into the intricate mechanisms of PE, paving the way for focused early intervention, personalized treatment, and enhanced obstetric healthcare.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90638">A suite of selective pressures supports the maintenance of alleles of a Drosophila immune peptide</a></h4>

              
                The innate immune system provides hosts with a crucial first line of defense against pathogens. While immune genes are often among the fastest evolving genes in the genome, in <i>Drosophila</i>, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are notable exceptions. Instead, AMPs may be under balancing selection, such that over evolutionary timescales, multiple alleles are maintained in populations. In this study, we focus on the <i>Drosophila</i> AMP Diptericin A, which has a segregating amino acid polymorphism associated with differential survival after infection with the Gram-negative bacteria <i>Providencia rettgeri</i>. Diptericin A also helps control opportunistic gut infections by common <i>Drosophila</i> gut microbes, especially those of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>. In addition to genotypic effects on gut immunity, we also see strong sex-specific effects that are most prominent in flies without functional <i>diptericin A</i>. To further characterize differences in microbiomes between different <i>diptericin</i> genotypes, we used 16S metagenomics to look at the microbiome composition. We used both lab-reared and wild-caught flies for our sequencing and looked at overall composition as well as the differential abundance of individual bacterial families. Overall, we find flies that are homozygous for one allele of <i>diptericin A</i> are better equipped to survive a systemic infection from <i>P. rettgeri</i>, but in general have a shorter lifespans after being fed common gut commensals. Our results suggest a possible mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation of <i>diptericin A</i> through the complex interactions of sex, systemic immunity, and the maintenance of the gut microbiome.

                <p>The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific translating ribosome affinity purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 months) and old (21-24 months) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Intriguingly, genes involved in serotonergic synthesis were upregulated with age in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.</p>

                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a devastating disease, often pharmacoresistant and with a high prevalence of 1% worldwide. There are a few disease-modifying therapies; thus, prevention has become a health priority. The overarching goal of this research project is to highlight the system's dynamics at different stages before TLE onset to identify an early shift in network dynamics trajectory toward disease onset. Researchers often investigate collective brain activity by tracking dynamical interactions of the signal recorded at multiple sites. However, these interactions are usually only computed between pairs of brain regions, at the risk of missing simultaneous interactions of three or more areas, an aspect that is crucial in a networked disease such as TLE. We thus propose to track, on a rich dataset of electrophysiological brain signals recorded within the temporal lobe (TL) of adult male Wistar Han rats, the formation and dissolution of high-order informational multiplets in time during distinct natural behaviors in an animal model of TLE. We identified the informational content of the multiplets as synergistic or redundant. Results identified an early transition of synergistic and redundant multiplets ahead of TLE onset with the predominant involvement of four TL brain regions in generating theta (4&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) activity. This shift has been shown predominantly during exploration, a theta-dependent behavior, less during rest and sleep. This specific change suggests a shift in communication from an integrated to a segregated network toward TLE onset.</p>

                <p>Recording the spiking activity from subcellular compartments of neurons such as axons and dendrites during mouse behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging is increasingly common yet remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise, inaccurate region-of-interest (ROI) identification, movement artifacts, and difficulty in grouping ROIs from the same neuron. To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient preprocessing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply bandpass filtering methods (e.g., 0.05&ndash;0.12&nbsp;Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from <I>z</I>-plane movement, we apply principal component analysis on all calcium traces and use a bottom-up segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or <I>k</I>-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to "ground truth" data. Our approach provides a guideline for standardizing the extraction of physiological signals from subcellular compartments during rodent behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging.</p>

                Background Universal access to maternal, newborn, and child healthcare is essential for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, but the effectiveness of various incentive-based programs for pregnant mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains uncertain. Objective of this systematic review was to determine if incentive-based interventions influenced maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Methods We conducted a search in various databases from inception. All incentive-based interventional studies conducted on pregnant women in LMICs were included. Evidence from the included trials was synthesized using risk ratios (RRs) to compare the outcomes between groups receiving incentives and not receiving incentives. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and reviewed the collected data to determine its suitability for meta-analysis. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021247681). Results Of the 3,897 records that were identified, 11 met eligibility criteria, all of which exhibited varying degrees of risk of bias, ranging from high to some concerns. Analysis of maternal outcomes across studies revealed no significant differences in the likelihood of delivering at a healthcare facility (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.47) and in frequency of prenatal care (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.12) between intervention and control groups. However, high levels of statistical heterogeneity were observed for both outcomes indicating variability among study results. Similarly, analysis of tetanus vaccine coverage showed no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.08), with moderate statistical heterogeneity observed. Conclusion The maternal and neonatal outcomes examined in this review did not have any significant differences in intervention group when compared to the control group. The interventions to address maternal health concerns need to follow a multifactorial approach. There is a need for extensive primary research studies in the future.

                Background Home care is an extension of hospital services that must be evaluated, coordinated, and educated to ensure proper care and accelerate recovery. The new concept of home care services can save costs and equipment. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that influence patient satisfaction with home care services. Methods This study is a systematic review with PRISMA guidelines using three electronic databases ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. There were 228 articles with duplication reduction to 197 and narrowed down to 73 articles whose titles and abstracts were appropriate, but only 10 articles met the provisions in the full text. Literature search using the keywords Home Care Services AND Satisfaction, then the type of full-text article, in English and a publication period of 10 years. The data extraction process, irrelevant articles such as articles on patient satisfaction in nursing homes and out-of-home care were removed. PROSPERO approved the following research protocol number: CRD42023482315. Result Found factors that influence patient satisfaction with home care services. Conclusion There are fifteen aspects that affect patient satisfaction and two aspects that affect patient satisfaction in general in long-term home care. It is hoped that the results of this literature review can be used as a reference for hospital home care managers to pay attention to aspects that can affect satisfaction. The author realizes that the methods in the articles vary greatly, which is a deficiency in this systematic review.

                <p>by Anna Zhukova, Olivier Gascuel</p>

Phylodynamics bridges the gap between classical epidemiology and pathogen genome sequence data by estimating epidemiological parameters from time-scaled pathogen phylogenetic trees. The models used in phylodynamics typically assume that the sampling procedure is independent between infected individuals. However, this assumption does not hold for many epidemics, in particular for such sexually transmitted infections as HIV-1, for which contact tracing schemes are included in health policies of many countries. We extended phylodynamic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) models with contact tracing (CT), and developed a simulator to generate trees under MTBD and MTBD-CT models. We proposed a non-parametric test for detecting contact tracing in pathogen phylogenetic trees. Its application to simulated data showed that it is both highly specific and sensitive. For the simplest representative of the MTBD-CT family, the BD-CT(1) model, where only the last contact can be notified, we solved the differential equations and proposed a closed form solution for the likelihood function. We implemented a maximum-likelihood program, which estimates the BD-CT(1) model parameters and their confidence intervals from phylogenetic trees. It performed accurate parameter inference on BD and BD-CT(1) simulated data, and detected contact tracing in HIV-1 B epidemics in Zurich and the UK. Importantly, we showed that not accounting for contact tracing when it is present, leads to bias in parameter estimation with the BD model (overestimation of the becoming-non-infectious rate). This bias is also present, but greatly reduced, when the BD-CT(1) model is used on data where multiple contacts can be notified. Our CT test, MTBD-CT tree simulator and BD-CT(1) parameter estimator are freely available at GitHub (evolbioinfo/treesimulator and evolbioinfo/bdct).

                <p>by Miriam Schnitzerlein, Eric Greto, Anja Wegner, Anna Möller, Oliver Aust, Oumaima Ben Brahim, David B. Blumenthal, Vasily Zaburdaev, Stefan Uderhardt</p>

Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are essential for tissue homeostasis. Their diverse functions, from monitoring interstitial fluids to clearing cellular debris, are accompanied by characteristic morphological changes that reflect their functional status. While current knowledge of macrophage behaviour comes primarily from <i>in vitro</i> studies, their dynamic behavior <i>in vivo</i> is fundamentally different, necessitating a more physiologically relevant approach to their understanding. In this study, we employed intravital imaging to generate dynamic data from peritoneal RTMs in mice under various conditions and developed a comprehensive image processing pipeline to quantify RTM morphodynamics over time, defining human-interpretable cell size and shape features. These features allowed for the quantitative and qualitative differentiation of cell populations in various functional states, including pro- and anti-inflammatory activation and endosomal dysfunction. The study revealed that under steady-state conditions, RTMs exhibit a wide range of morphodynamical phenotypes, constituting a naïve morphospace of behavioral motifs. Upon challenge, morphodynamic patterns changed uniformly at the population level but predominantly within the constraints of this naïve morphospace. Notably, aged animals displayed a markedly shifted naïve morphospace, indicating drastically different behavioral patterns compared to their young counterparts. The developed method also proved valuable in optimizing explanted tissue setups, bringing RTM behavior closer to the physiological native state. Our versatile approach thus provides novel insights into the dynamic behavior of <i>bona fide</i> macrophages <i>in vivo</i>, enabling the distinction between physiological and pathological cell states and the assessment of functional tissue age on a population level.

The global reliance on <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) proteins for controlling lepidopteran pests in cotton, corn, and soybean crops underscores the critical need to understand resistance mechanisms. Vip3Aa, one of the most widely deployed and currently effective Bt proteins in genetically modified crops, plays a pivotal role in pest management. This study investigates the molecular basis of Vip3Aa resistance in Australian <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> through genetic crosses, and integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses. We identified a previously uncharacterized gene, LOC110373801 (designated <i>HaVipR1</i>), as potentially important in Vip3Aa resistance in two field-derived resistant lines. Functional validation using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in susceptible lines confirmed the gene’s role in conferring high-level resistance to Vip3Aa. Despite extensive laboratory selection of Vip3Aa-resistant colonies in Lepidoptera, the biochemical mechanisms underlying resistance have remained elusive. Our research identifies HaVipR1 as a potential contributor to resistance, adding to our understanding of how insects may develop resistance to this important Bt protein. The identification of <i>HaVipR1</i> contributes to our understanding of potential resistance mechanisms and may inform future resistance management strategies. Future work should explore the biochemical pathways influenced by <i>HaVipR1</i> and assess its interactions with other resistance mechanisms. The approach utilized here underscores the value of field-derived resistant lines for understanding resistance in agricultural pests and highlights the need for targeted approaches to manage resistance sustainably.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses have confronted the dual challenge of exposure to infection and the duty to provide patient care, leading to certain moral dilemmas. This study aims to investigate the dilemmas, occupational and psychological distresses and professional rewards experienced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards and explore their nature and how they are connected. Methods This qualitative descriptive utilized semi-structured interviews with nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Results Twelve nurses (8 women, 4 men) with 4 to 21 years of experience participated. Six participants held managerial positions (three head nurses and three deputy head nurses), alongside six staff nurses. Analysis revealed that nurses experienced significant conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they reported substantial rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Conclusions Nurses in COVID-19 wards experienced considerable distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges. Leading to feeling of organizational mistrust. However this demanding environment also provided a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly from new interactions. These findings are highlight the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the inherent occupational distress with professional rewards.
