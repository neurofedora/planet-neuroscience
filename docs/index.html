                Background The newly entered health sciences students are often faced with the challenge of adapting due to an unfamiliar new environment with a different culture they are not used to and imposing professional demands. Aim This study aims to explore the facilitators’ experiences of the Ubuntu Ubuntu-infused orientation programme for first-year students in the Faculty of Health Sciences. Methods An explorative, descriptive phenomenological approach was used in the study. A non-probability purposive sampling technique was used to select 12 facilitators who were involved in the Ubuntu orientation of first-year students in the Faculty of Health Sciences. - A semi-structured interview was used to collect data via Google Forms. Colaizzi’s phenomenological method of analysis was used in this study because it provided clear and logical steps to explore the experiences and revealed emerging themes and their relationship. Results The objectives of this study were to explore the experiences of facilitators in relation to the infusion of Ubuntu values and principles during the orientation of the faculty of health first entering students, the different ways in which facilitators were involved in Ubuntu orientation of learners, and their views regarding how students responded to the inclusion of Ubuntu in their orientation. Identified challenges were also explored. Trustworthiness and ethical issues were ensured. Conclusion and Contribution The study concluded that Ubuntu values and principles should be applied by health professionals as they execute their daily work.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-7/v1?src=rss">Empowering the Community-based Bamboo Utilization to Advance Sustainable Coastal Ecosystem in East Lampung Regency [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Coastal ecosystems, including mangrove forests, are at the core of the socio-economic life of the local communities. Conversely, these ecosystems remain highly sensitive to the increasing impacts of climate change. Against such a backdrop, bamboo has been an important material, especially for construction and tool-making in coastal areas like East Lampung Regency. Despite the importance, such bamboo demands have yet to be met by local supplies or by the development of downstream value-added processing. Policy and Implications This study illustrates the strategic potential of bamboo as an economic and ecological resource, contributing to coastal resilience in East Lampung. If integrated into the Nature-based Solutions (NbS) framework, bamboo utilization can enhance livelihoods while restoring and protecting coastal ecosystems in communities. The study has revealed that sustainable management of bamboo provides a means to link environmental conservation to inclusive local development and climate adaptation. Recommendations The study outlines four strategies designed to advance the sustainable use of bamboo in East Lampung, including (a) empowering community-based bamboo cultivation focuses on facilitating regeneration activities that restore ecosystems and provide economic benefits to local communities, (b) investing in capacity building to equip local communities and key stakeholders with essential knowledge and skills in sustainable bamboo management and utilization, (c) driving policy advocacy that aims to champion the cause of sustainable bamboo utilization across multiple sectors, and (d) strengthening institutional frameworks that strengthen upstream bamboo resource management and optimize downstream processing and marketing systems, establish a robust industry infrastructure. Conclusions Bamboo utilization in East Lampung has the potential to change from a traditional subsistence material to a strategic instrument toward coastal sustainability. Bamboo-based initiatives can support ecological resilience, help boost the economy along the coast, and inspire a stronger socio-cultural regeneration toward a more sustainable future for East Lampung through the NbS approach.

                Abstract* Background Several studies have investigated internet-based interventions, demonstrating that they are an effective resource, including the use of gamification, which can enhance engagement in psychological interventions. This study explores the efficacy of gamified internet-based intervention programs in enhancing self-awareness among early adults. Methods This research used a pretest-posttest design to determine the effectiveness of the program. A dual-phase approach was adopted: the first phase involved a blend of online interventions and regular offline meetings with 25 participants, while the second was purely online, involving 40 participants. Participants, aged 18-22 years, engaged with a mental health application over a 30-day period. This study utilizing the Self Awareness Outcomes Questionnaire (SAOQ) for assessment. Results The Results indicated a statistically significant enhancement in self-awareness in both setups, with face-to-face interactions yielding a larger effect size (0.76) compared to online-only interventions (0.48). Conclusions Gamification offers a promising alternative for supporting participants in developing self-awareness as a means to improve mental health. Gamification programs have the ability to help individuals process independently or simultaneously get guidance from professionals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-5/v1?src=rss">A Systematic Literature Review on Biometric Authentication in Mobile Banking [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                As mobile banking continues to grow at an exponential rate, the financial industry is faced with a critical challenge: How to keep user credentials secure without compromising on efficiency. Password-based authentication is still dominant but has major limitations which compromise both security and user experience. These systems are susceptible to the most common attack vectors such as phishing, malware and man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if users are using weak passwords or sharing passwords. Additionally, mobile devices have limited input interfaces that are frequently sources of frustration and error. As a result, there is increasing interest in other more secure and convenient alternatives such as biometric and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate the inherent weaknesses of password-based systems. This systematic literature review, which covers studies from 2020 to 2025, provides a critical review of biometric authentication methods used in mobile banking. It analyses existing approaches, security risks and implementation practices adopted by major banks across the world. While biometric systems are more secure and user friendly than traditional systems, they also introduce new challenges in terms of privacy, spoofing and regulatory compliance. The review gives a detailed overview of the current advances, key issues, and emerging research directions, which will give valuable insight to the development of secure and easy-to-use authentication systems in mobile banking.

                Abstract* Objectives To determine the overall survival and immunophenotypes of patients with acute leukemia from a hospital in Chiclayo, Peru, during the period 2015-2019. Methods Observational research was conducted, analysing a total of 168 samples from patients diagnosed with acute leukemia, evaluating overall survival in the different types of leukemia at 5 years of follow-up using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results The overall survival for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) was found to be 52.7% at 5 years of follow-up, while for T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL), it was 50% at 2 years. The overall survival for non-promyelocytic Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) was 53.3% at 3 years of follow-up, and for promyelocytic leukemia, it was 66.7% at 3 years. The predominant immunophenotype was B-ALL, which represented 77.38%, while AML represented the remaining cases. Conclusions The overall survival of lymphoid leukemia was superior to that of myeloid leukemia. The most frequent aberration in B-ALL was the hyperexpression of CD10, while the absence of antigens was noted in T-ALL. The most frequent aberration in promyelocytic leukemia was the hyperexpression of CD13, and for non-promyelocytic leukemia, asynchronisms and lineage infidelity were observed.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00984">A Biologically Plausible Dense Associative Memory with Exponential Capacity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krotov and Hopfield (2021) proposed a biologically plausible two-layer associative memory network with memory storage capacity exponential in the number of visible neurons. However, the capacity was only linear in the number of hidden neurons. This limitation arose from the choice of nonlinearity between the visible and hidden units, which enforced winner-takes-all dynamics in the hidden layer, thereby restricting each hidden unit to encode only a single memory. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel associative memory network with a threshold nonlinearity that enables distributed representations. In contrast to winner-takes-all dynamics, where each hidden neuron is tied to an entire memory, our network allows hidden neurons to encode basic components shared across many memories. Consequently, complex patterns are represented through combinations of hidden neurons. These representations reduce redundancy and allow many correlated memories to be stored compositionally. Thus, we achieve much higher capacity: exponential in the number of hidden units, provided the number of visible units is sufficiently larger than the number of hidden neurons. Exponential capacity arises because all binary states of the hidden units can become stable memory patterns with an appropriately chosen threshold. Moreover, the distributed hidden representation, which has much lower dimensionality than the visible layer, preserves class-discriminative structure, supporting efficient nonlinear decoding. These results establish a new regime for associative memory, enabling high-capacity, robust, and scalable architectures consistent with biological constraints.

                arXiv:2601.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertebrate motor system employs dimensionality-reducing strategies to limit the complexity of movement coordination, for efficient motor control. But when environments are dense with hidden action-outcome contingencies, movement complexity can promote behavioral innovation. Humans, perhaps uniquely, may infer the presence of hidden environmental dynamics from social cues, by drawing upon computational mechanisms shared with Theory of Mind. This proposed "Theory of Environment" supports behavioral innovation by expanding the dimensionality of motor exploration.

                arXiv:2601.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How neural representations in the insular cortex support emotional processing remains poorly understood, and the extent to which the insula is specialized for disgust processing remains debated. We recorded stereoelectroencephalography data from the insula while human subjects with implanted electrode contacts performed a facial emotion recognition task involving disgusted, fearful, angry, sad, neutral, and happy expressions. Expression category specificity of insular activity was assessed via pairwise comparisons of within- and between-category pattern similarities, capturing both the shape and scale of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs; theta to high-gamma frequency ranges). Insular activity successfully identified all investigated expressions, mediated by diverse ERP responses intermixed across the insula. In contrast to the marked heterogeneity of insula ERP responses, the fusiform face area exhibited convergent ERP responses across expressions and contacts, with ERSPs also contributing substantially to expression identification. These findings not only elucidate the insula's neural mechanisms underlying facial emotion perception, but also establish a potential single-contact-level neural substrate for how the insula leverages its heterogeneous response profiles to act as a key hub for versatile cognitive and emotional functions.

                arXiv:2601.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable capability of the human brain is to form more abstract conceptual representations from sensorimotor experiences and flexibly apply them independent of direct sensory inputs. However, the computational mechanism underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here, we present a dual-module neural network framework, the CATS Net, to bridge this gap. Our model consists of a concept-abstraction module that extracts low-dimensional conceptual representations, and a task-solving module that performs visual judgement tasks under the hierarchical gating control of the formed concepts. The system develops transferable semantic structure based on concept representations that enable cross-network knowledge transfer through conceptual communication. Model-brain fitting analyses reveal that these emergent concept spaces align with both neurocognitive semantic model and brain response structures in the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex, while the gating mechanisms mirror that in the semantic control brain network. This work establishes a unified computational framework that can offer mechanistic insights for understanding human conceptual cognition and engineering artificial systems with human-like conceptual intelligence.

Abstract: How much of the brain's learned algorithms depend on the fact it is a brain? We argue: a lot, but surprisingly few details matter. We point to simple biological details -- e.g. nonnegative firing and energetic/space budgets in connectionist architectures -- which, when mixed with the requirements of solving a task, produce models that predict brain responses down to single-neuron tuning. We understand this as details constraining the set of plausible algorithms, and their implementations, such that only `brain-like' algorithms are learned. In particular, each biological detail breaks a symmetry in connectionist models (scale, rotation, permutation) leading to interpretable single-neuron responses that are meaningfully characteristic of particular algorithms. This view helps us not only understand the brain's choice of algorithm but also infer algorithm from measured neural responses. Further, this perspective aligns computational neuroscience with mechanistic interpretability in AI, suggesting a more unified approach to studying the mechanisms of intelligence, both natural and artificial.

Abstract: Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the development of tobacco addiction due to ongoing brain maturation and susceptibility to social influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Craving -the strong desire to use drugs -already emerges with non-daily tobacco use and predicts continued use and relapse. However, the roles of craving and ETS exposure during the early stages of tobacco use in adolescence remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, we harness a recently developed fMRI marker of craving -the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) -to compare craving-related brain responses to smoking versus social cues in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48) with varying levels of ETS exposure levels. Results showed that NCS responses to smoking cues compared to alternative social rewards were higher in Experimental Smokers compared to Non-smokers and predicted individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Both smoking behavior and NCS responses were correlated with the relative amount of ETS exposure from peers compared to exposure from family members. Together, these findings indicate a heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits already during experimental smoking and highlight the important role of peer social norms on craving and smoking initiation in the critical period of adolescence.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction of neural and cardiac systems during cognitive activity is critical to advancing physiological computing. Although EEG has been the gold standard for assessing mental workload, its limited portability restricts its real-world use. Widely available ECG through wearable devices proposes a pragmatic alternative. This research investigates whether ECG signals can reliably reflect cognitive load and serve as proxies for EEG-based indicators. In this work, we present multimodal data acquired from two different paradigms involving working-memory and passive-listening tasks. For each modality, we extracted ECG time-domain HRV metrics and Catch22 descriptors against EEG spectral and Catch22 features, respectively. We propose a cross-modal XGBoost framework to project the ECG features onto EEG-representative cognitive spaces, thereby allowing workload inferences using only ECG. Our results show that ECG-derived projections expressively capture variation in cognitive states and provide good support for accurate classification. Our findings underpin ECG as an interpretable, real-time, wearable solution for everyday cognitive monitoring.

                arXiv:2508.21445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synaptic plasticity typically produces heavy-tailed distributions of synaptic strengths, consisting of a few strong connections among many weaker ones. Meanwhile, structural plasticity relies on distinct signaling cascades to reshape network topology. We propose a model in which both types of plasticity adhere to the Hebbian principle while operating within homeostatically regulated activity. Synaptic plasticity alone generates heavy-tailed weight distributions, but only when any activity spreading beyond neighboring units is discarded. However, when combined with Hebbian structural plasticity, i.e., adaptive rewiring, heavy-tailed weight distributions also arise with more extensive activity flow. Furthermore, adaptive rewiring provides complex network structures with convergent-divergent circuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the nervous system. Having adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring driven by the same homeostatic dynamics gives our model a parsimonious and robust framework that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and convergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes. Consequently, the model accounts for key connectivity structures in both C. elegans and the mouse, suggesting that its principles are shared across species of different complexities.

Abstract: Understanding the representation of probability in the human mind has been of great interest to understanding human decision making. Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.

                arXiv:2511.20692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.

                arXiv:2512.15891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of millisecond-precision spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing, enabling a broader range of neural codes. It could also support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are stimulated synchronously. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).

                arXiv:2506.02164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared neural activities in the visual cortex to representations in deep neural networks trained on image classification. Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

                arXiv:2506.13717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.

                arXiv:2508.01992v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer(ST)-based models require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs, thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.

                arXiv:2601.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of hardware-optimized deployment of spiking neural networks (SNNs), SNN processors based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have become a research hotspot due to their efficiency and flexibility. However, existing methods rely on multi-timestep training and reconfigurable computing architectures, which increases computational and memory overhead, thus reducing deployment efficiency. This work presents an efficient and lightweight residual SNN accelerator that combines algorithm and hardware co-design to optimize inference energy efficiency. In terms of the algorithm, we employ single-timesteps training, integrate grouped convolutions, and fuse batch normalization (BN) layers, thus compressing the network to only 0.69M parameters. Quantization-aware training (QAT) further constrains all parameters to 8-bit precision. In terms of hardware, the reuse of intra-layer resources maximizes FPGA utilization, a full pipeline cross-layer architecture improves throughput, and on-chip block RAM (BRAM) stores network parameters and intermediate results to improve memory efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed processor achieves a classification accuracy of 87.11% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with an inference time of 3.98 ms per image and an energy efficiency of 183.5 FPS/W. Compared with mainstream graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, it achieves more than double the energy efficiency. Furthermore, compared with other SNN processors, it achieves at least a 4x faster inference speed and a 5x higher energy efficiency.

                arXiv:2601.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The city of Kinshasa faces severe traffic congestion, requiring strategic infrastructure capacity enhancements. Although a comprehensive master plan has been proposed, its implementation requires substantial financial investment, which remains constrained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), an emerging economy. This research proposes a traffic flow based algorithm to support the development of priority road segments. The objective is to enable more effective prioritisation of road construction projects and facilitate the optimal allocation of limited infrastructure budgets.
  Methods: The study was conducted by formulating a standard transport network design problem (TNDP) that included estimated origin demand data specific to the city of Kinshasa. Given the high computational nature of the 30 node network design, TNDP relevant metaheuristics (GA, ACO, PSO, SA, TS, Greedy) were used selectively and hybridised to achieve high quality, stable solutions. A greedy search seeded simulated annealing and Tabu search were devised to achieve the design goals.
  Results: Greedy Simulated Annealing and Greedy Tabu search yielded the best travel time reduction and the most stable solutions compared to other solvers, also improving network edge betweenness centrality by nearly a scale of two and a half.
  Conclusions: Road priorities were proposed, including junctions connecting the Bandundu and Kongo Central entry point to main attraction centres (Limete Poids Lourd, Gombe, Airport) and additional inner city areas (Ngaliema, Selembao, Lemba, Masina, Kimwenza).

                arXiv:2601.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a biologically grounded and energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural architectures; however, they struggle with long-range temporal dependencies due to fixed synaptic and membrane time constants. This paper introduces ChronoPlastic Spiking Neural Networks (CPSNNs), a novel architectural principle that enables adaptive temporal credit assignment by dynamically modulating synaptic decay rates conditioned on the state of the network. CPSNNs maintain multiple internal temporal traces and learn a continuous time-warping function that selectively preserves task-relevant information while rapidly forgetting noise. Unlike prior approaches based on adaptive membrane constants, attention mechanisms, or external memory, CPSNNs embed temporal control directly within local synaptic dynamics, preserving linear-time complexity and neuromorphic compatibility. We provide a formal description of the model, analyze its computational properties, and demonstrate empirically that CPSNNs learn long-gap temporal dependencies significantly faster and more reliably than standard SNN baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive temporal modulation is a key missing ingredient for scalable temporal learning in spiking systems.

Abstract: Coccidiosis, a disease caused by the Eimeria parasite, represents a major threat to the poultry and rabbit industries, demanding rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. While deep learning models offer high precision, their significant energy consumption limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel two-stage Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture, where a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network is first converted into a spiking feature extractor and then coupled with a lightweight, unsupervised SNN classifier trained with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.32\% accuracy in Eimeria classification. Remarkably, this performance is accomplished with a significant reduction in energy consumption, showing an improvement of more than 223 times compared to its traditional ANN counterpart. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between high accuracy and extreme energy efficiency, paving the way for autonomous, low-power diagnostic systems on neuromorphic hardware.

                arXiv:2601.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surveillance multisensor placement is an important optimization problem that consists of positioning several sensors of different types to maximize the coverage of a determined area while minimizing the cost of the deployment. In this work, we tackle a modified version of the problem, consisting of spatially distributed multisensor placement for indoor surveillance. Our approach is focused on security surveillance of sensible indoor spaces, such as military installations, where distinct security levels can be considered. We propose an evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem, in which a novel special encoding,integer encoding with binary conversion, and effective initialization have been defined to improve the performance and convergence of the proposed algorithm. We also consider the probability of detection for each surveillance point, which depends on the distance to the sensor at hand, to better model real-life scenarios. We have tested the proposed evolutionary approach in different instances of the problem, varying both size and difficulty, and obtained excellent results in terms of the cost of sensors placement and convergence time of the algorithm.

                arXiv:2601.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic multi-objective optimization (DMOO) has recently attracted increasing interest from both academic researchers and engineering practitioners, as numerous real-world applications that evolve over time can be naturally formulated as dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). This growing trend necessitates advanced benchmarks for the rigorous evaluation of optimization algorithms under realistic conditions. This paper introduces a comprehensive and principled framework for constructing highly realistic and challenging DMOO benchmarks. The proposed framework features several novel components: a generalized formulation that allows the Pareto-optimal Set (PS) to change on hypersurfaces, a mechanism for creating controlled variable contribution imbalances to generate heterogeneous landscapes, and dynamic rotation matrices for inducing time-varying variable interactions and non-separability. Furthermore, we incorporate a temporal perturbation mechanism to simulate irregular environmental changes and propose a generalized time-linkage mechanism that systematically embeds historical solution quality into future problems, thereby capturing critical real-world phenomena such as error accumulation and time-deception. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority over conventional benchmarks in terms of realism, complexity, and its capability for discriminating state-of-the-art algorithmic performance. This work establishes a new standard for dynamic multi-objective optimization benchmarking, providing a powerful tool for the development and evaluation of next-generation algorithms capable of addressing the complexities of real-world dynamic systems.

                arXiv:2601.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is essential for robotic manipulation, prosthetics and assistive technologies, yet neuromorphic tactile datasets remain limited compared to their visual counterparts. We introduce STEMNIST, a large-scale neuromorphic tactile dataset extending ST-MNIST from 10 digits to 35 alphanumeric classes (uppercase letters A--Z and digits 1--9), providing a challenging benchmark for event-based haptic recognition. The dataset comprises 7,700 samples collected from 34 participants using a custom \(16\times 16\) tactile sensor array operating at 120 Hz, encoded as 1,005,592 spike events through adaptive temporal differentiation. Following EMNIST's visual character recognition protocol, STEMNIST addresses the critical gap between simplified digit classification and real-world tactile interaction scenarios requiring alphanumeric discrimination. Baseline experiments using conventional CNNs (90.91% test accuracy) and spiking neural networks (89.16%) establish performance benchmarks. The dataset's event-based format, unrestricted spatial variability and rich temporal structure makes it suitable for testing neuromorphic hardware and bio-inspired learning algorithms. STEMNIST enables reproducible evaluation of tactile recognition systems and provides a foundation for advancing energy-efficient neuromorphic perception in robotics, biomedical engineering and human-machine interfaces. The dataset, documentation and codes are publicly available to accelerate research in neuromorphic tactile computing.

                arXiv:2601.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.
  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.

Abstract: To enhance the coverage rate of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), this paper proposes an advanced optimization strategy based on a multi-strategy integrated Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) algorithm. Specifically, multivariate chaotic mapping is first employed to improve the randomness and uniformity of the initial population. To further bolster population diversity and prevent the algorithm from stagnating in local optima, a bidirectional population evolutionary dynamics strategy is incorporated following the pursuit-and-evasion phase, thereby facilitating the attainment of the global optimal solution. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-strategy NGO in WSN coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of both coverage enhancement and node connectivity.

                arXiv:2601.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework--Holographic Reservoir Computing (HRC)--which hypothesizes that the thermodynamic noise and timing dynamics in voltage-stressed Bitcoin mining ASICs (BM1366) could potentially serve as a physical reservoir computing substrate. We present the CHIMERA (Conscious Hybrid Intelligence via Miner-Embedded Resonance Architecture) system architecture, which treats the SHA-256 hashing pipeline not as an entropy source, but as a deterministic diffusion operator whose timing characteristics under controlled voltage and frequency conditions may exhibit computationally useful dynamics. We report preliminary observations of non-Poissonian variability in inter-arrival time statistics during edge-of-stability operation, which we term the "Silicon Heartbeat" hypothesis. Theoretical analysis based on Hierarchical Number System (HNS) representations suggests that such architectures could achieve O(log n) energy scaling compared to traditional von Neumann O(2^n) dependencies. However, we emphasize that these are theoretical projections requiring experimental validation. We present the implemented measurement infrastructure, acknowledge current limitations, and outline the experimental program necessary to confirm or refute these hypotheses. This work contributes to the emerging field of thermodynamic computing by proposing a novel approach to repurposing obsolete cryptographic hardware for neuromorphic applications.

                arXiv:2601.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms.

                arXiv:2601.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental machine learning task with broad real-world applications. Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Experiments conducted on imbalanced time series datasets demonstrate that Evo-TFS outperforms existing oversampling methods, significantly enhancing the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain classifiers.

This approach leverages prior advances in geometric design such as blending functions and transfinite interpolation over convex domains. For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\mathcal{B}$, $g : \bar P \to C^0(\bar P)$, $\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\boldsymbol{x} \in \bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\boldsymbol{\lambda} : \bar P \to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain. This offers a framework for solving problems on parametrized convex geometries using neural networks. The accuracy of physics-informed neural networks and deep Ritz is assessed on forward, inverse, and parametrized geometric Poisson boundary-value problems.

                arXiv:2601.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain alignment refers broadly to learning correspondences between data distributions from distinct domains. In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment.

                arXiv:2508.04828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively change their culture in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society's repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.

                arXiv:2511.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II, the SPEA2 is one of the most widely used domination-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. For both algorithms, the known runtime guarantees are linear in the population size; for the NSGA-II, matching lower bounds exist. With a careful study of the more complex selection mechanism of the SPEA2, we show that it has very different population dynamics. From these, we prove runtime guarantees for the OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks that depend less on the population size. For example, we show that the SPEA2 with parent population size $\mu \ge n - 2k + 3$ and offspring population size $\lambda$ computes the Pareto front of the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark with gap size $k$ in an expected number of $O( (\lambda+\mu)n + n^{k+1})$ function evaluations. This shows that the best runtime guarantee of $O(n^{k+1})$ is not only achieved for $\mu = \Theta(n)$ and $\lambda = O(n)$ but for arbitrary $\mu, \lambda = O(n^k)$. Thus, choosing suitable parameters -- a key challenge in using heuristic algorithms -- is much easier for the SPEA2 than the NSGA-II.

                arXiv:2512.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising and energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks, thanks to their sparse binary activation. However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23926">Identification of fixations and saccades in eye-tracking data using adaptive threshold-based method</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.23926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels ({\sigma} = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.

                arXiv:2601.00020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.

                arXiv:2402.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with a large number of parameters often do not overfit, owing to implicit regularization that favors \lq good\rq{} networks. Other related and puzzling phenomena include properties of flat minima, saddle-to-saddle dynamics, and neuron alignment. To investigate these phenomena, we study the local geometry of deep ReLU neural networks. We show that, for a fixed architecture, as the weights vary, the image of a sample $X$ forms a set whose local dimension changes. The parameter space is partitioned into regions where this local dimension remains constant. The local dimension is invariant under the natural symmetries of ReLU networks (i.e., positive rescalings and neuron permutations). We establish then that the network's geometry induces a regularization, with the local dimension serving as a key measure of regularity. Moreover, we relate the local dimension to a new notion of flatness of minima and to saddle-to-saddle dynamics. For shallow networks, we also show that the local dimension is connected to the number of linear regions perceived by $X$, offering insight into the effects of regularization. This is further supported by experiments and linked to neuron alignment. Our analysis offers, for the first time, a simple and unified geometric explanation that applies to all learning contexts for these phenomena, which are usually studied in isolation. Finally, we explore the practical computation of the local dimension and present experiments on the MNIST dataset, which highlight geometry-induced regularization in this setting.

                arXiv:2407.13663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projection pursuit (PP) guided tour optimizes a criterion function, known as the PP index, to gradually reveal projections of interest from high-dimensional data through animation. Optimization of some PP indexes can be non-trivial, if they are non-smooth functions, or when the optimum has a small "squint angle", detectable only from close proximity. Here, measures for calculating the smoothness and squintability properties of the PP index are defined. These are used to investigate the performance of a recently introduced swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO), for optimizing PP indexes. The performance of JSO in detecting the target pattern (pipe shape) is compared with existing optimizers in PP. Additionally, JSO's performance on detecting the sine-wave shape is evaluated using different PP indexes (hence different smoothness and squintability) across various data dimensions (d = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) and JSO hyper-parameters. We observe empirically that higher squintability improves the success rate of the PP index optimization, while smoothness has no significant effect. The JSO algorithm has been implemented in the R package, `tourr`, and functions to calculate smoothness and squintability measures are implemented in the `ferrn` package.

                arXiv:2512.09972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability--efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Structural Importance Prior Bayesian Model Merging (SIP-BMM), a framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. SIP-BMM renders high-dimensional layer-wise search tractable by introducing an importance-aware Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace Bayesian Optimization (SAASBO) strategy. By leveraging a structural importance prior derived from task-vector differences, our method guides SAASBO to automatically identify critical layers, thereby dramatically reducing the effective dimensionality without sacrificing the granularity of full-model control. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the Log-Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement ($q$NEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that SIP-BMM discovers a stronger and denser Pareto front than competitive baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108882">Heterogeneity of genetic sequence within quasi-species of influenza virus revealed by single-molecule sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Influenza viruses exhibit high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations arise from the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts that conform to the quasi-species model of a cloud of related genomes evolving under selection (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and improving vaccine design, yet conventional RNA sequencing often fails to detect low-frequency variants because of technical errors during sample preparation and sequencing. Here, we implement a single unique molecular identifier strategy that reduces sequencing artifacts and achieves an error rate of ~10⁻⁵, enabling single-particle–level quantification of quasi-species diversity. Mutation frequencies greatly exceeding background error confirm their biological origin, while information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen–Shannon divergence reveal non-random mutation distributions under selective constraints. This framework supports detailed studies of intra-host viral evolution and may inform artificial intelligence-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and more effective influenza vaccine strategies.

                <p>Sulf1<I></I> is an extracellular sulfatase that regulates cell signaling by removing 6-<I>O</I>-sulfates from heparan sulfate. Although the roles of <I>Sulf1</I> in neural development have been studied extensively, its functions in the adult brain remain largely unknown. Here, we report the effects of <I>Sulf1</I> disruption on the neuronal properties of the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, one of the regions highly expressing <I>Sulf1</I>. We separately labeled MSNs expressing dopamine D1 receptors (D1-MSNs) or D2 receptors (D2-MSNs) by injecting adult male <I>Drd1-Cre</I> and <I>Drd2-Cre</I> mice with a Cre-dependent AAV vector expressing a red fluorescent protein, mCherry, and examined their electrophysiological properties by means of whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recording. In the D2-MSNs, <I>Sulf1</I> disruption led to drastic changes in neural firing responses to depolarizing current injections: in the <I>Sulf1</I> knock-out mice, the rheobase was smaller than in the wild-type mice, but the number of action potentials elicited by depolarization did not increase at larger current injections. In the D1-MSNs, <I>Sulf1</I> disruption resulted in more depolarized resting membrane potentials and increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio. These results suggest that <I>Sulf1</I> is essential for regulation of neuronal excitability and glutamatergic transmission of NAc MSNs in adult mice and implicate the potential roles of <I>Sulf1</I> in NAc circuit activity, reward-aversion behaviors, and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and drug addiction.</p>

                <p>We studied the role of movement and outcome information in forming metacognitive representations of agency. Human participants (<I>N</I> = 40; 25 female, 15 male, 0 diverse) completed a goal-oriented task: a semivirtual version of a ball-throwing game. In two conditions, we manipulated either the visual representation of the throwing movement or its proximal outcome (the resulting ball trajectory). We measured participants&rsquo; accuracy in a discrimination agency task, as well as confidence in their responses and tested for differences in the electrophysiological (EEG) signal using mass linear mixed-effect modeling. We found no mean differences between participants&rsquo; metacognitive efficiency between conditions. However, through exploratory analyses, we found that metacognitive sensitivity did not correlate between the two conditions and that the EEG signal differed between the two conditions during the agency discrimination task. We cautiously interpret these results as suggesting that although both movement and outcome information contribute to participants&rsquo; sense of agency, they may do so through distinct processes. These findings highlight the need for further research examining the potential neurophysiological differences corresponding to the conceptual distinction between bodily and external agency.</p>

                Background This study validates the Korean Movement Culture Perception (KMCP) scale, a tool designed to assess Korea's 'Movement Culture' (e.g., K-pop dance, Taekwondo), a key element of the 'Shin Hallyu' (New Korean Wave) characterized by participatory consumption. Using the Rasch model, this study analysed the validity of the scale among 1,240 participants from Korea and China, a major market for Hallyu. Methods Participants responded to the 21-item KMCP scale, which comprises three sub-factors ('Korean attractiveness,' 'correct knowledge information,' and 'content diversification'), using a five-point Likert scale. Results The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .954), and all 21 items showed an adequate model fit (Infit range: 0.86–1.11), confirming its overall construct validity. However, the item-person map revealed that item difficulty was clustered in the middle, indicating a limited capacity to measure diverse perception levels. Furthermore, significant differential item functioning (DIF) was found in five items (4, 6, 7, 12, and 31) based on nationality, with three of this exhibiting cultural bias unfavourable to foreigners. Conclusions In conclusion, while the KMCP scale is a generally valid tool, the revision of culturally biased items is urgently needed to ensure cross-cultural equivalence. By improving the scale, this study will contribute to a more objective evaluation of Hallyu content's value and support the global dissemination of Korean movement culture as a health promotion tool through education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-2/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Improved Oxygenation after One Lung Ventilation in Severe Cardiomegaly due to Cor Pulmonale; analysis with Heart-Lung Interaction Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Introduction One-lung ventilation (OLV) is used to isolate one lung during thoracic surgery, but manipulation and positioning can affect heart-lung interaction. Cardiomegaly may exacerbate these changes, especially in the left lateral decubitus (LLD) position. Objectives To investigate the effect of cardiomegaly on heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. Case presentation A 20-year-old male with recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax was scheduled for right-sided bronchopleural fistula repair via thoracotomy. The patient presented with cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio 75%) and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular and atrial dilation. In the LLD position, OLV led to desaturation when both lungs were ventilated, but oxygenation improved when only the left lung was ventilated. Results Cardiomegaly alters heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. The enlarged heart exerts pressure on the left lung, impairing ventilation. When both lungs are ventilated in this position, ventilation is directed toward the right lung, reducing oxygenation and causing desaturation. However, restricting ventilation to the left lung improved oxygenation due to better lung compliance and less interference from the enlarged heart. Conclusions Cardiomegaly affects heart-lung interaction during OLV in the LLD position. Oxygenation improves when only the left lung is ventilated, likely due to less compression of the left lung. The supine position may further enhance oxygenation even with bilateral ventilation. This case highlights the importance of considering cardiomegaly in OLV management. This section should be written as per the CARE checklist item 3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104700">Female moths incorporate plant acoustic emissions into their oviposition decision-making process</a></h4>

              
                Insects rely on plants’ visual, chemical, tactile, and electrical cues when making various decisions. A recent study demonstrated that dehydrated plants emit ultrasonic sounds within the auditory sensitivity range of many moth species. In this study, we sought to determine whether insects also rely on plant acoustic signals when making decisions. We investigated whether female moths rely on ultrasonic clicks which are typically produced by dehydrated plants when deciding where to oviposit. In the absence of an actual plant, the moths indeed preferred to lay their eggs in proximity to acoustic signals which represent dehydrating plants. Tracking the moths’ behavior prior to the decision showed that they examined both sides of the arena and gradually spent more time on the acoustic-playback side. Interestingly, when actual plants were added to the arena, the oviposition preference was reversed and the moths preferred silent plants, which is in accordance with their a priori preference for hydrated plants. Deafening the moths eliminated their preference, confirming that the choice was based on hearing. Moreover, the presence of male moths, including their auditory signals, did not affect their oviposition decision, suggesting that the response was specific to plant sound emissions. We reveal evidence for a first acoustic interaction between moths and plants, but as plants emit various sounds, our findings hint at the existence of more currently unknown insect-plant acoustic interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107039">CCDC32 stabilizes clathrin-coated pits and drives their invagination</a></h4>

              
                Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining homeostasis in mammalian cells. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the α-appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full-length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted α-helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32’s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93994">Population analyses reveal heterogenous encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex during naturalistic foraging</a></h4>

              
                Foraging in the wild requires coordinated switching of critical functions, including goal-oriented navigation and context-appropriate action selection. Nevertheless, few studies have examined how different functions are represented in the brain during naturalistic foraging. To address this question, we recorded multiple single-unit activities from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats seeking a sucrose reward in the presence of an unpredictable attack posed by a robotic predator (Lobsterbot). Simultaneously recorded ensemble activities from neurons were analyzed in reference to various behavioral indices as the animal moved freely across the foraging area (F) between the nest (N) and the goal (E) area. An artificial neural network, trained with simultaneously recorded neural activity, estimated the rat’s current distance from the Lobsterbot. The accuracy of distance estimation was the highest in the middle F-zone in which the dominant behavior was active navigation. The spatial encoding persisted in the N-zone when non-navigational behaviors such as grooming, rearing, and sniffing were excluded. In contrast, the accuracy decreased as the animal approached the E-zone, when the activity of the same neuronal ensembles was more correlated with events related to dynamic decision-making between food procurement and Lobsterbot evasion. A population-wide analysis confirmed highly heterogeneous encoding by the region. To further assess the decision-related activity in the E-zone, a naive Bayesian classifier was trained to predict the success and failure of avoidance behavior. The classifier predicted the avoidance outcome as much as 6 s before the head withdrawal. In addition, two sub-populations of recorded units with distinct temporal dynamics contributed differently to the prediction. These findings suggest that an overlapping population of mPFC neurons may switch between two heterogeneous modes, encoding relevant locations for goal-directed navigation or an imminent situational challenge.

">Non-Canonical ERP Patterns in Second-language Sentence Processing: Evidence from Syntactic, Semantic, and Phonological Violations in Japanese Learners of English</a></h4>

              
                Background/Objectives: Despite notable advances in the neural mechanisms of second-language (L2) processing, few studies have systematically compared syntactic, semantic, and phonological processing of L2 within a single experimental design. We investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers with intermediate English proficiency. By integrating behavioral measures and event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined how syntactic, semantic, and phonological information influenced sentence comprehension. Methods: Twenty-seven participants completed an auditory sentence judgment task involving English sentences with a syntactic, semantic, or phonological error. Results: Behavioral results revealed the highest accuracy in the control and semantic conditions, while syntactic and phonological violations led to significantly lower performance, indicating greater processing difficulty in these domains. Among the three linguistic violation types, phonological violations elicited the robust ERP negativities across both time 300-500 ms and 500-800 ms time windows, while syntactic and semantic violations evoked less consistent neural responses in this L2 auditory sentence judgment task. These results suggest that mismatches in expected phonological forms hinder lexical activation, triggering a negativity that resembles an N400 but reflects different underlying processes. Conclusion: We found non-canonical neural response patterns in L2 learners, characterized by sensitivity to phonological anomalies but minimal neural disruption for semantic or syntactic anomalies. The current study contributes to our understanding of L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers, particularly by aligning real-time neural responses with behavioral performance. This work offers implications for pedagogical practices and assessment strategies tailored to neurodiverse bilingual populations.

">INS-fMRI reveals a mesoscale limbic organization associated with medial pulvinar in primates</a></h4>

              
                The experience of emotion comprises not only the feelings (happiness, sadness), but also behavioral expression, internal awareness, and the body's physiological response. However, it remains unclear how the brain integrates these disparate aspects of emotion. Here, to examine functional connectivity in the limbic system of macaque monkeys, we combined focal Infrared Neural Stimulation of a sensory gateway (medial pulvinar PM), with ultra-high-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (INS-fMRI). We find connected sites are mesoscale (millimeter-scale) in size and arranged in patchy patterns across cingulate, insula, and amygdala. Non-overlapping connections evoked from three sequential stimulation sites in PM form clusters of multi-site integration, and appear related to known functional organization within these limbic regions. We suggest these mesoscale functional connections link the limbic axes of motor expression (cingulate), interoception (insula), and emotion-related processing (amygdala), and that, much like visual system, the limbic system is fundamentally quite orderly at mesoscale. Our results underscore the importance of millimeter-scale precision and organization in diagnosis and treatment of affective disorders.

">Multitimescale Computation by Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The basic computational unit of the brain has long been defined as the neuron. However, mounting evidence suggests that other cells, especially astrocytes, also perform computation. Here we demonstrate that cerebellar astrocytes decompose norepinephrine input into slow and fast calcium activities through differential adrenergic receptor engagement. During reward learning in mice, slow and fast activities selectively target distinct synaptic pathways. Causal manipulations reveal that slow 1-adrenergic signals maintain behavioral states and coordinate transitions, while fast 2-adrenergic signals govern event-triggered responses and reinforcement learning. Remarkably, an actor-critic neural network trained on a similar sequence task spontaneously recapitulates these multitimescale dynamics, suggesting astrocytes implement critic-like computations that evaluate states and modulate neuronal learning. These findings establish astrocytes as multilevel processors that transform univariate neuromodulatory inputs into multivariate, pathway-specific circuit control operating in parallel with neuronal processing.

">HONeD-in on Brain Activity: Deconvolving Passive Diffusion on the Structural Network from Functional Brain Signals</a></h4>

              
                Brain regions perform distinct computations, and their signals propagate through the whole-brain white matter network. Yet, mathematical models that describe this signal propagation via purely passive diffusion can predict a considerable amount of the observed functional connectivity between regions. This raises a critical question: if so much functional connectivity can be explained by a passive process, how can we isolate the active process? Here, we calculate in closed-form an estimate for such an active signal in functional MRI by spatially deconvolving the effect of passive signal spread over the brain's structural connectivity using a higher-order network diffusion (HONeD) model. Across 770 Human Connectome Project subjects, we show that the resulting HONeD-innovation (HONeD-in) signal 1) sparsifies functional connectivity while retaining a well-connected network, 2) remodels resting-state networks (RSNs), 3) mixes the unimodal--multimodal hierarchical organization of RSNs into a circle with no clear hierarchy, and 4) deblurs task-activation maps. Together, our results highlight HONeD deconvolution as a generalizable new way to study resting-state and task fMRI brain signals.

">Zebrin molecular identity and cerebellar location determine Purkinje cell vulnerability in Christianson syndrome mice</a></h4>

              
                Ataxia is a major characteristic feature in Christianson syndrome, where Purkinje cells in the anterior cerebellar vermis are vulnerable to degeneration while those in the posterior vermis are resilient. Here, we provide a temporal study of changes in Purkinje cell function, cell vulnerability and innervation of cerebellar nuclei in a mouse model of Christianson syndrome. Purkinje cells express certain molecules in a patterned manner across the cerebellum, such as aldolase C/zebrin-II (zebrin). We show that zebrin patterning appears normal before disease onset in Christianson syndrome mice with no apparent cell death, similar to what has been reported in patients. We observe rapid Purkinje cell death in the anterior lobe of Christianson syndrome mice that is exclusive to zebrin-negative Purkinje cells, with zebrin-positive Purkinje cells showing resilience. Intrinsic firing deficits exclusively in the anterior cerebellum are observed at the same time as the first observed cell death in the anterior cerebellum. In contrast, posterior Purkinje cells degenerated later, but zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive cells were equally susceptible to degeneration. Purkinje cells' innervation in the cerebellar nuclei was also lost in Christianson syndrome mice in a region-specific manner: neurons in the anterior cerebellar nuclei, with predominantly zebrin-negative Purkinje cells' inputs, displayed dramatic loss of Purkinje cells' innervation, while neurons in the posterior cerebellar nuclei, innervated by both zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive terminals, showed greater resiliency. Together, our results highlight that cerebellar location and zebrin molecular identity appear important to the vulnerability of Purkinje cells and their innervation in the cerebellar nuclei in Christianson syndrome.

">Shaped by meaning, weighted by reliability: New insights into multisensory integration</a></h4>

              
                In everyday perception, sensory information is rarely interpreted in isolation. Instead, observers generate expectations about what is likely to occur next, using contextual information to guide decisions, particularly when sensory input is weak, ambiguous, or uncertain. These expectations can facilitate behaviour when they align with incoming evidence, but impose costs when they conflict, shaping how information from different senses contributes to behaviour. However, it remains unclear what kind of multisensory process is engaged when meaning guides decisions, and whether multisensory facilitation and non-independence reflect a single integrative mechanism or distinct routes shaped by context. Here, we examined how semantic context, visual clarity, and the relationship between auditory and visual signals jointly shape behaviour in a semantic correspondence task using dynamic, naturalistic events. Participants judged whether a target matched a preceding concept prime, establishing an expectation at the level of meaning. Targets were auditory-only, visual-only (clear or blurry), or audiovisual (AV), with AV components conveying either the same or different meanings across modalities. AV facilitation was not a general consequence of stimulus redundancy. When the prime accurately predicted the target and auditory and visual signals conveyed the same meaning, degrading visual input increased the contribution of auditory information, leading to faster responses and violations of the race-model inequality. By contrast, when the prime indicated the target but auditory and visual signals conveyed competing meanings, AV stimulation produced robust behavioural costs relative to vision. When the prime did not match the target, congruent and incongruent audiovisual events produced comparable effects, and race-model violations were observed even when auditory and visual signals encoded different concepts, indicating convergence at the level of the response rather than shared perceptual content. Finally, exploratory clustering revealed two participant subgroups with comparable overall response speed but systematically different multisensory profiles when semantic expectations did not allow reliable anticipation of the upcoming event. Together, these findings show that multisensory effects in semantic decisions are shaped by meaning and arise through two functionally distinct routes: one in which reduced sensory reliability promotes joint use of congruent audiovisual information, and another in which perceptually different signals converge on the same response when semantic expectations are not met.

">Alpha oscillations and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly predict visual temporal resolution, confidence, and dependence on prior experience</a></h4>

              
                Perception requires integrating sensory input over time to construct coherent experiences. Alpha oscillations have been proposed to define the temporal resolution of perception, yet empirical evidence remains inconsistent. Here we combined a sustained visual integration paradigm with resting-state EEG to investigate how oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly shape temporal perception. Participants (n=83) viewed alternating gratings that varied in alternation speed, producing the perception of either a fused plaid (integration) or two interchanging gratings (segregation). Faster individual alpha rhythms were associated with narrower temporal integration windows, and a steeper aperiodic spectrum predicted greater perceptual precision. Moreover, individuals with slower alpha frequencies and flatter spectra showed stronger reliance on prior judgments, suggesting reduced sensory precision and increased weighting of recent experience. Subjective confidence increased with faster alpha rhythms, reflecting the clarity of sensory evidence and its consistency with prior responses. Together, these findings show that the perceptual interpretation, confidence and previous experience effects in temporal integration reflect the joint influence of alpha rhythms and aperiodic neural activity. Mechanistically, faster alpha rhythms and lower neural noise may enhance perceptual resolution by generating more precise sampling frames per time unit, leading to finer temporal perception, reduced reliance on prior experience, and greater confidence.

">The individuality of single-frame functional brain connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Converging evidence from studies on brain network fingerprinting and precision functional mapping suggest that brain networks are highly individualized in functionally meaningful ways. Concurrently with a growth in studies on this topic, there has been a rise in interest on dynamics (approximately second-to-second changes) in brain networks within scan sessions. While analyses of traditional static networks have increasingly grown towards emphasizing the importance of individual differences in brain network topology, studies of dynamic networks typically follow methodology that require brain states to be considered at a group level. In this work, we explore the extent to which brain states are shared across groups of people or unique to individuals using dynamic fingerprinting, an extension of existing fingerprinting methodology meant for dynamic networks. We estimate connectivity at individual volumes using phase coherence. We find that the identity of participants can be predicted with high accuracy based on single volumes given sufficient database scan data. We find that having more highly parcellated atlases facilitates individual identification. Finally, we find that tasks can be identified more readily within subjects than between subjects. We conclude that not only are trajectories between brain states unique to individuals (as previous work suggests), but also the instantaneous states that individuals inhabit are distinct. Further, the instantaneous neural correlates of a task appear to be more consistent within subjects than between subjects. This underlines the importance of considering individual variability in studies of brain network dynamics.

">The IKC-leptin axis functions as a molecular bridge between neurodevelopment and endocrine signaling</a></h4>

              
                Kcnb1, a voltage-gated K+ channel widely expressed in brain, assembles with integrins to form integrin-K+ channel complexes (IKCs) in cortex and hypothalamus. Pathogenic KCNB1 variants cause Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE), and Kcnb1-null (Null) mice reproduce core neurodevelopmental defects alongside chronic hypoleptinemia, suggesting a leptin-IKC signaling axis. We find that Kcnb1, integrins, and the leptin receptor (LepR) co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in cortical neurons. Perinatal leptin supplementation in Null mice improves cognition, corrects cortical anatomy, and restores neuronal migration, dendritic arborization, and synaptic functionality. In primary Null cortical neurons, leptin normalizes dendritic growth and actin remodeling via integrin-dependent mechanisms. By contrast, leptin has modest effects in WT animals and neurons; sensitivity is unmasked by pharmacological manipulation of integrins, and, strikingly, LepR blockade in the absence of exogenous leptin is sufficient to induce Null-like defects in WT neurons. These findings argue that hypoleptinemia alone does not drive the Null phenotype. Instead, they reveal a previously unrecognized, dual-mode model in which LepR signaling is regulated by both its ligand and IKCs. This conceptual advance links IKC-LepR coupling to neurodevelopment and DEE and pinpoints their interface as a tractable therapeutic target.

">PKMζ-KIBRA interactions, molecular turnover, and memory</a></h4>

              
                How can the molecules that strengthen synaptic connections maintain memory in the face of molecular turnover? Our previous work showed that persistent interaction between the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, KIBRA, and the autonomously active PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is crucial for maintaining synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory for at least a month. This duration is longer than the lifespans of individual KIBRA and PKM{zeta} molecules. Biophysical modeling of the interaction suggests oligomers of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} dimers, but not individual dimers or monomers, can overcome molecular turnover by continually incorporating newly synthesized KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, replacing those that have degraded. Here we used AlphaFold 3 to predict the structures of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} heterodimers and heterohexamers and to examine the sites of action of two structurally distinct inhibitors of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} interaction that disrupt established late-LTP and long-term memory. The structures predict that the peptide K-ZAP blocks formation of heterodimers, whereas the small molecule {zeta}-stat prevents PKM{zeta} of one heterodimer from binding a second KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, essential for forming larger oligomeric structures. We show that {zeta}-stat, like K-ZAP, disrupts 1-month-old spatial memory. Thus, continual formation of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} oligomers can be a core molecular mechanism driving the persistence of long-term memory in the face of molecular turnover.

">Differential modulation of aversive signaling by expectation across the cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Pain-related aversion is an affective-motivational state driven by sensory experience that promotes learning and recruits widespread cortical networks, yet how distinct cingulate subregions contribute to its adaptive utility remains poorly understood. Here we used longitudinal one-photon calcium imaging in mice to compare dynamics in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) across repeated unsignaled foot-shocks and fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Both regions contained relatively stable ensembles that responded robustly to shocks, indicating shared encoding of acute nociceptive events. However, only the RSC flexibly reorganized its population activity when shocks were preceded by predictive cues. These anticipatory dynamics in the RSC predicted the rate of fear learning across individuals and subsequent extinction. By contrast, the ACC maintained shock-responsive ensembles with limited cue modulation. Instead, its dynamics encoded decisions to freeze, aligning with its role in encoding ongoing nociception and driving immediate defensive behavior. Together, these results reveal a division of labor in which the ACC emphasizes ongoing nociceptive processing, while the RSC transforms sensory signals into predictive codes that shape learning and memory. This specialization highlights how distributed cortical computations cooperate to generate the adaptive value of aversion. More broadly, our findings suggest that these regions assume complementary roles to address immediate sensory-motivational responses while flexibly reconfiguring to support long-term behavioral adaptation.

">Neural Integration of Affective Prosodic and Semantic Cues in Non-literal Forms of Speech Understanding</a></h4>

              
                Emotions in speech are conveyed through both semantics and prosody--voice 'melody', yet how listeners integrate these cues in the brain remains unclear. We investigated non-literal forms of speech, such as irony and sarcasm, where understanding beyond literal meaning relies on the dynamic interplay between affective prosodic and semantic cues, alongside theory of mind (ToM). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants listened to short dialogues between two characters, which varied in prosody and semantics to convey either literal or non-literal meanings. Behaviorally, semantics and prosody interacted in shaping participants' evaluations, although the data suggest a prosody dominance effect. Non-literal speech engaged the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, temporal speech regions, and ToM areas, while integration-demanding tasks (e.g., irony, sarcasm, ToM) evoked stronger ToM-network activation than prosody or semantics tasks. Taken together, our data clarify the behavioral and neural underpinnings of the integration of prosody and semantics in non-literal speech and open new venues in this field.

">Regional Hypothalamic Responses to Light Vary Across Developmental Stages but Remain Stable with Time of Day</a></h4>

              
                Background: Light plays a significant role in regulating various non-visual biological processes, such as stimulating alertness and cognition. However, the precise subcortical neural pathways are not fully established, including within the hypothalamus. In particular, how the hypothalamus processes are modulated by time-of-day and developmental stages, remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine in vivo the impact of different light illuminance (0.16, 37, 92, and 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance: mel-EDI lux) on the activity of the hypothalamus of healthy young adults (N=33; 20 women; 24.3 +/- 3.2y) and adolescents (N=16; 5 women; 16.8 +/- 1.1y) while they completed an auditory executive task, in the morning or in the evening. Results: Performance to the task improved with increasing illuminance irrespective of time of day and age group. When focusing on time-of-day differences in young adults, we found that the regional impact of light illuminance on the activity of the hypothalamus was consistent between the morning and the evening, with the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, respectively, showing increased and decreased activity with increasing illuminance. When focusing on developmental stages differences, during the evening session only, we found similar regional patterns in adolescents and young adult. The magnitude of the response at the highest illuminance was, however, larger in adolescents, with a larger deactivation of the superior-anterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus. Conclusions: These findings reveal a complex and non-uniform impact of light on hypothalamus activity and provide novel insights into how light influences vary with developmental stages.

">Controllable Point-Light Displays Implemented in a game engine for biological motion research</a></h4>

              
                Biological motion perception plays a critical role in survival and social communication across species. Point-light displays (PLDs), which represent body movement using only a small set of joint markers, have long served as an effective tool for isolating motion cues from other visual features. However, existing methods for generating PLDs, ranging from filmed actors with reflective markers to markerless motion extraction and motion-capture datasets, present limitations in cost, accessibility, flexibility, or ecological validity. In particular, many laboratories lack the resources to create customizable stimuli that allow systematic manipulation of movement parameters. In this article, we introduce a practical and easily modifiable method for producing fully controllable 3D PLDs using freely available animation rigs and the Unity game engine. Our approach enables real-time control of depth cues and directional motion without the need for motion capture equipment or specialized filming environments. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we conducted a psychophysical experiment comparing the perception of biological and non-biological motion. The results replicate the well-documented forward-motion perceptual bias for biological stimuli and highlight differences in how observers interpret motion direction across stimulus classes. This method offers a convenient, accessible, and adaptable tool for research on motion perception and social cognition.

">Gliomas preferentially develop within the action-mode network</a></h4>

              
                Gliomas tend to arise in specific brain regions and may integrate into functional circuits, suggesting they could be regulated by brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether glioma growth is related to system-level brain networks. Analyzing neuroimaging data from three datasets including 1,310 patients with cerebral gliomas, we identified and replicated a functionally connected glioma network, which overlaps with the action-mode network (AMN), somatomotor network (SMN), and action-related subcortical regions. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the AMN successfully predicted the location of glioma occurrence in two independent datasets with complex tumor distributions. Remarkably, no patient had a glioma entirely outside the AMN, and over 89% of patients exhibited gliomas with at least 50% overlap with the network. Moreover, the spatial overlap between glioma location and the AMN demonstrated significant prognostic value in survival analyses, with higher AMN-tumor overlap associated with poorer overall survival. Notably, the acetylcholine transporter, a key player in glioma pathogenesis that drives transcriptional reprogramming, showed an expression pattern overlapping with the AMN. Meta-analytic annotations further linked the glioma network to processes of action initiation, execution, and feedback. These findings indicate that gliomas preferentially arise in circuits involved in action and highlight the central role of the AMN in glioma pathophysiology and growth.

">Context-Dependent Motor Feedback Underlies Choice-Related signals in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Choice-related neural activity, reflecting trial-by-trial correlation with subjects perceptual choice, is commonly observed in sensory cortices and has been implied in sensory readout. Recent studies suggest an alternative source from motor-reporting, yet its precise nature remain elusive due to limitations in conventional experimental paradigms. Here we quantitatively identified motor component by training macaques to discriminate visual motion directions via making saccade to spatial-independent, colored choice targets appeared under two contexts: at stimulus onset, or after its offset. Neural recordings in visual areas MT/MST revealed a dominant motor-related choice signal when the saccade goal was known in advance; this signal vanished with delayed target onset. By comparing with downstream sensory-motor transformation areas and employing a recurrent network model, we demonstrated that this motor component reflected feedback. Our work clarifies that a major portion of "decision" activity in sensory neurons is attributable to motor-reporting processes, highlighting the profound influence of behavioral context.

">Structural basis of CO2 valence coding in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In the olfactory system, glomerular sensory channels of single receptor identity support reliable odor recognition for appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors. For many olfactory stimuli, the assigned sensory value is innate but weighted by the internal state and previous experiences. How context-dependent modulation of innate valence coding supports distinct behavioral responses is poorly understood. Here we show that CO2 sensory information in Drosophila, intrinsically aversive but modified by attractive food signals, diverges from the canonical glomerular channel already in the antennal lobe via the polarized local interneuron LN23. LN23 relays sensory input via an extraglomerular CO2 pathway and manipulation of LN23 activity revealed a dominant role in CO2-induced avoidance behavior. The extraglomerular CO2 pathway projects to the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP) adjacent to the canonical Lateral Horn (LH) olfactory processing center and segregates into anatomically distinct valence channels. Connectome data together with functional characterization showed the convergence of parallel CO2 channels onto two interconnected 3rd order neurons which integrate additional sensory modalities via distinct mechanisms: while the glomerular CO2 pathway converge with food relay neurons onto separated dendritic domains of the PD5 interneuron in the LH, the extraglomerular pathways integrating CO2 information with antennal humidity and temperature modalities establish antagonistic inputs onto the PLP interneuron PV9. This early anatomical divergence of a defined olfactory channel followed by separated multimodal integration provides a structural basis for context-dependent valence coding and appropriate behavioral responses.

">Ultrashort optical-pin excitation for scattering brain imaging</a></h4>

              
                Imaging neural structures deep in brain tissue is central to understanding brain function, yet remains fundamentally limited by strong optical scattering and the requirement for accurate three-dimensional (3D) optical sectioning. Laser-scanning microscopy is a promising technique for brain imaging; however, maintaining excitation focus integrity in scattering media while preserving axial confinement poses a persistent photonic challenge. Here we introduce the optical pin, an ultrashort excitation regime engineered at the angular-spectrum level to address this limitation. By broadening the transverse angular bandwidth of a Bessel-type field while preserving its conical momentum-space architecture, the optical pin introduces a controlled longitudinal wave-vector spread that compresses the axial interference length to the micrometer scale, restoring Gaussian-like sectioning without sacrificing multi-angle interference. This excitation design yields substantially enhanced imaging performance, including ~1.5-fold contrast improvement and ~2.6-fold increased robustness to scattering. We validate the approach across transparent, scattering, and biological specimens, including bead phantoms, C. elegans, and mouse brain tissue. As a system-level excitation strategy, the optical pin is readily compatible with existing laser-scanning microscopy platforms and is particularly suited for scattering-limited brain imaging.

">Elements of Olfactory Intelligence in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The ability to make the world of odorants intelligible is a key capability of the Drosophila olfactory system that we shall call olfactory intelligence. We argue that olfactory intelligence does not only arise in the form of associative learning in the Mushroom Body, but can be seen throughout the first three stages of the early olfactory system: the Antenna, the Antennal Lobe and the Mushroom Body Calyx, where encoding and processing of odorants take places. Characterizing the structure and logic of the code underlying the spike trains accessing the memory in the Mushroom Body is a major challenge in neuroscience. To address this challenge and unveil the key elements of olfactory intelligence, we extensively model the function of the Drosophila early olfactory system from its intriguing connectome. We start by modeling the space of odorants using constructs of both semantic and syntactic information. Odorant semantics concerns the identity of odorants while odorant syntax pertains to their concentration amplitude. These odorant attributes are multiplicatively coupled in the process of olfactory transduction. To make the world of odorants intelligible, we establish that the Drosophila Antennal Lobe and Calyx largely reduce the concentration dependency of the odorant information from the confounding representation of the Antenna, and thereby disentangle the odorant semantic information from the odorant syntactic information. We also introduce a novel time and rank-based representation of Kenyon Cell (KC) outputs, called the marked first spike sequence code. We compare the cumulative inter-spike interval statistics of odorant semantics and introduce a novel distance measure for the accurate classification of odorant semantics. Computationally, these elements of olfactory intelligence are realized by a class of differential divisive normalization processors (DNPs) modeling the feedback circuits in the Antennal Lobe facilitated by Local Neurons and in the Calyx by the Anterior Paired Lateral (APL) neuron. The marked first spike sequence code at the output of the DNP circuit of the Calyx provides a novel representation of the odorant semantics. The code reflects the amplitude ranking that drives the KCs in the time domain. Strikingly, the APL feedback not only removes the concentration dependency of the KC outputs, but also increases the ranking distance between the marked first spike sequence codes representing different odorant identities. Thus, the rank-based representation supports accurate classification of odorant semantics.

">Facilitating the Supplementary Motor Area Activity Reduces Variability of Ball Arrival Position in Accurate Ball Throwing Performance</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining high accuracy during rapid, dynamic movements is a significant challenge for the central nervous system. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a key cortical region for orchestrating motor commands and regulating movement variability, yet its causal role in maintaining precision during high-speed tasks remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the impact of modulating SMA excitability on throwing performance in fourteen healthy novices. Participants performed maximal and submaximal (50% effort) throwing tasks before and after receiving intermittent (facilitatory) or continuous (inhibitory) theta burst stimulation (TBS) over the SMA. Outcome measures included ball speed, variability of pitch location--quantified as variable error (95% confidence ellipse area) and absolute error (Euclidean distance from the ellipse center to the target)--and introspective ratings of performance via visual analog scales (VAS). Results showed that intermittent TBS (iTBS) significantly reduced the variable error of pitch location during maximal-effort throwing--where neural noise is theoretically elevated--without compromising ball speed. In contrast, no significant changes in performance were observed following continuous TBS or during the submaximal throwing task. Notably, objective precision gains under iTBS were dissociated from subjective ratings of accuracy, which increased globally over time independent of stimulation type. These findings demonstrate that the SMA plays a critical causal role in stabilizing motor output under high motor drive. This study suggests that SMA-mediated stabilization operates as a subconscious process, offering new insights for optimizing complex motor skills.

">Operations Near the Edge of cognitive decline: Behavioral and Neural Correlates of cognitive load in Mild cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                Motivation: Early detection of cognitive strain is essential for identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and its progression to more severe neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates cognitive strain in MCI by examining both behavioral and neural correlates during a real-world task. Methods: Twenty-four older adults (M=69, 14 male, 10 female), including 11 with MCI and 13 healthy controls (MMSE >22/30), performed a spatial navigation task under varying memory load. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to capture error-related potentials (ErrPs), which reflect cognitive load and processing errors. Results: Both groups showed a decline in working memory performance as cognitive load increased ({beta} = -41.39, SE = 10.73, t(90) = -3.86, p < .001). MCI participants, however, exhibited more efficient use of non-intrinsic (allocentric) reference frames under high cognitive load ({beta} = 2.47, SE = 0.95, t(82) = 2.61, p = .009). MCI individuals also displayed larger ErrPs in central brain regions, indicating greater neural resource allocation. Additionally, MCI participants showed a decrease in parietal-to-frontal theta dominance under high load ({beta} = -0.68, SE = 0.32, t(90) = -2.12, p = .037), and reduced fronto-parietal connectivity. Discussion: These findings suggest that MCI participants experience greater cognitive strain, evidenced by increased neural resource allocation and strategy-shifting under load. This heightened strain may serve as an early marker of MCI progression, offering potential for early detection of pathological changes.

                Background: KCNV2-associated retinopathy is a rare inherited retinal dystrophy caused by variants in the KCNV2 gene, leading to disrupted photoreceptor function and slowly progressive vision loss. Patients have characteristic electroretinography abnormalities, including reduced cone responses, delayed and reduced rod responses to low light flashes and paradoxically large rod-driven responses to bright flashes of light. To model this condition, we generated the Kcnv2 E151X mouse line and assessed its structural and functional retinal features. Methods: We have employed CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing technology to generate a mouse line with an early stop mutation in position E151 - orthologous to the commonly encountered E143X mutation in humans - and performed a combination of immunohistochemistry and Western Blot to confirm the absence of the full-length KCNV2-encoded protein, Kv8.2. To assess how closely it models the human disease, we have characterised the KCNV2 mutant mouse line at histological and functional levels employing immunohistochemistry and electroretinography, respectively. Results: Kcnv2 mutant mice showed markedly reduced photopic responses and reproduced the supernormal rod phenotype as described in affected individuals. In the morphological context, mutant retinas demonstrated strong and early glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation together with reduced counts of cone arrestin positive cells as well as photoreceptors in general. Conclusions: The Kcnv2 mutant mouse line replicates key functional and structural hallmarks of KCNV2-associated retinopathy. This model provides a relevant platform for mechanistic studies and preclinical evaluation of gene based or pharmacological therapies targeting cone and rod photoreceptor dysfunction.

">Differential Effects of 5-HT7 Receptor Signaling in the Noradrenergic System in a Rat Model of Treatment-Resistant Depression</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major clinical challenge, and its neurobiological basis remains unclear. The locus coeruleus (LC), a key noradrenergic hub, shows altered activity in TRD models, and serotonergic 5-HT7 receptors have emerged as potential modulators of this circuit. Methods: We assessed the impact of 5-HT7 receptor activation on LC function in Wistar Kyoto rats, an established TRD model, using in vivo extracellular recordings, in vitro patch-clamp assays, and receptor expression analysis. Results: Systemic administration of AS19, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, increased LC neuronal firing in both strains, with a significantly greater effect in Wistar Kyoto rats. This response was prevented by a 5-HT7 antagonist confirming receptor specificity. Glutamatergic blockade altered AS19 effects in a strain-dependent manner, whereas in vitro assays revealed no differential postsynaptic modulation and similar presynaptic inhibition across groups. Western blot analysis showed elevated 5-HT7 receptor expression in the LC, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala of Wistar Kyoto rats, alongside reduced expression in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: These findings indicate that 5-HT7 receptor activation exerts complex, circuit-dependent modulation of LC activity, influenced by glutamatergic and serotonergic inputs. Enhanced receptor expression in limbic regions and altered LC responsiveness may contribute to TRD pathophysiology and highlight 5-HT7 signaling as a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies.

">Snipers under stress: mentally simulated motor actions are resistant to acute stress in police officers</a></h4>

              
                Motor imagery (MI) is a sensorimotor process allowing to mentally simulate a motor action and is widely used to enhance performance in domains such as rehabilitation, sport, and professional training. Although MI is increasingly incorporated into stress-management interventions, the reciprocal relationship, that is, the effect of acute stress on MI remain paradoxically poorly understood, particularly in ecologically valid settings. The present study investigated this issue in professional police officers performing physically and mentally a precise handgun manipulation task under graded stress conditions (psychological stress). Fourteen participants was exposed to controlled, work-related stress scenarios designed to closely reflect real operational demands, while stress markers and temporal features of executed and imagined movements were recorded. Our results clearly indicate that motor imagery was preserved despite significant increases in stress levels, as the temporal characteristics of both executed and imagined movements remained stable across experimental conditions. These findings indicate that MI is resilient to acute psychosocial stress and support its relevance as a reliable training and performance-optimization tool in high-demand occupational settings.

">When exploration replaces storage: how eye movements shape visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory (VWM) is traditionally studied while constraining eye movements and limiting access to visual input, yet in natural vision humans constantly explore and resample their environment. Only a few studies have examined VWM utilization when participants were allowed to interact with the environment and found that participants often preferred to resample their environment rather than rely on VWM storage. However, since eye movements were not controlled in these studies, the link between VWM utilization and free visual exploration remained unknown. In two experiments (N = 40), we investigated how visual exploration shapes reliance on VWM versus perceptual input. Participants searched for a common target across two item sets and could either store multiple items for comparison or repeatedly resample the sets by switching between them. Results revealed that when switching was achieved through eye movements, participants consistently relied more on visual resampling and less on VWM; in contrast, when switching required a manual response, they shifted toward greater VWM use. This pattern persisted even when peripheral input was equated, suggesting that natural exploration through eye movements reduces the cognitive cost of acquiring visual information, leading to a strategic reduction in VWM use. Our findings challenge fixation-based approaches to VWM research and highlight the importance of studying cognition under ecological viewing conditions.

">Evaluating and Classifying Gentleness in VR-Based Surgical Simulation: A VR+fNIRS Study</a></h4>

              
                Gentleness, defined as the ability to handle tissues delicately and minimize unnecessary force, is a key indicator of surgical proficiency. Objective and real-time assessment of gentleness in virtual reality (VR)-based training can enhance the understanding of both psychomotor and cognitive aspects of surgical skill. This study evaluates and classifies participants gentleness during VR-based surgical simulations using fNIRS-derived hemodynamic features. We trained and compared several machine learning models to assess performance. Twenty-three volunteers with no prior laparoscopic experience performed a virtual reality-based laparoscopic double-grasper task while hemodynamic activity over frontal and motor cortical areas was recorded using eighteen fNIRS channels. Alongside fNIRS, we collected subjective workload (NASA-TLX), error numbers, and a VR gentleness score. This task involves using two grasper tools simultaneously to perform the tissue like balloon manipulation in a VR environment. We extracted temporal features (slope, RMS, standard deviation) and trained machine learning models to classify performance levels based on cortical activation. Labels were binarized as low vs. high using median splits for the gentleness score. Models were evaluated with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and summarized by accuracy. Results showed stronger right-frontal HbO activity and increased left-motor HbR responses in the low-performance group, suggesting greater cognitive effort and less efficient motor strategies during VR-based laparoscopic manipulation. Across classifiers and feature sets, slope-based features consistently outperformed variability- and amplitude-based metrics. Among the tested models, HbR slope features achieved the best overall classification performance, with the highest accuracy obtained using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifiers (accuracy {approx} 0.89, AUC up to 0.97). These findings demonstrate that fNIRS-derived hemodynamic dynamics can reliably discriminate between high and low VR performance levels, supporting their potential use in automated performance assessment and neuroadaptive feedback frameworks for VR-based surgical training.

">Dopaminergic Modulation of Mushroom Body Output Neurons Mediates Nociception-Induced Escape in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In Drosophila, noxious heat is detected by peripheral nociceptors expressing transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, including Painless and TrpA1, and rapidly triggers escape behavior. Although peripheral transduction has been defined in detail, the central circuits and neuromodulatory mechanisms that translate nociceptor activity into escape decisions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine targeted behavioral perturbations with anatomical tracing to delineate a nociception to escape pathway that engages dopaminergic modulation of mushroom body (MB) output. Kir2.1 mediated silencing across candidate neurotransmitter systems revealed a specific requirement for MB innervating dopaminergic neurons (DANs), particularly subsets within the PPL1 and PAM clusters, for robust nociception induced escape. Anterograde trans Tango tracing from painless and trpA1 expressing nociceptors labeled these MB dopaminergic neurons as direct postsynaptic partners, consistent with convergence of distinct nociceptor inputs onto a shared dopaminergic pathway. Finally, silencing a subset of mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) delayed escape without overtly disrupting baseline locomotion, supporting a model in which dopaminergic signaling recruits MB output to shape defensive action selection. Together, our results define a multi layer circuit motif linking peripheral nociception to MB dependent escape and provide a framework for dissecting how neuromodulation gates rapid defensive behaviors.

">A dedicated brain circuit controls forward walking in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits in the brain control high-level parameters of movement, including the initiation, speed, and direction of locomotion. How specific cell types are organized into circuits to compute these control signals and enable context-appropriate behavior remains unclear. Here, we identify central brain neurons in Drosophila that can initiate walking and exert graded control over walking speed. Connectome analyses position the neurons on top of a layered brain circuit, which recruits a specific population of descending neurons to control forward walking independently of turning and other parameters. As predicted by the connectome, the circuit enforces straight walking when activated unilaterally, and the activity of the central brain neurons represents a high-level walking drive. This drive is suppressed during flight but flexibly integrated with other control signals to enable complex movement sequences during obstacle negotiation. Together, our findings elucidate a dedicated brain circuit that enables efficient computation, selection, and integration of forward-walking signals for context-appropriate motor control.

">Understanding Brain Aging Through Behavioural and Microglial Changes: A Lifespan Approach</a></h4>

              
                Aging is characterized by progressive physiological decline linked to inflammaging, a chronic low-grade inflammatory state. This study investigates age-related behavioural changes and their correlation with microglial function in female Sprague Dawley rats across their lifespan. Using a longitudinal design at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age, we assessed motor performance, mood-related behaviours, and spatial cognition alongside microglial morphometric analysis in key brain regions. Results showed that motor and cognitive performance began to decline significantly at 12 months, with severe impairments and depressive-like behaviours appearing by 24 months. These deficits were paralleled by progressive gliosis in the hippocampus and striatum. Microglial morphometric analysis further indicated a more reactive, region-dependent phenotype, with cells in the striatum adopting a smaller area, reduced perimeter, and fewer intersections. These findings provide compelling evidence for significant age-dependent deterioration in motor performance, mood regulation, and cognitive abilities in female rats. Our data strongly suggest an underlying progression of neurobiological changes, with microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation being central candidates. This research contributes valuable insights into the cellular correlates of behavioural decline across the female lifespan, serving as a reference for the multifaceted changes that occur during normal aging.

">A cell-type-resolved human brain atlas of microRNAs and tRNA fragments</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miRs) and transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) regulate multiple brain processes ranging from neurogenesis and development through diverse neurological disorders. However, the cell-type specificity of brain miRs and tRFs remains poorly characterized, limiting the interpretation of their function. To address this issue, we generated a comprehensive, cell-type-resolved atlas of miRs and tRFs from live human brain tissues. Specifically, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes from neurosurgery-obtained fresh human brain samples and profiled their miR and tRF repertoires using small RNA-sequencing. Our atlas revealed multiple differences in miR and tRF expression between the four cell types and consequently identified novel cell-type markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR cell-type specificity may be regulated by quantitative trait loci located in cell-type-associated enhancer regions. We also report higher levels of 5'-tRNA halves in neurons compared to glia, including a particular neuronal enrichment of 5'-tRNA halves derived from glycine, leucine and lysine tRNAs. These neuronal tRFs were significantly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease postmortem brain samples compared to age-matched controls, possibly reflecting a neuronal response to disease. Our atlas, together with an accompanying statistical tool for miR cell-type enrichment analysis, provides a publicly available resource for delineating small RNA cell-type origin and function in the human brain.

Through a series of accidents and opportunities, and after priming in the graduate student environment of hippocampus and memory at Dalhousie University in the Department of Psychology, my work on the topic started at the University of Lethbridge, evaluating place navigation in Richard Morris' swimming pool task with Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw. We made a number of experimental and theoretical contributions, most important among these was the evaluation of the deficits caused by hippocampal damage on place learning and memory, recent versus remote memory, configural associations, and extensions to human memory. We describe some missteps and how we picked ourselves up and continued on.</p>

<p>This article is a personal history of the background, ideas, and motivations behind the major discoveries from my lab in the past 27 years. Tracing the main themes back to my training as a graduate student and a postdoc, I discuss how all of our work has been influenced by a desire to use anatomical and computational literature to inspire and constrain the experimental questions we have addressed. The backstory of two fundamental discoveries made in the early days on my independent research program are described: (a) differences between DG, CA3, and CA1 population dynamics in relation to computational theories of pattern separation and pattern completion and (b) differences in the types of information conveyed to the hippocampus from its lateral and medial entorhinal cortex inputs. Also described are how these initial findings set the foundation for numerous subsequent discoveries as we followed the data from one experiment to the next, with the goals of understanding how information is represented and transformed through the hippocampal formation in support of spatial learning and episodic memory.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the neurodevelopment and risk factors for impairment at age 5 to 6 years after acute provoked neonatal seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter study of neonates with acute provoked seizures. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence IV (WPPSI-IV), Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Scales, Behavior Assessment System for Children, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Social Responsiveness Scale, cerebral palsy (CP), and epilepsy were assessed at age 5 to 6 years. Latent class analysis defined outcome profiles. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to determine outcome predictors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We characterized 3 latent classes among 164 children: (1) Typical Development (63%); (2) Behavioral Dysregulation (13%; low likelihood of physical impairment or severely impaired cognition, high likelihood of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]); and (3) Multi-Domain Impairment (24%; high likelihood of epilepsy and impairment across all domains). Among 144 children with standardized testing, mean WPPSI-IV was 91 ± 25 and Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite 90 ± 20. Twenty-nine percent had ADHD or elevated attention/hyperactivity scores; 19% had autism or elevated Social Responsiveness scores; 20% had epilepsy, and 19% had CP. Risk factors for Multi-Domain Impairment were abnormal neonatal neurologic examination (odds ratio [OR] = 3.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.74–8.95), impaired functional development at age 24 months (OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.25–11.66), and CP (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.74–7.90). No neonatal or infant characteristics were significantly associated with Behavioral Dysregulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of 5 to 6-year-old children with provoked neonatal seizures had typical development. Yet, executive and behavioral dysregulation were prevalent, even with preserved cognitive and physical function. These findings can inform outcome discussions and interventions to promote neurodevelopment. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <p>by Tahereh Razmpour, Masoud Tabibian, Arman Roohi, Rajib Saha</p>

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, presenting significant clinical challenges due to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Understanding the metabolic reprogramming that drives this disease is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and improving patient outcomes. We developed a novel computational framework integrating genome-scale metabolic modeling with machine learning to identify metabolic signatures and therapeutic vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer. To address the inherent class imbalance in cancer datasets, we generated synthetic healthy samples using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty, implementing a rigorous three-step biological filtration process to ensure their validity. This approach enabled the creation of a balanced dataset for robust comparison of healthy versus cancerous metabolic states. Our machine learning classifier achieved 94.83% accuracy in distinguishing between these states, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Systems-level analysis revealed three key dysregulated pathways: heparan sulfate degradation, O-glycan metabolism, and heme degradation. We identified impaired lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed association between lysosomal storage disorders and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, nervonic acid transport emerged as the most discriminative reaction between healthy and cancerous states, with gene-level analysis highlighting fatty acid binding proteins, fatty acid transporters, and acyl-CoA synthetases as key molecular drivers of metabolic reprogramming. Our multi-level approach connected genetic drivers to functional metabolic consequences, revealing coordinated upregulation of fatty acid transport and activation processes. These findings enhance our understanding of pancreatic cancer metabolism and present potential therapeutic targets, demonstrating the value of integrated computational approaches in cancer research.

Motivation <p>The interaction between peptides and human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) molecules plays a pivotal role in adaptive immune responses, as HLA-II mediates the recognition of exogenous antigens and initiates T cell activation through peptide presentation. Accurate prediction of peptide-HLA-II binding serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular immune responses, and is essential for guiding the optimization of antibody therapeutics. Researchers have developed several computational approaches to identify peptide-HLA-II interaction and presentation. However, most computational approaches exhibit inconsistent predictive performance, poor generalization ability and limited biological interpretability.</p> Results <p>In this study, we present DSCA-HLAII, a novel predictive framework for peptide-HLA-II interactions and presentation based on a dual-stream cross-attention architecture. The framework proposes a dual-stream cross-attention (DSCA) mechanism to integrate pre-trained semantic embedding ESMC with sequence-level ONE-HOT features. The DSCA mechanism effectively models the interaction dynamics between peptides and HLA-II molecules, enabling the precise identification of key binding sites. Experimental results demonstrate that DSCA-HLAII consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness in predicting peptide-HLA-II interactions and presentation. We further demonstrate the capability of DSCA-HLAII for predicting peptide binding cores and assessing antibody immunogenicity, which is expected to advance artificial intelligence-based peptide drug discovery.</p>

                <p>by Yan Liu, Yu Xia, He Yan, Long-Chen Shen, Yiheng Zhu, Ji-Peng Qiang, Guo Wei</p>

Accurate cell type annotation is fundamental to single-cell analysis, yet remains challenging across heterogeneous datasets and modalities. In particular, transferring labels between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data poses unique difficulties due to discrepancies in sequencing protocols and feature spaces. Existing methods typically handle only a subset of these challenges, often requiring scenario-specific adjustments and offering limited interpretability. Here, we present CellPredX, a structurally unified but adaptively parameterized, semi-supervised cross-modality framework for label transfer across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and cross-protocol datasets. While maintaining a unified model architecture and optimization strategy, CellPredX allows adaptive tuning of loss-weight hyperparameters to account for the varying degree of similarity or discrepancy between different reference–query dataset pairs. CellPredX integrates domain adaptation and deep metric learning to align heterogeneous embeddings, and introduces a sparse center loss with an attention mechanism to enhance discriminative representations while suppressing noise. Moreover, an integrated interpreter module based on gradient attribution enables biological interpretability by identifying key markers and feature dimensions driving model predictions. Through extensive benchmarking across scRNA to scATAC, scATAC to scATAC, and scRNA to scRNA transfers, CellPredX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art annotation methods in both accuracy and robustness. The interpreter module further reveals biologically meaningful marker patterns that are consistent with known cell hierarchies. Together, these results demonstrate that CellPredX provides an interpretable and scalable solution for cross-modality cell type annotation in single-cell multi-omic integration.

<p>The hypothalamic projections to the mouse olfactory bulb include neurons that express orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone. The axon terminals of both neuron populations were found to overlap with vesicular glutamate transporter type 2.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The direct pathway from the lateral hypothalamus to the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) includes neurons that express the neuropeptide orexin-A and others that do not. The OB-projecting neurons that do not express orexin-A are located in an area of the lateral hypothalamus known to contain neurons that express the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). We used virally mediated anterograde tract tracing and immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and MCH to demonstrate that the OB is broadly innervated by axon projections from both populations of neurons with expression in each OB layer across the anterior-to-posterior axis and which overlapped with synaptophysin. Both orexin-A and MCH neurons are genetically heterogeneous, with subsets that co-express an isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We used confocal imaging to test whether the projections from orexin-A and MCH neurons to the OB reflect this glutamatergic heterogeneity. The majority of putative orexin-A axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with smaller proportions that co-expressed VGLUT1 or that did not overlap with either VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. In contrast, a smaller proportion of MCH axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with the majority being non-glutamatergic. Therefore, the projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the OB are genetically heterogeneous and include neurons that can release two different neuropeptides. The projections from orexin-A and MCH neuron populations are each genetically heterogeneous, with differing proportions of glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic axon terminals.</p>

                Background Astaxanthin, a red xanthophyll carotenoid, is a powerful antioxidant, anticancer, and glucose and lipid homeostasis regulator. Some pigmented yeasts belonging to the genus Rhodotorula, the well-known yeast for beta-carotene production, have been reported as natural astaxanthin producers. However, the lack of genomic data on astaxanthin-producing strains within these species hinders the identification of biosynthetic routes, molecular characterization of these pathways, and gene editing applications. Methods This study explored the diversity and astaxanthin production capability of cultivable pigmented yeast in flower samples. The astaxanthin production ability was inspected by three consecutive methods, including thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for the preliminary step, followed by quantitative spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for qualitative validation. The draft genome sequence and astaxanthin-producing genes of astaxanthin-producing yeasts were examined. Results Twelve of 23 yeasts from floral samples exhibited natural pigmentation, with colors ranging from pinkish-orange to red, and exhibited the potential for astaxanthin synthesis. These yeasts were Rhodotorula paludigena (three strains) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (nine strains). Among R. mucilaginosa strains, HL26-1 had the greatest astaxanthin content (104.98 ± 0.13 μg/g DCW) and yield (0.9280 ± 0.0012 mg/L). Strain LL69-1 has the greatest astaxanthin content (251.78 ± 0.27 μg/g DCW) and yield (1.8632 ± 0.0023 mg/L) among R. paludigena strains. The 18.78 Mbp R. mucilaginosa HL26-1 genome includes 5,711 protein-coding genes. Conversely, the R. paludigena LL69-1 genome was 20.99 Mbp, encompassing 6,782 predicted genes. A comprehensive investigation of draft genome sequences of these two strains identified CrtE, CrtYB, CrtI, CrtS, and CrtR as potential astaxanthin transcription genes. Conclusion Here, our results highlight the outstanding potential of two naturally pigmented yeasts, R. mucilaginosa HL26-1 and R. paludigena LL69-1, for astaxanthin production. Furthermore, our findings provide information on the whole genome and protein-encoded genes associated with astaxanthin production, which serve as valuable biological resources for various biotechnological applications.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Female urethral adenocarcinoma (FUA) is an exceptionally rare and aggressive malignancy, accounting for less than 0.02% of all cancers in women. Its nonspecific symptoms often lead to delayed diagnosis, with many cases detected at advanced stages. The rarity of FUA, particularly when presenting with a large mass, underscores the challenges in developing standardized treatment protocols. Case Presentation A 65-year-old woman presented with urinary retention. Clinical examination revealed a large mass obstructing the urethral orifice. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a malignant mass involving the entire length of urethra, with no signs of metastasis. Percutaneous cystostomy was performed, and cystoscopy through the cystostomy access revealed tumor infiltration into the anterior bladder wall, approximately 2 cm from the bladder neck. A radical urethrectomy with partial cystectomy and bladder outlet reconstruction was performed via a transurethral approach, with antegrade cystoscopy guidance. The bladder outlet was reconstructed using a segment of the anterior bladder wall to facilitate voiding through the orthotopic site with a Foley catheter. Pathology confirmed pT4 urethral adenocarcinoma with enteric subtype and clear surgical margins. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy was administered. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient was in continuous incontinence status. This condition is expected since the sphincter was also resected during the surgery as the tumor already infiltrated the anterior bladder. But with the use of silicone catheter, we can avoid any leak and patient still can void timely through regularly clamp catheter. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient reported satisfaction with her quality of life and showed no signs of recurrence or metastasis. Conclusion This case highlights the feasibility of bladder-preserving surgical techniques in giant FUA with bladder infiltration. The approach achieved oncological control while maintaining the patient’s quality of life. Bladder outlet reconstruction provided satisfactory functional outcomes and eliminated the need for suprapubic urinary diversion.

                Introduction Valentino’s Syndrome is a rare affliction caused by the perforation of a peptic ulcer which simulates deviously a picture of acute appendicitis. The diagnosis of this condition is not simple (often intraoperative) and requires a high degree of suspicion. Case presentation A 90-year-old man arrived at the Emergency Room with abdominal pain mainly localized in the right iliac fossa (Blumberg +, McBurney +). The patient had a history of previous perforated peptic ulcer treated with surgery. A diagnosis of suspected perforated acute appendicitis was made based on clinical and radiological findings and the patient underwent urgent surgical intervention. Laparoscopic exploration revealed a picture of diffuse choleperitonitis due to a probable perforation of a duodenal ulcer. Considering the patient’s age and the severity of the clinical and surgical picture, characterized by the presence of indissociable intra-abdominal adhesions, it was decided to forgo further surgical procedures, except drainage of the abdominal cavity and palliative medical treatment, due to a poor prognosis. Conclusion This syndrome, although very rare, should always be suspected in cases of right iliac fossa pain in the presence of certain risk factors for perforated peptic ulcer. Patient’s ethnicity: Italian.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled exoskeleton training on lower-limb functional recovery, psychological outcomes, and neural plasticity in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind pilot trial (ChiCTR2300074503) including 21 patients with SCI. Participants were randomized to a BCI-exoskeleton group (B + E, n = 10) or an exoskeleton-only group (E, n = 11) for lower-limb training. Both groups received conventional rehabilitation plus 30 minutes of training, 6 days per week, for 4 weeks. The primary outcomes were Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI II) scoring. Secondary outcomes included Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III (SCIM III), International Association of Neurorestoratology Spinal Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIFRS), 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Cortical plasticity was assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The B + E group showed a significant improvement in LEMS (<i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas both groups improved in IANR-SCIFRS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The B + E group demonstrated significant within-group gains in walking speed (10MWT, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and endurance (6MWT, <i>p</i> = 0.031), although between-group differences were not significant. Compared with the E group, the B + E group had larger reductions in HADS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.003). EEG analyses revealed stronger μ/β desynchronization and increased network efficiency, whereas MRI showed no structural changes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BCI-controlled exoskeleton training enhanced motor function, walking performance, and depressive symptoms more than exoskeleton training alone, likely through cortical reorganization. Extended training may further consolidate these benefits, supporting BCI-exoskeleton integration as a promising rehabilitation strategy for SCI. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Mangroves are ecosystems that link freshwater, land, and oceans. They are also home to vast biodiversity of species and provide vital resources to many coastal communities worldwide. However, in various parts of the world, these natural ecosystems have been subjected to anthropogenic actions that compromise their subsistence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse seasonal changes in vegetation cover in the La Caimanera marsh (Colombia) using remote sensing and satellite sensor imagery. Methodologically, machine learning techniques were used, including semi-supervised and supervised learning, using Landsat, Copernicus, and Planet images. The influence of mangrove vegetation cover on pollutants was explored using remote sensing data and in-situ measurements. The results obtained indicated that in 2015 and 2024, the ecosystem showed stability, with slight reductions in mangrove cover and water bodies. In contrast, a slight increase in urbanized areas was also evident. The NDWI, MNDWI, OC3, and QAA spectral indices were used to monitor water dynamics and water quality. The results reflected stability in water conditions between 2010 and 2020, with a slight reduction in 2023. The increase in chlorophyll-a and reduction in turbidity in 2023 showed alterations in water quality. In addition, the predominance of mature mangrove trees, which comprised 83% of the vegetation, is noteworthy, reflecting a healthy and stable ecosystem. The greater density and homogeneity of the mangrove canopy observed in this study suggests a positive ecosystem response and greater resilience to past environmental changes. It is concluded that the changes experienced by the La Caimanera marsh reflect a balance between conservation and development, highlighting the effectiveness of territorial management policies implemented to maintain the ecosystem’s resilience in the face of human pressures.

                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) has had a major impact on neuroscience. In this review I use LTP citations from PubMed and LTP publications from the Web of Science to analyze the fascinating history of research on LTP. Interest gradually grew from a prolonged delay after its discovery, to its meteoric rise and mature growth, and finally to a recent steep decline. While such rise and fall is not unique in science, the sharpness and magnitude of the swings in LTP are unusually dramatic. I discuss factors that contributed to each phase and point to key developments that led to the inflection points, at times using my own work as illustrations. I call attention to several factors that contributed to the decline in interest and conclude that LTP is to a great extent a victim of its own success. Much of the community now accepts that LTP and CaMKII are the cellular and molecular underpinning of memory. However, a broad shift toward “systems neurosciences” has deflected attention away from crucial cellular and molecular issues still unaddressed in LTP. This neglect is regrettable and unwarranted. Neuroscience doesn't have to choose between mechanisms and behavior, and I describe two somewhat overlooked examples where notable progress is being made in combining the two approaches. Countless exciting opportunities exist for further advances along these lines.</p>

                A recent comparative transcriptomics study by Liu et al. highlights that conserved neuronal identity and synaptic gene expression in the superior colliculus of mice, tree shrews, and humans coexist with species-specific differences in primary cilia. These findings indicate that conserved circuit architecture is accompanied with specializations in signaling compartments that modulate circuit function.

                Dereddi, Djannatian, and colleagues show that oligodendrocytes use mechanical cues to measure axon size. The stretch-activated channel TMEM63A converts membrane tension into calcium signals, which calibrate myelin sheath growth via MYO5A-dependent Mbp mRNA transport. Loss of TMEM63A causes mis-sizing of myelin sheaths and hypomyelination linked to transient infantile leukodystrophy.

Most of our understanding of HAND neuropathogenesis comes from studies of individuals with HIV-1 subtype B, which is responsible for a small proportion of global HIV-1 infections. By contrast, HIV-1 subtype C, which predominates in sub-Saharan Africa, affects many more people but remains poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of HAND at a global level.
