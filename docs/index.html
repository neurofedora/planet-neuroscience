                Background This study establishes a mathematically consistent and computational framework for the simultaneous identification of two time-dependent coefficients in a one-dimensional second-order parabolic partial differential equation. The considered problem is governed by nonlocal initial, boundary, and integral overdetermination conditions. Methods The direct problem is solved using the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method (FDM), which ensures unconditional stability and second-order accuracy in both spatial and temporal discretizations. The corresponding inverse problem is reformulated as a nonlinear regularized least-squares optimization problem and efficiently solved used the MATLAB subroutine lsqnonlin from the optimization Toolbox. Due to the intrinsic, ill-posedness of the inverse formulation, small input data errors lead to big output errors. Then, Tikhonov regularization, is employed to enhance numerical stability and robustness. Results Extensive numerical experiments are carried out under exact and noisy data to evaluate the numerical accuracy and convergence behavior of the method. The results confirm that the regularization technique effectively damps numerical oscillations, minimizes reconstruction error, and ensures reliable recovery of the unknown coefficients. Sensitivity analysis further reveals the essential role of the regularization parameter in controlling the trade-off between stability and accuracy. Conclusions The proposed approach provides an accurate and computationally efficient tool for IP in heat transfer, diffusion processes, and related applied sciences.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06994">SurfAge-Net: A Hierarchical Surface-Based Network for Interpretable Fine-Grained Brain Age Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain age prediction serves as a powerful framework for assessing brain status and detecting deviations associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. However, most existing approaches emphasize whole-brain age prediction and therefore overlook the pronounced regional heterogeneity of brain maturation that is crucial for detecting localized atypical trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose a novel spherical surface-based brain age prediction network (SurfAge-Net) that leverages multiple morphological metrics to capture region-specific developmental patterns with enhanced robustness and clinical interpretability. SurfAge-Net establishes a new modeling paradigm by incorporating the connectomic principles of cortical organization: it explicitly models both intra- and inter-hemispheric dependencies through a spatial-channel mixing and a lateralization-aware attention mechanism, enabling the network to characterize the coordinate maturation pattern uniquely associated with each target region. Validated on three fetal and neonatal datasets, SurfAge-Net outperforms existing approaches (global MAE = 0.54, regional MAE = 0.45 in gestational/postmenstrual weeks) and demonstrates strong generalizability across external cohorts. Importantly, it provides spatially precise and biologically interpretable maps of cortical maturation, effectively identifying heterogeneous delays and regional-specific abnormalities in atypical developmental populations. These results established fine-grained brain age prediction as a promising paradigm for advancing neurodevelopmental research and supporting early clinical assessment.

                arXiv:2602.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Declarative memory, the memory that can be "declared" in words or languages, is made up of two dissociated parts: episodic memory and semantic memory. This dissociation has its neuroanatomical basis episodic memory is mostly associated with the hippocampus and semantic memory with the neocortex. The two memories, on the other hand, are closely related. Lesions in the hippocampus often result in various impairments of explicit memory, e.g., anterograde, retrograde and developmental amnesias, and semantic learning deficit. These impairments provide opportunities for us to understand how the two memories may be acquired, stored and organized. This chapter reviews several cognitive systems that are centered to mimic explicit memory, and other systems that are neuroanatomically based and are implemented to simulate those memory impairments mentioned above. This review includes: the structures of the computational systems, their learning rules, and their simulations of memory acquisition and impairments.

                arXiv:2602.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How large language models (LLMs) align with the neural representation and computation of human language is a central question in cognitive science. Using representational geometry as a mechanistic lens, we addressed this by tracking entropy, curvature, and fMRI encoding scores throughout Pythia (70M-1B) training. We identified a geometric modularization where layers self-organize into stable low- and high-complexity clusters. The low-complexity module, characterized by reduced entropy and curvature, consistently better predicted human language network activity. This alignment followed heterogeneous spatial-temporal trajectories: rapid and stable in temporal regions (AntTemp, PostTemp), but delayed and dynamic in frontal areas (IFG, IFGorb). Crucially, reduced curvature remained a robust predictor of model-brain alignment even after controlling for training progress, an effect that strengthened with model scale. These results links training-driven geometric reorganization to temporal-frontal functional specialization, suggesting that representational smoothing facilitates neural-like linguistic processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07547">Linguistic properties and model scale in brain encoding: from small to compressed language models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that scaling large language models (LLMs) improves their alignment with human brain activity, yet it remains unclear what drives these gains and which representational properties are responsible. Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling.

                arXiv:2602.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how humans and artificial intelligence systems process complex narrative videos is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. This study investigates how the temporal context length of video clips (3--12 s clips) and the narrative-task prompting shape brain-model alignment during naturalistic movie watching. Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs.

                arXiv:2602.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human eye-hand coordination relies on internal forward models that predict future states and compensate for sensory delays. During line tracing, the gaze typically leads the hand through predictive saccades, yet the extent to which this predictive window reflects expertise or intrinsic individual traits remains unclear. In this study, I examined eye-hand coordination in professional calligraphers and non-experts performing a controlled line tracing task. The temporal coupling between saccade distance (SD) and pen speed (PS) revealed substantial interpersonal variability: SD-PS peak times ranged from approximately -50 to 400 ms, forming stable, participant-specific predictive windows that were consistent across trials. These predictive windows closely matched each individual's pen catch-up time, indicating that the oculomotor system stabilizes fixation in anticipation of the hand's future velocity rather than relying on reactive pursuit. Neither the spatial indices (mean gaze-pen distance, mean saccade distance) nor the temporal index (SD-PS peak time) differed between calligraphers and non-calligraphers, and none of these predictive parameters correlated with tracing accuracy. These findings suggest that diverse predictive strategies can achieve equivalent performance, consistent with the minimum intervention principle of optimal feedback control. Together, the results indicate that predictive timing in eye-hand coordination reflects a stable, idiosyncratic Predictive Protocol shaped by individual neuromotor constraints rather than by expertise or training history.

                arXiv:2602.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving advanced machine intelligence remains a central challenge in AI research, often approached through scaling neural architectures and generative models. However, biological systems offer a broader repertoire of strategies for adaptive, goal-directed behavior - strategies that emerged long before nervous systems evolved. This paper advocates a genuinely life-inspired approach to machine intelligence, drawing on principles from biology that enable robustness, autonomy, and open-ended problem-solving across scales. We frame intelligence as flexible problem-solving, following William James, and develop the concept of "cognitive light cones" to characterize the continuum of intelligence in living systems and machines. We argue that biological evolution has discovered a scalable recipe for intelligence - and the progressive expansion of organisms' "cognitive light cone", predictive and control capacities. To explain how this is possible, we distill five design principles - multiscale autonomy, growth through self-assemblage of active components, continuous reconstruction of capabilities, exploitation of physical and embodied constraints, and pervasive signaling enabling self-organization and top-down control from goals - that underpin life's ability to navigate creatively diverse problem spaces. We discuss how these principles contrast with current AI paradigms and outline pathways for integrating them into future autonomous, embodied, and resilient artificial systems.

                arXiv:2602.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the language-brain relationship requires bridging the methodological gap between the abstract theoretical frameworks of linguistics and the empirical neural data of neuroscience. Serving as an interdisciplinary cornerstone, computational neuroscience formalizes the hierarchical and dynamic structures of language into testable neural models through modeling, simulation, and data analysis. This enables a computational dialogue between linguistic hypotheses and neural mechanisms. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs), have powerfully advanced this pursuit. Their high-dimensional representational spaces provide a novel scale for exploring the neural basis of linguistic processing, while the "model-brain alignment" framework offers a methodology to evaluate the biological plausibility of language-related theories.

Abstract: Early clinical assessment of Alzheimer's disease relies on behavior scores that measure a subject's language, memory, and cognitive skills. On the medical imaging side, functional magnetic resonance imaging has provided invaluable insights into the neural pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease. While prior studies have used resting-state functional MRI by extracting functional connectivity matrices, these approaches neglect the temporal dynamics inherent in functional data. In this work, we present a deep state space modeling framework that directly leverages the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent time series to learn a sparse collection of brain regions to predict behavior scores. Our model extracts temporal features that encapsulate nuanced patterns of intrinsic brain activity, thereby enhancing predictive performance compared to traditional connectivity methods. We identify specific brain regions that are most predictive of cognitive impairment through experiments on data provided by the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, providing new insights into the neural substrates of early Alzheimer's pathology. These findings have important implications for the possible development of risk monitoring and intervention strategies in Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Neuroimaging studies of psychiatric disorders often correlate imaging patterns with diagnostic labels or composite symptom scores, yielding diffuse associations that obscure underlying mechanisms. We instead seek to identify root-causal maps -- localized BOLD disturbances that initiate pathological cascades -- and to link them selectively to symptom dimensions. We introduce a bilevel structural causal model that connects between-subject symptom structure to within-subject resting-state fMRI via independent latent sources with localized direct effects. Based on this model, we develop SOURCE (Symptom-Oriented Uncovering of Root-Causal Elements), a procedure that links interpretable symptom axes to a parsimonious set of localized drivers. Experiments show that SOURCE recovers localized maps consistent with root-causal BOLD drivers and increases interpretability and anatomical specificity relative to existing comparators.

                arXiv:2602.08640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal approximation theorems establish the expressive capacity of neural network architectures. For dynamical systems, existing results are limited to finite time horizons or systems with a globally stable equilibrium, leaving multistability and limit cycles unaddressed. We prove that Neural ODEs achieve $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness -- trajectories within error $\varepsilon$ except for initial conditions of measure $< \delta$ -- over the \emph{infinite} time horizon $[0,\infty)$ for three target classes: (1) Morse-Smale systems (a structurally stable class) with hyperbolic fixed points, (2) Morse-Smale systems with hyperbolic limit cycles via exact period matching, and (3) systems with normally hyperbolic continuous attractors via discretization. We further establish a temporal generalization bound: $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness implies $L^p$ error $\leq \varepsilon^p + \delta \cdot D^p$ for all $t \geq 0$, bridging topological guarantees to training metrics. These results provide the first universal approximation framework for multistable infinite-horizon dynamics.

                arXiv:2602.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional connectivity estimates are highly sensitive to analysis choices and can be dominated by noise when the number of sampled time points is small relative to network dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints. This strategy helps separate noise-driven artifacts from reproducible patterns of human brain variability.

                arXiv:2412.12112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic framework for developing computational models of biological neural systems. In this framework, physiological recordings are viewed as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying continuous-time stochastic dynamical system which implements computations through its state evolution. To model this dynamical system, we employ a system of coupled stochastic differential equations with differentiable drift and diffusion functions and use variational inference to infer its states and parameters. This formulation enables seamless integration of existing mathematical models in the literature, neural networks, or a hybrid of both to learn and compare different models. We demonstrate this in our framework by developing a generative model that combines coupled oscillators with neural networks to capture latent population dynamics from single-cell recordings. Evaluation across three neuroscience datasets spanning different species, brain regions, and behavioral tasks show that these hybrid models achieve competitive performance in predicting stimulus-evoked neural and behavioral responses compared to sophisticated black-box approaches while requiring an order of magnitude fewer parameters, providing uncertainty estimates, and offering a natural language for interpretation.

Abstract: Now published in Nature Communications DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69345-9
  Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting computational neuroscience research by enabling models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, because the stimuli of these datasets typically live within a common naturalistic visual distribution, they do not allow for strict out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization tests which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the same eight NSD participants for 284 synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, we provide a proof of principle that OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with the original NSD data; we demonstrate that the degree of OOD (quantified as the distance between a set of responses and the training data used for modeling) is predictive of the magnitude of model failures; and we show that less strict OOD generalization tests can can be usefully applied even within the domain of naturalistic stimuli. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.

                arXiv:2506.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal (IT) models have been shown to generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity, yet most prior evaluations focus on unimodal stimuli or non-instruction-tuned models under multimodal stimuli. We still lack a clear understanding of whether instruction-tuning is associated with IT-MLLMs organizing their representations around functional task demands or if they simply reflect surface semantics. To address this, we estimate brain alignment by predicting fMRI responses recorded during naturalistic movie watching (video with audio) from MLLM representations. Using instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio IT-MLLMs, across 13 video task instructions, we find that instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform in-context learning (ICL) multimodal models (~9%), non-instruction-tuned multimodal models (~15%), and unimodal baselines (~20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs across video and audio tasks, and language-guided probing produces distinct task-specific MLLM representations that vary across brain regions. We also find that ICL models show strong semantic organization (r=0.78), while IT models show weak coupling to instruction-text semantics (r=0.14), consistent with task-conditioned subspaces associated with higher brain alignment. These findings are consistent with an association between task-specific instructions and stronger brain-MLLM alignment, and open new avenues for mapping joint information processing in both systems. We make the code publicly available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

                arXiv:2511.22848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.

Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.

Abstract: Graph deep learning models, a class of AI-driven approaches employing a message aggregation mechanism, have gained popularity for analyzing the functional brain connectome in neuroimaging. However, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. In this study, we re-examine graph deep learning versus classical machine learning models based on four large-scale neuroimaging studies. Surprisingly, we find that the message aggregation mechanism, a hallmark of graph deep learning models, does not help with predictive performance as typically assumed, but rather consistently degrades it. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid model combining a linear model with a graph attention network through dual pathways, achieving robust predictions and enhanced interpretability by revealing both localized and global neural connectivity patterns. Our findings urge caution in adopting complex deep learning models for functional brain connectome analysis, emphasizing the need for rigorous experimental designs to establish tangible performance gains and perhaps more importantly, to pursue improvements in model interpretability.

                arXiv:2602.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling distributed dynamical systems governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to discontinuities and shocks that hinder the convergence of traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The recently proposed vanishing stacked residual PINN (VSR-PINN) embeds a vanishing-viscosity mechanism within stacked residual refinements to enable a smooth transition from the parabolic to hyperbolic regime. This paper integrates three curriculum-learning methods as primal-dual (PD) optimization, causality progression, and adaptive sampling into the VSR-PINN. The PD strategy balances physics and data losses, the causality scheme unlocks deeper stacks by respecting temporal and gradient evolution, and adaptive sampling targets high residuals. Numerical experiments on traffic reconstruction confirm that enforcing causality systematically reduces the median point-wise MSE and its variability across runs, yielding improvements of nearly one order of magnitude over non-causal training in both the baseline and PD variants.

Abstract: We study sample-efficient molecular optimization under a limited budget of oracle evaluations. We propose MolLIBRA (MultimOdaLity and Language Integrated Bayesian and evolutionaRy optimizAtion), a genetic algorithm based framework that pre-ranks candidate molecules using multiple critics before oracle calls: (i) an ensemble of Gaussian process (GP) surrogates defined over multiple molecular fingerprints and (ii) a pretrained text-molecule aligned encoder CLAMP. The GP ensemble enables adaptive selection of task-appropriate fingerprints, while CLAMP provides a zero-shot scoring signal from task descriptions by measuring the similarity between molecular and text embeddings. On the Practical Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark with a budget of 1,000 evaluations (PMO-1K), MolLIBRA-L, our variant with a language-model-based candidate generator, attains the best Top-10 AUC on 14/22 tasks and the highest overall sum of Top-10 AUC across tasks among prior methods.

                arXiv:2602.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks achieve strong performance on benchmark tasks but remain fundamentally brittle under perturbations, limiting their deployment in real-world settings. In contrast, biological nervous systems sustain reliable function across decades through homeostatic regulation coordinated across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by this principle, this presents Multi-Scale Temporal Homeostasis (MSTH), a biologically grounded framework that integrates ultra-fast (5-ms), fast (2-s), medium (5-min) and slow (1-hrs) regulation into artificial networks. MSTH implements the cross-scale coordination system for artificial neural networks, providing a unified temporal hierarchy that moves beyond superficial biomimicry. The cross-scale coordination enhances computational efficiency through evolutionary-refined optimization mechanisms. Experiments across molecular, graph and image classification benchmarks show that MSTH consistently improves accuracy, eliminates catastrophic failures and enhances recovery from perturbations. Moreover, MSTH outperforms both single-scale bio-inspired models and established state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating generality across diverse domains. These findings establish cross-scale temporal coordination as a core principle for stabilizing artificial neural systems, positioning MSTH as a foundation for building robust, resilient and biologically faithful intelligence.

                arXiv:2602.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rises, improving mechanistic insight from non-invasive biomarkers is increasingly critical. Recent work suggests that circuit-level brain alterations manifest as changes in electroencephalography (EEG) spectral features detectable by machine learning. However, conventional deep learning approaches for EEG-based AD detection are computationally intensive and mechanistically opaque. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and energy-efficient alternative, yet their application to AD diagnosis remains largely unexplored.
  We propose a neuro-bridge framework that links data-driven learning with minimal, biophysically grounded simulations, enabling bidirectional interpretation between machine learning signatures and circuit-level mechanisms in AD. Using resting-state clinical EEG, we train an SNN classifier that achieves competitive performance (AUC = 0.839) and identifies the aperiodic 1/f slope as a key discriminative marker.
  The 1/f slope reflects excitation-inhibition balance. To interpret this mechanistically, we construct spiking network simulations in which inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic ratios are systematically varied to emulate healthy, mild cognitive impairment, and AD-like states. Using both membrane potential-based and synaptic current-based EEG proxies, we reproduce empirical spectral slowing and altered alpha organization.
  Incorporating empirical functional connectivity priors into multi-subnetwork simulations further enhances spectral differentiation, demonstrating that large-scale network topology constrains EEG signatures more strongly than excitation-inhibition balance alone. Overall, this neuro-bridge approach connects SNN-based classification with interpretable circuit simulations, advancing mechanistic understanding of EEG biomarkers while enabling scalable, explainable AD detection.

                arXiv:2602.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty in biological neural systems appears to be computationally beneficial rather than detrimental. However, in neuromorphic computing systems, device variability often limits performance, including accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we propose a spiking Bayesian neural network (SBNN) framework that unifies the dynamic models of intrinsic device stochasticity (based on Magnetic Tunnel Junctions) and stochastic threshold neurons to leverage noise as a functional Bayesian resource. Experiments demonstrate that SBNN achieves high accuracy (99.16% on MNIST, 94.84% on CIFAR10) with 8-bit precision. Meanwhile rate estimation method provides a ~20-fold training speedup. Furthermore, SBNN exhibits superior robustness, showing a 67% accuracy improvement under synaptic weight noise and 12% under input noise compared to standard spiking neural networks. Crucially, hardware validation confirms that physical device implementation causes invisible accuracy and calibration loss compared to the algorithmic model. Converting device stochasticity into neuronal uncertainty offers a route to compact, energy-efficient neuromorphic computing under uncertainty.

                arXiv:2602.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility is an important requirement in evolutionary computation, where results largely depend on computational experiments. In practice, reproducibility relies on how algorithms, experimental protocols, and artifacts are documented and shared. Despite growing awareness, there is still limited empirical evidence on the actual reproducibility levels of published work in the field. In this paper, we study the reproducibility practices in papers published in the Evolutionary Combinatorial Optimization and Metaheuristics track of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference over a ten-year period. We introduce a structured reproducibility checklist and apply it through a systematic manual assessment of the selected corpus. In addition, we propose RECAP (REproducibility Checklist Automation Pipeline), an LLM-based system that automatically evaluates reproducibility signals from paper text and associated code repositories. Our analysis shows that papers achieve an average completeness score of 0.62, and that 36.90% of them provide additional material beyond the manuscript itself. We demonstrate that automated assessment is feasible: RECAP achieves substantial agreement with human evaluators (Cohen's k of 0.67). Together, these results highlight persistent gaps in reproducibility reporting and suggest that automated tools can effectively support large-scale, systematic monitoring of reproducibility practices.

                arXiv:2602.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a novel application of Evolutionary Computation to the domain of residential electric vehicle (EV) energy management. While reinforcement learning (RL) achieves high performance in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) optimization, it typically produces opaque "black-box" neural networks that are difficult for consumers and regulators to audit. Addressing this interpretability gap, we propose a program search framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent mutation operators within an iterative prompt-evaluation-repair loop. Utilizing the high-fidelity EV2Gym simulation environment as a fitness function, the system undergoes successive refinement cycles to synthesize executable Python policies that balance profit maximization, user comfort, and physical safety constraints. We benchmark four prompting strategies: Imitation, Reasoning, Hybrid and Runtime, evaluating their ability to discover adaptive control logic. Results demonstrate that the Hybrid strategy produces concise, human-readable heuristics that achieve 118% of the baseline profit, effectively discovering complex behaviors like anticipatory arbitrage and hysteresis without explicit programming. This work establishes LLM-driven Evolutionary Computation as a practical approach for generating EV charging control policies that are transparent, inspectable, and suitable for real residential deployment.

                arXiv:2602.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the microbiological safety of large, heterogeneous water distribution systems (WDS) typically requires managing appropriate levels of disinfectant residuals including chlorine. WDS include complex fluid interactions that are nonlinear and noisy, making such maintenance a challenging problem for traditional control algorithms. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to this problem based on neuroevolution, multi-objective optimization, and surrogate modeling. Neural networks were evolved with NEAT to inject chlorine at strategic locations in the distribution network at select times. NSGA-II was employed to optimize four objectives: minimizing the total amount of chlorine injected, keeping chlorine concentrations homogeneous across the network, ensuring that maximum concentrations did not exceed safe bounds, and distributing the injections regularly over time. Each network was evaluated against a surrogate model, i.e. a neural network trained to emulate EPANET, an industry-level hydraulic WDS simulator that is accurate but infeasible in terms of computational cost to support machine learning. The evolved controllers produced a diverse range of Pareto-optimal policies that could be implemented in practice, outperforming standard reinforcement learning methods such as PPO. The results thus suggest a pathway toward improving urban water systems, and highlight the potential of using evolution with surrogate modeling to optimize complex real-world systems.

                arXiv:2602.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates neural network design, improving efficiency over manual approaches. However, efficiently discovering high-performance neural network architectures that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in NAS. Existing methods often suffer from limited population diversity and inadequate exploration of the search space, particularly in regions with extreme complexity values. To address these challenges, we propose MOEA-BUS, an innovative multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on bi-population with uniform sampling for neural architecture search, aimed at simultaneously optimizing both accuracy and network complexity. In MOEA-BUS, a novel uniform sampling method is proposed to initialize the population, ensuring that architectures are distributed uniformly across the objective space. Furthermore, to enhance exploration, we deploy a bi-population framework where two populations evolve synergistically, facilitating comprehensive search space coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate MOEA-BUS's superiority, achieving top-1 accuracies of 98.39% on CIFAR-10, and 80.03% on ImageNet. Notably, it achieves 78.28% accuracy on ImageNet with only 446M MAdds. Ablation studies confirm that both uniform sampling and bi-population mechanisms enhance population diversity and performance. Additionally, in terms of the Kendall's tau coefficient, the SVM achieves an improvement of at least 0.035 compared to the other three commonly used machine learning models, and uniform sampling provided an enhancement of approximately 0.07.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of hybridizing a multi-modal Genetic Algorithm with a Graph Neural Network for timetabling optimization. The Graph Neural Network is designed to encapsulate general domain knowledge to improve schedule quality, while the Genetic Algorithm explores different regions of the search space and integrates the deep learning model as an enhancement operator to guide the solution search towards optimality. Initially, both components of the hybrid technique were designed, developed, and optimized independently to solve the tackled task. Multiple experiments were conducted on Staff Rostering, a well-known timetabling problem, to compare the proposed hybridization with the standalone optimized versions of the Genetic Algorithm and Graph Neural Network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybridization brings statistically significant improvements in both the time efficiency and solution quality metrics, compared to the standalone methods. To the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first hybridization of a Genetic Algorithm with a Graph Neural Network for solving timetabling problems.

                arXiv:2602.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving complex problems requires continuous effort in developing theory and practice to cope with larger, more difficult scenarios. Working with surrogates is normal for creating a proxy that realistically models the problem into the computer. Thus, the question of how to best define and characterize such a surrogate model is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we introduce the PTME methodology to study deep learning surrogates by analyzing their Precision, Time, Memory, and Energy consumption. We argue that only a combination of numerical and physical performance can lead to a surrogate that is both a trusted scientific substitute for the real problem and an efficient experimental artifact for scalable studies. Here, we propose different surrogates for a real problem in optimally organizing the network of traffic lights in European cities and perform a PTME study on the surrogates' sampling methods, dataset sizes, and resource consumption. We further use the built surrogates in new optimization metaheuristics for decision-making in real cities. We offer better techniques and conclude that the PTME methodology can be used as a guideline for other applications and solvers.

                arXiv:2602.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological signals remains challenging due to their non-stationary, noisy, and subject-dependent characteristics. This work presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive application of liquid neural networks for EEG-based emotion recognition. The proposed multimodal framework combines convolutional feature extraction, liquid neural networks with learnable time constants, and attention-guided fusion to model temporal EEG dynamics with complementary peripheral physiological and personality features. Dedicated subnetworks are used to process EEG features and auxiliary modalities, and a shared autoencoder-based fusion module is used to learn discriminative latent representations before classification. Subject-dependent experiments conducted on the PhyMER dataset across seven emotional classes achieve an accuracy of 95.45%, surpassing previously reported results. Furthermore, temporal attention analysis provides interpretable insights into emotion-specific temporal relevance, and t-SNE visualizations demonstrate enhanced class separability, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, statistical analysis of temporal dynamics confirms that the network self-organizes into distinct functional groups with specialized fast and slow neurons, proving it independently tunes learnable time constants and memory dominance to effectively capture complex emotion artifacts.

                arXiv:2602.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems employ multi-stage pipelines consisting of object detection networks followed by separate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules, introducing compounding errors, increased latency, and architectural complexity. This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.

                arXiv:2602.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is a biologically plausible alternative to standard backpropagation (BP) that minimises an energy function with respect to network activities before updating weights. Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs.

                arXiv:2602.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a critical analytical technique for molecular identification across metabolomics, environmental chemistry, and chemical forensics. A variety of computational methods have emerged for structural annotation of spectral features of interest, but many of these features cannot be confidently annotated with reference structures or spectra. Here, we introduce FOAM (Formula-constrained Optimization for Annotating Metabolites), a computational workflow that poses structure elucidation from LC-MS/MS as an iterative optimization problem. FOAM couples a formula-constrained graph genetic algorithm with spectral simulation to explore candidate annotations given an experimental spectrum. We demonstrate FOAM's performance on the NIST'20 and MassSpecGym datasets as both a standalone elucidation pipeline and as a complement to existing inverse models. This work establishes iterative optimization as an effective and extensible paradigm for structural elucidation.

                arXiv:2602.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their use for numerical computation has received less attention. We study the approximation of matrix functions, which map scalar functions to matrices, using neural networks including transformers. We focus on functions mapping square matrices to square matrices of the same dimension. These types of matrix functions appear throughout scientific computing, e.g., the matrix exponential in continuous-time Markov chains and the matrix sign function in stability analysis of dynamical systems. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we prove bounds on the width and depth of ReLU networks needed to approximate the matrix exponential to an arbitrary precision. Second, we show experimentally that a transformer encoder-decoder with suitable numerical encodings can approximate certain matrix functions at a relative error of 5% with high probability. Our study reveals that the encoding scheme strongly affects performance, with different schemes working better for different functions.

                arXiv:2602.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of shallow physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving forward and inverse problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). By reformulating PINNs as nonlinear systems, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is employed to efficiently optimize the network parameters. Analytical expressions for the neural network derivatives with respect to the input variables are derived, enabling accurate and efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix required by LM. The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Burgers, Schr\"odinger, Allen-Cahn, and three-dimensional Bratu equations. Numerical results demonstrate that LM significantly outperforms BFGS in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and final loss values, even when using shallow network architectures with only two hidden layers. These findings indicate that, for a wide class of PDEs, shallow PINNs combined with efficient second-order optimization methods can provide accurate and computationally efficient solutions for both forward and inverse problems.

                arXiv:2602.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regression neural networks (NNs) are most commonly trained by minimizing the mean squared prediction error, which is highly sensitive to outliers and data contamination. Existing robust training methods for regression NNs are often limited in scope and rely primarily on empirical validation, with only a few offering partial theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new robust learning framework for regression NNs based on the $\beta$-divergence (also known as the density power divergence) which we call `rRNet'. It applies to a broad class of regression NNs, including models with non-smooth activation functions and error densities, and recovers the classical maximum likelihood learning as a special case. The rRNet is implemented via an alternating optimization scheme, for which we establish convergence guarantees to stationary points under mild, verifiable conditions. The (local) robustness of rRNet is theoretically characterized through the influence functions of both the parameter estimates and the resulting rRNet predictor, which are shown to be bounded for suitable choices of the tuning parameter $\beta$, depending on the error density. We further prove that rRNet attains the optimal 50\% asymptotic breakdown point at the assumed model for all $\beta\in(0, 1]$, providing a strong global robustness guarantee that is largely absent for existing NN learning methods. Our theoretical results are complemented by simulation experiments and real-data analyses, illustrating practical advantages of rRNet over existing approaches in both function approximation problems and prediction tasks with noisy observations.

                arXiv:2211.15386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), regarded as the third generation of neural networks, emulate the brain's information processing with unparalleled biological plausibility compared to traditional neural networks. However, their non-linear, event-driven dynamics pose significant challenges for training, and existing methods often deviate from neuroscientific principles of cortical learning. Drawing inspiration from predictive coding theory-a leading model of brain information processing-we propose PC-SNN, a novel learning framework that integrates predictive coding with SNNs to enable biologically plausible, local Hebbian plasticity without reliance on backpropagation. Unlike conventional SNN training approaches, PC-SNN leverages only local computations, aligning with the brain's distributed processing and overcoming the biological implausibility of global error propagation. Our classification model achieves competitive performance on the benchmark datasets, including Caltech Face/Motorbike, MNIST, and CIFAR10, surpassing state-of-the-art multi-layer SNNs. Furthermore, our predictive coding-based regression model outperforms backpropagation-based methods while adhering to local plasticity constraints, offering a scalable and biologically grounded alternative for SNN training. PC-SNN drives progress in neuromorphic computing through validating the adaptability of bio-inspired algorithms within spiking neural architectures, but also unveils novel understandings of neurocognitive learning processes, presenting a conceptual framework distinguished by its theoretical originality and functional efficacy.

Abstract: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has been highly effective in black-box continuous optimization, as demonstrated by its success in both benchmark problems and various real-world applications. To address the need for an accessible and powerful tool in this domain, we developed cmaes, a simple and practical Python library for CMA-ES. cmaes is characterized by its simplicity, offering intuitive use and high code readability. This makes it suitable for quick use of CMA-ES, as well as for educational purposes and seamless integration into other libraries. Despite its simple design, cmaes maintains advanced functionality. It incorporates recent advancements in CMA-ES, such as learning rate adaptation for challenging scenarios, transfer learning, mixed-variable optimization, and multi-objective optimization capabilities. These advanced features are accessible through a user-friendly API, ensuring that cmaes can be easily adopted in practical applications. We present cmaes as a strong candidate for a practical Python CMA-ES library aimed at practitioners.

                arXiv:2510.09391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hybrid Genetic Optimisation framework (HYGO) is introduced to meet the pressing need for efficient and unified optimisation frameworks that support both parametric and functional learning in complex engineering problems. Evolutionary algorithms are widely employed as derivative-free global optimisation methods but often suffer from slow convergence rates, especially during late-stage learning. HYGO integrates the global exploration capabilities of evolutionary algorithms with accelerated local search for robust solution refinement. The key enabler is a two-stage strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. For parametric problems, HYGO alternates between genetic algorithm and targeted improvement through a degeneracy-proof Dowhill Simplex Method (DSM). For function optimisation tasks, HYGO rotates between genetic programming and DSM. Validation is performed on (a) parametric optimisation benchmarks, where HYGO demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than standard genetic algorithms, and (b) function optimisation tasks, including control of a damped Landau oscillator. Practical relevance is showcased through aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, achieving consistently interpretable results and reductions exceeding 20% by controlled jet injection in the back of the body for flow reattachment and separation bubble reduction. Overall, HYGO emerges as a versatile hybrid optimisation framework suitable for a broad spectrum of engineering and scientific problems involving parametric and functional learning.

                arXiv:2601.21475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handcrafted optimizers become prohibitively inefficient for complex black-box optimization (BBO) tasks. MetaBBO addresses this challenge by meta-learning to automatically configure optimizers for low-level BBO tasks, thereby eliminating heuristic dependencies. However, existing methods typically require extensive handcrafted training tasks to learn meta-strategies that generalize to target tasks, which poses a critical limitation for realistic applications with unknown task distributions. To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization. This paradigm shift enables zero-shot optimization: ABOM achieves competitive performance on synthetic BBO benchmarks and realistic unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problems without any handcrafted training tasks. Visualization studies reveal that parameterized evolutionary operators exhibit statistically significant search patterns, including natural selection and genetic recombination.

Abstract: This paper presents a principled framework for designing energy-aware metaheuristics that operate under fixed energy budgets. We introduce a unified operator-level model that quantifies both numerical gain and energy usage, and define a robust Expected Improvement per Joule (EI/J) score that guides adaptive selection among operator variants during the search. The resulting energy-aware solvers dynamically choose between operators to self-control exploration and exploitation, aiming to maximize fitness gain under limited energy. We instantiate this framework with three representative metaheuristics - steady-state GA, PSO, and ILS - each equipped with both lightweight and heavy operator variants. Experiments on three heterogeneous combinatorial problems (Knapsack, NK-landscapes, and Error-Correcting Codes) show that the energy-aware variants consistently reach comparable fitness while requiring substantially less energy than their non-energy-aware baselines. EI/J values stabilize early and yield clear operator-selection patterns, with each solver reliably self-identifying the most improvement-per-Joule - efficient operator across problems.

                arXiv:2602.06610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing real-world optimization challenges requires not only advanced metaheuristics but also continuous refinement of their internal mechanisms. This paper explores the integration of machine learning in the form of neural surrogate models into metaheuristics through a recent lens: energy consumption. While surrogates are widely used to reduce the computational cost of expensive objective functions, their combined impact on energy efficiency, algorithmic performance, and solution accuracy remains largely unquantified. We provide a critical investigation into this intersection, aiming to advance the design of energy-aware, surrogate-assisted search algorithms. Our experiments reveal substantial benefits: employing a state-of-the-art pre-trained surrogate can reduce energy consumption by up to 98\%, execution time by approximately 98%, and memory usage by around 99\%. Moreover, increasing the training dataset size further enhances these gains by lowering the per-use computational cost, while static pre-training versus continuous (iterative) retraining have relatively different advantages depending on whether we aim at time/energy or accuracy and general cost across problems, respectively. Surrogates also have a negative impact on costs and accuracy at times, and then they cannot be blindly adopted. These findings support a more holistic approach to surrogate-assisted optimization, integrating energy with time and predictive accuracy into performance assessments.

Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function that enables us to learn to avoid danger via reinforcement learning (RL). While many researchers have argued that fear has evolved to escape predators, how varying predatory pressures have shaped fear and other rewards, including positive social rewards for collective grouping, remains an open question. In this study, we investigate the relationship between predatory pressure and fear using an evolutionary simulation of RL agents with evolving rewards. In our simulation, prey and predator RL agents co-evolve their reward functions, including visual rewards for observing prey and predators. While fear-like negative visual rewards for predators often evolved in prey, we also observed cases in which positive rewards for both predators and prey evolved, the latter serving as a social reward for collective grouping. A comparison between different environmental conditions revealed that stronger predator hunting capability promoted stronger fear reward, while less food supply promoted more negative social reward. Moreover, fear did not evolve in response to static pitfalls with non-lethal damage, suggesting that actively hunting predators played an important role in its evolution. These results highlight the special role of predators in the diverse evolution of fear and social rewards.

                arXiv:2508.13333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation (EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and superior query efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/Challenger-XJTU/HiFo-Prompt.

                arXiv:2509.24372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks is an essential stage of modern AI deployment. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the dominant fine-tuning paradigm, underpinning many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES) has largely been overlooked due to the widespread belief that it does not scale to modern model sizes. This paper overturns this assumption by demonstrating the first successful application of ES to full-parameter fine-tuning of LLMs at the billion-parameter scale, without dimensionality reduction. ES can indeed search over extremely high-dimensional parameter spaces and outperform established RL implementations across multiple axes, including improved tolerance to long-horizon and delayed rewards, robustness across diverse base LLMs, reduced susceptibility to reward hacking, and improved training stability. These findings suggest that ES is not merely a viable alternative to RL, but a fundamentally different and powerful backpropagation-free post-training paradigm that opens a new direction for LLM fine-tuning beyond current RL-based approaches.

                arXiv:2510.26718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption. This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based optimizer, was used to determine the best-performing jet actuation parameters in an experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately 8.8%. The best-performing control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

                arXiv:2511.05540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper challenges a prevailing epistemological assumption in End-to-End Autonomous Driving: that high-performance planning necessitates high-fidelity world reconstruction. Inspired by cognitive science, we propose the Mental Bayesian Causal World Model (MBCWM) and instantiate it as the Tokenized Intent World Model (TIWM), a novel cognitive computing architecture. Its core philosophy posits that intelligence emerges not from pixel-level objective fidelity, but from the Cognitive Consistency between the agent's internal intentional world and physical reality. By synthesizing von Uexk\"ull's $\textit{Umwelt}$ theory, the neural assembly hypothesis, and the triple causal model (integrating symbolic deduction, probabilistic induction, and force dynamics) into an end-to-end embodied planning system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this paradigm on the nuPlan benchmark. Experimental results in open-loop validation confirm that our Belief-Intent Co-Evolution mechanism effectively enhances planning performance. Crucially, in closed-loop simulations, the system exhibits emergent human-like cognitive behaviors, including map affordance understanding, free exploration, and self-recovery strategies. We identify Cognitive Consistency as the core learning mechanism: during long-term training, belief (state understanding) and intent (future prediction) spontaneously form a self-organizing equilibrium through implicit computational replay, achieving semantic alignment between internal representations and physical world affordances. TIWM offers a neuro-symbolic, cognition-first alternative to reconstruction-based planners, establishing a new direction: planning as active understanding, not passive reaction.

                This study employs a meta-analytic approach to synthesize empirical evidence on the psychological and behavioral determinants of fast fashion consumption. Integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with brand-related constructs—perceived scarcity, perceived quality, and self-congruity—this research examines how these factors shape consumer attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, consumption intentions, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth. Using studies published between 2004 and 2024, a random-effects meta-analysis reveals that brand attitude is the strongest predictor of purchase intention, while self-congruity with fashion brands significantly enhances all TPB components. Perceived quality exerts a cross-cutting influence on both cognitive and social evaluations, reinforcing the multidimensional nature of consumer judgments. The findings extend the TPB framework by embedding symbolic and perceptual brand dimensions, offering a more comprehensive explanatory model of fashion consumption. From a managerial perspective, the results suggest that marketing strategies emphasizing authentic scarcity cues and alignment with consumers’ self-identity can strengthen emotional attachment, perceived control, and loyalty. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for designing culturally sensitive and identity-driven branding strategies in the fast fashion sector.

                This study maps global research trends on creative pathways in the development of scientific literacy in higher education during the period 2020–2024. The study is grounded in the growing demand for graduates who are not only scientifically literate but also capable of creative, critical, and interdisciplinary thinking in response to rapid transformations in 21st-century education. A bibliometric-based Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was employed, utilizing Publish or Perish and VOSviewer as the main analytical tools. Data were retrieved from the Google Scholar database and limited to peer-reviewed publications published between 2020 and 2024. The analysis included keyword co-occurrence mapping, temporal publication trends, and geographic and institutional contribution analysis, supported by Microsoft Excel and NVivo 14 for data classification and thematic synthesis. The results indicate a steady growth in publications addressing creative approaches to scientific literacy, with a marked increase in both publication volume and citation impact in 2023–2024. Major contributions originated from the United Kingdom, the United States, India, Indonesia, and Spain. Dominant conceptual clusters were formed around keywords such as creative thinking, scientific literacy, higher education, and educational technology. Bibliometric visualizations further reveal strong linkages between creative pathways, digital transformation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and reflective learning practices. By integrating bibliometric analysis with spatial and temporal mapping, this study provides a structured overview of the evolving research landscape. The findings offer valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers seeking evidence-based directions for advancing innovation in scientific literacy within higher education.

                Background The genus Betta (family Osphronemidae) comprises over 70 species, many of which are endemic to Southeast Asia and highly vulnerable to habitat loss. While Betta splendens is well studied due to its importance in the ornamental fish trade, most wild Betta species remain poorly characterized, particularly at the genomic level. The Bangka Islands of Indonesia harbor several endemic Betta species threatened by peatland degradation. Methods We conducted an integrated meristic and genomic comparison of three endemic Bangka Island species—Betta burdigala, B. chloropharynx, and B. schalleri. Specimens were collected from peatland waters in Bangka, and meristic traits were examined to confirm diagnostic characteristics. High-molecular-weight DNA was extracted and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore PromethION technology, followed by de novo assembly and reference-guided scaffolding using the Betta splendens genome. Results The meristic analysis confirmed features consistent with their taxonomic placement within the coccina, waseri, and pugnax groups. Genome assembljies were highly contiguous and complete (BUSCO >97%), with B. chloropharynx showing the largest genome size, highest scaffold N50, and elevated retrotransposon content. Gene duplication analysis revealed dispersed duplications as the dominant category across all genomes, with variation in tandem and proximal duplicates. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated high collinearity, with B. chloropharynx and B. schalleri showing the closest relationship, while B. burdigala diverged earlier. The Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor A (CSF1RA) protein phylogenetic tree closely resembles the phylogenetic tree of nine fish species based on NCBI taxonomic data. We also identified two massive protein insertions in the CSF1RA of B. burdigala. Conclusions This study provides morphological and genomic evidence supporting the distinctiveness of Bangka’s endemic Betta species and delivers essential genomic resources for evolutionary research and conservation of these endangered freshwater fishes.

                Background While ivermectin is a common antiparasitic drug used in veterinary medicine, the effects of repeated administration at therapeutic doses have not been well studied. Of particular interest is the impact of ivermectin on electrolyte balance, blood biochemistry, and oxidation-related markers in rabbits, as these animals are known to be sensitive to drug-related metabolic disturbances and side effects. Methods A total of 10 clinically healthy adult male rabbits (1.5-2 kg) were randomly assigned to a control group with no treatment or to a treatment group receiving ivermectin subcutaneously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg once weekly for 30 days. The animals were housed in the physiological laboratory of the University of Fallujah under controlled environmental conditions. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected, and serum was analyzed for electrolytes, biochemical and oxidative markers, and liver enzyme activity using established laboratory methods. Results Repeated administration of ivermectin caused a statistically significant increase in potassium, sodium, chloride, and phosphate concentrations (P≤0.05) compared with baseline, while calcium and magnesium levels remained unchanged. Glucose, total protein, creatinine, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels increased statistically significantly (P≤0.05) compared with the control group, while albumin concentration decreased. Oxidative stress indicators showed increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity were also noted. Conclusions Repeated administration of ivermectin at therapeutic doses at short intervals causes disturbance in blood electrolyte balance, biochemical profile, and antioxidant system in rabbits, and may also negatively impact liver and kidney functions. These results indicate the need for cautions use of the drug, preferably limited to single administration at long intervals, to minimize the risk of side effects.

                In this review, we critically examine how e-leadership and workforce digital skills interact to enhance healthcare performance in post-COVID settings within emerging economies, addressing a knowledge gap concerning the joint influence of leadership behaviours and employee competencies on organisational outcomes in resource-constrained contexts. We anchored this review on the Upper Echelons Theory, which emphasises that leaders’ characteristics and cognitive frames shape strategic decisions, and the Technology-Organisation-Environment framework, which highlights the interplay of technological, organisational, and environmental factors in digital adoption. Employing a qualitative thematic review of empirical studies published between 2020 and 2025 and sourced from databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar, our review synthesises evidence on effective digital transformation strategies in healthcare. Our findings indicate that strategic e-leadership combined with workforce digital competence significantly improves efficiency, quality of care, innovation, remote collaboration, and organisational resilience. Successful interventions identified include digital dashboards, telehealth platforms, cloud-based patient management systems, and structured training programs, demonstrating the importance of aligning leadership vision, staff capability, and organisational resources. Persistent challenges encompass uneven distribution of digital skills among healthcare staff, limited assessment of leadership competence, infrastructural constraints, and insufficient longitudinal evidence on the sustainability and scalability of digital initiatives. Our review concludes that coordinated integration of leadership, workforce skills, and supportive organisational and technological infrastructures is essential for achieving resilient healthcare services. Policy implications involve institutionalising digital leadership frameworks, promoting continuous professional development, and investing in interoperable digital systems. Theoretical contributions reinforce the combined application of Upper Echelons and Technology-Organisation-Environment frameworks in explaining digital performance, while empirical contributions provide contextualised evidence of effective strategies and interventions. This review offers guidance for healthcare organisations, policymakers, and researchers seeking to enhance post-pandemic digital healthcare performance in emerging economies, emphasising the critical role of leadership, workforce capability, and organisational readiness in achieving sustainable outcomes.

                The Iraqi economy’s performance is impacted by the rivalry between public and private investment, which raises the country’s debt and reduces private investment, which in turn slows economic growth. As a result, the subject of crowding out is closely tied to both the public and private sectors and how they affect the country’s economy. To determine whether financial crowding out has occurred and whether there is a reciprocal relationship between government credit and private credit, this research focused on confirming the existence of financial crowding out through the levels of government credit and private credit in Iraq. Imbalances in the dynamic term of the agreement result in the long-term achievement of the difference, and the existence of integration implies the existence of a different economic connection. In both the short and long terms, there was a considerable inverse relationship between government credit and private credit, according to trends and conventional tests like the direction of the error limit mitigation (VECM) and (Wald). Due to the rise in government credit at the expense of private credit in the Iraqi economy, it produces outcomes that are comparable to those of a crowding-out model for financial credit.

                Abstract* This paper presents a new probability distribution known as the “Neutrosophic New Odd Weibull-Weibull Distribution (NNOWW)” by combining the proposed New Odd Weibull-Weibull (NOWW) distribution with the neutrosophic logic (the direct method of this logic). The distribution is presented in two theoretical frameworks. The derivation of several main distribution functions, along with their properties, is presented, accompanied by both theoretical and graphical representations of these properties. Parameters are estimated using three different methods, with Monte Carlo simulations conducted for various sample sizes to determine the estimation efficiency and the most suitable sample size for applying the distribution to real data. An applied framework tests its efficiency on real data representing the heart rate of 50 patients. The model was developed within this logic framework to define truth, falsity, and uncertainty in the data. The model was compared with five other neutrosophic distributions using criteria such as AIC, BIC, CAIC, and HQIC. The results showed a clear superiority of the NNOWW model across all indicators, confirming its accuracy and ability to represent uncertain data. Analytical graphs support this superiority. This model is recommended for use in medical fields and for analyzing Neutrosophic data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-221/v1?src=rss">Torsional Performance of Square CFDST Beams before and after Fire Exposure: Effect of Outer Tube Thickness [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Before and after being exposed to fire, concrete-filled double-skin steel tubular (CFDST) beams were tested. Six square beams with outer tube thicknesses of 1.3, 1.7, and 2.6 mm were made and then put through pure torsion until they broke. Half of the samples were tested in normal conditions, and the other half were tested after being exposed to the ISO 834 standard fire for 90 minutes. The results showed that all the beams had stable and ductile torque–rotation behavior up to about 55° of twist, and there was no sign of brittle failure. After the heating and cooling cycles, the beams still had most of their torsional rigidity. The stiffness values were about two-thirds to nine-tenths of what they were before the fire. It was noted that making the outer steel wall thicker helped the beams keep more of their stiffness after being exposed to fire. The thicker walls clearly made the section less likely to lose torsional strength, which shows that wall thickness has a big effect on how things behave after a fire. The results showed that CFDST beams could still safely handle torsional loads after being in a fire. Because of this, they are good for use in bridge beams, transfer beams, and building cores, where both fire resistance and torsional strength are needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-220/v1?src=rss">Decoding Decisions: Personality-Interest Motivational Sequences as Predictors of Career Paths [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research on personality and vocational interests has reached a plateau, with correlations stabilising around r ≈ .48. This plateau occurs because dominant models, such as Holland’s RIASEC (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) theory, treat interests as fixed matches to environments, rather than as dynamic outcomes of an individual’s psychology. This study introduces the Personality-Interest Motivational Sequences (PIMS) framework, which reinterprets vocational interests as emergent properties of facet-level personality trait configurations. Methods We analysed data from 504 final-year South African university students assessed with the Townsend Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and the O*NET Interest Profiler. A multinomial logistic regression model, trained on a subset of 404 participants and tested on a holdout set of 100, was used to predict primary RIASEC categories from 30 TPQ facet-level traits. Results The PIMS model predicted primary RIASEC categories with 60.0% accuracy, substantially exceeding the chance level of 16.7%. Investigative interests were predicted most effectively, with distinct facet-level sequences identified for this and other types. For example, an Investigative profile was characterised by low Resilience and Sociability facets coupled with high Thrill-seeking and Competence. Notably, the model found no single, consistent personality profile for Social interests, which reveals potential heterogeneity within this RIASEC category. Conclusions The findings support the PIMS framework, demonstrating that vocational interests are systematic outcomes of facet-level personality architecture. This moves the field from describing static correlations to modelling generative psychological mechanisms. The framework provides a foundation for moving beyond typological matching towards dynamic, personalised career pathwaying.

                Background Phacoemulsification is one of the most frequent surgeries in the world. However, prolonged use of phacoemulsification machines produces reactive oxygen species which will damage corneal endothelial cells. Ascorbic acid has an antioxidant capacity to neutralize oxidative stress in the anterior chamber. This study will investigate the protective effect of ascorbic acid on corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nuclear cataracts. Methods This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Samples will be divided into three groups, and 500 mg of vitamin C, tid, or placebo will be received for seven weeks. Clinical characteristics, ascorbic acid, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity of patients in serum and aqueous humor will be measured before and after intervention and phacoemulsification. Conclusions Data from this study will reveal the protective effect of oral vitamin C supplementation on the corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nucleus cataracts. This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT06781970; registered on 17 January 2025).

                Background This study examines the influence of auxiliary lighting configurations and artificial surface textures on the quality of 3D models generated using Structure from Motion (SfM) in an indoor laboratory setting. Method Experiments were conducted by capturing images of concrete, metal, and wooden specimens at a one-meter distance. Various lighting setups, including vertical and adjacent auxiliary lighting models, were tested to determine their impact on model accuracy. In addition, complex artificial textures, such as checkerboard patterns, were applied to the specimens to assess their effect on 3D model precision. Results Our results demonstrate that optimal lighting and artificial textures significantly enhance the accuracy of 3D models, especially for materials with uniform textures, such as painted metal. For materials with more varied textures, such as concrete and wood, improvements were notable but less pronounced. The combination of auxiliary lighting and artificial textures improved model quality by approximately 40% for high-texture materials and up to 60% for uniform-texture materials. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of image file formats in the SfM process. While RAW images stored in TIFF format offered a slight advantage over lossless JPEG in terms of model accuracy, the difference may not be substantial enough to justify the larger file size in situations where submillimeter precision is not required. Conclusions Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of tailored lighting and texturing strategies for achieving high-precision 3D models in SfM applications. These results are particularly relevant for structural testing and other applications that demand high-fidelity 3D reconstructions, providing a foundation for more accurate and reliable models.

She studied the diving physiology of emperor penguins in Antarctica and elephant seals in Northern California during her Ph.D., and she worked with high-flying bar-headed geese during her postdoctoral research. As an astronaut, she has extensive experience developing, teaching, coordinating and performing biology experiments in space or equivalent reduced-gravity settings. Dr. Meir will serve as spacecraft commander for NASA’s SpaceX Crew-12 mission, which will launch to the ISS in February 2026 for another science expedition. In this Q&A, she discusses her passion for biology and the value of conducting scientific research in space.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98283">Sex peptide targets distinct higher order processing neurons in the brain to induce the female post-mating response</a></h4>

              
                Sex peptide (SP) transferred during mating induces female post-mating responses including refractoriness to re-mate and increased oviposition in <i>Drosophila</i>. Yet, where SP-target neurons reside remained uncertain. Here, we show that expression of membrane-tethered SP (mSP) predominantly in the head or trunk either reduces receptivity or increases oviposition, respectively. Using fragments from large regulatory regions of <i>Sex Peptide Receptor</i>, <i>fruitless,</i> and <i>doublesex</i> genes together with intersectional expression of mSP, we identified distinct interneurons in the brain and abdominal ganglion controlling receptivity and oviposition. These SP response-inducing neurons (SPRINz) can induce post-mating responses through SP received by mating. Trans-synaptic mapping of neuronal connections reveals input from sensory processing neurons and two post-synaptic trajectories as output. Hence, SP-target neurons operate as key integrators of sensory information for decision-making of behavioural outputs. Multi-modularity of SP-targets further allows females to adjust SP-mediated male manipulation to physiological state and environmental conditions for maximising reproductive success.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-219/v1?src=rss">The Role of Organizational Capital Agility in Enhancing Organizational Performance: Mediating Effects of Transformational Leadership, Organizational Culture, and HRM Practices [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In an increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment, organizations are required to continuously adapt their intangible resources to sustain performance. While prior studies have emphasized the roles of transformational leadership, organizational culture, and human resource management (HRM) practices in enhancing organizational performance, limited attention has been given to the mechanisms through which these resources are transformed into dynamic capabilities. Methods This study employed a quantitative research design using survey data collected from 263 managers and supervisors of regional banks in Indonesia. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS was applied to examine the direct and indirect relationships among transformational leadership, organizational culture, HRM practices, organizational capital agility, and organizational performance. Mediation effects were tested using bootstrapping procedures to assess the significance of indirect relationships. Results The findings reveal that transformational leadership and organizational culture have significant positive effects on both organizational capital agility and organizational performance. Organizational capital agility was found to strongly influence organizational performance and significantly mediate the relationships between transformational leadership and performance, as well as between organizational culture and performance. In contrast, while HRM practices directly enhance organizational performance, they do not have a significant effect on organizational capital agility, nor is their impact on performance mediated by OCA. Conclusions This study highlights Organizational Capital Agility as a key dynamic capability that translates leadership and cultural resources into improved organizational performance. The results extend the Resource-Based View and Dynamic Capability Theory by demonstrating the mediating role of agility in resource transformation processes. Practically, the findings suggest that banking institutions should prioritize the development of transformational leadership and adaptive organizational cultures to foster agility, while aligning HRM practices with broader agility-oriented strategies to sustain performance in turbulent environments.

Recent advancements in computational pathology have greatly improved automated histopathological analysis. A compelling question in the field is how morphological traits are associated with genetic characteristics or molecular phenotypes. Here we propose TEMI, a novel framework for molecular subtype classification of cancers using whole-slide images (WSIs), augmented with transcriptomic data during training. TEMI aims to extract molecular-level signals from WSIs and make efficient use of available multimodal data. To this end, TEMI introduces a patch fusion network that captures dependencies among local patches of gigapixel WSIs to produce global representations and aligns them with transcriptomic embeddings attained from a masked transcriptomic autoencoder. TEMI achieves superior performance compared with existing methods in molecular subtype classification, owing to its effective integration of transcriptomic information achieved by the two developed alignment strategies. Guided by discriminative transcriptomic data, TEMI learns invariant WSI representations, while morphological features also enhance gene expression prediction. These findings suggest that histological features encode latent molecular signals, highlighting the interplay between the tumor microenvironment and cancer transcriptomics. Our study demonstrates how multimodal learning can bridge morphology and molecular biology, providing an effective tool to advance precision medicine.

Transposon Sequencing (Tn-Seq) is a high-throughput technique that utilizes transposon mutant libraries to assess gene fitness or essentiality under specific conditions potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets. However, the diversity of statistical methods, bioinformatics tools, and parameters complicates the selection of the most appropriate and reliable analysis pipeline for a given dataset. A significant limitation of existing studies is the absence of a gold-standard set of essential genes (EGs) for evaluating the analysis process. Relying on the original study as a gold-standard is suboptimal, as these results may have been obtained using non-optimal tools. Here, we introduce reliable EG datasets for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> to enhance Tn-Seq analyses. By utilizing literature data and sequencing of six samples from PA14 Wild-Type (WT) and PA14 OprD-deficient (Δ<i>oprD</i>), grown in LB medium, we compared EG lists generated by several statistical methods of TRANSIT2 and by the FiTnEss tools. We established a reference dataset of 84 genes found in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and another gold-standard set composed of 115 genes specific to PA14 grown in LB. Our findings revealed that depending on the analysis method used, retrieval rates of gold-standard genes ranged from 0% to 100%. The Hidden-Markov Model (HMM) method available in TRANSIT2 identified approximately 90% of gold-standard EGs, while FiTnEss identified up to 100%. This study addressed a critical gap in the field by providing gold-standard sets of EGs, enabling comparative evaluation of Tn-Seq analysis methods to help researcher select the most suitable bioinformatics pipeline for a given Tn-Seq dataset. We anticipate that our results will facilitate Tn-Seq analysis comparisons, harmonize <i>P. aeruginosa</i>-related studies, promote standardization and enhance reproducibility. Ultimately, this will lead to more reliable identification of EGs and potential therapeutic targets in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, advancing our understanding of this important pathogen.

                <p>by Alicia Lou, Mónica Chagoyen, Juan F. Poyatos</p>

It is widely acknowledged that development shapes phenotypes, yet the extent to which genes with similar expression patterns during development lead to equivalent organismal phenotypes when mutated remains unclear. Here, we propose addressing this issue, which we term the 𝒟evelopment–to–𝒫henotype, or 𝒟–𝒫, rule, by leveraging single-cell gene expression atlases and phenotypic ontologies, using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model system. This framework quantifies the proportionality between developmental expression and phenotypic similarities, demonstrating that the relationship holds on average. Genes that strongly fulfill the rule exhibit broad “housekeeping” expression and are associated with systemic phenotypes, whereas weak similarities correspond to specific expression patterns and specialized phenotypes. Deviations from the 𝒟–𝒫 rule provide insights into developmental divergence and phenotypic degeneracy, highlighting genes with narrow functional roles but systemic phenotypic impact. Furthermore, genes that closely adhere to the rule exhibit the highest pleiotropic impact on organismal traits. Our analysis also identifies cell types, such as ASK neurons, as key mediators of phenotype-specific gene contributions, exemplified by their association with chemosensory behavior and chemotaxis. These findings validate the 𝒟–𝒫 rule and underscore the role of cells as critical mediators of the genotype-phenotype map, offering a unified framework to understand the developmental origins of phenotypic complexity.

Protein language models (PLMs) pretrained via a masked language modeling objective have proven effective across a range of structure-related tasks, including high-resolution structure prediction. However, it remains unclear to what extent these models factorize protein structural categories among their learned parameters. In this work, we introduce trainable subnetworks, which mask out the PLM weights responsible for language modeling performance on a structural category of proteins. We systematically trained 39 PLM subnetworks targeting both sequence- and residue-level features at varying degrees of resolution using annotations defined by the CATH taxonomy and secondary structure elements. Using these PLM subnetworks, we assessed how structural factorization in PLMs influences downstream structure prediction. Our results show that PLMs are highly sensitive to sequence-level features and can predominantly disentangle extremely coarse or fine-grained information. Furthermore, we observe that structure prediction is highly responsive to factorized PLM representations and that small changes in language modeling performance can significantly impair PLM-based structure prediction capabilities. Our work presents a framework for studying feature entanglement within pretrained PLMs and can be leveraged to improve the alignment of learned PLM representations with known biological concepts.

Zimin words are words that have the same prefix and suffix. They are unavoidable patterns, with all sufficiently large strings encompassing them. Here, we examine for the first time the presence of k-mers not containing any Zimin patterns, defined hereafter as Zimin avoidmers, in the human genome. We report that in the reference human genome all k-mers above 104 base-pairs contain Zimin words. We find that Zimin avoidmers are most enriched in coding and Human Satellite 1 regions in the human genome. Zimin avoidmers display a depletion of germline insertions and deletions relative to surrounding genomic areas. We also apply our methodology in the genomes of another eight model organisms from all three domains of life, finding large differences in their Zimin avoidmer frequencies and their genomic localization preferences. We observe that Zimin avoidmers exhibit the highest genomic density in prokaryotic organisms, with <i>E. coli</i> showing particularly high levels, while the lowest density is found in eukaryotic organisms, with <i>D. rerio</i> having the lowest. Among the studied genomes the longest k-mer length at which Zimin avoidmers are observed is that of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> at k-mer length of 115 base-pairs. We conclude that Zimin avoidmers display inhomogeneous distributions in organismal genomes, have intricate properties including lower insertion and deletion rates, and disappear faster than the theoretical expected k-mer length, across the organismal genomes studied.

                <p>by Xincheng Gao, Yanchao Yu, Jiayin Sun, Huayuan Zhao, Yongqiang You, Xin Shi, Kang Wang, Sijia Hong, Xing Xiong, Chao Huang, Hui Zhang, Guosong Jiang</p>

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are capable of specifically targeting and eliminating malignant tumor cells, but tumor cells can develop resistance mechanisms to escape CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated killing. Here, we performed a whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen under CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells pressure and identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL5 as an essential factor required for escaping CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells killing in bladder cancer cells. We found that CUL5 knockout promoted the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated killing both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CUL5 loss reduced the ubiquitination of PTBP1, which regulated alternative splicing of RUBCN pre-mRNA and led to an increase in the levels of the RUBCN-S isoform, thereby preventing immune evasion of bladder cancer cells by inhibiting autophagy. Importantly, CUL5 knockout significantly enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in a xenograft model. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of bladder cancer immune evasion, providing potential targets for cancer immunotherapy.

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory skin disease with diverse clinical presentations, often overlapping with other dermatoses. Its diagnosis remains largely dependent on clinical expertise, leading to variability and limited diagnostic accuracy, particularly among general practitioners. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates lesion image analysis and structured anamnesis to improve AD diagnosis. Methods This diagnostic study was conducted in two phases: Phase 1 used retrospective data from 2021–2024, and Phase 2 involved prospective external validation from multiple hospitals in 2025. Patients with AD or related skin conditions were included, with diagnoses based on AAD 2014 criteria. Multimodal fusion combined ResNet50-extracted image features and MPNet-based anamnesis text features using a late fusion model. This approach mimics clinical reasoning by integrating visual and contextual clinical information to classify cases as AD or non-AD. Results and Discussion The multimodal AI model integrating ResNet50 (image) and MPNet (anamnesis) achieved 98.28% accuracy in classifying AD vs non-AD, outperforming image-or text-only models. It offers clinical advantages by mimicking physician reasoning, improving diagnostic consistency, reducing subjectivity, and enabling mass triage. However, real-world generalizability remains a challenge due to limited training diversity, potential language constraints (Bahasa Indonesia), and narrow differential diagnoses. External validation and explainable AI (XAI) are critical for broader application. Despite limitations, the model aligns with emerging literature, showing multimodal AI can approach or surpass expert-level performance in dermatological diagnosis when rigorously validated. Conclusions The multimodal ResNet50-MPNet model shows near-perfect accuracy in diagnosing AD by mimicking clinician reasoning. It offers consistent, holistic assessment but requires external validation and improved interpretability for clinical adoption. Continued AI-clinician collaboration is vital to translating this promising technology into real-world dermatological care.

                Fixed-point iterative methods play a fundamental role in nonlinear analysis and its applications. They provides a unified framework for establishing existence and uniqueness results for a wide class of nonlinear problems. In this paper, working in a real uniformly convex Banach space, we propose an accelerated four-step iterative scheme for approximating fixed-point of a class of mapping known as total asymptotically nonexpansive TAN-mappings. Weak and strong convergence results for proposed algorithm are established. The weak convergence analysis is obtained under Opial’s condition, while the strong convergence results require in addition a semi-compactness assumption on the underlying mapping. Furthermore, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and to compare its performance with existing iterative methods. The obtained results extend and refine several recent contributions in the literature. Finally, an application to two-dimensional equations is provided.

                The most typical bacterial species that may be associated with infections of the eye are Staphylococcus because they normally reside on the skin and eyelid margins; therefore, an easy transmission to the eye can take place whenever there is a lesion or abrasion. Apart from this, these bacteria have several virulence factors among which include adhesin and biofilm forming capacity which enhance their resistance against treatment. In addition, mecA gene carries resistance determinant against methicillin as well as many other β-lactam antibiotics. The current study was designed to characterize the factors and molecular mechanisms that facilitate pathogenicity and therapeutic resistance in these bacteria. A total of one hundred samples were obtained from patients who had visited Samarra General Hospital during the period extending from October 2024 to December 2024. As per the results of culture, all isolates were Gram-positive, and forty-nine belonged to the genus Staphylococcus. Amongst these, Staphylococcus aureus was the major species followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis and some other isolates. All isolates showed 100% resistance to Methicillin. They were sensitive to Vancomycin. Other antibiotics expressed variable sensitivity patterns among the isolates. The five isolates that expressed the highest levels of antibiotic resistance were selected, and one was excluded during analysis. All the remaining isolates, being coagulase-negative staphylococci, were tested for mecA, icaA, and tetK genes. The molecular results showed that all four tested isolates carried the mecA gene (100%), and only one isolate carried the icaA and tetK genes, hence its high level of antibiotic resistance.

                Objectives Comprehensive educational supervision is essential for ensuring quality teaching, fostering professional development, and supporting institutional capacity building. However, its implementation encounters numerous structural, technical, and human resource challenges. This study aimed to identify, validate, rank, and cluster the technical barriers affecting comprehensive educational supervision in Amanat Al Asimah, Yemen. This aligns with national reform goals by offering strategic insights to improve supervisory systems, thereby enhancing teaching quality, institutional performance, and educational resilience in fragile contexts Methods This study employed a three-phase mixed-methods approach. Initially, a literature review identified 11 key barriers to effective supervision. These were validated using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM), involving 16 experienced educational supervisors to assess the consensus and suitability of the items. Subsequently, a quantitative survey targeting 370 teachers was conducted to evaluate their perceived severity. Fuzzy set theory was used to aggregate and defuzzify the responses, generating crisp scores for prioritization. Finally, K-means clustering was applied to segment the barriers based on their impacts. Results FDM analysis confirmed the validity of all 11 identified barriers, with a domain-level threshold of 0.093 and an average expert consensus of 89.77%, indicating strong agreement. The fuzzy set-based evaluation highlighted three top-priority challenges: weak supervisory competencies, limited ability to develop effective supervisory plans, and poor supervisor-teacher relationships. K-means clustering grouped the barriers into three segments: one high-priority barrier, seven moderate-priority concerns, and three low-priority issues. Notably, weak supervisory competencies emerged as the most critical barrier, isolated in a high-priority cluster. Conclusion These findings provide evidence-based guidance for policy and strategic interventions aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of supervision systems in fragile educational settings. The study concludes with recommendations for strengthening supervisory competencies, improving resource allocation, and fostering trust-based supervisor-teacher relationships, thereby contributing to the quality of education and institutional resilience in Yemen.

                Neutrosophic crisp sets are an important and recent topic that has entered both pure and applied mathematics, especially general topology. A neutrosophic crisp topological space is defined as a generalization of classical topology in a broad sense, without specifying the type of neutrosophic crisp family or the algebraic operations of union and intersection, in addition to the kind of complement and the kinds of inclusion. In this research on the neutrosophic crisp topological space, we constructed such a space in which the intersection is fixed as Type I, the union as Type II, and the complement as Type II for all kinds of neutrosophic crisp families, and we considered the two kinds of inclusion. Within this framework, we defined two kinds of closure for a neutrosophic crisp set and two kinds of interior for a neutrosophic crisp set. We studied all relations, results, and theorems from general topology on them, as well as the properties related to them and the relationship between the closure and the interior of a neutrosophic crisp set. We proved all relations, results, and theorems that hold and gave examples of those that do not; however, many properties failed to hold. We also defined continuity in the constructed neutrosophic crisp topological space and proved all corresponding relations, results, and theorems in topology that hold, while providing examples of those that do not hold.

                Shoulder dislocation of the posterior variety is a rare condition, representing less than 2% of all dislocation types of the Shoulder Joint. During the acute presentation of posterior shoulder dislocation, the rate of misdiagnosis is high 50%-80% because acute posterior shoulder dislocation is not diagnosed during the initial presentation. The causes of this high rate of misdiagnosis are a lack of clarity regarding the signs of this type of dislocation and inadequate radiological assessment. A delayed diagnosis can result in painful and stiff shoulders, leading to chronic shoulder dislocation. The resulting decrease in joint motion and loss of many activities, instability, recurrent shoulder dislocation, and delay in diagnosis may result in Osteoarthritis or AVN of the humeral head. The chronicity of posterior shoulder dislocation may necessitate a complex surgical procedure for reduction with an unpredictable rate of success. The purpose of this case series was to clarify the difficulties in the diagnosis and management of chronic posterior shoulder dislocation by presenting three cases of posterior shoulder dislocation from the Orthopaedic Department at Fallujah Teaching Hospital in Iraq.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-214/v1?src=rss">Assessing Key Delay Causes in Residential Investment Projects Using Fuzzy AHP and Risk Matrix [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Residential investment projects play a vital economic and social role in Iraq; however, delays are a persistent problem that negatively affects project performance. Identifying and prioritizing the main causes of delay is challenging due to uncertainty and differences in expert judgment. Therefore, a systematic quantitative approach is required to evaluate these causes and their associated risks. Methods This study aimed to identify, classify, and prioritize the causes of delay in residential investment projects in Iraq. A questionnaire survey was conducted with experts specializing in residential projects. Fifteen main delay causes were identified and grouped into three categories: general causes, project parties–related causes, and resource-related causes. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied to determine the relative importance weights of the delay causes under uncertainty. The degree of delay risk for each cause was calculated by combining its relative weight with the probability of occurrence and impact. Results The results indicated that, within the general causes category, management-related and political causes were the most significant, each accounting for 14.6%. In the project parties–related category, owner-related causes had the highest importance, with a relative weight of 50.6%. For the resource-related category, labor-related causes were found to be the most influential, with a relative importance of 61.2%. The risk assessment highlighted variations in delay severity depending on both uncertainty and impact levels. Conclusions The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process in prioritizing delay causes under uncertainty in residential investment projects. The proposed framework supports decision-makers in identifying critical delay factors, improving risk management, and reducing delays in future residential projects in Iraq.

                Background Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a severe obstetric condition characterized by abnormal placental trophoblast invasion into the myometrium, leading to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. While imaging remains the cornerstone of prenatal diagnosis, limitations in sensitivity and availability necessitate the exploration of adjunctive biomarkers. Dysregulation of angiogenic pathways has been implicated in PAS pathogenesis. To evaluate maternal serum levels of angiogenic biomarkers—placental growth factor (PlGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)—and to compare their expression between PAS and normal pregnancies. Methods This prospective case–control study was conducted at RSUP Dr. M. Djamil Padang between March and November 2025. Eighty-eight pregnant women were enrolled, comprising 44 PAS cases and 44 gestational age–matched controls with normal placentation. Maternal serum samples were collected at 32–34 weeks of gestation and analyzed for PlGF, VEGF, and sFlt-1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Demographic, obstetric, ultrasound, laboratory, and neonatal data were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results Maternal demographic characteristics, fetal biometric parameters, neonatal outcomes, and baseline biochemical profiles were comparable between groups. Median maternal serum PlGF and VEGF levels were significantly lower in the PAS group compared with controls (PlGF: 3.825.660 vs 4.086.680 pg/mL, p = 0.032; VEGF: 8.713.645 vs 12.524.675 pg/mL, p = 0.008). Although sFlt-1 levels showed a decreasing trend in PAS cases, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.102). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.114). Conclusion PAS is associated with significant reductions in maternal serum PlGF and VEGF, reflecting angiogenic dysregulation and abnormal placental invasion. These biomarkers may serve as complementary tools to imaging modalities for improving prenatal detection of PAS. Larger studies are warranted to validate their clinical utility and integration into diagnostic algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-212/v1?src=rss">Choroid Plexus Tumors: Insights from a 13-Year Single-Institution Series [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are rare intraventricular neoplasms with diverse clinical and histopathological features. Their variable presentation and surgical challenges, particularly in pediatric patients, make detailed institutional experiences valuable for guiding management and understanding outcomes. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for CPTs at the Neurosurgery Department of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2023. Clinical, radiological, surgical, histopathological, and outcome data were analyzed. Imaging included CT and MRI; histopathology assessed cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic activity, necrosis, and immunohistochemistry. Surgical approach, cerebrospinal fluid diversion, perioperative complications, adjuvant therapy, and long-term outcomes were recorded. Results Seven patients were included (median age 2 years, range 2 months–28 years; 5 females). Histology revealed four choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) and three choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs). Tumor locations were lateral ventricles (n=5), third ventricle (n=1), and fourth ventricle/CPA (n=1). Gross total resection was achieved in all CPPs, with favorable long-term outcomes and minimal morbidity. CPCs were more vascular and complex to resect; one patient died intraoperatively, another shortly postoperatively, and the third developed severe postoperative complications before adjuvant therapy. Ki-67 indices ranged from <1% in CPPs to 40% in CPCs. CSF diversion was required in two patients. Conclusions CPTs demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in presentation, histology, and outcomes. Complete surgical resection is associated with excellent prognosis in CPPs, whereas CPCs present greater surgical and postoperative challenges. This series underscores the importance of early diagnosis, careful surgical planning, and multidisciplinary management to optimize outcomes across the CPT spectrum.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109308">Accessibility of the unstructured α-tubulin C-terminal tail is controlled by microtubule lattice conformation</a></h4>

              
                Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that self-assemble from the protein tubulin, a heterodimer of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, and are important for cell mechanics, migration, and division. Much work has focused on how the nucleotide state of β-tubulin regulates the structure and dynamics of microtubules. In contrast, less is known about the structure and function of the C-terminal tails (CTTs) of α- and β-tubulin which are thought to freely protrude from the surface of the microtubule. To study the CTT of α-tubulin, we developed three different biosensors that bind the tyrosinated α-tubulin CTT (Y-αCTT). Surprisingly, live imaging of the probes indicates that the Y-αCTT is minimally accessible along the microtubule lattice under normal cellular conditions. Lattice binding of the Y-αCTT probes can be increased by three different ways of changing the tubulin conformational state: the drug Taxol, expression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that recognize or promote an expanded tubulin conformation, or expression of tubulin that cannot hydrolyze GTP. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Y-αCTT undergoes numerous transient interactions with the bodies of α-tubulin and β-tubulin in the lattice, and that the frequency of these interactions is regulated by the tubulin nucleotide state. These findings suggest that accessibility of the Y-αCTT is locally governed by nucleotide- and MAP-dependent conformational changes to tubulin subunits within the microtubule lattice.

Despite their interconnections, distinct transcription factors have been reported to orchestrate each tissue’s developmental and regenerative processes. Here, using adult mouse skeletal muscles, we show that <i>Scx</i> expression is not detectable in adult muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells, SCs) during quiescence. <i>Scx</i> expression begins in activated SCs and continues throughout regenerative myogenesis after injury. By SC-specific <i>Scx</i> gene inactivation (<i>Scx</i> cKO), we show that <i>Scx</i> function is required for SC expansion/renewal and robust new myofiber formation after injury. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and CUT&amp;RUN to identify direct Scx target genes during muscle regeneration. These target genes help explain the muscle regeneration defects of <i>Scx</i> cKO and are not overlapping with <i>Scx</i>-target genes identified in tendon development. Together with a recent finding of a subpopulation of <i>Scx</i>-expressing connective tissue fibroblasts with myogenic potential during early embryogenesis, we propose that regenerative and developmental myogenesis co-opt the <i>Scx</i> gene via different mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106040">In vivo autofluorescence lifetime imaging of spatial metabolic heterogeneities and learning-induced changes in the Drosophila mushroom body</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal energy regulation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor underlying brain functions and their pathological alterations, yet the metabolic dynamics that accompany cognitive processes remain poorly understood. As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of coenzymes NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H) offers the possibility to resolve cellular metabolic profiles with high spatial precision. However, NAD(P)H FLIM’s capacity to detect subtle variations in neuronal metabolism has not been demonstrated. In this study, we applied NAD(P)H FLIM to map the metabolic profiles of <i>Drosophila</i> neurons in vivo across multiple scales, focusing on the primary centers for associative memory: the mushroom bodies (MBs). At a broad scale, we obtained an overview of the metabolic signatures of the main brain tissue and identified a marked difference between neuropil and cortex areas. At a finer scale, our findings revealed notable heterogeneity in the basal metabolic profiles of distinct MB neuron subtypes. Measurements performed after associative olfactory learning also uncovered a low-magnitude subtype-specific metabolic shift associated with memory formation, suggesting the utility of NAD(P)H FLIM in detecting physiology-driven changes linked to brain function. These results establish a promising framework for studying the spatial heterogeneities and the dynamics of cerebral energy metabolism in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106270">Mouse sensorimotor cortex reflects complex kinematic details during reaching and grasping</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated forelimb actions, such as reaching and grasping, rely on motor commands that span a spectrum from abstract target selection to detailed instantaneous muscle control. The sensorimotor cortex is central to controlling these complex movements, yet how the detailed command signals are distributed across its numerous subregions remains unclear. In particular, in mice, it is unknown if the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices represent low-level joint angle details in addition to high-level signals like movement direction. Here, we combine high-quality markerless tracking and two-photon imaging during a reach-to-grasp task to quantify movement-related activity in the mouse forelimb M1 (M1-fl) and forelimb S1 (S1-fl). Linear decoding models reveal a strong representation of proximal and distal joint angles in both areas, and both areas support joint angle decoding with comparable fidelity. Despite shared low-level encoding, the time course of high-level target-specific information varied across areas. M1-fl exhibited early onset and sustained encoding of target-specific signals, while S1-fl was more transiently modulated around lift onset. These results reveal both shared and unique contributions of M1-fl and S1-fl to reaching and grasping, implicating a more distributed cortical circuit for mouse forelimb control than has been previously considered.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103016">Citalopram exhibits immune-dependent anti-tumor effects by modulating C5aR1+ TAMs</a></h4>

              
                Administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with a reduced cancer risk and shows significant anti-tumor effects across multiple tumor types, suggesting the potential for repurposing SSRIs in cancer therapy. Nonetheless, the specific molecular target and mechanism of action of SSRIs remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we reveal that citalopram exerts an immune-dependent anti-tumor effect in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, the anti-HCC effects of citalopram are not reliant on its conventional target, the serotonin transporter. Through various drug repurposing approaches, including global reverse gene expression profiling, drug affinity responsive target stability assay, and molecular docking, the complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) is identified as a new target of citalopram. C5aR1 is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages, and citalopram treatment enhances local macrophage phagocytosis and elicits CD8<sup>+</sup> T anti-tumor immunity. C5aR1 deficiency or depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells hinders the anti-HCC effects of citalopram. Collectively, our study reveals the immunomodulatory roles of citalopram in inducing anti-tumor immunity and provides a basis for considering the repurposing of SSRIs as promising anticancer agents for HCC treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106156">Aggregation-dependent epitope sequence and modification fingerprints of anti-Aβ antibodies</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides across distinct brain regions. Anti-Aβ antibodies (Aβ-Abs) targeting specific Aβ variants are essential tools for AD research, diagnostics, and therapy. The monoclonal antibodies Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab have recently been approved as the first disease-modifying treatments for early AD, highlighting the clinical importance of their exact binding profiles. In this study, we systematically characterized the binding and modification requirements of 20 Aβ-Abs, including biosimilars of Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab, across monomeric, oligomeric, and aggregated Aβ forms. Array-based analysis of 20,000 modified Aβ peptides defined binding epitopes at single-residue resolution and revealed the impact of sequence variation, including familial AD mutations, as well as diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs). Notably, genetic variants, such as H6R, impaired binding of therapeutic Aβ-Abs like Aducanumab. Donanemab showed strong preference for pyroglutamate-modified AβpE3–17, while Lecanemab and Aducanumab exhibited aggregation- and sequence-context-dependent binding requirements. Comparison of peptide binding profiles with binding of full-length and aggregated Aβ via immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, capillary immunoassays, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry on AD brain tissue revealed distinct aggregation-dependent binding behaviours. The valency- and context-dependence of Aducanumab binding, together with its preference for Ser8-phosphorylated Aβ, supports a dimerization-mediated binding mechanism. For Lecanemab, our data suggest that additional structural contributions beyond the minimal N-terminal epitope are required for binding to aggregated Aβ, which remain to be fully resolved. Together, this work provides the most comprehensive dataset to date on aggregation-dependent sequence and modification selectivity of Aβ-Abs. By integrating mutational, PTM, and aggregation contexts in a unified experimental framework, we establish a resource that enables rational selection of antibodies for research and diagnostic applications and offers mechanistic insights that may inform the design and optimization of future therapeutic antibodies in AD.

">Between- and Within-subject Variability in Actigraphy Data: A Case Study on Sleep Patterns in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Variability in longitudinal health outcomes provides critical insight into disease dynamics, yet most statistical analyses continue to prioritize mean trajectories. This limitation is particularly consequential in psychiatric and mobile health (mHealth) research, where intensive repeated measurements increasingly reveal pronounced heterogeneity and temporal instability that cannot be captured by average responses alone. Standard mixed-effects models typically impose homoscedastic variance assumptions and relegate variability to a nuisance component, despite mounting evidence that both variability information, at both between- and within-subject level, carry independent clinical significance. Here, we describe an improved mixed-effects location-scale model for longitudinal outcomes that simultaneously characterizes mean structure, between-subject heterogeneity, and within-subject fluctuations. The proposed framework explicitly links variance components to both time-invariant and time-varying covariates, extending classical mixed-effects models to accommodate heteroscedastic and dynamically evolving variability. By jointly modeling location and scale parameters, the method enables direct inference on variability (or stability) of the data alongside mean trends. We evaluated the approach using an actigraphy-based mHealth case study of sleep patterns in schizophrenia. Our results demonstrate that explicitly modeling variability uncovers clinically relevant structure obscured by mean-based analyses, underscoring the importance of variability-aware modeling for modern longitudinal and mHealth research.

">The role of Fragile X in the control of vertebrate spinal cord networks</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and the leading monogenic cause of autism, resulting from mutations in the Fmr1 gene. While extensive research points to widespread circuit hyperexcitability across cortical and subcortical circuits, the contribution of the spinal cord circuits in the motor phenotypes associated with FXS remains largely unexplored. Given that Fmr1 is expressed in both dorsal and ventral spinal cord, including motoneurons, the possibility exists that loss of its protein product, FMRP, disrupts locomotor circuitry. Here, we investigate whether Fmr1 deletion alters the function of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG) networks and gait-related motor output. Using isolated neonatal spinal cord preparations from Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mice, we assessed the ability of spinal circuits to generate coordinated fictive locomotor activity in vitro. In parallel, we quantified the gait parameters and motor performance in freely moving adult mice during unskilled and skill-demanding tasks. Our findings indicate that, despite the absence of FMRP in spinal neurons, neonatal Fmr1 KO spinal cords generated robust and coordinated locomotor rhythms compared to controls. Consistently, adult Fmr1 KO mice exhibited normal gait metrics under baseline conditions. However, these mice displayed hyperactivity and performance deficits during more challenging motor tasks demanding higher coordination. These findings suggest that the fundamental locomotor circuitry is preserved in FXS, likely through compensatory mechanisms. Consequently, motor impairments in FXS may arise primarily from supraspinal or integrative circuit dysfunction, rather than intrinsic deficits in spinal CPG function.

                Neuroimaging research has produced tens-of-thousands of articles that pair natural language and activation coordinate tables. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have provided methods to model text and images simultaneously. In this work, we present NeuroVLM, a model architecture for learning from 30,000 human neuroimage-text pairs. The architecture supports contrastive and generative objectives. The contrastive model ranks similarity between neuroimages and text. The generative models include text-to-neuroimage and neuroimage-to-text. These models are evaluated on network images from a variety of atlases, statistical maps from diverse publications, and images created from coordinate tables. These models are capable of generating atlases or maps given a text corpus, generating text interpretations of neuroimages, labeling networks, finding publications most related to a neuroimage query, or finding neuroimages most related to a text query.

">Comorbid HIV and Cocaine Use Exacerbate Accelerated Brain Aging</a></h4>

              
                Background: HIV and cocaine use (CU) each relate to cognitive deficits and brain abnormalities, yet their combined impact on brain aging remains unclear. This study examined how comorbid HIV and CU relate to brain aging and cognitive impairment. Methods: We trained a morphometry-based brain-age model using harmonized Human Connectome Project-Aging data (HCP-A; n=725) with Gaussian Process Regression. The model was applied to an independent cohort with varying HIV/CU burden (HIV-/CU-, n=34; one disorder [HIV+/CU- or HIV-/CU+], n=72; HIV+/CU+, n=80). Brain age gap (BAG; predicted minus chronological age) was examined in relation to comorbidity burden and neurocognitive impairment (NCI; NIH Toolbox), adjusting for age, sex, education, depression, and image-quality indices. Analyses on SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values characterized network-wise feature-level contributions to brain age estimates. Results: A dose-dependent effect of comorbidity burden on BAG was observed, with the HIV+/CU+ group showing the highest BAG. Greater BAG was associated with increased likelihood of NCI, and BAG partially mediated the relationship between comorbidity burden and NCI, with a stronger mediation effect in the two-disorder group than in the one-disorder group. Structural contributors to elevated BAG in the HIV/CU cohort included cortical thickness in the visual, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks, and sulcal depth in the sensorimotor network. Conclusion: Comorbid HIV/CU is linked to accelerated structural brain aging. BAG may reflect brain-level alterations underlying the association between comorbid HIV/CU and cognitive impairment, and may help identify network-specific targets for intervention.

">Cellular and functional dissection of the octopaminergic system in the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Octopamine (OA) is a major biogenic amine in the invertebrate nervous system and is often considered a functional analog of vertebrate noradrenaline. Along with its immediate precursor tyramine (TA), OA influences diverse physiological and behavioral processes, including sensory processing and social behavior. However, understanding the neural basis of its multifunctionality has been constrained by the limited genetic access to defined OA/TA neuron types. Here, we present a curated set of transgenic driver strains that provide selective access to nearly all long-range OA/TA cell types in the brain of common fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. Using these tools, we map cell-type-specific innervation patterns, compare male and female neuroanatomy, and cross-reference identified neuron types with electron microscopy connectome datasets. As a proof of principle, we show that distinct optic lobe-projecting OA/TA neuron types differentially modulate visually guided behaviors, and we identify a novel OA/TA cell type that suppresses aggression in both sexes. This resource establishes a practical and conceptual foundation for cell-type-resolved analysis of OA/TA circuit function and enables direct integration of genetics, anatomy, and connectomics for studies of neuromodulatory circuit organization.

                Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) of the cervical spinal cord has been thought to modulate lumbar networks, leading to the hypothesis that leg muscle recruitment may occur via recruitment of long-range spinal connections between cervical and lumbar circuits. To directly test this hypothesis, we compared arm and leg muscle responses elicited in unimpaired participants (N = 12) by cervical tSCS with the anodes placed over the iliac crests, with the anodes placed over the clavicles, and with lumbar tSCS as a control for leg muscle recruitment via the posterior root-muscle reflex. The idea of tSCS targeting cervico-lumbar connectivity would suggest that cervical stimulation could evoke responses in leg muscles. However, in our experiments, leg responses via cervical tSCS were only observed when the anodes were placed over the iliac crests, but not over the clavicles. These leg muscle responses had shorter latencies than those with lumbar tSCS and showed minimal post-activation depression, indicating efferent rather than afferent recruitment. Therefore, changes in leg muscle excitability by cervical-iliac tSCS previously attributed to descending cervical circuits could instead be explained by direct recruitment of efferent fibers near the iliac anodes. These findings suggest that cervical tSCS alone does not engage leg muscle motoneurons via long-range spinal or bidirectional pathways. Therefore, our study highlights the need to carefully consider electrode configuration when interpreting cervical tSCS mechanisms and additional or unexpected rehabilitative effects that extend caudally to the cervical spinal cord.

">Balancing Stability and Flow in Hippocampal Networks via Inductive Bias and Learned Symmetry Breaking</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus must balance stable memory representations with internally generated sequential dynamics underlying replay, prediction and traveling waves. How hippocampal circuitry achieves both remains unclear. Here, we show that recurrent neural networks trained on continuous prediction tasks converge to a mixed-symmetry dynamical regime, in which dominant symmetric recurrence stabilizes a continuous attractor while a weaker antisymmetric component induces directed flow along it. Symmetry breaking occurs in physical systems such as the ferromagnetic phase transition between ordered and disordered states. This structure accelerates learning and supports robust replay and prediction. We further show that such symmetry breaking can arise from biologically plausible spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, yielding a tilted Mexican-hat connectivity profile without explicit architectural constraints. Importantly, initializing networks with CA3-like structured connectivity biases learning toward this regime, improving optimization efficiency and performance. These results suggest that hippocampal computation reflects an interaction between biologically constrained circuit structure and task-driven learning, with partial symmetry breaking providing a low-dimensional control principle for balancing stability and flow in sequence generation.

">VIP+ amacrine cells synchronize neural activity in the retina</a></h4>

              
                In early sensory circuits, inhibitory interneurons are best known for mediating lateral inhibition, gain control, and feature selectivity, but their roles at the population level are less understood. Using two photon digital holography, we found that in the retina, vasoactive intestinal peptide expressing (VIP+) amacrine cells not only inhibit some retinal ganglion cell types via GABAergic synapses but also excite specific other types through gap junctions. Selective knockout of these junctions abolished synchronized firing among these ganglion cells, showing that VIP+ amacrine cells coordinate their activity. Thus, VIP+ interneurons have a dual, cell type specific role: synchronizing some ganglion cells electrically while inhibiting others chemically, thereby differentially shaping retinal output.

">Decoding the RNA Splicing Network in HNRNPH2-R114W Brain Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder and related neurodevelopmental diseases are increasingly linked to disrupted RNA processing during corticogenesis, yet resolving variant-specific mechanisms during early human development remains challenging. We generated isogenic cerebral organoids from a patient iPSC line carrying the HNRNPH2-R114W mutation and its CRISPR-corrected counterpart. Developmental validation by time-course imaging, followed by bulk RNA-Seq at day 20, showed comparable early differentiation and corticogenesis. Genotype was the primary determinant of global expression state, with organized remodeling of neuronal and metabolic programs. Splicing analyses demonstrated junction-dominant dysregulation, where 6,310 junctions exhibited significant differential usage. Junction-level resolution revealed a dominant genotype-related signal than exon-centric analysis. A structural docking model shows HNRNPH2 RNA recognition motifs 1-3 within a spliceosomal context and position residue R114 at an RNA-contact cleft, consistent with direct disruption of RNA engagement by R114W. Integrating differential expression with event- and isoform-level evidence prioritized convergent regulatory hubs enriched for axon guidance, synaptic signaling, and extracellular matrix programs. Single-cell RNA-Seq deconvolution revealed modest compositional shifts that do not account for the magnitude of transcriptional and splicing alterations. Collectively, these data support that HNRNPH2-R114W drives pervasive, junction-centered RNA rewiring in human cortical organoids and defines isoform-level endpoints for mechanistic studies and therapeutic testing in an isogenic developmental model.

">Microglial reactivity in the hippocampal CA2 is associated with advanced neuronal α-synulceinopathy</a></h4>

              
                Lewy body diseases are thought to evolve by the spread of intraneuronal -synuclein pathology. However, staging models of -synuclein pathology in the human brain seldom evaluate regions with direct synaptic connectivity to model microglial processes in disease. Here, we address this gap by testing the hypothesis that, within the well-defined synaptic connectivity of the intrahippocampal circuit, neuronal -synuclein pathology is associated with microglial reactivity. We selected a cohort of autopsy-confirmed Lewy body disease patients with hippocampal neuronal -synuclein pathology and minimal age-related co-pathologies (n=62) and as a control for other intraneuronal hippocampal pathology, we used a cohort of cognitively healthy patients with focal hippocampal tau accumulation with minimal amyloid plaques, termed primary age-related tauopathy (n=12). We immunostained consecutive hippocampal sections for -synuclein pathology and established markers of microglial reactivity, Iba1, HLA-DR, and CD68. With validated digital histology methods, we measured percent area occupied in 6 hippocampal subfields to compare the percent area occupied within subfields between patient cohorts, correlate the percent area occupied within and between subfields, and use linear-mixed effects models to compare the percent area occupied across subfields while co-varying for demographics. We also constructed two groups of either low-level hippocampal -synuclein pathology restricted to the cornu ammonis 2-3 subfields (Focal Subtype) or widespread -synuclein pathology within additional subfields (Widespread Subtype) to model hypothesized -synuclein pathological spread within the intrahippocampal circuit. Lewy body disease patients exhibited increased HLA-DR and CD68 in most hippocampal subfields compared with primary age-related tauopathy. In Lewy body disease patients, staining for all microglial markers was highest in the cornu ammonis field 2. Neuronal -synuclein pathology in the cornu ammonis field 2 consistently correlated with only HLA-DR and CD68 but not Iba1. Patients classified as the Widespread Subtype had worse cognitive impairment and increased HLA-DR and CD68 within the cornu ammonis field 2. Furthermore, HLA-DR and CD68 in the cornu ammonis field 2 correlated with distal neuronal -synuclein pathology only in subfields with retrograde connectivity. We found increased hippocampal microglial abnormalities in Lewy body disease patients compared with cognitively normal controls with primary age-related tauopathy, suggesting a relatively specific microglial/inflammatory response to neuronal -synuclein pathology. Our data is consistent with predominantly retrograde transmission of neuronal -synuclein pathology across hippocampal subfields, where the focal microglial response in the cornu ammonis field 2 may influence clinical outcomes and -synuclein pathological spread. These data suggest that microglial processes can help refine Lewy body disease histopathological staging.

">Differential sex-dependent responses of circulating steroid hormones and cortical gene expression in a preclinical traumatic brain injury model</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence supports sex differences in traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes, however the underlying processes that lead to sex differences are not well understood. TBI results in the initiation of molecular and cellular responses that facilitate the progression of neurodegeneration. Importantly, little is known about how the circulating hormone profile is altered in response to TBI, and whether sex differences in endocrine responses might shape secondary injury pathologies. Using intact male and female mice in a preclinical TBI model, we assessed changes in plasma hormone concentrations and cortical gene expression at 24 and 72 hours after TBI. We demonstrate that males and females exhibit sex-specific alterations in circulating levels of progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, estradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in response to TBI. We also identified sex differences in the expression of genes that are involved in immune responses and tissue remodeling after injury. Moreover, we report divergent circulating hormone and gene expression correlations between sexes.

">Single-subject Proteomic Signatures in Alzheimers Disease Reflect Clinical Phenotypes and Distinguish Asymptomatic from Symptomatic Cases</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimers Disease (AD) exhibits considerable inter-individual variability in clinical presentation, neuropathological burden, and underlying molecular processes. Conventional cohort-based analyses of omics molecular data often mask individual-level heterogeneity, limiting insights into the precision therapeutic strategies. To address this challenge, we developed INDIGO (INdividual-level DIfferential GenOmics), a computational framework that quantifies molecular deviations for each individual relative to healthy controls, enabling subject-specific profiling of disease-associated alterations in proteomic data, with a framework that is readily applicable to other omics modalities. METHODS: We applied INDIGO to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) proteomic data from ROSMAP cohort (N = 610). Protein level deviations were aggregated into gene set activity scores for KEGG pathways and curated AD Biodomain annotations. Functional alterations across AD and Asymptomatic AD (AsymAD) individuals were evaluated and correlated with clinical metrics including APOE4 genotype, Braak stage, CERAD and MMSE scores. Graph-based clustering was used to identify molecularly distinct subgroups based on shared patterns of functional dysregulation. RESULTS: Limited overlap was observed between cohort-level differential expression analysis and INDIGO single-subject analyses. Individual deviations in various processes, including metabolic, immune and epigenetic pathways, exhibited sex- and disease stage-specific patterns. Amyloid clearance and immune activation were strongly associated with APOE4 dosage, higher amyloid and tau burden and cognitive decline, whereas upregulation of mitochondrial and synaptic modules correlated positively with preserved cognitive function. By linking individuals through concordant directional proteomic changes, we identified molecularly coherent subgroups that transcend conventional diagnostic boundaries and include both AD and AsymAD subjects. Each subgroup displayed distinct functional signatures and defined by a unique set of key regulatory proteins. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that single-subject omics profiling can resolve individual molecular signatures aligned with clinical and neuropathological variation in AD. By linking molecular heterogeneity with disease phenotypes, INDIGO provides a scalable framework for precision modeling and novel therapeutic target discovery.

">Optimizing therapeutic hypothermia conditions in a translational preclinical model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia in rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Therapeutic hypothermia is the only clinically approved treatment for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (NHI), although its efficacy remains partial. In preclinical research, hypothermia is widely used as a reference therapy; however, its protocol is highly variable across studies, limiting robust comparisons with emerging neuroprotective strategies. This study aimed to define an optimal and standardized hypothermia protocol in the Rice-Vannucci model, not to challenge clinical practice, but to establish a reliable benchmark for preclinical therapeutic development. Methods: NHI was induced in postnatal day 7 (P7) rat pups, followed by normothermia or hypothermia for 2, 3, or 5 hours. Short- and long-term outcomes were assessed using lesion volume measurements by MRI, neurological scoring, behavioral tests, and histological analyses. The impact of immediate hypothermia initiation was also examined. Results: Across analyses, both 2- and 3-hour hypothermia durations provided greater neuroprotection than 5 hours-including brain lesion volume, motor and cognitive performances, and markers of neuronal preservation and neuroinflammation. However, for several parameters, 2 hours of hypothermia showed superior efficacy compared with 3 hours. Immediate initiation further modestly improved outcomes. Conclusion: A 2-hour hypothermia protocol represents the most robust and reproducible preclinical reference, enabling meaningful comparison with novel therapies in the Rice-Vannucci model.

">Effects of metabotropic 2/3-glutamate receptor activation and inactivation on activity-based anorexia model in mice.</a></h4>

              
                Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder disproportionately found in female human teens and young adults. It is often resistant to treatment, has a significant chance of relapse and is more lethal than other eating disorders, such as bulimia nervosa or Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). There is no specific medication for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Treatment consists of psychosocial means, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, and nutritional counseling. Medication is usually used for treating comorbidities such as anxiety or to decrease obsessive-compulsive tendencies. These medications cannot help the patient regain weight or treat core symptoms. Metabotropic 2/3-glutamate (mGluR2/3) receptor agonist (LY379268) and antagonist (LY341495) are promising pharmacological agents to treat psychiatric disorders. Both agonists and antagonists have been reported to have anxiolytic effects in different animal models of anxiety, while antagonists have shown antidepressant-like effects in preclinical studies. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm is used to model anorexia nervosa. It consists of giving mice access to a running wheel and restricting their feeding time. This causes mice to exercise more than mice without feeding time restriction and to eat less than mice without access to a moving running wheel. In this study, we subcutaneously injected female ABA model mice with a metabotropic 2/3-glutamate receptor agonist (LY379268) and antagonist (LY341495) in two experiments. Both compounds exacerbated weight loss by decreasing food intake as well as increasing physical activity. It can be concluded that the manipulation of mGluR2/3 receptors is detrimental for the ABA model and likely for anorexia nervosa as well.

">Effects of Chronic Cannabis Smoke Exposure on Inflammatory Markers in Periphery and Brain in Young and Aged Mice</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, which is thought to contribute to both cognitive decline and various neurodegenerative diseases. Cannabinoids are reported to reduce levels of inflammatory markers; however, these effects have not been thoroughly assessed in aged subjects. To address this gap, we evaluated effects of chronic cannabis smoke exposure on peripheral and brain inflammatory markers in young and aged mice. Young adult (4 months old) and aged (22 months old) C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to smoke from burning either cannabis (5.5 - 6.2% THC) or placebo (0% THC) cigarettes daily for 30 consecutive days. Following exposure sessions, both blood and brain tissue from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) were collected and analyzed for multiple markers of inflammation. Overall, the patterns of inflammatory markers varied across the three tissue types. Both comparisons of individual cytokines and global cytokine profiles revealed that aging caused modest increases in cytokine levels in serum and PFC, with little influence of cannabis exposure. In contrast, HPC samples had stronger age effects, with numerous cytokines elevated in aged mice compared to young. Cannabis also interacted with age in the HPC such that smoke exposure tended to increase cytokine levels in young mice but decrease them in aged mice. These findings point to general age-related increases in brain inflammatory markers in this mouse strain, but cannabis effects were largely restricted to the HPC, where smoke exposure produced age-dependent changes in cytokine profiles.

">Interplay Between Retroviral Element De-repression and Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway in Cellular Models of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration driven by complex interactions among oxidative stress, impaired survival signaling, and protein homeostasis disruption. Emerging evidence suggests that endogenous retroelements, including human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), may contribute to neurodegenerative processes; however, their role in PD remains poorly defined. Here, we investigated whether dopaminergic neurotoxic stress induces HERV-K activation and whether modulation of pro-survival signaling pathways influences this response in PD-relevant cellular models. Using undifferentiated SHSY5Y cells and neuron-like retinoic acid-differentiated SHSY5Y cells, we show that exposure to the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induces a rapid and robust transcriptional de-repression of the HERV-K Env gene. HERV-K activation occurs early after toxin exposure, scales with the intensity of the insult, and is associated with alterations in oxidative stress defenses, survival signaling pathways, and protein homeostasis. Notably, 6-OHDA treatment promotes the accumulation and cytoplasmic mislocalization of phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43), a pathological feature linked to neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Pharmacological modulation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway by the natriuretic peptide atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) significantly attenuates neurotoxin-induced HERV-K activation, restores oxidative stress-related and survival signaling markers, and limits pTDP-43 accumulation and mislocalization. These findings indicate that reinforcement of Wnt/{beta}-catenin dependent protective pathways constrains stress-driven HERV-K de-repression and associated molecular alterations. Overall, this study identifies HERV-K activation as an early stress-responsive feature in PD-like cellular models and supports the existence of a functional interplay between retroelement regulation, survival signaling, and protein homeostasis. Modulation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling may represent a strategy to limit retroelement-associated pathological responses in PD.

">Maternal High-Fat Diet Induces Sex- and Estrous Cycle-Specific Glial Dysregulation in the Peripheral Offspring Retina</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Maternal high-fat diet (mHFD) induces metabolic disturbances that lead to inflammatory responses in the offspring brain. The retina, as part of the central nervous system, may be similarly affected. This study aimed to determine how mHFD affects microglial and Muller cell activity in the retinas of offspring and assess how these effects depend on sex and the female estrous cycle. Methods: Female C57Bl/6J mice were fed a control diet (CD, 10% fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) from weaning to lactation. The offspring were weaned to a normal rodent diet. Retinal structure and glial cells were assessed using immunohistochemical labeling of retinal ganglion cells, Muller glia, astrocytes, phagocytic and inflammatory markers. Observed retinal changes in female offspring were correlated with the estrous cycle stages. Results: mHFD induced subtle retinal structural changes and sex-specific alterations in glial cells of offspring peripheral retina. Male offspring exhibited a reduced microglial area, accompanied by increased phagocytic capacity, whereas females showed the opposite pattern. Under mCD, the microglial area and its phagocytic and metabolic activity fluctuated with the female estrous cycle, while mHFD diminished the differences between phases. Additionally, mHFD reduced Muller glial reactivity in females, indicating disrupted glial communication. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that mHFD has a sex-specific effect on the offspring's peripheral retina, affecting the response of retinal microglia to female reproductive hormones.

">Spontaneous axon regeneration is preserved despite gut microbiota disruption after spinal cord injury in lampreys</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) often result in permanent disabilities in humans. One major reason for the lack of recovery is the inability of adult mammalian descending neurons to regenerate their axons after injury. In contrast, several fish species, such as the sea lamprey, exhibit spontaneous axon regeneration and successful functional recovery following a complete SCI. Recent studies have shown that a SCI in rodents and humans induces gut microbiome dysbiosis, which can impair recovery. Therefore, our goal was to examine how the microbiome changes after SCI in a regenerating animal model (the larval sea lamprey) and whether these changes influence the spontaneous regeneration of descending neuropeptidergic (cholecystokinergic) axons. Our data show that a complete SCI triggers an initial shift (5 weeks post-injury) in gut microbial communities in larval lampreys, characterized by an expansion of Legionellaceae family members. However, a treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic gentamicin during the first 5 weeks post-injury, which completely disrupted the gut microbiome (eliminating Legionellaceae and promoting Bradyrhizobiaceae expansion), did not affect the spontaneous regeneration of descending cholecystokinergic axons at 10 weeks post-injury. This finding indicates that changes in the intestinal microbial communities following a complete SCI probably do not influence the spontaneous regeneration of descending axons in lampreys.

">Heterogeneous single-cell dynamics support stable population codes for objects in the mouse anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Remembering our environment and its principal features is essential to our survival. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been implicated as a key region in remote memory (Frankland et al., 2004; Goshen et al., 2011; Almaguer-Melian et al., 2025). Whilst most studies investigating the ACC's contribution to memory have used fear conditioning, some have highlighted a role in the retention of object locations across various timescales, both recent and remote (Weible et al., 2009, 2012). However, how neurons in the ACC encode object locations across repeated exposure has not been investigated. Here, we investigated if object representations are supported by cell assemblies that are stable over days, or if the representation is volatile and dynamic across repeated experiences separated across time. Using calcium-imaging in freely moving mice, we recorded the activity of excitatory ACC neurons while mice explored objects placed in an environment over repeated days. We find that the ACC encodes object location in a mostly dynamic fashion: while the proportion of neurons allocated to object coding does not change across days, the specific neurons exhibiting object correlates fluctuate, featuring a dynamic turnover with a smaller set of stable cells. Interestingly, this was modulated by the animal's behaviour, such as object cells from mice spending the most time exploring the objects showed a higher degree of stability. We next examined how dynamic single-cell coding relates to stability at the network level. Population analyses revealed stable representations emerging from collective dynamics, suggesting that downstream regions may rely on ensemble patterns rather than fixed cell identities. Decoding analyses supported this view: ensembles of 64-128 neurons were as accurate and more efficient than the full dataset, indicating that information about the animal's location becomes more linearly separable when represented at a coarser population scale, making it more readily accessible to downstream regions that integrate population-level activity. Thus, we show that the ACC achieves stability through emergent organization across neurons, even as individual cells remain dynamic.

">Multi-Layer Brain-Mimicking Phantom for Replicating Dura and Pia Membrane Dimpling and Rupture Properties During Neural Interface Implantation</a></h4>

              
                Development of novel neural interfaces faces buckling challenges and heavily relies on trial-and-error tests via in vivo animal brain insertions for design optimizations towards the minimal-damaging version for enhanced recording and stimulation outcome. To enable low-cost and fast-turnaround neural interface development and to enable previously impossible insertions via new understanding of the cutting process, this study developed a reproducible, multi-layer brain-mimicking phantom designed to replicate the rodent pia and dura mater dimpling and rupture force performance observed during in vivo tests. The phantom was composed of a 0.5% (w/v) agarose cortex layer, a 1.01% (w/v) agarose pia mater layer, and a pre-stretched polyvinyl chloride (PVC) dura mater layer, assembled via easily duplicable benchtop protocols. Using a cantilever-beam force measurement system, rupture force and dimpling depth were quantified across microwires of varying diameters (12 - 100 m), materials (tungsten, stainless steel), and tip geometries, as well as segmented silicon probe shanks. Phantom test results closely matched in vivo Sprague-Dawley rat data, validating the performance of the developed multi-layer phantom. At the same time, phantom insertion trial variability was substantially lower than in vivo tests, enabling a repeatable, low-cost, early-stage screening platform of novel electrode designs. The phantom's modular design also allowed tuning of layer thickness and stiffness of each layer for different species or devices, offering a validated customizable testing platform to accelerate novel neural implant development and reduce animal use.

">Pre-movement respiration-action coupling is specific to self-initiated action: Evidence for action alignment with ongoing breathing</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary actions are coupled with the respiratory cycle, yet whether this coupling reflects action timing aligning with breathing or breathing adjusting to anticipated action remains unclear. This pre-registered study compared respiration-action coupling across three conditions using a modified Libet clock task. Thirty participants performed key presses under Self-initiated (freely chosen timing), Delayed (predictable timing after one full clock rotation), and Immediate (speeded response to stimulus onset) conditions. Circular uniformity tests revealed significant respiratory phase concentration at key press exclusively in the Self-initiated condition, and time-resolved phase consistency analysis showed that coupling emerged before movement onset only in this condition. These findings suggest that action timing aligns with ongoing breathing rhythms, and that temporal freedom, rather than preparation time or predictability, is critical for this coupling to emerge. Additionally, actions performed during inhalation were followed by shorter and deeper subsequent breaths across all conditions, indicating greater perturbation of ongoing breathing when acting during inhalation. Participants reported a subjective preference for pressing during exhalation, which correlated with individual differences in exhalation bias during self-initiated actions. Body awareness, but not interoceptive awareness or trait anxiety, predicted coupling strength. These results suggest that pre-movement respiration-action coupling reflects an implicit process whereby self-chosen action timing exploits ongoing respiratory states, potentially minimizing action-related respiratory perturbation.

">In Vivo Surface Reconstruction of Three Signal-defined Intracortical Layers Using 5T 3D FLAIR MR Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Background: In vivo whole-cortex quantification of intracortical signal-defined layering on the routinely acquired structural MRI remains limited. Purpose: To develop and validate an automated framework to reconstruct three intracortical signal-defined layers from 5T three-dimensional (3D) T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and to characterize whole-cortex morphometrics and regional organization across a prespecified cortical organizational framework. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 5T 3D FLAIR images were acquired between February and July 2024. Brain Multi-Layer Surface Reconstruction (BrainMLSR) reconstructed three intracortical signal-defined layers, and derived intracortical layer thickness and surface area measures and ratios. Performance was evaluated against manual annotations and assessed for test-retest repeatability (n=13) and cross-site feasibility (n=2). Paired two-tailed t-tests and linear mixed-effects models were used. A proof-of-concept analysis compared Heschl's gyrus ratios between 19 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 19 age-matched healthy controls (HC Results: A total of 270 healthy participants (mean age, 54.4{+/-}14.5 years; 146 men) were included. Agreement with manual hypointense-layer annotations was high (Dice, 0.960{+/-}0.003), and was similar in the cross-site dataset (Dice, 0.954{+/-}0.009). In the test-retest dataset, average symmetric surface distance was less than 0.1 mm. Across prespecified systems, thickness and surface area ratios varied by region; within an auditory-perisylvian hierarchy, banksSTS showed a localized turning point with an increased hyperintense layer thickness ratio and decreased hypointense layer thickness ratio, accompanied by inflections in surface area ratios (P < .001). In bilateral Heschl's gyrus, hypointense (left: 0.619{+/-}0.262 vs 0.881 {+/-} 0.102; right: 0.607{+/-}0.310 vs 0.907{+/-}0.141 mm) and isointense (left: 0.406{+/-}0.225 vs 0.678{+/-} 0.128; right: 0.478{+/-}0.232 vs 0.808 {+/-} 0.176 mm) layer thicknesses were lower in TLE than in HC (all P<.001). Conclusion: BrainMLSR enabled accurate and repeatable in vivo reconstruction of three intracortical signal-defined layers from a single 5T 3D T2-weighted FLAIR acquisition and provided whole-cortex boundary-based morphometry with interpretable regional organization.

">Competing Effects of Agonist and Antagonist Vibration on the Proprioceptive Sense of Force</a></h4>

              
                Motor unit (MU) firing is affected by motoneuronal persistent inward currents (PICs), which heavily contribute to gain control of motor output. PICs are highly sensitive to inhibition; for instance, Ia reciprocal inhibition via antagonist muscle vibration drastically reduces discharge rate hysteresis (dF), an estimate of PIC magnitude. A direct link between sensitivity of PICs to inhibition and voluntary force control, however, has not been established. To determine whether force control is altered with inhibition of PICs, we recorded high-density surface EMG from the tibialis anterior, while 11 participants (5F; 6M) completed and isometric force reproduction task. Tendon vibration was applied to the agonist or antagonist muscle during the first (with visual feedback) or second contraction (without visual feedback) and participants were asked to match percieved effort across contractions, in an attempt to match neural drive to the motor pool. In support of our hypothesis, torque and MU firing rates were reduced when vibration was applied to the antagonist (torque: p < .0001; MU firing rate: p < .0001), but not agonist (torque: p = .9980; MU firing rate: p = .312) muscle tendon in the second contraction, compared to control. Conversely, when vibration was applied during the first contraction, opposite effects were observed. These results suggest that PICs play a role in the proprioceptive sense of force, offering a potential link between PICs and voluntary force control, which may be important for understanding and treatment of motor impairments.

">Causal evidence for a shared mechanism linking language and tool use via the putamen</a></h4>

              
                Both human language and tool use--two hallmark capacities of human cognition--depend on organizing discrete elements, i.e., symbols and actions, into highly constrained structured sequences to achieve a functional goal. However, the neural mechanism linking these capacities is unclear. We combined brain lesion analysis, developmental contrast, and functional neuroimaging to test whether the basal ganglia play a causal role in their shared capacity. In 100 adults with focal brain injury, damage to the putamen disrupted both sentence processing and tool use, with impairments specifically explained by reduced goal-dependent sequence integrity for both tasks. Further comparing populations with typical and deprived early language experience (congenitally deaf adults with vs. without early sign language exposure), we found that early language acquisition was associated with improved tool-use performance and strengthened putaminal responses to such goal dependency, which mediated the relationship between sentence sequence integrity and tool behavior. Together, these results identify the putamen as a key neural substrate supporting goal-dependent sequence integrity across language and action, and show how early language experience shapes this conserved control system.

                How humans reuse learned movements across different speeds, sizes, and contexts is poorly understood. Conventional theories assume that motor memories are linked to limb states; however, they fail to explain why the structure of skilled actions is preserved when scaled. Here, we propose the novel hypothesis that the brain organizes motor memory according to the relative progress within an action, where the movement is in its progression from start to finish. We tested this hypothesis using three experimental tasks involving single reaches, two-step reach sequences, and button-reach-button sequences. Across all tasks, behavior was more accurately predicted by representations anchored to the relative progress of the overall action than by state variables. Taken together, our findings support a scalable encoding scheme for abstract motor memory. This perspective provides a mechanistic basis for flexible, scale-invariant reuse of motor memories and the remarkable generalization capacity of human motor control.

">Individual differences of cortical and subcortical emotion-informed functional gradients</a></h4>

              
                The complex interplay between brain regions that support emotional experience and their link to individual differences is a topic of active research. Additionally, there has been growing interest in using functional gradients to investigate human cortical organization during both rest and film fMRI. Among these, several studies demonstrated improved brain fingerprinting performance, reflecting greater neural identification capability of film fMRI against rest fMRI despite higher subject synchronization during film-watching than in rest. Comparably, in this work we study the relation between individual differences, in particular, state anxiety and openness scores, and brain activity during the processing of various emotional scenes in films, through functional gradients. Next to including subcortical areas, we also propose a new approach of computing functional gradients based on a subset of frames selected using emotional annotation data of films, resulting in emotion-informed functional gradients. Then we evaluate the variance in emotion-informed gradients across subjects and employ these same gradients in the prediction of individual differences. For emotion-informed functional gradients, the highest predictability of state anxiety was found for scenes of negative valence and medium-high arousal, corresponding to the typical location of anxiety within the valence-arousal-power emotional space. Additionally, predictability of state anxiety was negatively correlated to inter-subject variability. In contrast, predictability of openness was found to be highest during scenes with low arousal and positively correlated to inter-subject variability. In essence, our results first show that macroscale brain organization is affected by emotional experience, and that frame selection based on the latter can be useful to remove non-subject-specific variability while extracting subject-specific information related to the emotion experience. It also demonstrates that frame selection increases inter-subject variability allowing the extraction of more subject-specific information. Thus, expanding on the idea of brain fingerprint in film fMRI, we argue that emotional experiences enhance disentanglement of various domain of individual differences. Moreover, depending on the individual difference of interest, fMRI acquired during more or less constrained paradigms would be more suitable to reveal different properties of brain function.

">Inflammation in schizophrenia: Peripheral interleukin-6 levels-related disease-specific functional activity abnormalities</a></h4>

              
                Background: Peripheral inflammation is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, but how inflammatory signals map onto the large-scale brain organization remains incompletely understood. Methods: We applied a supervised multimodal fusion approach guided by interleukin-6 (IL-6) to gray matter volume (GMV) and resting-state regional homogeneity (ReHo) from a population-based discovery cohort in the UK Biobank. Brain components related to IL-6 were identified and then projected onto an independent schizophrenia cohort to examine their relevance to the disease. Imaging-transcriptomic analyses using the Allen Human Brain Atlas characterize the molecular substrates underlying the disease-relevant pattern. Results: Two ReHo components were significantly associated with plasma IL-6, while no GMV components showed robust IL-6 correlations. One of the components (ReHo IC4) exhibited a conserved functional pattern characterized by enhanced visual synchrony and reduced synchrony in the medial prefrontal cortex. This pattern remained unchanged in both the healthy controls and patients. In contrast, another component (ReHo IC8) showed increased synchrony in the default mode network and reduced synchrony in sensorimotor networks, and its loadings were significantly elevated in patients with schizophrenia. Imaging-transcriptomic analysis revealed the molecular architecture of this disease-amplified pattern. The default mode region was enriched in synaptic signaling pathways, while the sensorimotor region was linked to mitochondrial bioenergetic processes; both patterns significantly enriched with gene sets related to schizophrenia. Conclusions: This study identified an IL-6-associated functional brain pattern that is amplified in schizophrenia, linking peripheral inflammation to disease-specific network dysregulation. The findings provide a systems-level framework for understanding how peripheral inflammation interacts with large-scale brain network activities in schizophrenia.

">Longitudinal quantitative streamline tractography: robust estimation of white matter connectivity differences</a></h4>

              
                Longitudinal probing of structural connectivity via diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is experiencing uptake. However, the detection of biological effects is significantly hampered by the limitations of cross-sectional streamline tractography, where even small changes in the dMRI signal can produce drastically different trajectories and therefore quantitative parameterisation; if not properly dealt with, such effects will manifest as spurious longitudinal change, which can obscure subtle biological differences. To overcome this challenge, we here introduce a novel quantitative streamline tractography framework tailored for longitudinal analysis, wherein the streamline trajectories of an individual remain fixed throughout the analysis, allowing only their ascribed density weights to vary between sessions. We present two strategies by which these quantitative streamline weights can be determined, both extensions of the widely adopted SIFT2 method. The performance of this framework is benchmarked against cross-sectional reconstruction with and without SIFT2 optimisation, in both in silico dMRI phantoms with known ground truths and three distinct human in vivo cohorts with clear a priori expectations of biological effects. We demonstrate that the proposed framework drastically reduces methodological imprecisions in synthetic dMRI phantoms and enhances statistical sensitivity and specificity to biological effects in human cohorts, enabling robust longitudinal quantification of structural connectivity.

">Effects of spatial attention on iconic memory are primarily driven by costs rather than benefits</a></h4>

              
                The role of spatial attention in iconic memory - an early interface between visual perception and short-term memory - remains poorly understood. Across two experiments run in 2025, we investigated how endogenous spatial attention modulates iconic memory using a partial-report paradigm. In both experiments, pre-cues manipulated the allocation of spatial attention before stimulus onset. Stimulus arrays were then briefly presented to one hemifield and followed by a post-cue that probed iconic memory at varying delays after stimulus offset. In Experiment 1 (N = 47), valid attentional cues improved performance at short delays. Performance was modeled with an exponential decay function to dissociate effects on initial stimulus availability at short SOAs, the rate of iconic decay, and later transfer to working memory. This analysis indicated that valid pre-cues increased initial stimulus availability relative to invalid pre-cues. In Experiment 2 (N = 66), a neutral pre-cue condition was added, and post-cues were presented at three delays (0, 120, and 1240 ms). This revealed that performance differences were driven by attentional costs at invalidly cued locations, with no detectable benefits at validly cued locations relative to neutral cues. Together, these results show that spatial attention modulates the earliest measurable phase of iconic memory by shaping the initial sensory trace. The cost-dominated pattern suggests that attention primarily suppresses information at unattended locations rather than enhancing representations at attended locations. This finding challenges the view of iconic memory as a pre-attentive sensory store and indicates that attentional selection operates earlier than previously assumed.

">Preferential generation of pathological tau species in specific subtypes of entorhinal neurons: implications for Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is distinguished by the presence of two key pathological features: amyloid plaques, accumulations of proteolytic products of Amyloid Precursor Protein, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), intracellular aggregations of microtubule-associated protein tau. NFTs first appear in particular entorhinal cortex (EC) neurons (called pre-alpha neurons) in asymptomatic patients, then continue to spread through other connected brain regions as the disease progresses. This stereotypical progression of tauopathy through synaptically connected brain regions (i.e. Braak stages) not only suggests that the tauopathy in AD spreads transsynaptically, it also raises the question whether particular neuronal subtypes and/or brain regions are especially prone to tauopathy. We explored this question by overexpressing wildtype human tau protein (hTau) in a variety of entorhinal and neocortical neuronal subtypes. We then compared the tendencies of different neuronal cell types to develop different pathological tau species over time and found that tau pathology does indeed develop at markedly different rates in different neuronal subtypes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the EC is particularly prone, with the likely rat cognates of the pre-alpha neurons (ECLII fan cells) among the first to express pathological tau label. Fan cells were not, however, the neurons with the greatest vulnerability to generate pathological tau species: subsets of ECLIII neurons were found to express disproportional amounts of pathological tau. This is of particular interest given that the next structures to develop AD-related tauopathy after the EC in patients are CA1 hippocampus and subiculum, where ECLIII neurons project, rather than the dentate gyrus and CA3, where ECLII fan cells project. These results demonstrate differential susceptibility of different neuronal subtypes to pathological tau species and suggest distinct roles for different entorhinal neuronal subtypes in the propagation of the tauopathy underlying AD-related neurodegeneration.

                This paper explores how smart governance can reduce financial risks in the Iraqi banking industry by focusing on the adoption of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to increase financial stability and operational efficiency. The study uses a combination of quantitative indicators of the dimensions of smart governance (standards, policies, practices, information, technologies, and skills) and financial risk dimensions (market, credit, operational, and investment portfolio risks) based on the secondary data provided by the Central Bank of Iraq covering the years 2023 and 2024. The results reveal a strong progression in all aspects of smart governance during the study time in the form of the rising number of licensed electronic payment providers, the rise of the percentage of current deposits, and the further use of bank accounts and electronic wallets. Also, the human resources in the banking industry have been enhanced with expertise in professional development initiatives. In the financial risk sector, the outcomes are a decline in non-performing loans, an upward trend in the ratio of credit to deposits and an increase in total deposits and total credit facilities, hence, an indication of an improvement in the ability to handle risk. The testing of hypothesis confirms that a strong governing process, including standards, policies, practices, information management, technology adoption and development of human skills, has a positive influence on financial risk management in the AI environment. The research suggests enhancing regulatory systems, increasing digital transformation programs, investing in human-capital growth, and introducing AI-based analytical solutions to guarantee long run sustainability and stability of the financial sector.

                Background After witnessing the implementations of Banach fixed point theory which is stated that a mapping T: X→X has always a unique fixed point in X in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were established. Consequently, the theory has evolved to encompass diverse extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Vital concepts such as D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces and weakly compatible maps are reviewed to establish the framework for our main results. The major objective of the present study is to investigate and verify the uniqueness of some common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced categories of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. Our first main outcomes were established by applying the concepts of weak compatibility and common limit in the range property, whereas we obtained our second major results by utilizing the notion of occasionally weakly compatible mapping. Additionally, various common fixed point outcomes for the two pairs of self-maps were determined. Conclusion This manuscript explores novel outcomes regarding the uniqueness of various common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced types of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. We anticipate that the discoveries in this manuscript will aid scientists in enhancing the authors on popularized extended symmetric-spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementations in each advanced branches of science.

                <p>Dementia-causing diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are one of the greatest health concerns facing the aging world population. A key feature of AD is excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta, leading to synapse and cell loss in brain structures, such as the hippocampus. This neurodegeneration is preceded by impaired neuron function, notably reduced synaptic inhibition. Metabotropic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs) may be modulated by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are reported to be progressively lost from neuronal membranes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, it remains unknown whether functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated signaling changes over aging and whether or not pharmacological intervention can prevent receptor loss. In this study, we combine electrophysiological and biochemical analysis of hippocampal neurons in the Amyloid Precursor Protein/Presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD from acute brain slices and organotypic slice cultures prepared from male and female mice to determine if functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs are lost and the effect of pharmacological modulation. Overall, we found that GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R expression decreased with age, independent of genotype, with no evidence for postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R loss in CA1 pyramidal cells at any age. We did observe a genotype-dependent reorganization of postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated IPSCs, which was independent of age. Presynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated inhibition was impaired in APP/PS1 mice, also independent of age. We observed that chronic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R modulation differentially regulated function but was independent of genotype. Overall, our data show that functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signaling is altered in APP/PS1 mice, independent of age, increasing our understanding of amyloidopathy-induced dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-32/v2?src=rss">The paradox of food production, expenditure, poverty and stunting  in Tanzania: an ecological study design [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background There have been claims amongst nutrition stakeholders in Tanzania that the food basket regions, are the regions most affected by stunting among children. However, this study could not find evidence that combines food production and stunting levels, to substantiate this claim. Therefore, this study aims to compare data on stunting, food production and consumption within administrative regions of the Tanzania mainland. Methods The study used an ecological study design to show the relationship between stunting, poverty, food production and food and non-food consumption expenditure across administrative regions in Tanzania mainland. The study used data from three national wide surveys: 2017/2018 Household Budget Survey (HBS), Tanzania National Nutrition Survey (TNNS) 2018 and Agriculture Statistics for Food Security report 2018/2019. Results The study showed that there is a positive relationship between the prevalence of stunting and food production (r=0.43, p=0.03), while there is a negative relationship between stunting and the level of both the average monthly household food consumption expenditure (r = -0.51, p = 0.01) and average monthly household non-food consumption expenditure (r = -0.51, p = 0.01). It was further found that some regions which have higher levels of stunting such as Njombe, have the lowest level of basic need poverty. Conclusion The study found a positive relationship between food production and the prevalence of stunting using data across regions in mainland Tanzania. This is an indication that regional food production may not entail nutrition outcomes, hence a call for more advocacy on nutrition-sensitive agriculture.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-209/v1?src=rss">Analyzing the Effectiveness of Macroeconomic Policies in Addressing Poverty in Iraq: An Econometric Study considering Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence for the Period (2004–2024) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Digital transformation and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly important in enhancing the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies, particularly through improved economic data management and more efficient targeting of vulnerable groups. Poverty reduction remains one of the most critical challenges for policymakers in Iraq due to its wide economic and social implications. Addressing this challenge requires a comprehensive mix of macroeconomic policies tailored to the national context. This study examines the effectiveness of key macroeconomic policy instruments in reducing poverty in Iraq during the period (2004–2024). Methods The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is employed, along with the Bounds Testing approach, to investigate the existence of a long-run cointegration relationship between the absolute poverty line and major macroeconomic policy variables, including broad money supply, inflation rate, government expenditure, and per capita foreign trade. Annual time-series data for the period were analyzed to estimate both short-run and long-run dynamics. Results The results indicate a statistically significant long-run equilibrium relationship at the (1%) level between macroeconomic policy instruments and the absolute poverty line. The empirical findings show that monetary policy exerts the strongest influence on poverty levels, with broad money supply, inflation, and per capita foreign trade displaying significant effects. Government expenditure plays a meaningful role in reducing poverty in both the short and long run. Conclusions The study concludes that integrating digital transformation and AI technologies into the design and implementation of macroeconomic policies can substantially enhance their effectiveness in reducing poverty. Key recommendations include establishing a National Council for Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence within the Ministry of Planning, strengthening digital infrastructure through public–private partnerships, activating electronic interlinkages among ministries via unified databases, enhancing financial inclusion platforms targeting vulnerable groups, improving government spending efficiency, and encouraging investments that generate sustainable employment opportunities.

                <p>by Yu Wang, Lanxi Wu, Lin Zhang, Yongming Dong, Aaradhya Pant, Yan Liu, Jihong Bai</p>

Neuronal communication relies on neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles. The endocytic protein AP180 is critical for efficient vesicle recycling at presynaptic terminals, and its loss impairs neurotransmission, producing reduced release frequency, enlarged synaptic vesicles, and increased quantal amplitude. Yet how AP180 controls vesicle size and whether vesicle size influences release remains unclear. Here, we show that the C-terminal Assembly domain (AD) of AP180 determines vesicle size and thereby regulates release properties in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. An AP180 variant lacking the AD (AP180∆AD) increases release frequency, contrasting sharply with the reduced transmission in <i>ap180</i> null mutants, yet fails to correct the vesicle size or quantal amplitude. These enlarged vesicles evade curvature-dependent inhibition by complexin, a presynaptic regulator of fusion, while remaining dependent on complexin for evoked responses. This selective escape reveals that vesicle size influences release dynamics through curvature-sensing proteins. Replacing the AP180 AD with actin-binding motifs restores normal vesicle size, quantal amplitude, and release frequency, indicating that actin interactions are both necessary and sufficient for AD function. Biochemically, we show that the intrinsically disordered AD forms condensates that enrich actin monomers and nucleate filament assembly, while full-length AP180 couples PIP2-rich membranes to actin filaments. Together, these findings reveal that the AP180 AD regulates synaptic vesicle size through actin binding, establishing vesicle morphology as a key influencer of curvature-dependent release control.

Macrophages are essential for host defense, yet how parenchyma-residing macrophages detect pathogens without direct contact remains unclear. <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that infects the brain. Using in situ imaging of mouse model, we showed that brain-resident microglia vigilantly detect capillary-residing <i>C. neoformans</i> prior to its blood–brain barrier transmigration, but are less responsive to nonencapsulated fungi or parenchyma-injected <i>C. neoformans</i>. Microglia migrate to and enwrap leaky capillaries harboring fungi, leading to fungal uptake but not clearance, instead promoting fungal growth. Microglial response is triggered by released capsule components, rather than the assembled capsule. In particular, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) plays a critical role by activating endothelial cells to release nucleotides which act on microglia P2Y12. Our findings revealed a novel paradigm by which microglia detect pathogens without direct contact, offering new insights for microglia-directed antifungal therapies.

                Background Sentence-embedding models transform sentences into dense vector representations that capture their semantic meanings. These representations enable deep learning to perform many tasks efficiently, such as similarity measurement, retrieval, and summarization, with improved semantic understanding. Existing sentence embedding models often struggle to capture the semantic richness and morphological complexity of Arabic, limiting their effectiveness in tasks such as semantic similarity, question answering, summarization, and information retrieval. Objectives This study aims to develop a novel sentence-embedding framework tailored for Arabic that addresses the shortcomings of current models by integrating contextual and linguistic features. Methods We propose a multimodal architecture that combines a fine-tuned Sentence-AraBERT (SAraBERT) model with pre-trained FastText embeddings. The model is evaluated on standard Arabic Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Results Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, achieving lower MSE values (0.0355) and higher correlation scores (0.8053), indicating a stronger alignment with human-annotated similarity judgments on the ATrD dataset. Conclusion The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal SAraBERT-based embeddings in enhancing sentence-level semantic understanding of Arabic. This study advances Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for underrepresented languages and provides a foundation for future research on Arabic language understanding using deep learning techniques.

                Background A neutrosophic ring represents an algebraic generalization of the classical ring structure by introducing an indeterminacy element I , enabling the modeling of truth, falsity, and indeterminacy simultaneously, as established within Smarandache’s neutrosophic framework. In contrast, a Boolean ring is a commutative algebraic structure in which every element is idempotent ( αI ) ² = αI reflecting the logical principles of Boolean algebras and possessing characteristic two Combining these concepts, the neutrosophic Boolean ring extends the Boolean ring by embedding neutrosophic logic parameters—truth (T), indeterminacy (I), and falsity (F)—into its elements and operations. This hybrid structure allows for the representation of algebraic uncertainty and incomplete information while preserving Boolean idempotent properties, thus providing a flexible framework for studying systems with uncertain or partially defined information in algebraic and logical contexts Methods The research defines the Indeterminacy ring R I = { α + βI : α , β ∈ R } and explores its algebraic properties through examples from integers, rationals, and reals. It then formulates the Indeterminacy Boolean Ring (B-Ring) characterized by idempotency ( αI ) ² = αI , and establishes several theorems proving its core algebraic features. Results Findings reveal that Indeterminacy B-Rings are commutative and have characteristic two, ensuring 2 αI = 0 . Each maximal Indeterminacy ideal is also prime, and these rings are semisimple and reduced, containing no nonzero nilpotent elements. Furthermore, any Indeterminacy B-Ring can be represented as a direct product of copies of Z ₂ I , known as the Indeterminacy Boolean field. The quotient rings preserve Boolean and Indeterminacy properties, confirming their structural consistency. Conclusions The study successfully extends Boolean ring theory to the Indeterminacy domain, establishing a strong algebraic foundation for modeling uncertainty. Indeterminacy B-Rings maintain the essential Boolean properties of idempotency and commutativity while incorporating indeterminate behavior through I ² = I . These results open new perspectives for future applications in neutrosophic logic, fuzzy systems, and abstract algebra dealing with indeterminate information.

                Background Oxidative stress and inflammation are mutually reinforcing physiological processes. The transcription factor Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) acts as the master regulator of redox homeostasis and anti-inflammatory signaling. To overcome the off-target limitations of conventional electrophilic Nrf2 activators, this study investigates selective peptide-based modulators. We present data indicating that an innate defense regulator (IDR)-1002 peptide is able to activate the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response and mitigate inflammation in an endothelial cell model. Methods We first screened several IDR peptides IDR-1 (Lys-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Pro-Ala-Ile-Pro-Val-Ser-Leu-Leu), IDR-1018 (Val-Arg-Leu-Ile-Val-Ala-Val-Arg-Ile-Trp-Arg-Arg), HH2 (Val-Gln-Leu-Arg-Ile-Arg-Val-Ala-Val-Ile-Arg-Ala) and IDR-1002 (Val-Gln-Arg-Trp-Leu-Ile-Val-Trp-Arg-Ile-Arg-Lys) for their ability to induce Nrf2 nuclear translocation in HEK293 and bovine endothelial cells (BEC) via Western blot and ELISA. Transcriptional activity was assessed in HepG2 cells using an ARE (Antioxidant Response Element)-luciferase reporter assay to determine the EC50. Downstream expression of antioxidant enzymes, including HO-1 (Heme Oxygenase-1), NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1), and GCLM (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase Modifier Subunit), was quantified by ELISA. GST (Glutathione S-Transferase) activity induced by IDR-1002 was measured using a CDNB-GSH conjugation assay. Finally, the functional capacity to reduce H2O2-induced ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) and TNF-stimulated inflammation was measured in BECs. Results Among the tested peptides, IDR-1002 induced the most potent concentration-dependent nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in both cell lines. IDR-1002 activated ARE-dependent transcription with an EC50 of 18.57 μM. This activation led to a significant time-dependent increase in HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM protein levels, alongside enhanced GST activity. Functionally, IDR-1002 pre-treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of intracellular ROS (up to 5.4-fold at 50 μM) and a significant decrease in TNF-α expression in stimulated BECs. Conclusions IDR-1002 acts as a potent dual-function regulator that simultaneously activates the Nrf2 antioxidant response and inhibits NF-κB-mediated inflammation. These findings highlight IDR-1002 as a promising therapeutic candidate for chronic diseases characterized by the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation.

                The transition toward greener economies has heightened the need for education systems to cultivate green skills from early schooling through vocational pathways. Despite growing interest, existing assessments remain fragmented and lack validation across educational levels. This study develops and validates a unified measurement framework for assessing green skills implementation across basic, lower-secondary, and vocational education. A multi-phase quantitative design was employed, including item development, expert review, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and multi-group measurement invariance testing. The final instrument comprised 36 items across six constructs: environmental awareness, sustainable behaviour, critical sustainability thinking, sustainability participation, resource management skills, and technical green practices. Using data from 215 students, the six-factor CFA model demonstrated excellent fit (CFI = .953; RMSEA = .052) and strong reliability and convergent validity across all constructs. Multi-group CFA supported configural and metric invariance, while partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing four intercepts, enabling valid latent mean comparisons across educational levels. Results indicated a clear developmental progression of green skills, with foundational competencies stronger in primary education and technical competencies highest in vocational students. These findings confirm that green skills evolve along a continuum and can be measured consistently across schooling stages. The validated framework provides a robust tool for curriculum alignment, professional development, and monitoring sustainability competencies within national education systems. This study advances psychometric approaches in sustainability education and offers empirical guidance for policymakers seeking coherent strategies to support future green workforces.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-202/v1?src=rss">The Long-COVIDiet Study: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Effectiveness of Diet Quality on Fatigue, Physical Function, and Inflammation in Older Adults with Long COVID [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by persistent or new symptoms lasting three months or more after acute infection. Approximately 4% of U.S. adults are affected, with fatigue and muscle weakness among the most common symptoms. Chronic inflammation and nutritional imbalances are thought to contribute to long-COVID symptomatology. The Long-COVIDiet Study was designed to test the effectiveness of a whole-diet approach—grounded in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025—that emphasizes nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods and select supplements. The trial evaluates the impact of this dietary intervention, quantified through a diet quality score, on fatigue, muscle strength, physical function, and biomarkers of nutritional and inflammatory status in older adults with long COVID. Methods and analysis Fifty-six participants aged ≥50 years with long COVID, moderate-to-severe fatigue, and suboptimal diet quality will be recruited from the Baltimore, Maryland area. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either a dietary intervention arm or an attention-control arm. The intervention includes individualized dietary counseling (eight biweekly sessions) and 16 weekly online group sessions with a registered dietitian, emphasizing anti-inflammatory and nutrient-rich foods. The control group attends matched weekly sessions on non-dietary healthy aging topics. Primary outcomes are fatigue and diet quality, assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes include muscle mass, grip strength, and physical function; exploratory outcomes include nutritional and inflammatory biomarkers. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, with linear regression and mixed-effects models evaluating changes across timepoints. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Review Board (HP-00106745). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences, and plain-language summaries on the study website. Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05977179.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-201/v1?src=rss">Photoinitiator Systems in Dental Resin-Based Composites: Mechanisms, Performance, and Clinical Implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This review summarizes current knowledge on both the most used photoinitiator system in dental resin (camphorquinone) and the alternative photoinitiator systems employed in dentistry. The review focuses on polymerization mechanisms, in vitro evaluation techniques, and factors that influence the degree of conversion and hardness of dental resin-based materials. A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Elsevier databases, covering publications from 1984 to 2025. More than 30 articles were selected based on their relevance to the scope of this review. Light-activated dental resin-based composites (RBCs) represent the most widely used restorative materials in clinical practice. However, effective polymerization of each photoinitiator system depends on the use of a compatible light-curing unit with an appropriate emission spectrum. Changes in the photoinitiator system can markedly affect the biomechanical properties of dental resins, including degree of conversion, hardness, and biocompatibility. This review provides a comparative analysis of RBCs formulated with different photoinitiators, such as camphorquinone, benzophenone, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione, trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosphine oxide, and benzoyl peroxide. The main objective of this article was to highlight alternative photoinitiators capable of overcoming the color drawbacks of camphorquinone, particularly yellow discoloration, while maintaining comparable mechanical performance. Although current evidence suggests that no alternative photoinitiator fully matches the effectiveness of camphorquinone, certain systems—such as benzoyl germanium derivatives and novel acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators used in combination with camphorquinone—appear promising for enhancing esthetic properties and increasing the degree of conversion of dental RBCs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-200/v1?src=rss">The E-Learning System and its Role in Promoting Digital Culture An analytical study of the opinions of a sample of faculty members at the University of Fallujah [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                E-learning has become increasingly important, especially after the pandemic and the changes it brought about, forcing educational institutions to adopt unconventional methods to accomplish their missions. We seek in this research to understand the role of the e-learning system in promoting digital culture at the University of Fallujah to help it spread and enhance its digital culture, by supporting, identifying, and establishing appropriate mechanisms that can enable it to perform its essential role in the era of digitizing human resources. The researchers used the descriptive analytical method in completing their research, for this purpose, a questionnaire was prepared consisting of 41 questions covering the research variables distributed over a sample of these academics at the university, numbering 296 teaching staff. The researchers used the method of random intentional sampling by distributing 85 questionnaires, of which 82 were retrieved, to constitute 96% of the questionnaires valid for statistical analysis. A set of statistical methods was used to analyze the study data using the statistical package (SPSS). The research reached a set of conclusions, including that e-learning systems have a major role in enhancing digital culture within the university, especially in light of the digital orientation of universities, which requires them to spread a digital culture on a large scale so that the teaching staff can perform their duties without fear or complaint about the future and the fluctuations and rapid changes it brings, thus enhancing the university’s ability to catch up with international universities that have made great strides in this field.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-199/v1?src=rss">Case Report: High-Flow Priapism After Vesicolithotripsy in an Adult Male: An Unusual Case Report [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                High-flow priapism is a rare, non-ischemic penile erection due to unregulated arterial inflow, usually from trauma. We report a 48-year-old male who developed high-flow priapism one day after vesicolithotripsy, with no trauma history. Despite pseudoephedrine, symptoms persisted. Examination showed a rigid, non-ischemic erection; a proximal shunt was performed after conservative measures failed. This case highlights a rare iatrogenic cause, possibly due to arterial injury from instrumentation or Foley removal. In settings without embolization access, surgical shunting remains a valid treatment. Early recognition is key to prevent complications and preserve erectile function.
