	<p>Disease modification trials in dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not met with success. One potential criticism of these trials is the lack of sensitive outcome measures. A large number of outcome measures have been employed in dementia and MCI trials. This review aims to describe and analyze the utility of cognitive/clinical outcome measures in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and MCI trials. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using relevant MeSH terms and exploded keywords. The search was confined to English language publications of human studies from the last five years which describe the latest trends in the use of outcome measures. Results: Despite broad use, the outcome measures employed are heterogeneous, with little data on correlations between scales. Another problem is that most studies are over-reliant on clinician/researcher assessment and cognitive outcomes, and there is a definite lack of stakeholder input. Finetuning of the paradigm is also required for people with early-stage disease, mild to moderate disease, and advanced dementia, as the outcome measures in these subgroups have varying relevance. Disease modification/prevention is an appropriate goal in early disease, whereas palliation and freedom from discomfort are paramount in later stages. The outcome measures selected must be suitable for and sensitive to these particular care goals. Although there is a shift to enrich MCI cohorts using a biomarker-based approach, the clinical relevance of such outcome measures remains uncertain. Conclusions: Outcome measures in dementia/MCI trials remain inhomogeneous and diverse, despite extensive use. Outcome measures fall within several paradigms, including cognitive, functional, quality-of-life, biomarker-based, and patient-reported outcome measures. The success of future disease-modifying trials is reliant to a large extent on the selection of outcome measures which combine all outcomes of clinical relevance as well as clinical meaning. Outcome measures should be tied to the type and stage of dementia and to the specific interventions employed.</p>

	<p>Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 40% of OCD patients show a poor response to CBT. This study aimed to identify the cortical structural factors that predict CBT outcomes in OCD patients. A total of 56 patients with OCD received baseline structural MRI (sMRI) scanning and 14 individual CBT sessions. The linear support vector regression (SVR) models were used to identify the predictive performance of sMRI indices, including gray matter volume, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and gyrification value. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; OC symptoms decreased significantly after CBT intervention (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We found the model with the comprehensive variables exhibited better performance than the models with single structural indices (MAE = 0.14, MSE = 0.03, R2 = 0.36), showing a significant correlation between the true value and the predicted value (r = 0.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The results indicated that a model integrating four cortical structural features can accurately predict the effectiveness of CBT for OCD. Future models incorporating other brain indicators, including brain functional indicators, EEG indicators, neurotransmitters, etc., which might be more accurate for predicting the effectiveness of CBT for OCD, are needed.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neuropathological studies have shown that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are heterogeneous in terms of myelin/axon damage and repair as well as iron content. However, it remains a challenge to identify specific chronic lesion types, especially remyelinated lesions, in vivo in patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed 3 studies: (1) a cross-sectional study in a prospective cohort of 115 patients with MS and 76 healthy controls, who underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), myelin water fraction (MWF), and neurite density index (NDI) maps. White matter (WM) lesions in QSM were classified into 5 QSM lesion types (iso-intense, hypo-intense, hyperintense, lesions with hypo-intense rims, and lesions with paramagnetic rim legions [PRLs]); (2) a longitudinal study of 40 patients with MS to study the evolution of lesions over 2 years; (3) a postmortem histopathology-QSM validation study in 3 brains of patients with MS to assess the accuracy of QSM classification to identify neuropathological lesion types in 63 WM lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, hypo- and isointense lesions showed higher mean MWF and NDI values compared to other QSM lesion types (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Further, at 2-year follow-up, hypo-/iso-intense lesions showed an increase in MWF. Postmortem analyses revealed that QSM highly accurately identifies (1) fully remyelinated areas as hypo-/iso-intense (sensitivity = 88.89% and specificity = 100%), (2) chronic inactive lesions as hyperintense (sensitivity = 71.43% and specificity = 92.00%), and (3) chronic active/smoldering lesions as PRLs (sensitivity = 92.86% and specificity = 86.36%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide the first evidence that it is possible to distinguish chronic MS lesions in a clinical setting, hereby supporting with new biomarkers to develop and assess remyelinating treatments. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are known to alter responses to empathic pain when used alone, however the effects of their combined use on empathy are unknown. In order to examine the effects of concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use on perspective-taking, we analyzed behavioral and neural changes on perspective-taking ability using event-related potentials. Methods: To this purpose, 13 long-term concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants users and 13 healthy controls performed a task designed to assess affective perspective-taking with simultaneous EEG recording. Results: The behavioral results revealed similar performance between groups. The neural results showed no significant differences between groups for the N170 and late positive potential (LPP) components. These results seem to suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants together does not affect perspective-taking abilities nor the processing of related information. Conclusions: The concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use seem to preserve the perspective-taking ability of social cognition.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the effects of demographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities on serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people without neurologic disease and establish demographic-specific reference ranges of sNfL.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a representative sample of the US population in which detailed information on demographic, lifestyle, routine laboratory tests, and overall health status are systematically collected. From stored serum samples, we measured sNfL levels using a novel high-throughput immunoassay (Siemens Healthineers). We evaluated the predictive capacity of 52 demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, anthropometric, or laboratory characteristics in explaining variability in sNfL levels. Predictive performance was assessed using cross-validated <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub>) and forward selection was used to obtain a set of best predictors of sNfL levels. Adjusted reference ranges were derived incorporating characteristics using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,706 NHANES participants (average age: 43.6 ± 14.8 y; 50.6% male, 35% non-white) without neurological disorders. In univariate models, age explained the most variability in sNfL (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub> = 26.8%). Multivariable prediction models for sNfL contained three covariates (in order of their selection): age, creatinine, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (standardized β—age: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 0.50; creatinine: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.22; HbA1c: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.11). Adjusted centile curves were derived incorporating identified predictors. We provide an interactive R Shiny application to translate our findings and allow other investigators to use the derived centile curves.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results will help to guide interpretation of sNfL levels as they relate to neurologic conditions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Didelphys uterus is one of the rarest Müllerian duct anomalies (MDA) of the female genital tract. Many remain undiagnosed due to possibilities of successful pregnancies and vaginal deliveries in those without or with mild forms of associated cervical and/or vaginal anomalies.  Due to this, data on didelphys uterus in pregnancy are rare, with most cases seen during routine ultrasound in pregnancies’ Caesarean section for other obstetric indications. This case was a 36-year-old G4P1+2 female who had successful vaginal delivery in her preceding pregnancy; in index pregnancy, she presented with fetal footling breech in labour and had an emergency caesarean section during which uterine didelphys was diagnosed. Many pregnant women with didelphys uterus will deliver vaginally and, as such, remain undiagnosed.  Its presence is one of the possible reasons for persistent abnormal presentations like fetal breech presentation, especially in women with prior successful vaginal deliveries. Early recognition and availability of facilities for management of such incidentally found cases of uterine didelphys will prevent many of the complications associated with pregnancy with them.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Direct Observation of Compartment-Specific Localization and Dynamics of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain enriched voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 are critical for electrical signaling in the CNS. Previous studies have extensively characterized cell-type-specific expression and electrophysiological properties of these two VGSCs and how their differences contribute to fine-tuning of neuronal excitability. However, because of a lack of reliable labeling and imaging methods, the subcellular localization and dynamics of these homologous Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 channels remain understudied. To overcome this challenge, we combined genome editing, super-resolution, and live-cell single-molecule imaging to probe subcellular composition, relative abundances, and trafficking dynamics of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 in cultured mouse and rat neurons and in male and female mouse brain. We discovered a previously uncharacterized trafficking pathway that targets Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 to the distal axon of unmyelinated neurons. This pathway uses distinct signals residing in the intracellular loop 1 between transmembrane domain I and II to suppress the retention of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 in the axon initial segment and facilitate its membrane loading at the distal axon. As mouse pyramidal neurons undergo myelination, Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 is gradually excluded from the distal axon as Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 becomes the dominant VGSC in the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier. In addition, we revealed exquisite developmental regulation of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 localizations in the axon initial segment and dendrites, clarifying the molecular identity of sodium channels in these subcellular compartments. Together, these results unveiled compartment-specific localizations and trafficking mechanisms for VGSCs, which could be regulated separately to modulate membrane excitability in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Direct observation of endogenous voltage-gated sodium channels reveals a previously uncharacterized distal axon targeting mechanism and the molecular identity of sodium channels in distinct subcellular compartments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Antiseizure Drug Perampanel Is a Subunit-Selective Negative Allosteric Modulator of Kainate Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perampanel (PMP) is a third-generation antiseizure drug reported to be a potent and selective noncompetitive negative allosteric modulator of one subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR), the &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-S-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). However, the recent structural resolution of AMPARs in complex with PMP revealed that its binding pocket is formed from residues that are largely conserved in two members of another family of iGluRs, the GluK4 and GluK5 kainate receptor (KAR) subunits. We show here that PMP inhibits both recombinant and neuronal KARs, contrary to the previous reports, and that the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) activity requires GluK5 subunits to be channel constituents. PMP inhibited heteromeric GluK1/GluK5 and GluK2/GluK5 KARs at IC<SUB>50</SUB> values comparable to that for AMPA receptors but was much less potent on homomeric GluK1 or GluK2 KARs. The auxiliary subunits Neto1 or Neto2 also made GluK2-containing KARs more sensitive to inhibition. Finally, PMP inhibited mouse neuronal KARs containing GluK5 subunits and Neto proteins in nociceptive dorsal root ganglia neurons and hippocampal mossy fiber&ndash;CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. These data suggest that clinical actions of PMP could arise from differential inhibition of AMPAR or KAR signaling and that more selective drugs might maintain antiseizure efficacy while reducing adverse effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> PMP is a regulatory approved antiseizure drug used for refractory partial-onset and generalized tonic-clonic seizures that acts as a selective negative allosteric modulator of AMPARs. Here, we demonstrate that PMP inhibits KARs, a second family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in addition to AMPARs. NAM activity on KARs required GluK5 subunits or Neto auxiliary subunits as channel constituents. KAR inhibition, therefore, could contribute to PMP antiseizure action or the adverse effects that are significant with this drug. Drug discovery aimed at more selective allosteric modulators that discriminate between AMPARs and KARs could yield next-generation drugs with improved therapeutic profiles for treatment of epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Migrating Pyramidal Neurons Require DSCAM to Bypass the Border of the Developing Cortical Plate</a></h4>

              
                <p>During mammalian neocortex development, nascent pyramidal neurons migrate along radial glial cells and overtake earlier-born neurons to terminate at the front of the developing cortical plate (CP), leading to the outward expansion of the CP border. While much has been learned about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the migration of pyramidal neurons, how migrating neurons bypass the preceding neurons at the end of migration to reach their final positions remains poorly understood. Here, we report that Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is required for migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors during the expansion of the upper cortical layers. DSCAM is a type I transmembrane cell adhesion molecule. It has been linked to Down syndrome through its location on Chromosome 21 trisomy and to autism spectrum disorders through loss-of-function mutations. <I>Ex vivo</I> time-lapse imaging demonstrates that DSCAM is required for migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors, crossing the CP border to expand the upper cortical layers. In <I>DSCAM</I>-deficient cortices, migrating neurons stop prematurely under the CP border, leading to thinner upper cortical layers with higher neuronal density. We further show that DSCAM weakens cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin in the upper cortical plate, allowing migrating neurons to traverse the CP border and expand the CP. These findings suggest that DSCAM is required for proper migratory termination and final positioning of nascent pyramidal neurons, which may provide insight into brain disorders that exhibit thinner upper layers of the cerebral cortex without neuronal loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Newly born neurons in the developing mammalian neocortex migrate outward toward the cortical surface, bypassing earlier born neurons to expand the developing cortex. How migrating neurons bypass the preceding neurons and terminate at the front of the expanding cortex remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), linked to Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, is required by migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors and terminate migration in the outwardly expanding cortical layer. Migrating neurons deficient in <I>DSCAM</I> stop prematurely, failing to expand the cortex. We further show that DSCAM likely mediates migratory termination by weakening cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Astrocytes Sustain Circadian Oscillation and Bidirectionally Determine Circadian Period, But Do Not Regulate Circadian Phase in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian clock of mammals, generating and transmitting an internal representation of environmental time that is produced by the cell-autonomous transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) of the 10,000 neurons and 3500 glial cells. Recently, we showed that TTFL function in SCN astrocytes alone is sufficient to drive circadian timekeeping and behavior, raising questions about the respective contributions of astrocytes and neurons within the SCN circuit. We compared their relative roles in circadian timekeeping in mouse SCN explants, of either sex. Treatment with the glial-specific toxin fluorocitrate revealed a requirement for metabolically competent astrocytes for circuit-level timekeeping. Recombinase-mediated genetically complemented Cryptochrome (Cry) proteins in Cry1-deficient and/or Cry2-deficient SCNs were used to compare the influence of the TTFLs of neurons or astrocytes in the initiation of <I>de novo</I> oscillation or in pacemaking. While neurons and astrocytes both initiated <I>de novo</I> oscillation and lengthened the period equally, their kinetics were different, with astrocytes taking twice as long. Furthermore, astrocytes could shorten the period, but not as potently as neurons. Chemogenetic manipulation of Gi- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways in neurons acutely advanced or delayed the ensemble phase, respectively. In contrast, comparable manipulations in astrocytes were without effect. Thus, astrocytes can initiate SCN rhythms and bidirectionally control the SCN period, albeit with lower potency than neurons. Nevertheless, their activation does not influence the SCN phase. The emergent SCN properties of high-amplitude oscillation, initiation of rhythmicity, pacemaking, and phase are differentially regulated: astrocytes and neurons sustain the ongoing oscillation, but its phase is determined by neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) encodes and disseminates time-of-day information to allow mammals to adapt their physiology to daily environmental cycles. Recent investigations have revealed a role for astrocytes, in addition to neurons, in the regulation of this rhythm. Using pharmacology, genetic complementation, and chemogenetics, we compared the abilities of neurons and astrocytes in determining the emergent SCN properties of high-amplitude oscillation, initiation of rhythmicity, pacemaking, and determination of phase. These findings parameterize the circadian properties of the astrocyte population in the SCN and reveal the types of circadian information that astrocytes and neurons can contribute within their heterogeneous cellular network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subthalamic Nucleus Modulation of the Pontine Nuclei and Its Targeting of the Cerebellar Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been implicated in motor and nonmotor tasks, and is an effective target of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, likely in part because of the STN's projections outside of the basal ganglia to other brain regions. While there is some evidence of a disynaptic connection between the STN and the cerebellum via the pontine nuclei (PN), how the STN modulates the activity of the neurons in the PN remains unknown. Here we addressed this question using a combination of anatomical tracings, optogenetics, and <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology in both wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice of both sexes. Approximately half of recorded neurons in the PN, which were located primarily in the medial area, responded with short latency to both single pulses and trains of optogenetic stimulation of channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing STN axons in awake, head-restrained mice. Furthermore, the increase in the activity of PN neurons correlated with the strength of activation of STN axons, suggesting that the STN projections to the PN could, in principle, encode information in a graded manner. In addition, transsynaptic retrograde tracing confirmed that the STN sends disynaptic projections to the cerebellar cortex. These results suggest that the STN sends robust functional projections to the PN, which then propagate to the cerebellum, and have important implications for understanding motor control of normal conditions, and Parkinsonian symptoms, where this pathway may have a role in the therapeutic efficacy of STN deep brain stimulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The primary excitatory nucleus in the basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus, is known to play a role in pathways modulating movement. The pontine nuclei are the main precerebellar nuclei, which transmit signals through their axonal projections to the cerebellum as mossy fibers. The pathway we have functionally characterized in this paper represents an additional cortex-independent pathway capable of relaying information between the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The effectiveness of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease suggests that this pathway could be explored as an avenue of investigation for therapeutic purposes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Muscarinic Acetylcholine M2 Receptors Regulate Lateral Habenula Neuron Activity and Control Cocaine Seeking Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lateral habenula (LHb) balances reward and aversion by opposing activation of brain reward nuclei and is involved in the inhibition of responding for cocaine in a model of impulsive behavior. Previously, we reported that the suppression of cocaine seeking was prevented by LHb inactivation or nonselective antagonism of LHb mAChRs. Here, we investigate mAChR subtypes mediating the effects of endogenous acetylcholine in this model of impulsive drug seeking and define cellular mechanisms in which mAChRs alter LHb neuron activity. Using <I>in vitro</I> electrophysiology, we find that LHb neurons are depolarized or hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonists oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) and carbachol (CCh), and that mAChRs inhibit synaptic GABA and glutamatergic inputs to these cells similarly in male and female rats. Synaptic effects of CCh were blocked by the M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChR (M<SUB>2</SUB>R) antagonist AFDX-116 and not by pirenzepine, an M<SUB>1</SUB>-mAChR (M<SUB>1</SUB>R) antagonist. Oxo-M-mediated depolarizing currents were also blocked by AFDX-116. Although M<SUB>2</SUB>R activation inhibited excitatory and inhibitory inputs to LHb neurons, the effect on excitation was greater, suggesting a shift in excitatory-inhibitory balance toward net inhibition. Activation of VTA inhibitory inputs to LHb neurons, via channelrhodopsin-2 expression, evoked IPSCs that were inhibited by M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs. Finally, we measured LHb-dependent operant response inhibition for cocaine and found it impaired by antagonism of M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs, and not M<SUB>1</SUB>Rs. In summary, we show that a cholinergic signal to LHb and activation of M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs are critical to enable inhibition of responding for cocaine, and we define cellular mechanisms through which this may occur.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain region receiving information from brain areas involved in decision-making, and its output influences motivation, reward, and movement. This interface between thoughts, emotions, and actions is how the LHb permits adaptive behavior, and LHb dysfunction is implicated in psychiatric and drug use disorders. Silencing the LHb impairs control over cocaine seeking in rats, and mAChRs are also implicated. Here, we measured cocaine seeking while blocking different mAChRs and examined mechanisms of mAChR effects on LHb neurons. M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChRs were necessary for control of cocaine seeking, and these receptors altered LHb neuron activity in several ways. Our study reveals that LHb M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChRs represent a potential target for treating substance use disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuromodulatory Mechanisms Underlying Contrast Gain Control in Mouse Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural adaptation enables the brain to efficiently process sensory signals despite large changes in background noise. Previous studies have established that recent background spectro- or spatio-temporal statistics scale neural responses to sensory stimuli via a canonical normalization computation, which is conserved among species and sensory domains. In the auditory pathway, one major form of normalization, termed contrast gain control, presents as decreasing instantaneous firing-rate gain, the slope of the neural input-output relationship, with increasing variability of background sound levels (contrast) across time and frequency. Despite this gain rescaling, mean firing-rates in auditory cortex become invariant to sound level contrast, termed contrast invariance. The underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms of these two phenomena remain unknown. To study these mechanisms in male and female mice, we used a 2-photon calcium imaging preparation in layer 2/3 neurons of primary auditory cortex (A1), along with pharmacological and genetic KO approaches. We found that neuromodulatory cortical synaptic zinc signaling is necessary for contrast gain control but not contrast invariance in mouse A1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When sound levels in the acoustic environment become more variable across time and frequency, the brain decreases response gain to maintain dynamic range and thus stimulus discriminability. This gain adaptation accounts for changes in perceptual judgments in humans and mice; however, the underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report context-dependent neuromodulatory effects of synaptic zinc that are necessary for contrast gain control in A1. Understanding context-specific neuromodulatory mechanisms, such as contrast gain control, provides insight into A1 cortical mechanisms of adaptation and also into fundamental aspects of perceptual changes that rely on gain modulation, such as attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Value, Confidence, Deliberation: A Functional Partition of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Demonstrated across Rating and Choice Tasks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deciding about courses of action involves minimizing costs and maximizing benefits. Decision neuroscience studies have implicated both the ventral and dorsal medial PFC (vmPFC and dmPFC) in signaling goal value and action cost, but the precise functional role of these regions is still a matter of debate. Here, we suggest a more general functional partition that applies not only to decisions but also to judgments about goal value (expected reward) and action cost (expected effort). In this conceptual framework, cognitive representations related to options (reward value and effort cost) are dissociated from metacognitive representations (confidence and deliberation) related to solving the task (providing a judgment or making a choice). We used an original approach aimed at identifying consistencies across several preference tasks, from likeability ratings to binary decisions involving both attribute integration and option comparison. fMRI results in human male and female participants confirmed the vmPFC as a generic valuation system, its activity increasing with reward value and decreasing with effort cost. In contrast, more dorsal regions were not concerned with the valuation of options but with metacognitive variables, confidence being reflected in mPFC activity and deliberation time in dmPFC activity. Thus, there was a dissociation between the effort attached to choice options (represented in the vmPFC) and the effort invested in deliberation (represented in the dmPFC), the latter being expressed in pupil dilation. More generally, assessing commonalities across preference tasks might help in reaching a unified view of the neural mechanisms underlying the cost/benefit tradeoffs that drive human behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decision neuroscience studies have implicated the medial PFC in forming the cognitive representations that drive human choice behavior. However, different studies using different tasks have suggested somewhat inconsistent links between precise computational variables and specific brain regions. Here, we use fMRI to demonstrate a robust functional partition of the medial PFC that generalizes across tasks involving an estimation of goal value and/or action cost to provide a judgment or make a choice. This general functional partition makes a critical dissociation between neural representations of decisional factors (the expected costs and benefits attached to a given option) and metacognitive estimates (confidence in the judgment or choice, and effort invested in the deliberation process).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Prefrontal-Amygdala Circuit Interactions Underlie Social and Nonsocial Valuation in Rhesus Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lesion studies in macaques suggest dissociable functions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial frontal cortex (MFC), with OFC being essential for goal-directed decision-making and MFC supporting social cognition. Bilateral amygdala damage results in impairments in both of these domains. There are extensive reciprocal connections between these prefrontal areas and the amygdala; however, it is not known whether the dissociable roles of OFC and MFC depend on functional interactions with the amygdala. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of male rhesus macaques (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) with crossed surgical disconnection of the amygdala and either MFC (MFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, <I>n</I> = 4) or OFC (OFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, <I>n</I> = 4) to a group of unoperated controls (CON, <I>n</I> = 5). All monkeys were assessed for their performance on two tasks to measure the following: (1) food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of social and nonsocial stimuli in a test of social interest and (2) object choices based on current food value using reinforcer devaluation in a test of goal-directed decision-making. Compared with the CON group, the MFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY group, but not the OFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY group, showed significantly reduced food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of conspecifics, indicating reduced social valuation and/or interest. By contrast, on the devaluation task, group OFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, but not group MFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, displayed deficits on object choices following changes in food value. These data indicate that the MFC and OFC must functionally interact with the amygdala to support normative social and nonsocial valuation, respectively.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ascribing value to conspecifics (social) versus objects (nonsocial) may be supported by distinct but overlapping brain networks. Here, we test whether two nonoverlapping regions of the prefrontal cortex, the medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, must causally interact with the amygdala to sustain social valuation and goal-directed decision-making, respectively. We found that these prefrontal-amygdala circuits are functionally dissociable, lending support for the idea that medial frontal and orbital frontal cortex make independent contributions to cognitive appraisals of the environment. These data provide a neural framework for distinct value assignment processes and may enhance our understanding of the cognitive deficits observed following brain injury or in the development of mental health disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pain, But Not Physical Activity, Is Associated with Gray Matter Volume Differences in Gulf War Veterans with Chronic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a significant burden for Persian Gulf War Veterans (GWVs), yet the causes are poorly understood. Brain structure abnormalities are observed in GWVs, however relationships with modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity (PA) are unknown. We evaluated gray matter volumes and associations with symptoms, PA, and sedentary time in GWVs with and without CMP. Ninety-eight GWVs (10 females) with CMP and 56 GWVs (7 females) controls completed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, pain and fatigue symptom questionnaires, and PA measurement via actigraphy. Regional gray matter volumes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and were compared across groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Separate multiple linear regression models were used to test associations between PA intensities, sedentary time, symptoms, and gray matter volumes. Familywise cluster error rates were used to control for multiple comparisons (&alpha; = 0.05). GWVs with CMP reported greater pain and fatigue symptoms, worse mood, and engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous PA and more sedentary time than healthy GWVs (all <I>p</I> values &lt; 0.05). GWVs with CMP had smaller gray matter volumes in the bilateral insula and larger volumes in the frontal pole (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05<SUB>adjusted</SUB>). Gray matter volumes in the left insula were associated with pain symptoms (<I>r</I><SUB>partial</SUB> = 0.26, &ndash;0.29; <I>p</I> &lt; 0.05<SUB>adjusted</SUB>). No significant associations were observed for either PA or sedentary time (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05<SUB>adjusted</SUB>). GWVs with CMP had smaller gray matter volumes within a critical brain region of the descending pain processing network and larger volumes within brain regions associated with pain sensation and affective processing, which may reflect pain chronification.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The pathophysiology of chronic pain in Gulf War veterans is understudied and not well understood. In a large sample of Gulf War veterans, we report veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain have smaller gray matter volumes in brain regions associated with pain regulation and larger volumes in regions associated with pain sensitivity compared with otherwise healthy Gulf War veterans. Gray matter volumes in regions of pain regulation were significantly associated with pain symptoms and encompassed the observed group brain volume differences. These results are suggestive of deficient pain modulation that may contribute to pain chronification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatic Genetics Analysis of Sleep in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Classical forward and reverse mouse genetics require germline mutations and, thus, are unwieldy to study sleep functions of essential genes or redundant pathways. It is also time-consuming to conduct EEG/EMG-based mouse sleep screening because of labor-intensive surgeries and genetic crosses. Here, we describe a highly accurate SleepV (video) system and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based adult brain chimeric (ABC)-expression/KO platform for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult male or female mice. A pilot ABC screen identifies CREB and CRTC1, of which constitutive or inducible expression significantly reduces quantity and/or quality of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Whereas ABC-KO of exon 13 of <I>Sik3</I> by AAV-Cre injection in <I>Sik3-E13<sup>flox/flox</sup></I> adult mice phenocopies <I>Sleepy (Sik3</I><sup><I>Slp</I>/+</sup><I>)</I> mice, ABC-CRISPR of <I>Slp/Sik3</I> reverses hypersomnia of <I>Sleepy</I> mice, indicating a direct role of SLP/SIK3 kinase in sleep regulation. Multiplex ABC-CRISPR of both orexin/hypocretin receptors causes narcolepsy episodes, enabling one-step analysis of redundant genes in adult mice. Therefore, this somatic genetics approach should facilitate high-throughput analysis of sleep regulatory genes, especially for essential or redundant genes, in adult mice by skipping mouse development and minimizing genetic crosses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The molecular mechanisms of mammalian sleep regulation remain unclear. Classical germline mouse genetics are unwieldy to study sleep functions of essential genes or redundant pathways. The EEG/EMG-based mouse sleep screening is time-consuming because of labor-intensive surgeries and lengthy genetic crosses. To overcome these "bottlenecks," we developed a highly accurate video-based sleep analysis system and adeno-associated virus-mediated ABC-expression/KO platform for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice. These methodologies facilitate rapid identification of sleep regulatory genes, but also efficient mechanistic studies of the molecular pathways of sleep regulation in mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Unbalanced Regulation of Sec22b and Ykt6 Blocks Autophagosome Axonal Retrograde Flux in Neuronal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cerebral ischemia&ndash;reperfusion (I/R) injury in ischemic penumbra is accountable for poor outcome of ischemic stroke patients receiving recanalization therapy. Compelling evidence previously demonstrated a dual role of autophagy in stroke. This study aimed to understand the traits of autophagy in the ischemic penumbra and the potential mechanism that switches the dual role of autophagy. We found that autophagy induction by rapamycin and lithium carbonate performed before ischemia reduced neurologic deficits and infarction, while autophagy induction after reperfusion had the opposite effect in the male murine middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model, both of which were eliminated in mice lacking autophagy (Atg7<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Nestin-Cre). Autophagic flux determination showed that reperfusion led to a blockage of axonal autophagosome retrograde transport in neurons, which then led to autophagic flux damage. Then, we found that I/R induced changes in the protein levels of Sec22b and Ykt6 in neurons, two autophagosome transport-related factors, in which Sec22b significantly increased and Ykt6 significantly decreased. In the absence of exogenous autophagy induction, Sec22b knock-down and Ykt6 overexpression significantly alleviated autophagic flux damage, infarction, and neurologic deficits in neurons or murine exposed to cerebral I/R in an autophagy-dependent manner. Furthermore, Sec22b knock-down and Ykt6 overexpression switched the outcome of rapamycin posttreatment from deterioration to neuroprotection. Thus, Sec22b and Ykt6 play key roles in neuronal autophagic flux, and modest regulation of Sec22b and Ykt6 may help to reverse the failure of targeting autophagy induction to improve the prognosis of ischemic stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The highly polarized architecture of neurons with neurites presents challenges for material transport, such as autophagosomes, which form at the neurite tip and need to be transported to the cell soma for degradation. Here, we demonstrate that Sec22b and Ykt6 act as autophagosome porters and play an important role in maintaining the integrity of neuronal autophagic flux. Ischemia&ndash;reperfusion (I/R)-induced excess Sec22b and loss of Ykt6 in neurons lead to axonal autophagosome retrograde trafficking failure, autophagic flux damage, and finally neuronal injury. Facilitated axonal autophagosome retrograde transport by Sec22b knock-down and Ykt6 overexpression may reduce I/R-induced neuron injury and extend the therapeutic window of pharmacological autophagy induction for neuroprotection.</p>

Transportation activities at Dock 16 Ilir in Palembang City, starts  with delivering items from the shop to the ship or vice versa by utilizing human strength in less ergonomic work positions with little consideration for the weight of the load. Whencarrying goods , the body is bent, the neck is bent, and the arms are distant from the body, putting the body  at a very high risk of injury. This type of working position causes muscle aches ranging from mild to severe. The personnel seen in this investigation were rice transporters and cement transporters. The aim  of this study is to quantify the workload and provide a design tool to help lessen worker concerns. The Nordic Body Map, Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), and Ovako Working Analysis System (OWAS)methodologies were used in this investigation. The study's findings showed that the five cement transport workers and four rice transport workers were at risk of developing muscoskeletal illnesses, with a risk level of 3 to 4, indicating that the risk category is very high and comprehensive treatment is required as soon as feasible. According to the OWAS technique, the posture of rice transportation employees has a value of 3, indicating that they are at high danger. Meanwhile, the working posture of cement transportation has a score of 7 with a risk level of 4, indicating that the danger of MSDS is very high. The developing aids are projected to lower the danger of Muscoskeletal Disorders in a backpack-like style that can resist large loads and reduce the risk of Muscoskeletal Disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fides: Reliable trust-region optimization for parameter estimation of ordinary differential equation models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fabian Fröhlich, Peter K. Sorger</p>

Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are widely used to study biochemical reactions in cellular networks since they effectively describe the temporal evolution of these networks using mass action kinetics. The parameters of these models are rarely known <i>a priori</i> and must instead be estimated by calibration using experimental data. Optimization-based calibration of ODE models on is often challenging, even for low-dimensional problems. Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain why biochemical model calibration is challenging, including non-identifiability of model parameters, but there are few comprehensive studies that test these hypotheses, likely because tools for performing such studies are also lacking. Nonetheless, reliable model calibration is essential for uncertainty analysis, model comparison, and biological interpretation.
We implemented an established trust-region method as a modular Python framework (fides) to enable systematic comparison of different approaches to ODE model calibration involving a variety of Hessian approximation schemes. We evaluated fides on a recently developed corpus of biologically realistic benchmark problems for which real experimental data are available. Unexpectedly, we observed high variability in optimizer performance among different implementations of the same mathematical instructions (algorithms). Analysis of possible sources of poor optimizer performance identified limitations in the widely used Gauss-Newton, BFGS and SR1 Hessian approximation schemes. We addressed these drawbacks with a novel hybrid Hessian approximation scheme that enhances optimizer performance and outperforms existing hybrid approaches. When applied to the corpus of test models, we found that fides was on average more reliable and efficient than existing methods using a variety of criteria. We expect fides to be broadly useful for ODE constrained optimization problems in biochemical models and to be a foundation for future methods development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">What are housekeeping genes?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chintan J. Joshi, Wenfan Ke, Anna Drangowska-Way, Eyleen J. O’Rourke, Nathan E. Lewis</p>

The concept of “housekeeping gene” has been used for four decades but remains loosely defined. Housekeeping genes are commonly described as “essential for cellular existence regardless of their specific function in the tissue or organism”, and “stably expressed irrespective of tissue type, developmental stage, cell cycle state, or external signal”. However, experimental support for the tenet that gene essentiality is linked to stable expression across cell types, conditions, and organisms has been limited. Here we use genome-scale functional genomic screens together with bulk and single-cell sequencing technologies to test this link and optimize a quantitative and experimentally validated definition of housekeeping gene. Using the optimized definition, we identify, characterize, and provide as resources, housekeeping gene lists extracted from several human datasets, and 10 other animal species that include primates, chicken, and <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. We find that stably expressed genes are not necessarily essential, and that the individual genes that are essential and stably expressed can considerably differ across organisms; yet the pathways enriched among these genes are conserved. Further, the level of conservation of housekeeping genes across the analyzed organisms captures their taxonomic groups, showing evolutionary relevance for our definition. Therefore, we present a quantitative and experimentally supported definition of housekeeping genes that can contribute to better understanding of their unique biological and evolutionary characteristics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AC-PCoA: Adjustment for confounding factors using principal coordinate analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Wang, Fengzhu Sun, Wei Lin, Shuqin Zhang</p>

Confounding factors exist widely in various biological data owing to technical variations, population structures and experimental conditions. Such factors may mask the true signals and lead to spurious associations in the respective biological data, making it necessary to adjust confounding factors accordingly. However, existing confounder correction methods were mainly developed based on the original data or the pairwise Euclidean distance, either one of which is inadequate for analyzing different types of data, such as sequencing data.
In this work, we proposed a method called Adjustment for Confounding factors using Principal Coordinate Analysis, or AC-PCoA, which reduces data dimension and extracts the information from different distance measures using principal coordinate analysis, and adjusts confounding factors across multiple datasets by minimizing the associations between lower-dimensional representations and confounding variables. Application of the proposed method was further extended to classification and prediction. We demonstrated the efficacy of AC-PCoA on three simulated datasets and five real datasets. Compared to the existing methods, AC-PCoA shows better results in visualization, statistical testing, clustering, and classification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Synchronous bilateral lipoma arborescens of the bicipitoradial bursa [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lipoma arborescens (LA) is an infrequent benign tumor made of mature sub-synovial fatty cell proliferation that may arise into the synovial joint, the bursae or the tendon sheaths. This condition affects mainly the knee joint, but the bicipitoradial bursa is an exceptional location. We report herein a case of a synchronous bilateral (LA) of the bicipitoradial bursa. Case presentation: A 52-year-old patient, with no medical history, presented with a swelling of both front arms that had been progressing for nine years. Physical examination showed a mass in the antecubital fossae of 3cm on the left side and 0.5cm on the right side. Both masses were tender, well-defined, fixed, without inflammatory signs and painful on elbow flexion. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, revealing the presence of a septate soft-tissue mass of the distal portion of the brachial muscle of 70x46x27mm. This mass had a heterogeneous fat signal in its depth and a homogeneous fat composition on the outside. The diagnosis of liposarcoma was suspected. The patient underwent surgery to remove both masses. Gross examination showed a characteristic frond-like or digitiform pattern. Microscopical examination demonstrated papillary proliferation of the synovial villi. The final diagnosis was of LA. The patient had no complications and there was no recurrence of LA. Conclusions: LA is a rare condition, and the bicipitoradial bursa is an exceptional location. Histological confirmation is mandatory to correct the diagnosis.

                Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly critically ill patients. It poses a public health challenge in resource-constrained settings due to high administrative costs. AKI is commonly misdiagnosed due to its painless onset and late disruption of serum creatinine, which is the gold standard biomarker for AKI diagnosis. There is increasing research into the use of early biomarkers and the development of predictive models for early AKI diagnosis using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. This field note provides insight into the challenges of using available AKI prediction models in resource-constrained environments, as well as perspectives that practitioners in these settings may find useful

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Emergency contraception from historical myth to modern reality: a historical timeline and updated interpretation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Emergency contraception is the use of a birth control method after coitus has taken place and there is a fear that it may lead to a pregnancy. Historical attempts were more likely to be harmful rather than effective. Oral estrogens, progestins, anti-progesterone, and partial agonist/antagonists of progesterone have all been used with varying degrees of efficacy. Currently ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel combinations, levonorgestrel alone, ulipristal acetate, and mifepristone are the usual oral methods depending on availability. Copper carrying and more recently levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine devices have also been used successfully. The intrauterine devices appear to be more effective than the oral methods and are also regular contraceptive methods and in addition have therapeutic properties. Background: The evolution from longer duration oral treatments with side effects to the current single tablet of levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone with low side effects and reasonable efficacy is described. The role of the highly effective copper intrauterine device and now also the levonorgestrel intrauterine device for emergency contraception is examined. Conclusion: Oral emergency contraception is a short term solution. Expanding emergency contraception to include the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine device may provide long term contraception and health benefits as well as providing emergency contraception.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Records of antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to COVID-19: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby's immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

                Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. IFNs need to be controlled, as sustained levels have detrimental effects on disease outcome. van der Sluis et al examine the importance of pCDs in protection against SARS-CoV-2, but also how they contribute to chronic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intracerebral mechanisms explaining the impact of incidental feedback on mood state and risky choice</a></h4>

              
                Identifying factors whose fluctuations are associated with choice inconsistency is a major issue for rational decision theory. Here, we investigated the neuro-computational mechanisms through which mood fluctuations may bias human choice behavior. Intracerebral EEG data were collected in a large group of subjects (n = 30), while they were performing interleaved quiz and choice tasks that were designed to examine how a series of unrelated feedbacks affects decisions between safe and risky options. Neural baseline activity preceding choice onset was confronted first to mood level, estimated by a computational model integrating the feedbacks received in the quiz task, and then to the weighting of option attributes, in a computational model predicting risk attitude in the choice task. Results showed that 1) elevated broadband gamma activity (BGA) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal anterior insula (daIns) was respectively signaling periods of high and low mood, 2) increased vmPFC and daIns BGA respectively promoted and tempered risk taking by overweighting gain versus loss prospects. Thus, incidental feedbacks induce brain states that correspond to different moods and bias the evaluation of risky options. More generally, these findings might explain why people experiencing positive (or negative) outcome in some part of their life tend to expect success (or failure) in any other.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Meta-Research: How parenthood contributes to gender gaps in academia</a></h4>

              
                Being a parent has long been associated with gender disparities in academia. However, details of the mechanisms by which parenthood and gender influence academic career achievement and progression are not fully understood. Here, using data from a survey of 7,764 academics in North America and publication data from the Web of Science, we analyze gender differences in parenthood and academic achievements and explore the influence of work-family conflict and partner support on these gender gaps. Our results suggest that gender gaps in academic achievement are, in fact, 'parenthood gender gaps'. Specifically, we found significant gender gaps in all measures of academic achievement (both objective and subjective) in the parent group but not in the non-parent group. Mothers are more likely than fathers to experience higher levels of work-family conflict and to receive lower levels of partner support, contributing significantly to the gender gaps in academic achievement for the parent group. We also discuss possible interventions and actions for reducing gender gaps in academia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Using adopted individuals to partition indirect maternal genetic effects into prenatal and postnatal effects on offspring phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Maternal genetic effects can be defined as the effect of a mother's genotype on the phenotype of her offspring, independent of the offspring's genotype. Maternal genetic effects can act via the intrauterine environment during pregnancy and/or via the postnatal environment. In this manuscript, we present a simple extension to the basic adoption design that uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to partition maternal genetic effects into prenatal and postnatal effects. We assume that in biological families, offspring phenotypes are influenced prenatally by their mother's genotype and postnatally by both parents' genotypes, whereas adopted individuals' phenotypes are influenced prenatally by their biological mother's genotype and postnatally by their adoptive parents' genotypes. Our SEM framework allows us to model the (potentially) unobserved genotypes of biological and adoptive parents as latent variables, permitting us in principle to leverage the thousands of adopted singleton individuals in the UK Biobank. We examine the power, utility and type I error rate of our model using simulations and asymptotic power calculations. We apply our model to polygenic scores of educational attainment and birth weight associated variants, in up to 5178 adopted singletons, 943 trios, 2687 mother-offspring pairs, 712 father-offspring pairs and 347980 singletons from the UK Biobank. Our results show the expected pattern of maternal genetic effects on offspring birth weight, but unexpectedly large prenatal maternal genetic effects on offspring educational attainment. Sensitivity and simulation analyses suggest this result may be at least partially due to adopted individuals in the UK Biobank being raised by their biological relatives. We show that accurate modelling of these sorts of cryptic relationships is sufficient to bring type I error rate under control and produce asymptotically unbiased estimates of prenatal and postnatal maternal genetic effects. We conclude that there would be considerable value in following up adopted individuals in the UK Biobank to determine whether they were raised by their biological relatives, and if so, to precisely ascertain the nature of these relationships. These adopted individuals could then be incorporated into informative statistical genetics models like the one described in our manuscript to further elucidate the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A CD4+ T cell reference map delineates subtype-specific adaptation during acute and chronic viral infections</a></h4>

              
                CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical orchestrators of immune responses against a large variety of pathogens, including viruses. The multifaceted roles of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including their help to innate cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T and B cells and their support for long-lived immunity rely on a profound functional heterogeneity. While multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes and their key transcriptional regulators have been identified, there is a lack of consistent definition for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transcriptional states. In addition, the progressive changes affecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes during and after immune responses remain poorly defined. Taking advantage of single-cell transcriptomics, efficient computational methods, and robust animal models, we characterize the transcriptional landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to self-resolving and chronic viral infections. We build a comprehensive map of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and their evolution over time, and identify six major distinct cell states that are consistently observed in acute and chronic infections in mice. During the course of acute infections, T cell composition progressively changes from effector to memory states, with subtype-specific gene modules and kinetics. Conversely, T cells in persistent infections fail to transition from effector to memory states, and acquire distinct, chronicity-associated transcriptional programs. By single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis, we characterize the clonal structure of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells across individuals and T cell subtypes. We find that virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are essentially private across individuals and that most T cells differentiate into both Tfh and Th1 subtypes irrespective of their TCR, in both acute and chronic infections. Finally, we show that our CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell map can be used as a reference to accurately interpret cell states in external single-cell datasets across tissues and disease models. Overall, this study describes a previously unappreciated level of adaptation of the transcriptional states of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to viruses and provides a new computational resource for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell analysis, available online at https://spica.unil.ch.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HIF-1α induces glycolytic reprograming in tissue-resident alveolar macrophages to promote cell survival during acute lung injury</a></h4>

              
                Cellular metabolism is a critical regulator of macrophage effector function. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs) inhabit a unique niche marked by high oxygen and low glucose. We have recently shown that in contrast to bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), TR-AMs do not utilize glycolysis and instead predominantly rely on mitochondrial function for their effector response. It is not known how changes in local oxygen concentration that occur during conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) might affect TR-AM metabolism and function; however, ARDS is associated with progressive loss of TR-AMs, which correlates with the severity of disease and mortality. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia robustly stabilizes HIF-1α in TR-AMs to promote a glycolytic phenotype. Hypoxia altered TR-AM metabolite signatures, cytokine production, and decreased their sensitivity to the inhibition of mitochondrial function. By contrast, hypoxia had minimal effects on BMDM metabolism. The effects of hypoxia on TR-AMs were mimicked by FG-4592, a HIF-1α stabilizer. Treatment with FG-4592 decreased TR-AM death and attenuated acute lung injury in mice. These findings reveal the importance of microenvironment in determining macrophage metabolic phenotype, and highlight the therapeutic potential in targeting cellular metabolism to improve outcomes in diseases characterized by acute inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human muscle spindles are wired to function as controllable signal-processing devices</a></h4>

              
                Muscle spindles are encapsulated sensory organs found in most of our muscles. Prevalent models of sensorimotor control assume the role of spindles is to reliably encode limb posture and movement. Here, I argue that the traditional view of spindles is outdated. Spindle organs can be tuned by spinal γ motor neurons that receive top-down and peripheral input, including from cutaneous afferents. A new model is presented, viewing γ motor activity as an intermediate coordinate transformation that allows multimodal information to converge on spindles, creating flexible coordinate representations at the level of the peripheral nervous system. That is, I propose that spindles play a unique overarching role in the nervous system: that of a peripheral signal-processing device that flexibly facilitates sensorimotor performance, according to task characteristics. This role is compatible with previous findings and supported by recent studies with naturalistically active humans. Such studies have so far shown that spindle tuning enables the independent preparatory control of reflex muscle stiffness, the selective extraction of information during implicit motor adaptation, and for segmental stretch reflexes to operate in joint space. Incorporation of advanced signal-processing at the periphery may well prove a critical step in the evolution of sensorimotor control theories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-EM structures reveal that RFC recognizes both the 3′- and 5′-DNA ends to load PCNA onto gaps for DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                RFC uses ATP to assemble PCNA onto primed sites for replicative DNA polymerases d and e. The RFC pentamer forms a central chamber that binds 3′ ss/ds DNA junctions to load PCNA onto DNA during replication. We show here five structures that identify a 2<sup>nd</sup> DNA binding site in RFC that binds a 5′ duplex. This 5′ DNA site is located between the N-terminal BRCT domain and AAA+ module of the large Rfc1 subunit. Our structures reveal ideal binding to a 7-nt gap, which includes 2 bp unwound by the clamp loader. Biochemical studies show enhanced binding to 5 and 10 nt gaps, consistent with the structural results. Because both 3′ and 5′ ends are present at a ssDNA gap, we propose that the 5′ site facilitates RFC’s PCNA loading activity at a DNA damage-induced gap to recruit gap-filling polymerases. These findings are consistent with genetic studies showing that base excision repair of gaps greater than 1 base requires PCNA and involves the 5′ DNA binding domain of Rfc1. We further observe that a 5′ end facilitates PCNA loading at an RPA coated 30-nt gap, suggesting a potential role of the RFC 5′-DNA site in lagging strand DNA synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correction of susceptibility distortion in EPI: a semi-supervised approach with deep learning.</a></h4>

              
                Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the most common approach for acquiring diffusion and functional MRI data due to its high temporal resolution. However, this comes at the cost of higher sensitivity to susceptibility-induced B0 field inhomogeneities around air/tissue interfaces. This leads to severe geometric distortions along the phase encoding direction (PED). To correct this distortion, the standard approach involves an analogous acquisition using an opposite PED leading to images with inverted distortions and then non-linear image registration, with a transformation model constrained along the PED, to estimate the voxel-wise shift that undistorts the image pair and generates a distortion-free image. With conventional image registration approaches, this type of processing is computationally intensive. Recent advances in unsupervised deep learning-based approaches to image registration have been proposed to drastically reduce the computational cost of this task. However, they rely on maximizing an intensity-based similarity measure, known to be suboptimal surrogate measures of image alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm that directly leverages ground truth spatial transformations during training. Simulated and real data experiments demonstrate improvement to distortion field recovery compared to the unsupervised approach, improvement image similarity compared to supervised approach and precision similar to TOPUP but with much faster processing.

                The asymmetric summation of kinetically distinct glutamate inputs across the dendrites of retinal "starburst" amacrine cells is proposed to underlie their direction selective properties, but experimentally verifying input kinetics has been challenging. Here, we used two-photon glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging to directly measure the input kinetics across individual starburst dendrites. We found that signals measured from proximal dendrites were relatively sustained compared to those measured from distal dendrites. These differences were observed across a range of stimulus sizes and appeared to be shaped mainly by excitatory rather than inhibitory network interactions. Temporal deconvolution analysis suggests that the steady-state vesicle release rate was ~ 3 times larger at proximal sites compared to distal sites. Using a connectomics-inspired computational model, we demonstrate that input kinetics play an important role in shaping direction selectivity at low stimulus velocities. Together, these results provide direct support for the  space-time wiring model for direction selectivity.

                How neurogenesis and gliogenesis are coordinated during development and why mature glial cells often share properties with neuroectodermal progenitors remains unclear. Here, we have used single cell RNA sequencing to map the regulatory landscape of neuronal and glial differentiation in the mammalian enteric nervous system (ENS). Our analysis indicates that neurogenic trajectories branch directly from a linear gliogenic axis defined by autonomic neural crest cells adopting sequential states as they progressively lose their strong neurogenic bias and acquire properties of adult enteric glia. We identify gene modules associated with transcriptional programs driving enteric neurogenesis and cell state transitions along the gliogenic axis. By comparing the chromatin accessibility profile of autonomic neural crest and adult enteric glia we provide evidence that the latter maintain an epigenetic memory of their neurogenic past. Finally, we demonstrate that adult enteric glia maintain neurogenic potential and are capable of generating enteric neurons in certain contexts by activating transcriptional programs employed by early ENS progenitors. Our studies uncover a novel configuration of enteric neurogenesis and gliogenesis that enables the coordinate development of ENS lineages and provides a mechanistic explanation for the ability of enteric glia to be functionally integrated into the adult intestine and simultaneously maintain attributes of early ENS progenitors.

                Geometric descriptions of deep neural networks (DNNs) have the potential to uncover core principles of computational models in neuroscience, while abstracting over the details of model architectures and training paradigms. Here we examined the geometry of DNN models of visual cortex by quantifying the latent dimensionality of their natural image representations. The prevailing view holds that optimal DNNs compress their representations onto low-dimensional manifolds to achieve invariance and robustness, which suggests that better models of visual cortex should have low-dimensional geometries. Surprisingly, we found a strong trend in the opposite direction---neural networks with high-dimensional image manifolds tend to have better generalization performance when predicting cortical responses to held-out stimuli in both monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data. These findings held across a diversity of design parameters for DNNs, and they suggest a general principle whereby high-dimensional geometry confers a striking benefit to DNN models of visual cortex.

                Numerous T1- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have separately assessed the contribution of hippocampal gray matter macrostructure (volume) and macrostructure (diffusion) to age-related declines in episodic memory, respectively. Here, we simultaneously examined the unique and joint contribution of these distinct imaging modalities in the same sample of 84 young and 66 older adults who underwent a structural MRI protocol and completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. As expected, older age was significantly related to smaller volume and higher diffusion (intracellular, dispersion, and free) in bilateral hippocampus and to worse episodic memory performance (immediate and delayed free recall, recognition). Structural equation modelling further revealed that the age-memory relationship was significantly mediated by hippocampal diffusion, but not volume. A non-significant influential indirect effect further revealed that volume and diffusion did not jointly mediate the age-memory relationship. These findings indicate that hippocampal microstructure uniquely contributes to age-related declines in episodic memory and suggest that microstructure and macrostructure capture distinct neurobiological properties of hippocampal gray matter.

                Risky decisions involve choosing between options where the outcomes are uncertain. Cognitive tasks such as the CANTAB Cambridge Gamble Task (CGT) have revealed that patients with depression make more conservative decisions, but the mechanisms of choice evaluation underlying such decisions, and how they lead to the observed differences in depression, remain unknown. To test this, we used a computational modelling approach in a broad general-population sample (N = 753) who performed the CANTAB CGT and completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of mental illness, including depression. We fit five different computational models to the data, including two novel ones, and found that a novel model that uses an inverse power function in the loss domain (contrary to standard Prospect Theory accounts), and is influenced by the probabilities but not the magnitudes of different outcomes, captures the characteristics of our dataset very well. Surprisingly, model parameters were not significantly associated with any mental health questionnaire scores, including depression scales; but they were related to demographic variables, particularly age, with stronger associations than typical model-agnostic task measures. This study showcases a new methodology to analyse data from CANTAB CGT, describes a noteworthy null finding with respect to mental health symptoms, and demonstrates the added precision that a computational approach can offer.

                Recently, a new kind of sensor applicable in magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been presented: a solid-state yttrium-iron garnet magnetometer (YIGM). The feasibility of YIGM was proved in alpha-rhythm registration experiment. In the current paper, we propose the analysis of lead-field matrices for different possible YIGM multi-channel on-scalp sensor layouts with respect to the information theory. We use real noise level of the new sensor to compute signal power, signal-to-noise ration (SNR) and total information capacity, and compare them with corresponding metrics that can be obtained with well-established MEG systems: based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). This simulation study is aimed to shed some light on the direction for further development of YIGM sensor, namely creation of multi-channel YIG-MEG.

                To understand how pharmacological interventions can exert their powerful effects on brain function, we need to understand how they engage the brain's rich neurotransmitter landscape. Here, we bridge microscale molecular chemoarchitecture and pharmacologically-induced macroscale functional reorganisation, by relating the regional distribution of 18 neurotransmitter receptors and transporters obtained from Positron Emission Tomography, and the regional changes in functional MRI connectivity induced by 7 different mind-altering drugs including anaesthetics, psychedelics, and cognitive enhancers. Our results reveal that psychoactive drugs exert their effects on brain function by engaging multiple neurotransmitter systems. Intriguingly, the effects of both anaesthetics and psychedelics on brain function, though opposite, are organised along hierarchical gradients of brain structure and function. Finally, we show that regional co-susceptibility to pharmacological interventions recapitulates co-susceptibility to disorder-induced structural alterations. Collectively, these results highlight rich statistical patterns relating molecular chemoarchitecture and drug-induced reorganisation of the brain's functional architecture.

                Dexterous object manipulation depends critically on information about forces normal and tangential to the fingerpads, and also on torque associated with object orientation at grip surfaces. In this study we investigated how torque information is encoded by human tactile afferents, including slowly adapting type-II (SA-II) afferents, in the fingerpads. SA-II afferent properties seemed perfectly suited for torque encoding but could not be previously investigated as they are absent in the glabrous skin of monkeys. Torques of different magnitudes (3.5-7.5 mNm) were applied in clockwise and anticlockwise directions to a standard central site on the fingerpads of 34 participants. Torques were superimposed on a 2 N, 3 N, or 4 N background normal force. Unitary microneurography recordings were made from fast adapting type-I (FA-I, n=39), slowly adapting type-I (SA-I, n=31), and type-II (SA-II, n=13) afferents supplying the fingerpads. All three afferent types encoded torque magnitude and direction, with SA-II afferents showing excitatory and inhibitory modulation depending on torque direction. Most afferents of all three types had higher torque sensitivity with smaller normal force. FA-I afferents showed the best torque magnitude and worst directional discrimination abilities in both species. Human SA-I afferent response to static torque was inferior to dynamic stimuli, while in monkeys the opposite was true. In humans this might be compensated by the addition of a sustained SA-II afferent input. In comparison to monkeys the performance of each afferent type was inferior in humans, likely due to differences in fingertip tissue compliance and skin friction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">"Leap before you look": Conditions that promote implicit visuomotor adaptation without explicit learning</a></h4>

              
                When learning a novel visuomotor mapping (e.g., mirror writing), accuracy can improve quickly through explicit learning (e.g., move left to go right) but after considerable practice, implicit learning takes over, producing fast, natural movements. This implicit learning occurs automatically, but it has been unknown whether explicit learning is similarly obligatory. Using a reaching task with a 90-degree rotation between screen position and movement direction, we found that explicit learning could be "turned off" by introducing the rotation gradually (increments of 10-degrees) and instructing participants to move quickly. These specific conditions were crucial, because both explicit and implicit learning occurred if the rotation occurred suddenly, if participants were told to emphasize accuracy, or if visual feedback during movement was removed. We reached these conclusions by examining the time course of learning (e.g., whether there was fast improvement followed by a long tail of additional improvement), by examining the aftereffects of learning when the rotation was abruptly removed, and by using formal model comparison between a dual-state (explicit and implicit) versus a single-state learning model as applied to the data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cervical Spinal Cord Modulation with Repeated Epidural Stimulation in Healthy Adult Rats</a></h4>

              
                The effects of spinal epidural stimulation (ES) in regaining various physiological functions after a spinal cord injury (SCI) are well documented. Spinal evoked motor responses (SEMR) are commonly utilized experimental outcomes in longitudinal pre-clinical and human studies to reflect the in-vivo physiological changes in neural networks secondary to a neurological insult or neuro-rehabilitative treatments utilizing ES. However, it remains unknown if the repeated exposure to ES during SEMRs testing itself modulates the spinal cord physiology and hence the SEMRs characteristics. To address this issue, cervical ES was delivered to the healthy adult rats' cervical cord using standard stimulation paradigms during multiple sessions (~17 hours that spanned across 100 days). Cervical SEMR and electromyography (EMG) activity from forelimb muscles during a reaching & grasping task were collected before and after 100 days. We noted persistent increase in the cervical SEMR and forelimb muscle activity during reaching & grasping task relative to baseline at the end of the stimulation period indicating increased spinal and cortical excitability. Findings from the present work suggests that cervical SEMRs are amenable to modulation by routine ES testing protocols, with prominent changes in the mono and poly synaptic component of evoked responses. Additionally, since multiple testing sessions of cervical ES alone increases the excitability of the intact spinal cord, we suggest that SEMR data be used with caution to infer the physiological status of the spinal circuitry in longitudinal studies involving multiple SEMR testing sessions. Our findings also recommend involving appropriate control groups, motor behavior correlates, and practicing caution while utilizing normalization methods to allow meaningful functional interpretation of SEMR profiles following a SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular Neurobiology of Loss</a></h4>

              
                Psychological loss is a common experience that erodes well-being and negatively impacts quality of life. The molecular underpinnings of loss are poorly understood, making it challenging to develop treatment strategies. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of loss using an enrichment removal (ER) paradigm in rats. A comprehensive multi-omics investigation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), spanning multiple cohorts, platforms, and analyses, revealed alterations in microglia and extracellular matrix (ECM). Follow-up studies indicated that ER decreased microglia size, complexity, and phagocytosis, suggesting reduced immune surveillance. Loss also substantially increased ECM coverage, specifically targeting perineuronal nets surrounding parvalbumin interneurons, suggesting decreased plasticity and increased inhibition in the BLA. Behavioral analyses suggests that these molecular effects are linked to impaired BLA salience evaluation and flexibility, phenotypes that resemble emotional blunting observed in human loss. Taken together, these experiments help us understand the mechanisms underlying loss and reveal novel molecular targets to ameliorate its impact.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plan versus motion-referenced generalization of fast and slow processes in reach adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Generalization in motor learning refers to the transfer of a learned compensation to other relevant contexts. The generalization function is typically assumed to be of Gaussian shape, centered on the planned motion, although more recent studies associate generalization with the actual motion. Because motor learning is thought to involve multiple adaptive processes with different time constants, we hypothesized that these processes have different time-dependent contributions to the generalization. Guided by a model-based approach, the objective of the present study was to experimentally examine these contributions. We first reformulated a validated two-state adaptation model as a combination of weighted motor primitives, each specified as a Gaussian-shaped tuning function. Adaptation in this model is achieved by updating individual weights of the primitives of the fast and slow adaptive process separately. Depending on whether updating occurred in a plan-referenced or a motion-referenced manner, the model predicted distinct contributions to the overall generalization by the slow and fast process. We tested 23 participants in a reach adaptation task, using a spontaneous recovery paradigm consisting of five successive blocks of a long adaptation phase to a viscous force field, a short adaptation phase with the opposite force, and an error-clamp phase. Generalization was assessed in eleven movement directions relative to the trained target direction. Results of our participant population fell within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced to evidence for motion-referenced updating. This mixture may reflect the differential weighting of explicit and implicit compensation strategies among participants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intense light unleashes male courtship behaviorin wild-type Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Studies of the Drosophila courtship repertoire have elucidated several principles of the neurogenetic organization of complex behavior. Based on a multi-modal integration of olfactory, gustatory, visual, and acoustic cues, males perform stereotypic patterns of chasing, courtship song production, and copulation attempts (Hall, 1994; Yamamoto & Koganezawa, 2013). Here we report a serendipitous finding that intense light (~18 klx, comparable to direct sunlight) induces courtship-associated motor activity in wild-type (WT) male flies, including chasing with wing extension and song production. The intensified male courtship behavior was directed to both male or female targets, as shown in both male-only and mixed sex arenas. However, in male-only chambers, we found extreme behavioral manifestations such as "chaining" and "wheeling", which resembled previously reported homosexual behavior in certain mini-white+ constructs (Zhang & Odenwald, 1995; Yin Hing & Carlson, 1996) and fruitless mutants (Ito et al., 1996). Investigations into the required sensory systems, yielded results of strong implications. In visual system mutants with defective photo-sensitive or screening pigments (norpA), the phenomenon was absent. Even in sevenless mutants, where the high-acuity blue/UV channels are disrupted but motion sensitivity is preserved (Yamaguchi, Wolf, Desplan, & Heisenberg, 2008), light-triggered courtship was greatly attenuated. However, light-induced courtship was unhampered in flies lacking acoustic signals (with wings cut to disrupt song production). Strikingly, we observed unrestrained male-male courtship behavior in olfactory mutants (orco and sbl). Particularly, orco males displayed maximum courtship scores regardless of light intensity. Together our observations support the notion that male courtship is restrained by olfactory cues and can be unleashed by strong visual stimulation in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">OptoPi: An open source flexible platform for the analysis of small animal behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Behaviour is the ultimate output of neural circuit computations, and therefore its analysis is a cornerstone of neuroscience research. However, every animal and experimental paradigm requires different illumination conditions to capture and, in some cases, manipulate specific behavioural features. This means that researchers often develop, from scratch, their own solutions and experimental set-ups. Here, we present OptoPi, an open source, affordable, behavioural arena with accompanying multi-animal tracking software. The system features highly customisable and reproducible visible and infrared illumination and allows for temporally precise optogenetic stimulation. OptoPi acquires images using a Raspberry Pi camera, features motorised LED-based illumination, Arduino control, as well as spectrum and irradiance monitoring to fine-tune illumination conditions with real time feedback. Our open-source software (BIO) can be used to simultaneously track multiple animals while accurately keeping individual animal's identity both in on-line and off-line modes. We demonstrate the functionality of OptoPi by recording and tracking under different illumination conditions the spontaneous behaviour of larval zebrafish as well as adult Drosophila flies and their first instar larvae, an experimental animal that due to its small size and transparency has classically been hard to track. Further, we showcase OptoPi's optogenetic capabilities through a series of experiments using transgenic Drosophila larvae.

                Lewy body dementias are pathologically defined by the deposition of -synuclein fibrils into inclusions throughout the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from cases harbors circulating -synuclein-fibril seeds, and parental -synuclein fibrils can template core structure into amplified fibrils. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we identify six novel -synuclein fibril assemblies amplified from ten CSF samples (3.8 [A] to 2.9 [A] nominal resolutions). Fibrils are classified based on two types of filament interaction, two types of {beta}-sheet stacking, and two types of hydrophobic pocket. CSF-amplified fibril products have one, two, or three distinct assemblies each. Six of ten samples share a common fibril assembly. Within this classification, the fibrils have distinct profiles in amyloid dye binding, and dramatically different potencies in both seeding new inclusions in neurons and evoked microglial pro-inflammatory responses. However, no single structural feature predicts functional phenotypes. Our results highlight CSF as a valuable resource to identify novel -synuclein assemblies potentially important in disease.

                The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is a major hub that receives sensory information from both internal and external environments. Specific populations of PBN neurons are involved in behaviors including food and water intake, pain sensation, breathing regulation, as well as learning and responding appropriately to threatening stimuli. However, it is unclear how many PBN neuron populations exist and how different behaviors may be encoded by unique signaling molecules or receptors. Here we provide a repository of data on the molecular identity, spatial location, and projection patterns on dozens of PBN neuron subclusters. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified 21 subclusters of neurons in the PBN and neighboring regions. Multiplexed in situ hybridization showed many of these subclusters are localized to distinct PBN subregions. We also describe two major ascending pathways that innervate distinct brain regions by analyzing axonal projections in 21 Cre-driver lines of mice. These results are all publicly available for download and provide a foundation for further interrogation of PBN functions and connections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian regulation of hippocampal function is disrupted with chronic corticosteroid treatment</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depression and schizophrenia are highly prevalent and contribute substantially to disease burden worldwide. Despite this, progress understanding the pathophysiology has remained largely elusive, yet these disorders often exhibit a loss of regulation of biological rhythms, such as sleep/wake cycles and hormonal rhythms. Cushing's disease, a condition characterized by chronic corticosteroid (cortisol) hypersecretion is associated with psychiatric and neurocognitive disorders and disruption to the circadian release of cortisol can result in depression and neurocognitive impairment. In rats, we report that circadian regulation of the hippocampal transcriptome integrates crucial functional networks that link corticosteroid-inducible gene regulation to synaptic plasticity regulation via an intra-hippocampal circadian transcriptional clock. During the early active period, when corticosteroid availability is high, CA1 region excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents were augmented along with long-term potentiation. In contrast, chronic corticosteroid exposure disturbed hippocampal function. The hippocampal transcriptome, as well as circadian regulation of synaptic plasticity were ablated, resulting in memory loss during hippocampal-dependent behavior. These findings identify how exposure to elevated levels of corticosteroid, that is often seen in neuropsychiatric illness, results in adverse critical hippocampal function. These data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of neurocognitive disorders and provides evidence for corticosteroid-mediated intervention in disabling mental illnesses.

                Fluctuations in brain and behavioral state are supported by broadly projecting neuromodulatory systems. In this study, we use mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging to examine spontaneous activity of cholinergic and noradrenergic axons in awake mice, in order to determine the interaction between arousal/movement state transitions and neuromodulatory activity across the dorsal cortex at distances separated by up to 4 mm. We confirm that GCaMP6s activity within axonal projections of both basal forebrain cholinergic and locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons track arousal, indexed as pupil diameter, and changes in behavioral engagement, as reflected by bouts of whisker movement and/or locomotion. The broad coordination in activity between even distant axonal segments indicates that both of these systems can operate in a global fashion, especially in relation to changes in behavioral state. In addition to this broadly coordinated activity, we also find that a subpopulation of both cholinergic and noradrenergic axons exhibit heterogeneity in activity that appears to be independent of our measures of behavioral state. By monitoring the activity of cholinergic interneurons in the cortex we found that a subpopulation of these cells exhibit state-dependent (arousal/movement) activity. These results demonstrate that cholinergic and noradrenergic systems not only provide a prominent and broadly synchronized signal related to behavioral state, but may also provide more heterogeneous activity independent of this general signal. Together, these two systems may prepare the cortex for both broad behavioral state transitions as well as regionally or temporally specific cortical dynamics.

                Axon terminal structure is critical for neuronal function. This cellular compartment houses synaptic terminals and is a site of high metabolic and functional demand. Axon terminals are also the site of a change in microtubule structure within the neuron. Microtubule stability is decreased relative to the axon shaft due to an enrichment of microtubule plus ends and increase in microtubule dynamics. These dynamic microtubule plus ends have many functions including serving as a docking site for the microtubule motor protein complex Cytoplasmic dynein. Here, we report an unexplored function of the dynein motor in axon terminals: regulation of microtubule stability. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a mutant with abnormal axon terminal structure due to a loss of function mutation in the dynein interacting protein NudC. We show that the primary function of NudC in the axon terminal is as a chaperone for the protein Lis1. Loss of NudC results in decreased Lis1 protein in this neuronal compartment. Decreased Lis1 in nudc mutants causes dynein/dynactin accumulation and increased microtubule stability in axon terminals. Microtubules in the proximal axon are unaffected. Abnormal microtubule stability and structure can be suppressed by pharmacologically inhibiting dynein, implicating excess dynein motor activity as causal in the enhanced axon terminal microtubule stability. Together, our data support a model in which local NudC-Lis1 modulation of dynein motor activity is critical for regulation of microtubule stability in the axon terminal.

                Rapid eye movement sleep (REM) is believed to have a binary temporal structure with "phasic" and "tonic" microstates, defined by motoric activity versus quiescence, respectively. However, we observed in mice that the frequency of theta activity (a marker of rodent REM) fluctuates in a non-binary fashion, with the extremes of that fluctuation correlating with phasic-type and tonic-type facial motricity. This demonstrates that phasic and tonic REM rather represent ends of a continuum. These cycles of brain physiology and facial movement occurred at 0.01-0.06 Hz, or infraslow frequencies, and affected cross-frequency coupling and neuronal assembly activity in the neocortex, suggesting network functional impact. We then confirmed that humans also demonstrate non-binary phasic/tonic microstates, with continuous 0.01-0.04 Hz respiratory rate cycles matching the incidence of eye movements. Thus, we discovered a fundamental property of REM, which can yield new insights into our understanding of sleep health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain mapping of effective connectivity by fMRI with cortex-wide patterned optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with optogenetic neural manipulation is a powerful tool that enables brain-wide mapping of effective functional networks. To achieve flexible manipulation of neural excitation throughout the mouse cortex, we incorporated spatiotemporal programmable optogenetic stimuli generated by a digital micromirror device into an MR scanner via an optical fiber bundle for the first time. This approach offered versatility in space and time in planning the photostimulation pattern, combined with in situ optical imaging and cell-type or circuit-specific genetic targeting in individual mice. Brain-wide effective connectivity obtained by fMRI with optogenetic stimulation of atlas-based cortical regions is generally congruent with anatomically defined axonal tracing data but is affected by the types of anesthetics that act selectively on specific connections. fMRI combined with flexible optogenetics opens a new path to investigate dynamic changes in functional brain states in the same animal through high-throughput brain-wide effective connectivity mapping.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Long-Term Alcohol Consumption on Behavior in the P301S (Line PS19) Tauopathy Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol consumption and misuse remain prevalent public health issues with recent reports of increased heavy consumption in older populations in the United States. Several studies have identified alcohol consumption as a risk factor for developing multiple forms of dementia. The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as changes in affective behavior (e.g. anxiety), precede and coincide with cognitive decline. While many studies have characterized the intersection of alcohol use and affective behaviors, little is known regarding alcohol consumption and BPSD. This study characterizes the impact of long-term alcohol consumption on various behaviors in the P301S (line PS19) tauopathy mouse model. Male and female P301S and littermate control mice underwent two-bottle choice intermittent access to alcohol for sixteen weeks starting at 12 weeks of age. There were no significant differences in total ethanol consumption between wildtype and P301S mice of the same sex; however, drinking behavior differed among genotypes, and female mice of each genotype drank significantly more ethanol than males of each genotype. Following drinking studies, mice were run through a battery of behavioral tests during a period of forced abstinence, including approach/avoidance assays, social behavior tests, and memory and cognition tests. Across these tests we observed differences between groups due to genotype, alcohol history, and interactions between alcohol exposure and genotype. These differences were not always consistent between the sexes. In total, this study reveals significant alcohol-tauopathy interactions in subsequent behavior, which may have implications for understanding how alcohol may impact BPSD in conditions associated with tauopathy like Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Respiration-driven brain network: neural underpinning of breathing correlates with resting-state fMRI signal</a></h4>

              
                Respiration can induce motion and CO2 fluctuation during resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) scans, which will lead to non-neural artifacts in the rsfMRI signal. In the meantime, as a crucial physiologic process, respiration that can directly drive neural activity change in the brain, and may thereby modulate the rsfMRI signal. Nonetheless, this potential neural component in the respiration-fMRI relationship is largely unexplored. To elucidate this issue, here we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology, rsfMRI and respiration signals in rats. Our data show that respiration is indeed associated with neural activity changes, evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrophysiologic signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex. Intriguingly, slow respiration variations are also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network, which is mediated by gamma-band neural activity. In addition, this respiration-related brain network disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced at an iso-electrical state, while the respiration is maintained, further confirming the necessary role of neural activity. Taken together, this study identifies a respiration-related brain network underpinned by neural activity, which represents a novel component in the respiration-rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts. It opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between respiration, neural activity and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signaling the agency of an erroneous outcome via synchronization of spikes in the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Claiming agency is a prerequisite for taking responsibility: the brain must differentiate between the sensory events that are the erroneous consequences of our actions, and thus may be remedied if we change our behavior, and the many other events in our environment that consume our attention, but for which we have no means of influence. In the cerebellum, the firing rates of complex spikes of Purkinje cells signal that a sensory or a motor event has taken place, but do not specify if that event was the consequence of the animal's action. Instead, to claim agency of a sensory outcome, the complex spikes synchronize within the population of Purkinje cells that guided that action. As a result, in the cerebellum the erroneous sensory consequences of movements are identified not via modulation of complex spike firing rates, but via synchronization of spikes.

                Hair cells are the principal sensory receptors of the vertebrate auditory system, and transduce sounds with mechanically-gated ion channels that permit cations to flow from the surrounding endolymph into the cells. The lateral line of zebrafish has served as a key model system for understanding hair cell physiology and development, and it has often been speculated that these hair cells employ a similar transduction mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that the hair cells are exposed to an unregulated external environment with cation concentrations that are too low to support transduction. Instead, our results indicate that hair cell excitation is mediated by a fundamentally different mechanism involving the outward flow of anions.

                Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-relevant large neutral amino acids, lead to a form of autism spectrum disorder, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different stages of life. We found that the cerebral cortex undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of large neutral amino acids and lipids in the cerebral cortex are highly interconnected. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell-type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term cortical circuit dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FEZ1 participates in human embryonic brain development by modulating neuronal progenitor subpopulation specification and migration</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal neuronal networks arising from perturbations during early brain development contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations and deletions of human Fasciculation and Elongation Protein Zeta 1 (FEZ1) are found in schizophrenia and Jacobsen syndrome patients. However, its roles in human brain development and manifestation of clinical pathological symptoms remain unknown. Here, using human cerebral organoids (hCOs), we observed that FEZ1 expression is turned on early during brain development and is detectable in both neuroprogenitor subtypes and immature neurons. Deletion of FEZ1 disrupts expression of genes involved in neuronal and synaptic development. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we further uncovered an abnormal expansion of homeodomain-only protein homeobox (HOPX)- outer radial glia (oRG) in FEZ1-null hCOs, occurring at the expense of HOPX+ oRG. HOPX- oRGs show higher cell mobility as compared to HOPX+ oRGs, which is accompanied by the ectopic localization of the neuroprogenitors to the outer layer of FEZ1-null hCOs. Moreover, abnormal encroachment of TBR2+ intermediate progenitors into CTIP2+ deep layer neurons indicated that cortical layer formation is disrupted in FEZ1-null hCOs. Collectively, our findings highlight the involvement of FEZ1 in early cortical brain development and how it contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endogenous modulation of pain relief: evidence for dopaminergic but not opioidergic involvement</a></h4>

              
                Relief of ongoing pain is a potent motivator of behavior, directing actions to escape from or reduce potentially harmful stimuli. Whereas endogenous modulation of pain events is well characterized, relatively little is known about the modulation of pain relief and its corresponding neurochemical basis. Here we studied pain modulation during a probabilistic relief-seeking task (a 'wheel of fortune' gambling task), in which people actively or passively received reduction of a tonic thermal pain stimulus. We found that relief perception was enhanced by active decisions and unpredictability, and greater in high novelty-seeking trait individuals, consistent with a model in which relief is tuned by its informational content. We then probed the roles of dopaminergic and opioidergic signaling, both of which are implicated in relief processing, by embedding the task in a double-blinded cross-over design with administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa and the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone. We found that levodopa, but not naltrexone, enhanced each of these information-specific aspects of relief modulation. These results show that dopaminergic signaling has a key role in modulating the perception of pain relief to optimize motivation and behavior.

	<p>Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) aims to hone motor skills and improve the quality of life. However, the non-repeatability of experimental results and the inconsistency of research conclusions have become a common phenomenon, which may be due to the imprecision of the experimental protocol, great variability of the participant characteristics within the group, and the irregularities of quantitative indicators. The aim of this study systematically summarised and analysed the effect of a-tDCS on lower extremity sensorimotor control under different experimental conditions. This narrative review was performed following the PRISMA guidelines until June 2022 in Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The findings of the present study demonstrated that a-tDCS can effectively improve the capabilities of lower extremity sensorimotor control, particularly in gait speed and time-on-task. Thus, a-tDCS can be used as an effective ergogenic technology to facilitate physical performance. In-depth and rigorous experimental protocol with larger sample sizes and combining brain imaging technology to explore the mechanism have a profound impact on the development of tDCS.</p>

	<p>Traditional cognitive linguistic theories acknowledge that human emotions are embodied, yet they fail to distinguish the dimensions that reflect the direction of neural signaling between the brain and body. Differences exist across languages and cultures in whether embodied emotions are conceptualized as afferent (feelings from the body) or efferent (enacted through the body). This important distinction has been neglected in academic discourse, arguably as a consequence of the &amp;amp;lsquo;lexical approach&amp;amp;rsquo;, and the dominance within the affective psychology of the cognitive and semantic models that overlook the role of interoception as an essential component of affective experience. Empirical and theoretical advances in human neuroscience are driving a reappraisal of the relationships between the mind, brain and body, with particular relevance to emotions. Allostatic (predictive) control of the internal bodily states is considered fundamental to the experience of emotions enacted through interoceptive sensory feelings and through the evoked physiological and physical actions mediated through efferent neural pathways. Embodied emotion concepts encompass these categorized outcomes of bidirectional brain&amp;amp;ndash;body interactions yet can be differentiated further into afferent or interoceptive and efferent or autonomic processes. Between languages, a comparison of emotion words indicates the dominance of afferent or interoceptive processes in how embodied emotions are conceptualized in Chinese, while efferent or autonomic processes feature more commonly in English. Correspondingly, in linguistic expressions of emotion, Chinese-speaking people are biased toward being more receptive, reflective, and adaptive, whereas native English speakers may tend to be more reactive, proactive, and interactive. Arguably, these distinct conceptual models of emotions may shape the perceived divergent values and &amp;amp;lsquo;national character&amp;amp;rsquo; of Chinese- and English-speaking cultures.</p>

	<p>In vivo studies of the therapeutic effects of argon in traumatic brain injury (TBI) are limited, and their results are contradictory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a three-hour inhalation of argon (70%Ar/30%O2) after an open TBI on the severity of the neurological deficit and the degree of brain damage in rats. The experiments were performed on male Wistar rats (n = 35). The TBI was simulated by the dosed open brain contusion injury. The animals were divided into three groups: sham-operated (SO, n = 7); TBI + 70%N2/30%O2 (TBI, n = 14); TBI + 70%Ar/30%O2 (TBI + iAr, n = 14). The Neurological status was assessed over a 14-day period (using the limb-placing and cylinder tests). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and a histological examination of the brain with an assessment of the volume of the lesions were performed 14 days after the injury. At each of the time points (days 1, 7, and 14), the limb-placing test score was lower in the TBI and TBI + iAr groups than in the SO group, while there were no significant differences between the TBI and TBI + iAr groups. Additionally, no differences were found between these groups in the cylinder test scores (day 13). The volume of brain damage (tissue loss) according to both the MRI and histological findings did not differ between the TBI and TBI + iAr groups. A three-hour inhalation of argon (70%Ar/30%O2) after a TBI had no neuroprotective effect.</p>

	<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that results from complex interactions of multiple genes and environmental risk and adversity factors. Some researchers have suggested a need for additional research into differing clinical presentations of ADHD for further classification. In this context, this study aimed to investigate whether increases in risk and adversity factors increase the severity of ADHD and the number of comorbid psychiatric disorders. This is a naturalistic retrospective chart review exploratory study in 100 patients 16 years or older who have a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS, using the Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney test for parametric data and the Chi-square and Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis p value tests for non-parametric and categorical data. Qualitative data were tabulated and described. The study found that (1) the average number of comorbidities increases with the severity of ADHD, (2) the average number of risk and adversity factors increases with the severity of ADHD, (3) the number of risk and adversity factors were positively associated with the number of comorbidities, and (4) Level of education was negatively associated with the number of risk and adversity factors and the number of comorbidities. The implications of these findings are discussed, and future research in this important area is suggested.</p>

	<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling plays a crucial role in drug reward and the development of addiction. Historically, GABA neurochemistry in humans has been difficult to study due to methodological limitations. In recent years, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS, MRS) has emerged as a non-invasive imaging technique that can detect and quantify human brain metabolites in vivo. Novel sequencing and spectral editing methods have since been developed to allow for quantification of GABA. This review outlines the clinical research utilization of 1H-MRS in understanding GABA neurochemistry in addiction and summarizes current literature that reports GABA measurements by MRS in addiction. Research on alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and cannabis addiction all suggest medications that modulate GABA signaling may be effective in reducing withdrawal, craving, and other addictive behaviors. Thus, we discuss how improvements in current MRS techniques and design can optimize GABA quantification in future studies and explore how monitoring changes to brain GABA could help identify risk factors, improve treatment efficacy, further characterize the nature of addiction, and provide crucial insights for future pharmacological development.</p>

	<p>Background: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and gender differences have been described on several aspects of PD. In the present commentary, we aimed to collect and discuss the currently available evidence on gender differences in PD regarding biomarkers, genetic factors, motor and non-motor symptoms, therapeutic management (including pharmacological and surgical treatment) as well as preclinical studies. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed by searching the Pubmed and Scopus databases with the search strings &amp;amp;ldquo;biomarkers&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;deep brain stimulation&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;female&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;gender&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;genetic&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;levodopa&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;men&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;male&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;motor symptoms&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;non-motor symptoms&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;Parkinson disease&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;sex&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;surgery&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;women&amp;amp;rdquo;. Results: The present review confirms the existence of differences between men and women in Parkinson Disease, pointing out new information regarding evidence from animal models, genetic factors, biomarkers, clinical features and pharmacological and surgical treatment. Conclusions: The overall goal is to acquire new informations about sex and gender differences in Parkinson Disease, in order to develop tailored intervetions.</p>

	<p>Osteoid osteoma (OO) is a primary benign tumor that accounts for up to 3% of all bone tumors. The cervical spine is less affected by OOs, and very few cases of C2 OOs have been reported in the literature, both in adults and children. Surgery may be required in case of functional torticollis, stiffness, and reduced range of motion (ROM) due to cervical OOs refractory to medical therapy. Several posterior and anterior surgical techniques have been described to remove C2 OOs. In particular, anterior approaches to the cervical spine represent the most used surgical route for treating C2 OOs. We describe the first case of OO of the odontoid process removed through a transnasal endoscopic approach with the aid of neuronavigation in a 6-year-old child. No intraoperative complications occurred, and the post-operative course was uneventful. The patient had immediate relief of neck pain and remained pain-free throughout the follow-up period, with complete functional recovery of the neck range of motion (ROM). In this case, based on the favorable anatomy, the transnasal endoscopic approach represented a valuable strategy for the complete removal of an anterior C2 OO without the need for further vertebral fixation since the preservation of ligaments and paravertebral soft tissue.</p>

	<p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare complication that the exact pathophysiological mechanism of which is still unclear. PRES most often occurs in connection with severe hypertension and autoimmune diseases. It can also appear during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment. A 38-year-old woman with a negative medical history was admitted to the local hospital due to loss of consciousness accompanied by seizures and high values of blood pressure, and a PCR test for COVID-19 was positive. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s condition was preceded by weakness, wet cough, runny nose, and low-grade fever for three days. Due to the conducted diagnostics after negative CT scans and angio CT studies, an MRI of the head with contrast was performed, where changes characteristic of PRES syndrome were found. During the hospitalization, the patient did not require invasive ventilation and did not receive antiviral drugs or tocilizumab as a result of treatment for her high blood pressure values, and after establishing the diagnosis, the patient was discharged home with a significant improvement in her well-being. In the literature, there are discussions as to whether COVID-19 predisposes patients to PRES. Isolated cases have been described, but its frequency is not yet established. Case reports in the literature appear to be specifically associated with a severe course of the disease, unlike in our patient. Even with a mild course of COVID, the diagnosis of PRES should be taken into account in patients with seizures, visual disturbances, or other focal neurological deficits.</p>

	<p>Shape-contrast effects have been introduced to the investigations into face perception with the aim of exploring face adaptation in the context of norm-based coding. Research has indicated that shape-contrast effects occur even for shapes as complex as the human face. However, whether the complexity of face stimuli alters the magnitude of shape-contrast effects needs to be examined. In this study, emoticons and realistic human faces were used with the original white circle as the test stimuli. The results revealed that the shape-contrast effect was dependent on the stimulus. However, there was no significant difference between the shape-contrast effect evoked by upright faces and that evoked by inverted ones. This suggests that the face stimuli influenced the strength of the shape-contrast effect: the mechanism of this effect involved multiple stages of the visual system related to luminance and complexity, rather than the holistic face perception.</p>

	<p>Having a family history of alcohol use problems (FH+) conveys risk for alcohol use in offspring. Reward-related brain functioning may play a role in this vulnerability. The present study investigated brain function in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) associated with the anticipation of reward in youth with two biological parents with alcohol use problems (FH+2), one biological parent with alcohol use problems (FH+1), and no biological parents with alcohol use problems (FH-). Participants were from the large, national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (mean age: 9.93; 48% female; FH+2 n = 223, FH+1 n = 1447, FH- n = 9690) and the Michigan Longitudinal Study (MLS), consisting of community-recruited families with high rates of alcohol use disorder (mean age: 10.54; 39.3% female; FH+2 n = 40, FH+1 n = 51, FH- n = 40). Reward anticipation was measured by the monetary incentive delay task. Regression models were used to assess associations between FH status and the anticipation of large rewards in right and left NAcc regions of interest. In both studies, FH+2 youth showed blunted anticipatory reward responding in the right NAcc compared to FH+1 youth. In the MLS, FH+2 youth also had blunted anticipatory reward responding in the right NAcc compared to the FH- group. Convergent results across two separate samples provide insights into a unique vulnerability of FH+2 youth and suggest that binary FH+ versus FH- categorizations may obscure important differences within FH+ youth.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Learning Spatiotemporal Properties of Hippocampal Place Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is well known that hippocampal place cells have spatiotemporal properties, namely, that they generally respond to a single spatial location of a small environment, and they also display the temporal response property of theta phase precession, namely, that the phase of spiking relative to the theta wave shifts from the late phase to early phase as the animal crosses the place field. Grid cells in Layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) also have spatiotemporal properties similar to hippocampal place cells, except that grid cells respond to multiple spatial locations that form a hexagonal pattern. Because the EC is the upstream area that projects strongly to the hippocampus, a number of EC-hippocampus learning models have been proposed to explain how the spatial receptive field properties of place cells emerge via synaptic plasticity. However, the question of how the phase precession properties of place cells and grid cells are related has remained unclear. This study shows how theta phase precession in hippocampal place cells can emerge from MEC input as a result of synaptic plasticity, demonstrating that a learning model based on non-negative sparse coding can account for both the spatial and temporal properties of hippocampal place cells. Although both MEC grid cells and other EC spatial cells contribute to the spatial properties of hippocampal place cells, it is the MEC grid cells that predominantly determine the temporal response properties of hippocampal place cells displayed here.</p>

                Background: ACE-2 receptors are well-known as binding receptors to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 highly expressed in the gastrointestinal system. The Role of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and its effect on gut inflammation in COVID-19 patients are still not well-understood. This study aims to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on gastrointestinal inflammation. Methods: A total of 44 inpatient subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria were examined for cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from several nucleic levels based on fluorescence signal and calprotectin levels of stool samples using Calprotectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Results: Of 44 subjects, 52.3% were male, with a median age of 52.5 years. Hypertension or diabetes was found in 26 patients. The median cycle threshold value was 31.3 with a value range of 10.9-40.0, median cycle threshold was significantly lower in subjects with comorbidity with P = 0.01. The median fecal calprotectin level was 42 μg/g with a value range of 5.1-1,393.7 μg/g, with median fecal calprotectin significantly higher in subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms with P = 0.008 with a relative risk (RR) of 5.5. There was a significant correlation between cycle threshold and fecal calprotectin in subjects with comorbidity with P <0.05, a coefficient contingency of 0.414. Conclusion: Subjects with comorbidity are prone to have higher viral loads paralleled with gastrointestinal inflammation. Subjects with overt gastrointestinal manifestations had a five-fold higher degree of gut inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automated detection of over- and under-dispersion in baseline tables in randomised controlled trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Papers describing the results of a randomised trial should include a baseline table that compares the characteristics of randomised groups. Researchers who fraudulently generate trials often unwittingly create baseline tables that are implausibly similar (under-dispersed) or have large differences between groups (over-dispersed). I aimed to create an automated algorithm to screen for under- and over-dispersion in the baseline tables of randomised trials. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study I examined 2,245 randomised controlled trials published in health and medical journals on PubMed Central. I estimated the probability that a trial's baseline summary statistics were under- or over-dispersed using a Bayesian model that examined the distribution of t-statistics for the between-group differences, and compared this with an expected distribution without dispersion. I used a simulation study to test the ability of the model to find under- or over-dispersion and compared its performance with an existing test of dispersion based on a uniform test of p-values. My model combined categorical and continuous summary statistics, whereas the uniform uniform test used only continuous statistics. Results: The algorithm had a relatively good accuracy for extracting the data from baseline tables, matching well on the size of the tables and sample size. Using t-statistics in the Bayesian model out-performed the uniform test of p-values, which had many false positives for skewed, categorical and rounded data that were not under- or over-dispersed. For trials published on PubMed Central, some tables appeared under- or over-dispersed because they had an atypical presentation or had reporting errors. Some trials flagged as under-dispersed had groups with strikingly similar summary statistics. Conclusions: Automated screening for fraud of all submitted trials is challenging due to the widely varying presentation of baseline tables. The Bayesian model could be useful in targeted checks of suspected trials or authors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNANetMotif: Identifying sequence-structure RNA network motifs in RNA-protein binding sites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hongli Ma, Han Wen, Zhiyuan Xue, Guojun Li, Zhaolei Zhang</p>

RNA molecules can adopt stable secondary and tertiary structures, which are essential in mediating physical interactions with other partners such as RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and in carrying out their cellular functions. In vivo and in vitro experiments such as RNAcompete and eCLIP have revealed in vitro binding preferences of RBPs to RNA oligomers and in vivo binding sites in cells. Analysis of these binding data showed that the structure properties of the RNAs in these binding sites are important determinants of the binding events; however, it has been a challenge to incorporate the structure information into an interpretable model. Here we describe a new approach, RNANetMotif, which takes predicted secondary structure of thousands of RNA sequences bound by an RBP as input and uses a graph theory approach to recognize enriched subgraphs. These enriched subgraphs are in essence shared sequence-structure elements that are important in RBP-RNA binding. To validate our approach, we performed RNA structure modeling via coarse-grained molecular dynamics folding simulations for selected 4 RBPs, and RNA-protein docking for LIN28B. The simulation results, e.g., solvent accessibility and energetics, further support the biological relevance of the discovered network subgraphs.

                Background: The objective of the study was to determine the influence of storytelling in the tourism promotion of the Huayllay National Sanctuary. Methods: A quantitative approach study was used, a pre-experimental design with a single control group, and the study population consisted of 19 visitors to whom a pre-test and post-test were performed to evaluate the results obtained. The information collected was processed through the SPSS 26 statistical program and subsequently the event tree analysis (ETA) was performed to determine the degree of influence between the study variables. Results: Results of 0.677 and 0.795 indicate that storytelling does have an influence on the promotion of tourism for the study area. Conclusions: The study was able to determine that there is an influence between storytelling and tourism, and this can be used as a tourism promotion tool not only at the local level of the study site, but also at the national level.

                Caecal volvulus (CV) is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, defined by an axial torsion of the caecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum around the mesenteric vascular pedicles, leading to ischemia and bowel necrosis. A 20-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, was admitted for generalized abdominal pain evolving for three days, along with constipation and abdominal distension, but with no vomiting. Physical examination showed a generalized abdominal tenderness with no rigidity or rebound tenderness, associated with abdominal distension and tympanic upon percussion. Laboratory findings were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed distension of a loop of the large bowel with its long axis extending from the right lower quadrant to the epigastrium or left upper quadrant. Colonic haustral pattern was absent. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a rounded focal collection of air-distended bowel with haustral creases in the upper left quadrant. In addition, spiraled loops of the collapsed cecum (giving a whirl sign) were noted, along with low-attenuating fatty mesentery from the twisted bowel. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy and caecectomy using GEA 80 charges. The patient had no complaints post-operation. CV is a rare cause of bowel obstruction, mainly caused by an exceedingly mobile caecum. Despite its rareness, CV represents the second most common cause of large bowel volvulus, behind sigmoid volvulus. For acute obstruction by CV, it is hard to differentiate it clinically from obstruction of the small bowel; therefore, radiological exams are needed. Surgery is the gold standard treatment for CV. We report a rare case of CV to highlight the rarity of this pathology, specify its diagnostic and therapeutic means, and its clinical and biological evolution.

                Background: This study aimed to determine the ameliorative effects of Physalis angulata leaf extract on L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced preeclampsia symptoms in rats. Methods: Phytochemical analysis of the extract was performed with liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=6). Preeclampsia rats were injected with L-NAME on gestation days 9 to 18 (G9–G18), while sham rats were injected with the same vehicle volume. Three groups of preeclampsia rats were orally supplemented with the extract at doses of 500, 1500, and 2500 mg/kg body weight/day on G12–G18. The tail-cuff method measured blood pressures. Spectrophotometry determined urine protein levels. Serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt)-1 levels were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum and placental malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured by colorimetry. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine tail artery endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), placental eNOS, and placental hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expressions. Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) were counted using flow cytometry. Results: L-NAME injection increased blood pressures, 24-h total urine protein level, serum sFlt-1 level, serum and placental MDA levels, percentages of CACs and ECFCs, and placental HIF-1α expression. It also decreased serum and placental SOD activities, serum NO level, tail artery and placental eNOS expressions compared to the sham group. Physalis angulata leaf extract administration lowered blood pressures, urine protein level, sFlt-1 level, MDA levels, percentages of CACs and ECFCs, and placental HIF-1α expression. The extract increased SOD activities, NO level, tail artery and placental eNOS expressions compared to the preeclampsia group. Conclusions: Physalis angulata leaf extract reduces antiangiogenic factor and oxidative stress. It also enhances eNOS/NO signaling. Thus, it improves EPC and endothelial cell function and reverses L-NAME-induced hypertension and proteinuria in preeclampsia rats.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Optimal timing for lithium levels [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Reddy and Reddy (2014) discuss the optimal timing for lithium levels in patients taking once-daily extended-release lithium formulations. They argue for blood sampling 24 h after the previous dose rather than the standard 12 h. I interpret the data quite differently. The authors start with the assumption that the clinician wants a trough level. I disagree. What one wants is to be able to compare a patient’s lithium level to the large body of published knowledge about lithium dosing. Almost all of that data comes from standard 12-h blood draws with plain (immediate-release) lithium carbonate or lithium citrate. So, the real question of interest is, with extended-release lithium formulations, at what time point does one draw the lithium level to compare most accurately with a standard 12-h blood draw with plain lithium carbonate? The answer is not obvious because extended-release formulations affect only the absorption and not the excretion of lithium. Their primary benefit is reducing the transient peak lithium serum concentration, not delaying the (already relatively slow) elimination of lithium. Emami and colleagues (2004) provide the needed data. First they show that 90% of the administered dose of a commercial extended-release formulation (Eskalith CR®) is absorbed by 4 h after a dose, and ~100% is absorbed by 8 h (their Figure 2A). Second, they show that at 12 h after a dose, the blood levels for immediate and extended release formulations are essentially identical (their Figure 3).  Thus 12 h after the previous dose is the ideal time for drawing blood levels for extended-release lithium tablets.

                Hepatic Sodium Taurocholate cotransporter polypeptide (NTCP1) captures approximately 80% of the conjugated bile acids that come from the enterohepatic circulation. Transcriptionally, NTCP1 expression is activated by an RAR/RXR heterodimer, which is repressed by SHP when intracellular bile acids are high. In addition, NTCP1 activity is post-translational modulated by phosphorylation. However, whether NTCP1 could be regulated by acetylation is unknown. A bioinformatic analysis for the mouse NTCP1 protein sequence showed potential lysine acetylation sites. Thus, we evaluated taurocholate uptake in hepatocytes incubated with NAM, which induced a two-fold increase in the content of acetylated proteins. Interestingly, taurocholate uptake was reduced by 50% in hepatocytes incubated with NAM. These results demonstrate that acetylation mediates taurocholate uptake in hepatocytes possibly through modulation of NTCP1 activity.

                Background: Prenatal growth retardation may increase the risk of later chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes; however, long-term effects of wasting malnutrition in childhood or adulthood are less studied. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions, both critical for nutrition and NCD aetiology, may not fully recover following malnutrition. However, the evidence and mechanistic information is piecemeal. We hypothesise that wasting malnutrition at any age has long-term detrimental effects on endocrine and exocrine pancreatic structure and function. Methods: The SAMPA international research programme will assess pancreatic structure and function in 3700 participants from ongoing observational nutrition cohorts, two adolescent and four adult, in Zambia, Tanzania, Philippines, and India. Pancreas size, structure, and calcification will be assessed by ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan; exocrine function by faecal elastase and serum lipase; and endocrine function by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In-depth hormonal analyses of incretins, glucagon, proinsulin and trypsinogen during OGTT and intravenous glucose tolerance tests will be done in subsets of adult participants. Pancreatic size and function outcomes will be compared between people with and without prior wasting malnutrition. Analyses will investigate effect modification by sex, current age, time since malnutrition, current body mass index and dietary patterns. Mathematical modelling of OGTT data will be used to estimate the relative contribution to glucose dysregulation of decreased insulin production, changes in insulin clearance and increased insulin resistance. Proinsulin/insulin ratio will be analysed in archived samples from the Tanzanian cohort using a nested case-control design to investigate whether abnormal values precede diabetes. Conclusions: SAMPA, a large-scale multi-centre research programme using data from people with or without prior wasting malnutrition to assess several aspects of pancreatic phenotype, will provide coherent evidence for future policies and programmes for malnutrition and diabetes.

                <p>In this one-year prospective study, Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with or without mania following STN-DBS were compared to investigate risk and etiological factors, clinical management and consequences. Eighteen (16.2%) out of 111 consecutive PD patients developed mania, of whom 17 were males. No preoperative risk factor was identified. Postoperative mania was related to ventral limbic subthalamic stimulation in 15 (83%) patients, and resolved as stimulation was relocated to the sensorimotor STN, besides discontinuation or reduction of dopamine agonists and use of low-dose clozapine in 12 patients, while motor and nonmotor outcomes were similar. These findings underpin the prominent role of limbic subthalamic stimulation in postoperative mania. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness among medical students: a prospective study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Physical activity and fitness level of fitness decline mostly between adolescence and early adulthood. This leads to risks of non-communicable diseases in the future. Medical students, assumed to have an extensive understanding of physical exercise and its benefits, are less active than they were before attending graduate school. This study aimed to assess changes in physical fitness and physical activity of students over-time. Methods: This was a prospective study undertaken at Basic Science Complex of Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital in Nepal. In total, 72 medical students were put through a modified Harvard step test during their first year and then three years later during their third year at medical school. Maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 max) was calculated subsequently by plotting the average pulse rate on the Astrand-Rhyming Nomogram. Results: The mean value of relative maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 max) decreased from first year to the third year. When the mean values of body mass index and relative maximum aerobic capacity were compared between first year and third year, the difference was found to be statistically significant (p-value=0.000). The physical fitness index and relative maximum aerobic capacity in both years were positively correlated r (70) = +.59, p<0.001(first year); r (70) = +.47, p<0.001(third year). Meanwhile, body mass index and relative maximum aerobic capacity in the third year were negatively correlated and statistically significant with r (70) = -0.23, p=.045. Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory fitness of the students steadily declined as they progressed through their academic years. Positive correlation between cardiorespiratory fitness and physical fitness index was established along with negative correlation between body mass index and cardiorespiratory fitness. The findings in this study expose the lack of fitness in youth as they focus more on academics, giving the impression that they forget to implement a fitness routine in their lifestyle.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Treadmill exercise reduces α-synuclein spreading via PPARα</a></h4>

              
                Dutta et al. demonstrate that regular treadmill exercise is capable of decreasing α-synuclein spreading in the brain and protecting nigral dopaminergic neurons in mice. However, treadmill running does not reduce α-synucleinopathy in mice lacking peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), highlighting a role of PPARα in the beneficial effect of treadmill running.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Morphometric analysis of lungfish endocasts elucidates early dipnoan palaeoneurological evolution</a></h4>

              
                The lobe-finned fish, lungfish (Dipnoi, Sarcoptergii), have persisted for ~400 million years from the Devonian Period to present day. The evolution of their dermal skull and dentition is relatively well understood, but this is not the case for the central nervous system. While the brain has poor preservation potential and is not currently known in any fossil lungfish, substantial indirect information about it and associated structures (e.g. labyrinths) can be obtained from the cranial endocast. However, before the recent development of X-ray tomography as a palaeontological tool, these endocasts could not be studied non-destructively, and few detailed studies were undertaken. Here, we describe and illustrate the endocasts of six Palaeozoic lungfish from tomographic scans. We combine these with six previously described digital lungfish endocasts (4 fossil and 2 recent taxa) into a 12-taxon dataset for multivariate morphometric analysis using 17 variables. We find that the olfactory region is more highly plastic than the hindbrain, and undergoes significant elongation in several taxa. Further, while the semicircular canals covary as an integrated module, the utriculus and sacculus vary independently of each other. Functional interpretation suggests that olfaction has remained a dominant sense throughout lungfish evolution, and changes in the labyrinth may potentially reflect a change from nektonic to near-shore environmental niches. Phylogenetic implications show that endocranial form fails to support monophyly of the ‘chirodipterids’. Those with elongated crania similarly fail to form a distinct clade, suggesting these two paraphyletic groups have converged towards either head elongation or truncation driven by non-phylogenetic constraints.

                KCNMA1 forms the pore of BK K<sup>+</sup> channels, which regulate neuronal and muscle excitability. Recently, genetic screening identified heterozygous <i>KCNMA1</i> variants in a subset of patients with debilitating paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, presenting with or without epilepsy (PNKD3). However, the relevance of <i>KCNMA1</i> mutations and the basis for clinical heterogeneity in PNKD3 has not been established. Here, we evaluate the relative severity of three <i>KCNMA1</i> patient variants in BK channels, neurons, and mice. In heterologous cells, BK<sup>N999S</sup> and BK<sup>D434G</sup> channels displayed gain-of-function (GOF) properties, whereas BK<sup>H444Q</sup> channels showed loss-of-function (LOF) properties. The relative degree of channel activity was BK<sup>N999S</sup> &gt; BK<sup>D434G</sup>&gt;WT &gt; BK<sup>H444Q</sup>. BK currents and action potential firing were increased, and seizure thresholds decreased, in <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>N999S/WT</sup> and <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>D434G/WT</sup> transgenic mice but not <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>H444Q/WT</sup> mice. In a novel behavioral test for paroxysmal dyskinesia, the more severely affected <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice became immobile after stress. This was abrogated by acute dextroamphetamine treatment, consistent with PNKD3-affected individuals. Homozygous <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice showed similar immobility, but in contrast, homozygous <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> mice displayed hyperkinetic behavior. These data establish the relative pathogenic potential of patient alleles as N999S&gt;D434G&gt;H444Q and validate <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice as a model for PNKD3 with increased seizure propensity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">UP-DOWN states and ripples differentially modulate membrane potential dynamics across DG, CA3, and CA1 in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal ripples are transient population bursts that structure cortico-hippocampal communication and play a central role in memory processing. However, the mechanisms controlling ripple initiation in behaving animals remain poorly understood. Here we combine multisite extracellular and whole-cell recordings in awake mice to contrast the brain state and ripple modulation of subthreshold dynamics across hippocampal subfields. We find that entorhinal input to the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits UP and DOWN dynamics with ripples occurring exclusively in UP states. While elevated cortical input in UP states generates depolarization in DG and CA1, it produces persistent hyperpolarization in CA3 neurons. Furthermore, growing inhibition is evident in CA3 throughout the course of the ripple buildup, while DG and CA1 neurons exhibit depolarization transients 100 ms before and during ripples. These observations highlight the importance of CA3 inhibition for ripple generation, while pre-ripple responses indicate a long and orchestrated ripple initiation process in the awake state.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Exploring the expression patterns of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in the mouse brain using the curated RNA-seq database BrainPalmSeq</a></h4>

              
                Protein <i>S</i>-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational lipid modification that plays a critical role in neuronal development and plasticity, while dysregulated <i>S</i>-palmitoylation underlies a number of severe neurological disorders. Dynamic <i>S</i>-palmitoylation is regulated by a large family of ZDHHC palmitoylating enzymes, their accessory proteins, and a small number of known de-palmitoylating enzymes. Here, we curated and analyzed expression data for the proteins that regulate <i>S</i>-palmitoylation from publicly available RNAseq datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of their distribution in the mouse nervous system. We developed a web-tool that enables interactive visualization of the expression patterns for these proteins in the nervous system (http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/), and explored this resource to find region and cell-type specific expression patterns that give insight into the function of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in the brain and neurological disorders. We found coordinated expression of ZDHHC enzymes with their accessory proteins, de-palmitoylating enzymes and other brain-expressed genes that included an enrichment of <i>S</i>-palmitoylation substrates. Finally, we utilized ZDHHC expression patterns to predict and validate palmitoylating enzyme-substrate interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Increased signal-to-noise ratios within experimental field trials by regressing spatially distributed soil properties as principal components</a></h4>

              
                Environmental variability poses a major challenge to any field study. Researchers attempt to mitigate this challenge through replication. Thus, the ability to detect experimental signals is determined by the degree of replication and the amount of environmental variation, noise, within the experimental system. A major source of noise in field studies comes from the natural heterogeneity of soil properties which create microtreatments throughout the field. In addition, the variation within different soil properties is often nonrandomly distributed across a field. We explore this challenge through a sorghum field trial dataset with accompanying plant, microbiome, and soil property data. Diverse sorghum genotypes and two watering regimes were applied in a split-plot design. We describe a process of identifying, estimating, and controlling for the effects of spatially distributed soil properties on plant traits and microbial communities using minimal degrees of freedom. Importantly, this process provides a method with which sources of environmental variation in field data can be identified and adjusted, improving our ability to resolve effects of interest and to quantify subtle phenotypes.
