     alt="Comparative analysis of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex of primates: Insights into the evolution of human brain energetics"/>
<p>We quantified astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein in human and nonhuman primates. We report that astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells in layer I of Brodmann.s area 9 increased significantly with brain size enlargement and was greatest in humans. Roman numerals denote cortical layer. Scale bars = 25 Âµm.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the main homeostatic cell of the brain involved in many processes related to cognition, immune response, and energy expenditure. It has been suggested that the distribution of astrocytes is associated with brain size, and that they are specialized in humans. To evaluate these, we quantified astrocyte density, soma volume, and total glia density in layer I and white matter in Brodmann's area 9 of humans, chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques. We found that layer I astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells were highest in humans and increased with brain size. Overall glia density in layer I and white matter were relatively invariant across brain sizes, potentially due to their important metabolic functions on a per volume basis. We also quantified two transporters involved in metabolism through the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). We expected these transporters would be increased in human brains due to their high rate of metabolic consumption and associated gene activity. While humans have higher EAAT2 cell density, GLUT1 vessel volume, and GLUT1 area fraction compared to baboons and chimpanzees, they did not differ from macaques. Therefore, EAAT2 and GLUT1 are not related to increased energetic demands of the human brain. Taken together, these data provide evidence that astrocytes play a unique role in both brain expansion and evolution among primates, with an emphasis on layer I astrocytes having a potentially significant role in human-specific metabolic processing and cognition.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The brainstem plays an essential role in the early stage of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but it is not widely tested in clinical examinations of PD. Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) are recognized as fundamental tools in the assessment of brainstem function. The aim of our meta-analysis was to assess the abnormal findings of VEMPs in patients with PD. (2) Methods: Up to 14 February 2022, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to evaluate VEMPs in patients with PD in comparison with respective controls. The study protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022311103). (3) Results: A total of 15 studies were finally included in our meta-analysis. The absence rates of VEMPs in patients with PD were significantly higher than those of control groups (cVEMP: OR = 6.77; oVEMP: OR = 13.9; mVEMP: OR = 7.52). A delayed P13 latency, a decreased peak-to-peak amplitude, and an increased AAR of cVEMP, and a delayed oVEMP P15 latency were also found in patients with PD. (4) Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicates abnormal VEMP findings in patients with PD, revealing the dysfunction of the brainstem in PD. VEMP tests, especially cVEMP tests, could be a helpful method for the early detection of PD.</p>

	<p>Background: Obesity is a condition that affects humans both physically and mentally. Moreover, many psychopathological conditions can be observed in obese patients that may threaten the positive outcomes of bariatric surgery. Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the main psychopathological correlates of obese candidates for bariatric surgery, with particular attention on the relationship between psychopathology and gender. Methods: In total, 273 candidates for bariatric surgery for obesity underwent a psychiatric evaluation using a compilation of psychometric scales: the Revised Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R), the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), the Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) and the Obesity-Related Well-Being (ORWELL 97). The sample was divided on the basis of gender and binge eating disorder (BED) severity. Comparisons between the groups were performed using an analysis of variance model (ANOVA) or a Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s chi-squared test. Further, we also divided our sample into a severe binge eating group (score &amp;amp;gt; 27), a mild to moderate group (18 &amp;amp;lt; score &amp;amp;lt; 26) and a low/no symptoms group (score &amp;amp;lt; 17). Results: Male and female subjects showed different results for the BES, with higher scores reported among women (17.50 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.59) compared to men (14.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.64). Women also showed higher scores across most of the SCL-90-R domains and worse outcomes in terms of quality of life. Both women and men in the severe binge eating group reported higher scores for the SCL-90-R. Conclusion: The symptoms of BED, along with body image dissatisfaction (BID), are among the most important to investigate for candidates for bariatric surgery in order to improve the surgery outcomes. Level of evidence: Level III as the evidence came from a cohort analytic study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Definition of âclose contactsâ in leprosy studies: protocol for a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite difficulties to document transmission pathways (assumed to be airborne), increased risk of leprosy infection has been shown for individuals living in close contact with patients. However, variations in the concept of âclose contactsâ are used in different settings and studies. We conduct this review to identify criteria of space (location, geographical variables, distance, indoor vs outdoor), time (including frequency and duration), physical exposure (skin to skin, sexual), and relationship (familial, occupational, social) involved in the definition of âclose contactsâ in leprosy studies. We expect this review to provide an overview of the (lack of) conceptualization of this term and its variations across settings. Primary studies and reviews are eligible for inclusion in this review. The main source of records will be the PubMed interface. Secondary searches will be conducted in Google Scholar, as well as through the reference lists of selected publications. The search strategy is based on the combination of the condition of interest (leprosy) and the concept under study (âcontactâ). The findings of this review will be presented using thematic narrative synthesis, tables, and figures. The protocol is written in line with the Prisma Extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">In Vivo Optogenetics Reveals Control of Cochlear Electromechanical Responses by Supporting Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cochlear sensitivity, essential for communication and exploiting the acoustic environment, results from sensory-motor outer hair cells (OHCs) operating in a structural scaffold of supporting cells and extracellular cortilymph within the organ of Corti (OoC). Cochlear sensitivity control is hypothesized to involve interaction between the OHCs and OoC supporting cells (e.g., Deiters' cells [DCs] and outer pillar cells [OPCs]), but this has never been established <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we conditionally expressed channelrhodopsins (ChR2) specifically in male and female mouse DCs and OPCs. Illumination of the OoC activated the nonselective ChR2 cation conductance and depolarized DCs when measured <I>in vivo</I> and in isolated OoC. Measurements of sound-induced cochlear mechanical and electrical responses revealed that OoC illumination suppressed the normal functions of OoC supporting cells transiently and reversibly. OoC illumination blocked normally occurring continuous minor adjustments of tone-evoked basilar membrane displacements over their entire dynamic range and OHC voltage responses to tones at levels and frequencies subject to cochlear amplification. OoC illumination altered the OHC mechanoelectrical transduction conductance operating point, which reversed the asymmetry of OHC voltage responses to high level tones. OoC illumination accelerated recovery from temporary loud sound-induced acoustic desensitization. We concluded that DCs and OPCs are involved in both the control of cochlear responses (which are essential for normal hearing) and the recovery from temporary acoustic desensitization. This is the first direct <I>in vivo</I> evidence for the interdependency of the structural, mechanical, and electrochemical arrangements of OHCs and OoC supporting cells that together provide fine control of cochlear responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A striking feature of the mammalian cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, is the cellular architecture and supporting cell arrangement that provides a structural scaffold for the sensory-motor outer hair cells. The role of the supporting cell scaffold, however, has never been elucidated <I>in vivo</I>, although <I>in vitro</I> and modeling studies indicate the scaffold is involved in exchange of forces between the outer hair cells and the organ of Corti. We used <I>in vivo</I> techniques, including optogenetics, that do not disrupt arrangements between the outer hair cells and supporting cells, but selectively, transiently, and reversibly interfere with supporting cell normal function. We revealed the supporting cells provide continuous adjustment of cochlear sensitivity, which is instrumental in normal hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Membrane Stretch Gates NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>NMDARs are ionotropic glutamate receptors widely expressed in the CNS, where they mediate phenomena as diverse as neurotransmission, information processing, synaptogenesis, and cellular toxicity. They function as glutamate-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels, which require glycine as coagonist, and can be modulated by many diffusible ligands and cellular cues, including mechanical stimuli. Previously, we found that, in cultured astrocytes, shear stress initiates NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the absence of added agonists, suggesting that more than being mechanosensitive, NMDARs may be mechanically activated. Here, we used controlled expression of rat recombinant receptors and noninvasive on-cell single-channel current recordings to show that mild membrane stretch can substitute for the neurotransmitter glutamate in gating NMDAR currents. Notably, stretch-activated currents maintained the hallmark features of the glutamate-gated currents, including glycine-requirement, large unitary conductance, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, and voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> blockade. Further, we found that the stretch-gated current required the receptor's intracellular domain. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanical forces can gate endogenous NMDAR currents even in the absence of synaptic glutamate release, which has important implications for understanding mechanotransduction and the physiological and pathologic effects of mechanical forces on cells of the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that, in addition to enhancing currents elicited with low agonist concentrations, membrane stretch can gate NMDARs in the absence of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Stretch-gated currents have the principal hallmarks of the glutamate-gated currents, including requirement for glycine, large Na<sup>+</sup> conductance, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, and voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block. Therefore, results suggest that mechanical forces can initiate cellular processes presently attributed to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as synaptic plasticity and cytotoxicity. Given the ubiquitous presence of mechanical forces in the CNS, this discovery identifies NMDARs as possibly important mechanotransducers during development and across the lifespan, and during pathologic processes, such as those associated with traumatic brain injuries, shaken infant syndrome, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Graded Variation in T1w/T2w Ratio during Adolescence: Measurement, Caveats, and Implications for Development of Cortical Myelin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adolescence is characterized by the maturation of cortical microstructure and connectivity supporting complex cognition and behavior. Axonal myelination influences brain connectivity during development by enhancing neural signaling speed and inhibiting plasticity. However, the maturational timing of cortical myelination during human adolescence remains poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in high-resolution cortical T1w/T2w mapping methods, including principled correction of B1+ transmit field effects, using data from the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D; <I>N</I> = 628, ages 8&ndash;21). We characterize microstructural changes relevant to myelination by estimating age-related differences in T1w/T2w throughout the cerebral neocortex from childhood to early adulthood. We apply Bayesian spline models and clustering analysis to demonstrate graded variation in age-dependent cortical T1w/T2w differences that are correlated with the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis of cortical organization reported by others. In sensorimotor areas, T1w/T2w ratio measures start at high levels at early ages, increase at a fast pace, and decelerate at later ages (18&ndash;21). In intermediate multimodal areas along the S-A axis, T1w/T2w starts at intermediate levels and increases linearly at an intermediate pace. In transmodal/paralimbic association areas, T1w/T2w starts at low levels and increases linearly at the slowest pace. These data provide evidence for graded variation of the T1w/T2w ratio along the S-A axis that may reflect cortical myelination changes during adolescence underlying the development of complex information processing and psychological functioning. We discuss the implications of these results as well as caveats in interpreting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based estimates of myelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin is a lipid membrane that is essential to healthy brain function. Myelin wraps axons to increase neural signaling speed, enabling complex neuronal functioning underlying learning and cognition. Here, we characterize the developmental timing of myelination across the cerebral cortex during adolescence using a noninvasive proxy measure, T1w/T2w mapping. Our results provide new evidence demonstrating graded variation across the cortex in the timing of T1w/T2w changes during adolescence, with rapid T1w/T2w increases in lower-order sensory areas and gradual T1w/T2w increases in higher-order association areas. This spatial pattern of microstructural brain development closely parallels the sensorimotor-to-association axis of cortical organization and plasticity during ontogeny.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inputs to the Sleep Homeostat Originate Outside the Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The need to sleep is sensed and discharged in a poorly understood process that is homeostatically controlled over time. In flies, different contributions to this process have been attributed to peripheral ppk and central brain neurons, with the former serving as hypothetical inputs to the sleep homeostat and the latter reportedly serving as the homeostat itself. Here we re-evaluate these distinctions in light of new findings using female flies. First, activating neurons targeted by published ppk and brain drivers elicits similar phenotypes, namely, sleep deprivation followed by rebound sleep. Second, inhibiting activity or synaptic output with one type of driver suppresses sleep homeostasis induced using the other type of driver. Third, drivers previously used to implicate central neurons in sleep homeostasis unexpectedly also label ppk neurons. Fourth, activating only this subset of colabeled neurons is sufficient to elicit sleep homeostasis. Thus, many published contributions of central neurons to sleep homeostasis can be explained by previously unrecognized expression of brain drivers in peripheral ppk neurons, most likely those in the legs, which promote walking. Last, we show that activation of certain non-ppk neurons can also induce sleep homeostasis. Notably, axons of these as well as ppk neurons terminate in the same ventral brain region, suggesting that a previously undefined neural circuit element of a sleep homeostat may lie nearby.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The biological needs that sleep fulfills are unknown, but they are reflected by the ability of an animal to compensate for prior sleep loss in a process called sleep homeostasis. Researchers have searched for the neural circuitry that comprises the sleep homeostat so that the information it conveys can shed light on the nature of sleep need. Here we demonstrate that neurons originating outside of the brain are responsible for phenotypes previously attributed to the proposed central brain sleep homeostat in flies. Our results support a revised neural circuit model for sensing and discharging sleep need in which peripheral inputs connect to a sleep homeostat through previously unrecognized neural circuit elements in the ventral brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Resting-State fMRI-Based Screening of Deschloroclozapine in Rhesus Macaques Predicts Dosage-Dependent Behavioral Effects</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemogenetic techniques, such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), enable transient, reversible, and minimally invasive manipulation of neural activity <I>in vivo</I>. Their development in nonhuman primates is essential for uncovering neural circuits contributing to cognitive functions and their translation to humans. One key issue that has delayed the development of chemogenetic techniques in primates is the lack of an accessible drug-screening method. Here, we use resting-state fMRI, a noninvasive neuroimaging tool, to assess the impact of deschloroclozapine (DCZ) on brainwide resting-state functional connectivity in 7 rhesus macaques (6 males and 1 female) without DREADDs. We found that systemic administration of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ did not alter the resting-state functional connectivity. Conversely, 0.3 mg/kg of DCZ was associated with a prominent increase in functional connectivity that was mainly confined to the connections of frontal regions. Additional behavioral tests confirmed a negligible impact of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ on socio-emotional behaviors as well as on reaction time in a probabilistic learning task; 0.3 mg/kg DCZ did, however, slow responses in the probabilistic learning task, suggesting attentional or motivational deficits associated with hyperconnectivity in fronto-temporo-parietal networks. Our study highlights both the excellent selectivity of DCZ as a DREADD actuator, and the side effects of its excess dosage. The results demonstrate the translational value of resting-state fMRI as a drug-screening tool to accelerate the development of chemogenetics in primates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemogenetics, such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), can afford control over neural activity with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Accelerating the translation of chemogenetic neuromodulation from rodents to primates requires an approach to screen novel DREADD actuators <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we assessed brainwide activity in response to a DREADD actuator deschloroclozapine (DCZ) using resting-state fMRI in macaque monkeys. We demonstrated that low-dose DCZ (0.1 mg/kg) did not change whole-brain functional connectivity or affective behaviors, while a higher dose (0.3 mg/kg) altered frontal functional connectivity and slowed response in a learning task. Our study highlights the excellent selectivity of DCZ at proper dosing, and demonstrates the utility of resting-state fMRI to screen novel chemogenetic actuators in primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rewarded Extinction Increases Amygdalar Connectivity and Stabilizes Long-Term Memory Traces in the vmPFC</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurobiological evidence in rodents indicates that threat extinction incorporates reward neurocircuitry. Consequently, incorporating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study with both female and male participants, we compared counterconditioning (CC; a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction at recent (24 h) and remote (approximately one month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, rewarded extinction diminished 24-h relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One month later, the retrieval of both standard-extinction and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-h and one-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may generate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prevalent treatments for pathologic fear and anxiety are based on the principles of Pavlovian extinction. Unfortunately, extinction forms weak memories that only temporarily inhibit the retrieval of threat associations. Thus, to increase the translational relevance of extinction research, it is critical to investigate whether extinction can be augmented to form a more enduring memory, especially after long intervals. Here, we used a multiday fMRI paradigm in humans to compare the short-term and long-term neurobehavioral effects of aversive-to-appetitive counterconditioning (CC), a form of augmented extinction. Our results provide novel evidence that including an appetitive stimulus during extinction can reduce short-term threat relapse and stabilize the memory trace of extinction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), for at least one month after learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rat Anterior Cingulate Cortex Continuously Signals Decision Variables in a Patch Foraging Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>In patch foraging tasks, animals must decide whether to remain with a depleting resource or to leave it in search of a potentially better source of reward. In such tasks, animals consistently follow the general predictions of optimal foraging theory (the marginal value theorem; MVT): to leave a patch when the reward rate in the current patch depletes to the average reward rate across patches. Prior studies implicate an important role for the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in foraging decisions based on MVT: within single trials, ACC activity increases immediately preceding foraging decisions, and across trials, these dynamics are modulated as the value of staying in the patch depletes to the average reward rate. Here, we test whether these activity patterns reflect dynamic encoding of decision-variables and whether these signals are directly involved in decision-making. We developed a leaky accumulator model based on the MVT that generates estimates of decision variables within and across trials, and tested model predictions against ACC activity recorded from male rats performing a patch foraging task. Model predicted changes in MVT decision variables closely matched rat ACC activity. Next, we pharmacologically inactivated ACC in male rats to test the contribution of these signals to decision-making. ACC inactivation had a profound effect on rats' foraging decisions and response times (RTs) yet rats still followed the MVT decision rule. These findings indicate that the ACC encodes foraging-related variables for reasons unrelated to patch-leaving decisions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to make adaptive patch-foraging decisions, to remain with a depleting resource or search for better alternatives, is critical to animal well-being. Previous studies have found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity is modulated at different points in the foraging decision process, raising questions about whether the ACC guides ongoing decisions or serves a more general purpose of regulating cognitive control. To investigate the function of the ACC in foraging, the present study developed a dynamic model of behavior and neural activity, and tested model predictions using recordings and inactivation of ACC. Findings revealed that ACC continuously signals decision variables but that these signals are more likely used to monitor and regulate ongoing processes than to guide foraging decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Time Course of Language Production as Revealed by Pattern Classification of MEG Sensor Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>Language production involves a complex set of computations, from conceptualization to articulation, which are thought to engage cascading neural events in the language network. However, recent neuromagnetic evidence suggests simultaneous meaning-to-speech mapping in picture naming tasks, as indexed by early parallel activation of frontotemporal regions to lexical semantic, phonological, and articulatory information. Here we investigate the time course of word production, asking to what extent such "earliness" is a distinctive property of the associated spatiotemporal dynamics. Using MEG, we recorded the neural signals of 34 human subjects (26 males) overtly naming 134 images from four semantic object categories (animals, foods, tools, clothes). Within each category, we covaried word length, as quantified by the number of syllables contained in a word, and phonological neighborhood density to target lexical and post-lexical phonological/phonetic processes. Multivariate pattern analyses searchlights in sensor space distinguished the stimulus-locked spatiotemporal responses to object categories early on, from 150 to 250 ms after picture onset, whereas word length was decoded in left frontotemporal sensors at 250-350 ms, followed by the latency of phonological neighborhood density (350-450 ms). Our results suggest a progression of neural activity from posterior to anterior language regions for the semantic and phonological/phonetic computations preparing overt speech, thus supporting serial cascading models of word production.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Current psycholinguistic models make divergent predictions on how a preverbal message is mapped onto articulatory output during the language planning. Serial models predict a cascading sequence of hierarchically organized neural computations from conceptualization to articulation. In contrast, parallel models posit early simultaneous activation of multiple conceptual, phonological, and articulatory information in the language system. Here we asked whether such earliness is a distinctive property of the neural dynamics of word production. The combination of the millisecond precision of MEG with multivariate pattern analyses revealed subsequent onset times for the neural events supporting semantic and phonological/phonetic operations, progressing from posterior occipitotemporal to frontal sensor areas. The findings bring new insights for refining current theories of language production.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prefrontal GABAA({delta})R Promotes Fear Extinction through Enabling the Plastic Regulation of Neuronal Intrinsic Excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Extinguishing the previously acquired fear is critical for the adaptation of an organism to the ever-changing environment, a process requiring the engagement of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs). GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs consist of tens of structurally, pharmacologically, and functionally heterogeneous subtypes. However, the specific roles of these subtypes in fear extinction remain largely unexplored. Here, we observed that in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a core region for mood regulation, the extrasynaptically situated, -subunit-containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs [GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()Rs], had a permissive role in tuning fear extinction in male mice, an effect sharply contrasting to the established but suppressive role by the whole GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R family. First, the fear extinction in individual mice was positively correlated with the level of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R expression and function in their mPFC. Second, knockdown of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R in mPFC, specifically in its infralimbic (IL) subregion, sufficed to impair the fear extinction in mice. Third, GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R-deficient mice also showed fear extinction deficits, and re-expressing GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()Rs in the IL of these mice rescued the impaired extinction. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that the permissive effect of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R was associated with its role in enabling the extinction-evoked plastic regulation of neuronal excitability in IL projection neurons. By contrast, GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R had little influence on the extinction-evoked plasticity of glutamatergic transmission in these cells. Altogether, our findings revealed an unconventional and permissive role of extrasynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors in fear extinction through a route relying on nonsynaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of the kernel brain regions engaged in fear extinction. Previous studies have repetitively shown that the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) family in this region act to suppress fear extinction. However, the roles of specific GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R subtypes in mPFC are largely unknown. We observed that the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-containing -subunit [GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R], a subtype of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs exclusively situated in the extrasynaptic membrane and mediating the tonic neuronal inhibition, works oppositely to the whole GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R family and promotes (but does not suppress) fear extinction. More interestingly, in striking contrast to the synaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs that suppress fear extinction by breaking the extinction-evoked plasticity of glutamatergic transmission, the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R promotes fear extinction through enabling the plastic regulation of neuronal excitability in the infralimbic subregion of mPFC. Our findings thus reveal an unconventional role of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R in promoting fear extinction through a route relying on nonsynaptic plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Voluntary Motor Command Release Coincides with Restricted Sensorimotor Beta Rhythm Phases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory perception and memory are enhanced during restricted phases of ongoing brain rhythms, but whether voluntary movement is constrained by brain rhythm phase is not known. Voluntary movement requires motor commands to be released from motor cortex (M1) and transmitted to spinal motoneurons and effector muscles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that motor commands are preferentially released from M1 during circumscribed phases of ongoing sensorimotor rhythms. Healthy humans of both sexes performed a self-paced finger movement task during electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. We first estimated the time of motor command release preceding each finger movement by subtracting individually measured corticomuscular transmission latencies from EMG-determined movement onset times. Then, we determined the phase of ipsilateral and contralateral sensorimotor mu (8&ndash;12 Hz) and beta (13&ndash;35 Hz) rhythms during release of each motor command. We report that motor commands were most often released between 120 and 140&deg; along the contralateral beta cycle but were released uniformly along the contralateral mu cycle. Motor commands were also released uniformly along ipsilateral mu and beta cycles. Results demonstrate that motor command release coincides with restricted phases of the contralateral sensorimotor beta rhythm, suggesting that sensorimotor beta rhythm phase may sculpt the timing of voluntary human movement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual and cognitive function is optimal during specific brain rhythm phases. Although brain rhythm phase influences motor cortical neuronal activity and communication between the motor cortex and spinal cord, its role in voluntary movement is poorly understood. Here, we show that the motor commands needed to produce voluntary movements are preferentially released from the motor cortex during contralateral sensorimotor beta rhythm phases. Our findings are consistent with the notion that sensorimotor rhythm phase influences the timing of voluntary human movement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APPs{alpha} Rescues Tau-Induced Synaptic Pathology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is histopathologically characterized by A&beta; plaques and the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau species, the latter also constituting key hallmarks of primary tauopathies. Whereas A&beta; is produced by amyloidogenic APP processing, APP processing along the competing nonamyloidogenic pathway results in the secretion of neurotrophic and synaptotrophic APPs&alpha;. Recently, we demonstrated that APPs&alpha; has therapeutic effects in transgenic AD model mice and rescues A&beta;-dependent impairments. Here, we examined the potential of APPs&alpha; to mitigate Tau-induced synaptic deficits in <I>P301S</I> mice (both sexes), a widely used mouse model of tauopathy. Analysis of synaptic plasticity revealed an aberrantly increased LTP in <I>P301S</I> mice that could be normalized by acute application of nanomolar amounts of APPs&alpha; to hippocampal slices, indicating a homeostatic function of APPs&alpha; on a rapid time scale. Further, AAV-mediated <I>in vivo</I> expression of APPs&alpha; restored normal spine density of CA1 neurons even at stages of advanced Tau pathology not only in <I>P301S</I> mice, but also in independent <I>THY-Tau22</I> mice. Strikingly, when searching for the mechanism underlying aberrantly increased LTP in <I>P301S</I> mice, we identified an early and progressive loss of major GABAergic interneuron subtypes in the hippocampus of <I>P301S</I> mice, which may lead to reduced GABAergic inhibition of principal cells. Interneuron loss was paralleled by deficits in nest building, an innate behavior highly sensitive to hippocampal impairments. Together, our findings indicate that APPs&alpha; has therapeutic potential for Tau-mediated synaptic dysfunction and suggest that loss of interneurons leads to disturbed neuronal circuits that compromise synaptic plasticity as well as behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our findings indicate, for the first time, that APPs&alpha; has the potential to rescue Tau-induced spine loss and abnormal synaptic plasticity. Thus, APPs&alpha; might have therapeutic potential not only because of its synaptotrophic functions, but also its homeostatic capacity for neuronal network activity. Hence, APPs&alpha; is one of the few molecules which has proven therapeutic effects in mice, both for A&beta;- and Tau-dependent synaptic impairments and might therefore have therapeutic potential for patients suffering from AD or primary tauopathies. Furthermore, we found in <I>P301S</I> mice a pronounced reduction of inhibitory interneurons as the earliest pathologic event preceding the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau species. This loss of interneurons most likely disturbs neuronal circuits that are important for synaptic plasticity and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Functionally Clustered mRNAs Are Distinctly Enriched at Cortical Astroglial Processes and Are Preferentially Affected by FMRP Deficiency</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mature protoplasmic astroglia in the mammalian CNS uniquely possess a large number of fine processes that have been considered primary sites to mediate astroglia to neuron synaptic signaling. However, localized mechanisms for regulating interactions between astroglial processes and synapses, especially for regulating the expression of functional surface proteins at these fine processes, are largely unknown. Previously, we showed that the loss of the RNA binding protein FMRP in astroglia disrupts astroglial mGluR5 signaling and reduces expression of the major astroglial glutamate transporter GLT1 and glutamate uptake in the cortex of Fmr1 conditional deletion mice. In the current study, by examining ribosome localization using electron microscopy and identifying mRNAs enriched at cortical astroglial processes using synaptoneurosome/translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-Seq in WT and FMRP-deficient male mice, our results reveal interesting localization-dependent functional clusters of mRNAs at astroglial processes. We further showed that the lack of FMRP preferentially alters the subcellular localization and expression of process-localized mRNAs. Together, we defined the role of FMRP in altering mRNA localization and expression at astroglial processes at the postnatal development (P30-P40) and provided new candidate mRNAs that are potentially regulated by FMRP in cortical astroglia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lack of Causal Roles of Cannabinoid and Dopamine Neurotransmitter Systems in Orbitofrontal and Piriform Cortex in Fentanyl Relapse in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and piriform cortex (Pir) play a role in fentanyl relapse after food choice-induced voluntary abstinence, a procedure mimicking abstinence because of availability of alternative nondrug rewards. We used <I>in situ</I> hybridization and pharmacology to determine the role of OFC and Pir cannabinoid and dopamine receptors in fentanyl relapse. We trained male and female rats to self-administer food pellets for 6 d (6 h/d) and intravenous fentanyl (2.5 &micro;g/kg/infusion) for 12 d (6 h/d). We assessed fentanyl relapse after 12 discrete choice sessions between fentanyl and food (20 trials/d), in which rats voluntarily reduced fentanyl self-administration. We used RNAscope to determine whether fentanyl relapse is associated with activity (indicated by <I>Fos</I>) in OFC and Pir cells expressing <I>Cnr1</I> [which encodes cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors] or <I>Drd1</I> and <I>Drd2</I> (which encode dopamine D1 and D2 receptors). We injected a CB1 receptor antagonist or agonist (0.3 or 1.0 &micro;g AM251 or WIN55,212-2/hemisphere) into OFC or a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist (1.0 or 3.0 &micro;g SCH39166/hemisphere) into Pir to determine the effect on fentanyl relapse. Fentanyl relapse was associated with OFC cells co-expressing <I>Fos</I> and <I>Cnr1</I> and Pir cells co-expressing <I>Fos</I> and <I>Drd1</I>. However, injections of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 or agonist WIN55,212-2 into OFC or the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH39166 into Pir had no effect on fentanyl relapse. Fentanyl relapse is associated with activation of <I>Cnr1</I>-expressing OFC cells and <I>Drd1</I>-expressing Pir cells, but pharmacological manipulations do not support causal roles of OFC CB1 receptors or Pir dopamine D1 receptors in fentanyl relapse.</p>

                Human and animal cell lines serve as model systems in a wide range of life sciences such as cancer and infection research or drug screening. Reproducible data are highly dependent on authenticated, contaminant-free cell lines, no better delivered than by the official and certified biorepositories. Offering a web portal to high-throughput information on these model systems will facilitate working with and comparing to these references by data otherwise dispersed at different sources. We here provide DSMZCellDive to access a comprehensive data source on human and animal cell lines, freely available at celldive.dsmz.de. A wide variety of data sources are generated such as RNA-seq transcriptome data and STR (short tandem repeats) profiles. Several starting points ease entering the database via browsing, searching or visualising. This web tool is designed for further expansion on meta and high-throughput data to be generated in future. Explicated examples for the power of this novel tool include analysis of B-cell differentiation markers, homeo-oncogene expression, and measurement of genomic loss of heterozygosities by an enlarged STR panel of 17 loci. Sharing the data on cell lines by the biorepository itself will be of benefit to the scientific communityÂ  since it (1) supports the selection of appropriate model cell lines, (2) ensures reliability, (3) avoids misleading data, (4) saves on additional experimentals,Â and (5) serves as reference for genomic and gene expression data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Transmission of yellow fever vaccine virus from breast feeding mothers to their infants: reporting of yellow fever virus (YFV) RNA detection in milk specimens [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Because of yellow feverâs serious impact on health, vaccination is the principal strategy to control the disease. Administration of the yellow fever vaccine to breastfeeding women should be before they complete 9 months post-delivery, in order to prevent transmission of the yellow fever vaccine virus to their infants through breast feeding. This study aimed to confirm whether the excretion of yellow fever vaccine virus is in milk of vaccinated breastfeeding mothers and to confirm the probable transmission to their infants through breast milk. Methods: Samples were taken as follows: one serum specimen was taken 3-14 days after the date of the vaccination, and breast milk specimens were taken at four different time points between 3-4 days apart. Specimens were obtained from eight nursing mothers, who received the YVF vaccine (17DD). Mothers were asymptomatic before and after the vaccine administration but their infants developed symptoms after administration. Maternal serum samples were tested for YFV specific IgM antibodies through immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA). RNA was extracted from serum and breast milk specimens and YFV RNA screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In total, five mothers (62.5%) were positive for YFV IgM and two mothers (25%) had YFV RNA in serum. Among milk specimens, YFV RNA was detected during the four different mentioned collection times as follows (positive milk specimens/total milk specimens): 3/8 (37.5 %), 4/6 (66.6%) and 1/4(25%). RNA was completely undetectable in the last collection time. Conclusions: YFV transmission from mothers to their babies through breast-feeding was highly probable indicated by the temporal relationship to motherâs YF vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A comparative study of red brick powder and lime as soft soil stabilizer [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The role of soil in building construction is to support the loads above it. Different types of soil with poor mechanical properties require more attention. Therefore, more effort is needed to stabilize the soil by improving its properties. These improvements are intended to modify soil properties to improve engineering performance, such as strength, decrease in compressibility and permeability. This study aimed to compare the potential of lime and brick powder as stabilizers based on the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values. Soil stabilization can be defined as modifying the soil properties by chemical or physical means to improve its engineering efficiency. The main objectives of stabilizing soil are increasing its bearing capacity, resistance to weathering processes, and permeability. Methods: This work did laboratory tests with disturbed and undisturbed soil samples. The proportions of lime or red brick powder additives are 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of the soil sample. From the results of the laboratory tests, the soil type obtained is MH (low plasticity silt) as per the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). Results: This study showed that soft soil could be improved by adding lime and red brick powder as a soil stabilizer. In both soaked and unsoaked CBR tests, there was an increase in the CBR value for each proportion of the mixed additives. However, the red brick powder addition (15%) has significantly increased the CBR value. Conclusions: The soil sample mixed with 15% red brick powder had the highest Maximum Dry Density (MDD), about 5.5% over untreated soil. The increment of lime to 15% has increased the CBR soaked by 61% in relation to untreated soil. The increment of red brick powder to 15% has increased the CBR unsoaked by 73% in relation to untreated soil.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">To what extent naringenin binding and membrane depolarization shape mitoBK channel gatingâA machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Monika Richter-Laskowska, Paulina Trybek, Piotr Bednarczyk, Agata Wawrzkiewicz-JaÅowiecka</p>

The large conductance voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels from the inner mitochondrial membrane (mitoBK) are modulated by a number of factors. Among them flavanones, including naringenin (Nar), arise as a promising group of mitoBK channel regulators from a pharmacological point of view. It is well known that in the presence of Nar the open state probability (<i>p</i><sub>op</sub>) of mitoBK channels significantly increases. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of the mitoBK-Nar interactions remains still unrevealed. It is also not known whether the effects of naringenin administration on conformational dynamics can resemble those which are exerted by the other channel-activating stimuli. In aim to answer this question, we examine whether the dwell-time series of mitoBK channels which were obtained at different voltages and Nar concentrations (yet allowing to reach comparable <i>p</i><sub>op</sub>s) are discernible by means of artificial intelligence methods, including k-NN and shapelet learning. The obtained results suggest that the structural complexity of the gating dynamics is shaped both by the interaction of channel gate with the voltage sensor (VSD) and the Nar-binding site. For a majority of data one can observe stimulus-specific patterns of channel gating. Shapelet algorithm allows to obtain better prediction accuracy in most cases. Probably, because it takes into account the complexity of local features of a given signal. About 30% of the analyzed time series do not sufficiently differ to unambiguously distinguish them from each other, which can be interpreted in terms of the existence of the common features of mitoBK channel gating regardless of the type of activating stimulus. There exist long-range mutual interactions between VSD and the Nar-coordination site that are responsible for higher levels of Nar-activation (Î<i>p</i><sub>op</sub>) at deeply depolarized membranes. These intra-sensor interactions are anticipated to have an allosteric nature.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling scenarios for mitigating outbreaks in congregate settings</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Seth Blumberg, Phoebe Lu, Ada T. Kwan, Christopher M. Hoover, James O. Lloyd-Smith, David Sears, Stefano M. Bertozzi, Lee Worden</p>

The explosive outbreaks of COVID-19 seen in congregate settings such as prisons and nursing homes, has highlighted a critical need for effective outbreak prevention and mitigation strategies for these settings. Here we consider how different types of control interventions impact the expected number of symptomatic infections due to outbreaks. Introduction of disease into the resident population from the community is modeled as a stochastic point process coupled to a branching process, while spread between residents is modeled via a deterministic compartmental model that accounts for depletion of susceptible individuals. Control is modeled as a proportional decrease in the number of susceptible residents, the reproduction number, and/or the proportion of symptomatic infections. This permits a range of assumptions about the density dependence of transmission and modes of protection by vaccination, depopulation and other types of control. We find that vaccination or depopulation can have a greater than linear effect on the expected number of cases. For example, assuming a reproduction number of 3.0 with density-dependent transmission, we find that preemptively reducing the size of the susceptible population by 20% reduced overall disease burden by 47%. In some circumstances, it may be possible to reduce the risk and burden of disease outbreaks by optimizing the way a group of residents are apportioned into distinct residential units. The optimal apportionment may be different depending on whether the goal is to reduce the probability of an outbreak occurring, or the expected number of cases from outbreak dynamics. In other circumstances there may be an opportunity to implement reactive disease control measures in which the number of susceptible individuals is rapidly reduced once an outbreak has been detected to occur. Reactive control is most effective when the reproduction number is not too high, and there is minimal delay in implementing control. We highlight the California state prison system as an example for how these findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding disease transmission in congregate settings. Our approach and accompanying interactive website (https://phoebelu.shinyapps.io/DepopulationModels/) provides a quantitative framework to evaluate the potential impact of policy decisions governing infection control in outbreak settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental health burden and predictors among Egyptian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to have negatively affected the physical and mental well-being of healthcare workers. Estimating such a burden in a limited-resource setting may be essential in the ongoing fight against the pandemic. This research aims to assess the prevalence of mental health problems, that is, depression and anxiety, among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and their associated factors and predictors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey to screen for anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score among healthcare workers in direct or indirect contact with COVID-19 cases. Results: Analysis of participantsâ responses showed that 36.7% suffered from depression, while 30.7% had moderate to severe anxiety. Independent predictors of depression were feeling unsure or dissatisfied with oneâs income (AOR =8.87 and 8.51, respectively), working exclusively in private or governmental hospitals (AOR = 8.15 and 5.1, respectively), and serving in central or insurance hospitals (AOR = 2.21). Meanwhile, independent predictors of anxiety were working in governmental hospitals (AOR = 5.87), working duration from 5 to 10 years (AOR = 4.65), and suffering from other comorbidities (AOR = 2.18). Working as a nurse was a protective factor against anxiety (AOR = 0.36). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic considerably affected the mental well-being of health care workers in Egypt. Income, type of hospital, working duration, and other comorbidities were the main predictors of health care workersâ mental health. Examining the mental burden of the pandemic on health care workers is important so that current and future crises can be managed better.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of Integrated Emotional-Self Enhancement (IESE) program among staff nurses: protocol for a quasi-experimental study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Staff nurses face frequent emotional situations in their work environment. The constant contact with suffering patients, and the busy work environment, pose tremendous stress on nurses' physical and emotional health. Theâ¯Emotional Intelligenceâ¯skills of empathy, self-awareness, motivation, self-control, andâ¯keepingâ¯relationships, can help handleâ¯difficult emotions and allow nurses to work in an organized, calm, and professional way. This study aims to implement and assess the effectiveness of a training program developed by the investigator, tailored to the mental and emotional needs of staff nurses who are working in an organisation. The study also aims to observe any significant change, correlation, and association in the staff nursesâ level of emotional intelligence, intrinsic motivation, self-compassion, emotional labour, and nurse-in-chargesâ and patientsâ perception of nursing care after the program. Methods: A quasi-experimental (one-group) study design will be used in this study. The study will involve 80 staff nurses working in a selected hospital in India. The staff nurses will be selected from the hospital's general wards using convenience sampling. The investigator will deliver a training program, divided into four sessions of two hours each. Data will be collected from the participants at baseline and 3-months pre-intervention; and post-test data will be collected immediately after the intervention, at 3-month, and 6-month follow-up, to observe any significant change in the study variables before and after the intervention. Results: The current study primarily focuses on the vital aspect of developing emotional needs, for promoting a better work-life balance. Research findings from the study will significantly contribute to the evidence-based Emotional Intelligence programs for staff nurses, and if proven effective, could be delivered extensively in hospitals. Trial registration: The study is registered in June 2019 under the Central Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2019/08/020592).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria are one of the essential cellular organelles. Apart from being considered as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria have been widely known to regulate redox reaction, inflammation, cell survival, cell death, metabolism, etc., and are implicated in the progression of numerous disease conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain is an energy-demanding organ, mitochondria and their functions are important for maintaining normal brain homeostasis. Alterations in mitochondrial gene expression, mutations, and epigenetic modification contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria and aggregation of proteins in neurons leads to alteration in mitochondria functions which further causes neuronal death and progression of neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies have prioritized mitochondria as a possible drug target in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the present review article has been intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis followed by possible intervention and future treatment strategies to combat mitochondrial-mediated neurodegeneration.</p>

                Background: In this study we aimed to test whether suggested DSM-5 criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) share a similar latent structure to formally recognised addiction. Methods: We used latent class analysis on a dichotomous measure of IGD. The data was collected from a convenient general population sample (500) and a targeted gaming forum sample (236). Results: We found a four or six-class model to be most appropriate, ranging from âcasual/non-gamerâ to âpotentially disorderedâ with increasing symptom severity. The majority of âpotentially disorderedâ gamers (5+ criteria) were found to be 18-30 years old, and no âpotentially disorderedâ gamers were over 42. Conclusions: The results suggest that gaming may share a similar latent structure to established addictions, with adolescents and young adults being more at risk. Studies replicating these results would be beneficial, with further emphasis on a critical evaluation of the criteria and symptom cut-off point.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Feasibility and effectiveness of exercise-based prehabilitation in patients opting for elective abdominal surgeries: A pre-post study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Surgical procedures are accompanied by various complications such as decreased respiratory muscle strength, decreased functional capacity, decreased quality of life, and increased the length of hospital stay. There is a growing body of evidence that indicates that exercise-based prehabilitation offered before major abdominal surgeries can improve the above-mentioned complications. Considering the socioeconomic inequalities, educational characteristics, and healthcare system, which are different in low and lower-middle income countries, it is important to know whether interventions such as prehabilitation are feasible and effective in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgeries. Hence, we set out to determine the role of exercise-based prehabilitation in patients opting for these surgeries. Methods: In this feasibility study, 71% of the eligible patients agreed to participate. Baseline values of respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life were recorded preoperatively, and an exercise-based prehabilitation programme consisting of chest physiotherapy, aerobic exercises and inspiratory muscle training according to the patientâs capacity was administered until the day of surgery. A total of 62% of the participants completed the study whose postoperative values and a user satisfaction scale were noted. The feasibility parameters Â of recruitment rate, dropout rates, adherence events, adverse events and participants satisfaction were evaluated and the differences in the preoperative and postoperative values of respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life Â were calculated using the paired t-test Â accordingly. Results: Feasibility was measured using five parameters. All the values were > 50% and above. The secondary variables respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, and quality of life were not significant. Conclusions: This study concluded that prehabilitation is feasible and can be effectively delivered to patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery.

                <p>Brain imaging is essential to the clinical care of patients with stroke, a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Whereas advanced neuroimaging techniques offer opportunities for aiding acute stroke management, several factors, including time delays, inter-clinician variability, and lack of systemic conglomeration of clinical information, hinder their maximal utility. Recent advances in deep machine learning (DL) offer new strategies for harnessing computational medical image analysis to inform decision making in acute stroke. We examine the current state of the field for DL models in stroke triage. First, we provide a brief, clinical practice-focused primer on DL. Next, we examine real-world examples of DL applications in pixel-wise labeling, volumetric lesion segmentation, stroke detection, and prediction of tissue fate postintervention. We evaluate recent deployments of deep neural networks and their ability to automatically select relevant clinical features for acute decision making, reduce inter-rater variability, and boost reliability in rapid neuroimaging assessments, and integrate neuroimaging with electronic medical record (EMR) data in order to support clinicians in routine and triage stroke management. Ultimately, we aim to provide a framework for critically evaluating existing automated approaches, thus equipping clinicians with the ability to understand and potentially apply DL approaches in order to address challenges in clinical practice.

                Low voltage-activated calcium currents are mediated by T-type calcium channels Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, which modulate a variety of physiological processes including sleep, cardiac pace-making, pain, and epilepsy. Ca<sub>V</sub>3 isoforms' biophysical properties, overlapping expression, and lack of subtype-selective pharmacology hinder the determination of their specific physiological roles in health and disease. We have identified Î¼-theraphotoxin Pn3a as the first subtype-selective spider venom peptide inhibitor of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, with &gt;100-fold lower potency against the other T-type isoforms. Pn3a modifies Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 gating through a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation thus decreasing Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-mediated currents in the normal range of activation potentials. Paddle chimeras of K<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels bearing voltage sensor sequences from all four Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 domains revealed preferential binding of Pn3a to the S3-S4 region of domain II (Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3<sup>DII</sup>). This novel T-type channel pharmacological site was explored through computational docking simulations of Pn3a, site-directed mutagenesis, and full domain II swaps between Cav3 channels highlighting it as a subtype-specific pharmacophore. This research expands our understanding of T-type calcium channel pharmacology and supports the suitability of Pn3a as a molecular tool in the study of the physiological roles of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A dynamic rhizosphere interplay between tree roots and soil bacteria under drought stress</a></h4>

              
                Root exudates are thought to play an important role in plant-microbial interactions. In return for nutrition, soil bacteria can increase the bioavailability of soil nutrients. However, root exudates typically decrease in situations such as drought, calling into question the efficacy of solvation and bacteria-dependent mineral uptake in such stress. Here we tested the hypothesis of exudate-driven microbial priming on <i>Cupressus</i> saplings grown in forest soil in custom-made rhizotron boxes. A 1-month imposed drought and concomitant inoculations with a mix of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i>, bacteria species isolated from the forest soil, were applied using factorial design. Direct bacteria counts and visualization by confocal microscopy showed that both bacteria associated with <i>Cupressus</i> Interestingly, root exudation rates increased 2.3-fold with bacteria under drought, as well as irrigation. Forty four metabolites in exudates were significantly different in concentration between irrigated and drought trees, including phenolic acid compounds and quinate. When adding these metabolites as carbon and nitrogen sources to bacterial cultures of both bacterial species, 8 of 9 metabolites stimulated bacterial growth. Importantly, soil phosphorous bioavailability was maintained only in inoculated trees, mitigating drought-induced decrease in leaf phosphorus and iron. Our observations of increased root exudation rate when drought and inoculation regimes were combined, support the idea of root recruitment of beneficial bacteria, especially under water stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The rapid developmental rise of somatic inhibition disengages hippocampal dynamics from self-motion</a></h4>

              
                Early electrophysiological brain oscillations recorded in preterm babies and newborn rodents are initially mostly driven by bottom-up sensorimotor activity and only later can detach from external inputs. This is a hallmark of most developing brain areas including the hippocampus, which in the adult brain, functions in integrating external inputs onto internal dynamics. Such developmental disengagement from external inputs is likely a fundamental step for the proper development of cognitive internal models. Despite its importance, the developmental timeline and circuit basis for this disengagement remain unknown. To address this issue, we have investigated the daily evolution of CA1 dynamics and underlying circuits during the first two postnatal weeks of mouse development using two-photon calcium imaging in non-anesthetized pups. We show that the first postnatal week ends with an abrupt shift in the representation of self-motion in CA1. Indeed, most CA1 pyramidal cells switch from activated to inhibited by self-generated movements at the end of the first postnatal week whereas the majority of GABAergic neurons remain positively modulated throughout this period. This rapid switch occurs within two days and follows the rapid anatomical and functional surge of local somatic GABAergic innervation. The observed change in dynamics is consistent with a two-population model undergoing a strengthening of inhibition. We propose that this abrupt developmental transition inaugurates the emergence of internal hippocampal dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of nuclear size by osmotic forces in Schizosaccharomyces pombe</a></h4>

              
                The size of the nucleus scales robustly with cell size so that the nuclear-to-cell volume ratio (N/C ratio) is maintained during cell growth in many cell types. The mechanism responsible for this scaling remains mysterious. Previous studies have established that the N/C ratio is not determined by DNA amount but is instead influenced by factors such as nuclear envelope mechanics and nuclear transport. Here, we developed a quantitative model for nuclear size control based upon colloid osmotic pressure and tested key predictions in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. This model posits that the N/C ratio is determined by the numbers of macromolecules in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Osmotic shift experiments showed that the fission yeast nucleus behaves as an ideal osmometer whose volume is primarily dictated by osmotic forces. Inhibition of nuclear export caused accumulation of macromolecules and an increase in crowding in the nucleoplasm, leading to nuclear swelling. We further demonstrated that the N/C ratio is maintained by a homeostasis mechanism based upon synthesis of macromolecules during growth. These studies demonstrate the functions of colloid osmotic pressure in intracellular organization and size control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dopamine D2Rs coordinate cue-evoked changes in striatal acetylcholine levels</a></h4>

              
                In the striatum, acetylcholine (ACh) neuron activity is modulated co-incident with dopamine (DA) release in response to unpredicted rewards and reward predicting cues and both neuromodulators are thought to regulate each other. While this co-regulation has been studied using stimulation studies, the existence of this mutual regulation <i>in vivo </i>during natural behavior is still largely unexplored. One long-standing controversy has been whether striatal DA is responsible for the induction of the cholinergic pause or whether D2R modulate a pause that is induced by other mechanisms. Here, we used genetically encoded sensors in combination with pharmacological and genetic inactivation of D2Rs from cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to simultaneously measure ACh and DA levels after CIN D2R inactivation in mice. We found that CIN D2Rs are not necessary for the initiation of cue induced decrease in ACh levels. Rather, they prolong the duration of the decrease and inhibit ACh rebound levels. Notably, the change in task evoked ACh levels is not associated with altered DA levels. Moreover, D2R inactivation strongly decreased the temporal correlation between DA and ACh signals not only at cue presentation but also during the intertrial interval pointing to a general mechanism by which D2Rs coordinate both signals. At the behavioral level D2R antagonism increased the latency to lever press, which was not observed in CIN-selective D2R knock out mice. Press latency correlated with the cue evoked decrease in ACh levels and artificial inhibition of CINs revealed that longer inhibition shortens the latency to press compared to shorter inhibition. This supports a role of the ACh signal and itâs regulation by D2Rs in the motivation to initiate actions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior-guided Individualized Thalamic Parcellation based on Local Diffusion Characteristics using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                As a gateway for projections entering and exiting the cerebral cortex, the human thalamus processes information from sensory to cognition relevant to various neuropsychiatric disorders. It is composed of dozens of nuclei, which have been difficult to identify with clinical MR sequences. However, delineating thalamic nuclei accurately at an individual level is essential for precise neuromodulation treatment. Here, we not only identified the fine-grained thalamic nuclei using local diffusion properties in vivo but also employed a deep learning strategy to achieve highly reproducible individual-level parcellation. Using High-quality diffusion MRI (dMRI), we first constructed a fine-grained group thalamus atlas based on thalamic local diffusion features. Then, the high-probability core area of the group thalamus atlas was wrapped into the native space as prior guidance for individualized thalamus construction. Finally, we trained the semi-supervised multiple classification models to accurately construct the individualized thalamus atlas with single-subject local diffusion characteristics. Compared to group atlas registration and single-subject clustering strategies, our individualized thalamus atlas combines population commonality and individual specificity and is superior in depicting the individual thalamic nuclei boundaries. Besides, our atlas provides a more conspicuous capacity to capture the individual specificity of thalamic nuclei. Through the evaluation by 3.0T7.0T and test-retest dMRI datasets, the proposed high-probability group prior guided individualized thalamus construction pipeline is robust and repeatable in different magnetic field strengths and scanning batches. In addition, the individual parcellation of the thalamic nuclei has a good correspondence with the histological atlas and captured both higher group consistency and inter-subjects variations, which could be a valuable solution for precision clinical treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sustained spinal motor activity triggered by direct mechanosensory stimulation in adult Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Most vertebrates and invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster are able to move in complex environments due to their ability to integrate sensory information along with motor commands. Mechanosensory structures exist along each leg to assist in motor coordination by transmitting external cues or proprioceptive information to motor centers in the central nervous system. Nevertheless, how different mechanosensory structures engage these locomotor centers and their underlying circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the role of mechanosensory structures in movement initiation by optogenetically stimulating specific classes of leg sensory structures. We found that stimulation of leg Mechanosensory Bristles (MsB) and femoral Chordotonal Organ (ChO) is sufficient to initiate forward movement in immobile animals. We also found that while the stimulation of the ChO depends on the presence of the central brain to trigger forward movement, stimulation of leg MsB could trigger cyclic motor activity independently of central brain circuits. Leg MsB-triggered movement lacks inter-leg and intra-leg coordination, whilst antagonistic muscle activity within joints is preserved. Moreover, we found that the duration of the MsB-induced movement is dependent on the number of excited cells and is specific to leg afferents, since stimulation of MsB in other segments lead to different motor outcomes. This study sheds light on the ability of specific sensory circuits to modulate motor control, including initiation of movement, and how this information can be automatically translated to a motor command by spinal neuronal pathways.

                Mechanosensory feedback of internal state regulates numerous bodily processes including feeding, defecation, and reproduction. However, how mechanosensory feedback signals to modulate neural circuits and coordinate these behaviors is incompletely understood. Here, we use the egg-laying circuit of C. elegans to test our hypothesis that mechanosensory feedback of egg accumulation promotes the active reproductive behavior state. Using an acute gonad microinjection technique to mimic changes in pressure and stretch resulting from germline activity and egg accumulation, we find that injection rapidly stimulates Ca2+ activity in both neurons and muscles of the egg-laying circuit. Injection-induced vulval muscle Ca2+ activity requires L-type Ca2+ channels but is independent of presynaptic input. Direct mechanical prodding activates the vulval muscles, suggesting they are the proximal targets of the stretch-dependent stimulus. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in C. elegans is regulated by a stretch-dependent homeostat that scales postsynaptic muscle responses with egg accumulation in the uterus.

                The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is known to regulate various cognitive and behavioral processes. However, while functional diversity among PVT circuits has often been linked to cellular differences, the molecular identity and spatial distribution of PVT cell types remains unclear. To address this gap, here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and identified five molecularly distinct PVT neuronal subtypes. Additionally, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization of top marker genes revealed that PVT subtypes are organized by a combination of previously unidentified molecular gradients. Lastly, comparing our dataset with a recently published single-cell sequencing atlas of thalamus yielded novel insight into the PVT's connectivity with cortex, including unexpected innervation of auditory and visual areas. This comparison also revealed that our data contains a largely non-overlapping transcriptomic map of multiple midline thalamic nuclei. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unknown features of the molecular diversity and anatomical organization of the PVT and provide a valuable resource for future investigations.

                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a hub for cognitive control, and dopamine profoundly influences its functions. In other brain regions, astrocytes sense diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and, in turn, orchestrate regulation of neuroactive substances. However, basic physiology of PFC astrocytes, including which neuromodulatory signals they respond to and how they contribute to PFC function, is lacking. Here, we characterize divergent signaling signatures in astrocytes of PFC and primary sensory cortex in mice, which are linked to differential responsivity to locomotion. We find that PFC astrocytes express receptors for dopamine, but are unresponsive through the Gs/Gi-cAMP pathway. Instead, fast calcium signals in PFC astrocytes are time-locked to dopamine release, and are mediated by 1-adrenergic receptors both ex vivo and in vivo. Further, we describe dopamine-triggered regulation of extracellular ATP at PFC astrocyte territories. Thus, we identify astrocytes as active players in dopaminergic signaling in PFC, contributing to PFC function though neuromodulator receptor crosstalk.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective cure. Cerebrovascular and neurovascular pathology are early and causal hallmarks of AD, with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the deposition of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) at the cerebral vasculature, being present in about 90% of AD cases. Our previous work has uncovered the protective effect of carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition against A{beta}-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in vascular, glial and neuronal cells in culture and in mouse brains injected with A{beta}. Here, we tested for the first time in a model of AD and cerebrovascular amyloidosis, the TgSwDI mice, a chronic regimen employing FDA-approved CA inhibitors (CAIs), methazolamide (MTZ) and acetazolamide (ATZ). These drugs are used in humans for the treatment of glaucoma, high altitude sickness, and other disorders, and are able to pass the blood-brain barrier. We found that both CAIs were non-toxic, significantly reduced cerebral amyloidosis, including vascular and glial A{beta} accumulation, and ameliorated cognition. MTZ and ATZ treatment prevented caspase activation in endothelial cells, microglia and astrocytes, reverted capillary constriction, reduced gliosis, and induced protective pro-clearance pathways, which are likely responsible for the reduction of A{beta} deposition. Importantly, we unveiled a key new drug target, showing that the mitochondrial isozyme CA-VB is upregulated in TgSwDI brains and in endothelial cells upon A{beta} treatment, and that CA-VB silencing, mimicking CAIs effects, reduces endothelial cell apoptosis. Overall, this work paves the way to the potential application of CAIs in clinical trials for human AD and CAA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A spherical harmonics-based framework for representing steady-state shifts in neuron models induced by weak electric fields</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We provide a systematic framework for the quantification of the effect of externally applied weak electric fields on realistic neuron compartment models as captured by physiologically relevant quantities such as the membrane potential or transmembrane current as a function of the orientation of the field. Approach: We define a response function as the steady-state change of the membrane potential induced by a canonical external field of 1~V/m as a function of its orientation. We estimate the function values through simulations employing reconstructions of the rat somatosensory cortex from the Blue Brain Project. The response of different cell types is simulated using the NEURON simulation environment. We represent and analyze the angular response as an expansion in spherical harmonics. Main results: We report membrane perturbation values comparable to those in the literature, extend them to different cell types, and provide their profiles as spherical harmonic coefficients. We show that in resting condition, responses are dominated by their dipole terms (l=1), in agreement with experimental findings and compartment theory. Indeed, we show analytically that for a passive cell only the dipole term is nonzero. However, for states other than resting, other terms, while small, appear relevant. In particular, we show how l=0 and l=2 terms can modify the function to induce asymmetries in the response. Significance: This work provides a practical framework for the realistic representation of the effects of weak electric fields on different neuron types and their main regions---an important milestone for the development of micro- and mesoscale models and the optimization of brain stimulation solutions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross Atlas Remapping via Optimal Transport (CAROT): Creating connectomes for any atlas when raw data is not available</a></h4>

              
                Whether using large-scale projects---like the Human Connectome Project (HCP), the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, Healthy Brain Network (HBN), and the UK Biobank---or pooling together several smaller studies, open-source, publicly available datasets allow for unpresented sample sizes and promote generalization efforts. Overall, releasing preprocessing data can enhance participant privacy, democratize science, and lead to unique scientific discoveries. But releasing preprocessed data also limits the choices available to the end-user. For connectomics, this is especially true as connectomes created from different atlases i.e., ways of dividing the brain into distinct regions) are not directly comparable. In addition, there exist several atlases with no gold standards, and more being developed yearly, making it unrealistic to have processed, open-source data available from all atlases. To address these limitations, we propose Cross Atlas Remapping via Optimal Transport (CAROT) to find a mapping between two atlases, allowing data processed from one atlas to be directly transformed into a connectome based on another atlas without needing raw data. To validate CAROT, we compare reconstructed connectomes against their original counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas), demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes in downstream analyses, and show how a connectome-based predictive model can be generalized to publicly available processed data that was processed with different atlases. Overall, CAROT can reconstruct connectomes from an extensive set of atlases---without ever needing the raw data---allowing already processed connectomes to be easily reused in a wide-range of analyses while eliminating wasted and duplicate processing efforts. We share this tool as both source code and as a stand-alone web application (http://carotproject.com/).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Updating memories of unwanted emotions during human sleep</a></h4>

              
                Post-learning sleep contributes to memory consolidation. Yet, it remains contentious whether sleep affords opportunities to modify or update emotional memories, such as those people would prefer to forget. Here we attempted to update memories during sleep using spoken positive emotional words paired with cues to recent memories for aversive events. Affect updating using positive words during human non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, compared with using neutral words instead, reduced negative affect judgments in post-sleep tests, suggesting that the recalled events were perceived as less aversive. EEG analyses showed that emotional words modulated theta and spindle/sigma activity. Specifically, to the extent that theta power was larger for the positive word than for the following memory cue, participants judged the memory cues less negatively. Moreover, to the extent that sigma power was larger for the emotional word than for the following memory cue, participants showed higher forgetting of unwanted memories. Notably, when the onset of individual positive word coincided with the upstate of slow oscillations, a state characterized by increased cortical excitability during NREM sleep, affective updating was more successful. In sum, the affect content of memories was altered via strategic spoken words presentations during sleep, in association with theta power increases and slow-oscillation upstates. These findings offer novel possibilities for modifying unwanted memories during sleep, without requiring conscious confrontations with aversive memories that people would prefer to avoid.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A physical neural mass model framework for the analysis of oscillatory generators from laminar electrophysiological recordings</a></h4>

              
                Cortical function emerges from the interactions of multi-scale networks that may be studied at a high level using neural mass models (NMM), which represent the mean activity of large numbers of neurons. In order to properly reproduce experimental data, these models require the addition of further elements. Here we provide a framework integrating conduction physics that can be used to simulate cortical electrophysiology measurements, in particular those obtained from multicontact laminar electrodes. This is achieved by endowing NMMs with basic physical properties, such as the average laminar location of the apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cell populations. We call this framework laminar NMM, or LaNMM for short. We then employ this framework to infer the location of oscillatory generators from laminar-resolved data collected from the prefrontal cortex in the macaque monkey. We define, based on the literature of columnar connectivity, a minimal neural mass model capable of generating amplitude and phase coupled slow (alpha, 4--22~Hz) and fast (gamma, 30--250~Hz) oscillations. The synapse layer locations of the two pyramidal cell populations are treated as optimization parameters, together with two more LaNMM-specific parameters, to compare the models with the multicontact recordings. We rank the candidate models using an optimization function that evaluates the match between the functional connectivity of the model and data, where the FC is defined by the covariance between bipolar voltage measurements at different cortical depths. The family of best solutions reproduces the FC of the observed electrophysiology while selecting locations of pyramidal cells and their synapses that result in the generation of fast activity at superficial layers and slow activity across most depths, in line with recent literature proposals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Class imbalance should not throw you off balance: Choosing classifiers and performance metrics for brain decoding with imbalanced data</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning (ML) is becoming a standard tool in neuroscience and neuroimaging research. Yet, because it is such a powerful tool, the appropriate application of ML requires a sound understanding of its subtleties and limitations. In particular, applying ML to datasets with imbalanced classes, which are very common in neuroscience, can have severe consequences if not adequately addressed. With the neuroscience machine-learning user in mind, this technical note provides a didactic overview of the class imbalance problem and illustrates its impact through systematic manipulation of class imbalance ratios in both simulated data, and real electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain data. Our results illustrate how in highly imbalanced data, the commonly used Accuracy (Acc) metric yields misleadingly high performances by preferentially predicting the majority class, while other evaluations metrics (e.g. Balanced Accuracy (BAcc) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)) may still provide reliable performance evaluations. In terms of classifiers and cross-validation schemes, our data highlights the higher robustness of Random Forest (RF) and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation, compared to the other approaches tested. Critically, for neuroscience ML applications that seek to minimize overall classification error (not preferentially that of a single class), we recommend the routine use of BAcc, rather than the simple and more commonly used Acc metric. Importantly, we provide a best practices list of recommendations for dealing with imbalanced data, and open-source code to allow the neuroscience community to replicate our observations and further explore the best practices in handling imbalanced data.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by loss of smell and olfactory system pathology that subsequently leads to dementia. Understanding these early processes can identify therapeutic targets to slow AD progression. Thus, we analyzed differential gene and protein expression in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory tract (OT) of familial AD (FAD) individuals carrying the autosomal dominant presenilin 1 E280A paisa mutation and age-matched controls. In FAD samples, we find human transcriptome signatures for viral infection in OB and for inflammation in OT that carries information via entorhinal cortex from the OB to hippocampus, a brain region essential for learning and memory. Interestingly, spatial proteomic changes consistent with a demyelination response in the OT of FAD individuals were seen, implying dysfunction of communication between the OB and hippocampus. These findings raise the possibility that viral infection and associated inflammation/demyelination of the olfactory system may disrupt downstream hippocampal function, accelerating FAD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oral oxycodone self-administration leads to features of opioid addiction in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Use of prescription opioids, particularly oxycodone is an initiating factor driving the current opioid epidemic. There are several challenges with modeling oxycodone abuse. First, prescription opioids including oxycodone are orally self-administered and have different pharmacokinetics and dynamics than morphine or fentanyl which have been more commonly used in rodent research. This oral route of administration determines the pharmacokinetic profile, which then influences the establishment of drug-reinforcement associations in animals. Moreover, the pattern of intake and the environment in which addictive drugs are self-administered are critical determinants of the levels of drug intake, of behavioral sensitization, and of propensity to relapse behavior. These are all important considerations when modeling prescription opioid use, which is characterized by continuous drug access in familiar environments. Thus, to model features of prescription opioid use and the transition to abuse, we designed an oral, homecage-based oxycodone self-administration paradigm. Mice voluntarily self-administer oxycodone in this paradigm without any taste modification such as sweeteners, and the majority exhibit preference for oxycodone, escalation of intake, physical signs of dependence, and reinstatement of seeking after withdrawal. In addition, a subset of animals demonstrate drug taking that is resistant to aversive consequences. This model is therefore translationally relevant and useful for studying the neurobiological substrates of prescription opioid abuse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fractionating distraction: How past- and future-relevant distractors influence integrated decisions</a></h4>

              
                Many everyday tasks require us to integrate information from multiple steps to make a decision. Dominant accounts of flexible cognition suggest that we are able to navigate such complex tasks by attending to each step in turn, yet few studies measure how we direct our attention to immediate and future task steps. Here, we used a two-step task to test whether participants are sensitive to information that is currently irrelevant, but will be relevant in a future task step. Participants viewed two displays in sequence, each containing two superimposed moving dot clouds of different colours. Participants attended to one cued target colour in each display and reported the average direction of the two target dot clouds. In a subset of trials, we presented a "decoy" distractor: the second target colour appeared as the distractor in the first display. We regressed behavioural responses on the dot clouds' motion directions to track how this future-relevant "decoy" distractor influenced participants' reporting of the average target direction. We compared the influence of decoy distractors to never-relevant, recently relevant, and globally relevant distractor baselines. Across four experiments, we found that responses reflected what was immediately relevant, as well as the broader historical relevance of the distractors. However, relevance for a future task step did not reliably influence attention. We propose that attention in multi-step tasks is shaped by what has been relevant in the current setting, and by the immediate demands of each task step.

                Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent disease impeding vision. More recently, AMD has also been linked to cognitive impairment, such as deficits in language and memory skills. In order to better understand the extent of AMD-related changes in the whole brain structure and connectivity, we have conducted an MRI diffusion acquisition study on 40 participants (20 diagnosed with AMD and 20 controls). These acquisitions were then performed again in a follow up two years later. We developed novel analysis methods for diffusion based tractography and connectomes to better determine which, if any, brain region connections saw the greatest changes between the AMD and the age-matched control groups. Using voxel-based analysis, we identified atrophy in AMD participants in the cuneate gyrus, which has been associated with vision, and the left superior temporal gyrus, which has been associated with language, while later acquisitions compounded this with a deficiency in the bilateral cingulate gyrus, itself linked to higher cognition and memory. These regional atrophy findings support that people with AMD experience widespread neuronal degradation that is not limited to retinal neurons. Regions that saw drastically lowered fractional anisotropy among AMD vs. control included the visual cortex, such as the bilateral occipital lobe and the frontoparietal cortex. Tensor Network Principal Component Analysis (TN-PCA) isolated lingual and temporal connections as important differentiators of AMD connectomes compared to controls, thus supporting our morphometric and texture findings in regions related to vision, but also connectopathies of language and memory brain regions. Bundle based analyses in baseline data revealed that the lingual gyrus had greater spread of tracts overall in the AMD participants, which may be explained by prior reorganization in this area, demonstrating a connection between retinal health and lingual structure. Moreover, we noted group differences in the interhemispheric temporal connections, and lingual cerebellar connections, supporting extensive downstream effects of vision loss. Our bundle-based analyses expand the toolset available for neuroimaging-based phenotyping, and reveal widespread changes in AMD participants beyond brain regions and tractography networks directly involved in vision processing, including those involved in language and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Menstrual cycle and exogenous attention toward emotional expressions</a></h4>

              
                Several studies suggest that the menstrual cycle affects emotional processing. However, these results may be biased by including women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in the samples. PMS is characterized by negative emotional symptomatology, such as depression and/or anxiety, during the luteal phase. This study aimed to explore the modulation of exogenous attention to emotional facial expressions as a function of the menstrual cycle in women without PMS. For this purpose, 55 women were selected (from an original volunteer sample of 790) according to rigorous exclusion criteria. Happy, angry, and neutral faces were presented as distractors, while both behavioral performance in a perceptual task and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. This task was applied during both phases of the menstrual cycle (luteal and follicular, counterbalanced), and premenstrual symptomatology was monitored daily. Traditional and Bayesian ANOVAs on behavioral data (reaction times and errors in the task) and ERP indices (P1, N170, N2, and LPP amplitudes) confirmed the expected lack of an interaction of phase and emotion. Taken together, these results indicate that women free of PMS present steady exogenous attention levels to emotionally positive and negative stimuli regardless of the menstrual phase.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NeuVue: A Framework and Workflows for High-Throughput Electron Microscopy Connectomics Proofreading</a></h4>

              
                NeuVue is a software platform created for large-scale proofreading of machine segmentation and neural circuit reconstruction in high-resolution electron microscopy connectomics datasets. The NeuVue platform provides a robust web-based interface for proofreaders to collaboratively view, annotate, and edit segmentation and connectivity data. A backend queuing service organizes proofreader tasks into purpose-driven task types and increases proofreader throughput by limiting proofreader actions to simple, atomic operations. A collection of analytical dashboards, data visualization tools, and Application Program Interface (API) capabilities provide stakeholders real-time access to proofreading progress at an individual proofreader level as well as insights on task generation priorities. NeuVue is agnostic to the underlying data being proofread and improves upon the traditional proofreader experience through quality-of-life features that streamline complex editing operations such as splitting and merging objects in dense nanoscale segmentation. NeuVue heavily leverages cloud resources to enable proofreaders to simultaneously access and edit data on the platform. Production-quality features such as load-balancing, auto-scaling, and pre-deployment testing are all integrated into the platform's cloud architecture. Additionally, NeuVue is powered by well-supported open-source connectomics tools from the community such as Neuroglancer, PyChunkedGraph, and Connectomics Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE). The modular design of NeuVue facilitates easy integration and adoption of useful community tools to allow proofreaders to take advantage of the latest improvements in data visualization, processing, and analysis. We demonstrate our framework through proofreading of the mouse visual cortex data generated on the IARPA MICrONS Project. This effort has yielded over 40,000 proofreader edits across the 2 petavoxels of "Minnie" neuroimaging data. 44 unique proofreaders of various skill levels have logged a cumulative 3,740 proofreading hours, and we have been able to validate the improved connectivity of thousands of neurons in the volume. With sustained development on the platform, new integrated error detection and error correction capabilities, and continuous improvements to the proofreader model, we believe that the NeuVue framework can enable high-throughput proofreading for large-scale connectomics datasets of the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual stimuli modulate local field potentials but drive no high-frequency activity in human auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies suggest cross-sensory visual influences in human auditory cortices (AC). Whether these influences reflect active visual processing in human ACs, which drives neuronal firing and concurrent broadband high-frequency activity (BHFA; >70 Hz), or whether they merely modulate sound processing is still debatable. Here, we presented auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli to 16 participants with stereo-EEG depth electrodes implanted near ACs for presurgical monitoring. Anatomically normalized group analyses were facilitated by inverse modeling of intracranial source currents. Pattern cross-correlation analyses suggested cross-sensory visual influences, lagging auditory responses by ~50 ms in ACs. Visual stimuli also modulated the phase of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations and triggered 15-30-Hz event-related desynchronization in ACs. However, BHFA, a putative correlate of neuronal firing, was not significantly increased in ACs after visual stimuli, not even when they coincided with auditory stimuli. Intracranial recordings demonstrate cross-sensory modulations, but no indication of active visual processing in human ACs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">One-to-one mapping between deep network units and real neurons uncovers a visual population code for social behavior</a></h4>

              
                The rich variety of behaviors observed in animals arises through the complex interplay between sensory processing and motor control. To understand these sensorimotor transformations, it is useful to build models that predict not only neural responses to sensory input but also how each neuron causally contributes to behavior. Here we demonstrate a novel modeling approach to identify a one-to-one mapping between internal units in a deep neural network and real neurons by predicting the behavioral changes arising from systematic perturbations of more than a dozen neuron types. A key ingredient we introduce is "knockout training", which involves perturbing the network during training to match the perturbations of the real neurons during behavioral experiments. We apply this approach to model the sensorimotor transformation of Drosophila melanogaster males during a complex, visually-guided social behavior. Contrary to prevailing views, our model suggests that visual projection neurons at the interface between the eye and brain form a distributed population code that collectively sculpts social behavior. Overall, our framework consolidates behavioral effects elicited from various neural perturbations into a single, unified model, providing a detailed map from stimulus to neuron to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Event integration and temporal pattern separation: how hierarchical knowledge emerges in hippocampal subfields through learning</a></h4>

              
                Everyday life experiences are composed of sequences of events determined by changes of contexts, layered with more rapidly changing occurrences that unfold within each event. A major challenge of our memory systems is how the brain integrates these occurrences within events while also maintaining their distinct details and avoiding over-integration across different contexts. Here we asked if and how distinct hippocampal subfields come to hierarchically represent both event context and subevents occurrences with learning. Participants learned repeating events, defined as sequences of objects superimposed on shared color frames, while undergoing high-resolution fMRI. Behavioral markers and consequences of event boundaries were evident across all repetitions. After learning, hippocampal CA3 multivoxel activation patterns reflected the event context and the strength of event representations in CA3 correlated with behavioral facilitation during event transitions. In contrast to CA3, dentate gyrus activation patterns became more differentiated through learning, specifically for objects that were close in time and belonged to the same event. This is a form temporal pattern separation that is sensitive to context, to facilitate distinct representations of subevent occurrences. A computational model explained these results by dynamic inhibition in dentate gyrus. We also adopted to fMRI novel similarity measures that are sensitive to the overlap in the population of activated voxels and show that CA3 representations of different contexts, and dentate gyrus' distinct item representations, likely result from different populations of voxels. These findings suggest an interplay between the representations of event context that shapes temporal pattern separation in dentate gyrus, and attractor dynamics in CA3. The results advance our knowledge of how the hippocampus represents context and time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Somatostatin peptide signaling dampens cortical circuits and promotes exploratory behavior</a></h4>

              
                Background Somatostatin (SST) neurons in the prelimbic (PL) cortex mediate a variety of behavioral states, ranging from alcohol consumption to fear learning and avoidance-related behaviors. However, little is known about the role of somatostatin peptide signaling itself to cortical functioning and behavior. Here, we sought to characterize the unique physiological and behavioral roles of the SST peptide in the PL cortex. Methods We employed a combination of ex vivo electrophysiology, in vivo calcium monitoring, and in vivo peptide pharmacology to explore the role of SST neuron and peptide signaling in the mouse PL cortex. Whole-cell slice electrophysiology was conducted in C57BL/6J male and female mice in pyramidal and GABAergic neurons of the PL cortex to characterize the pharmacological mechanism of SST signaling. Fiber photometry recordings of GCaMP6f fluorescent calcium signals from SST neurons were conducted to characterize the activity profile of SST neurons during exploration of an elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF). We further used local delivery of a broad SST receptor (SSTR) agonist into bilateral PL cortex to test causal effects of SST signaling on these same exploratory behaviors. Results SSTR activation broadly hyperpolarized layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the PL cortex in both male and female mice ex vivo, through both monosynaptic and polysynaptic GABA neuron-mediated mechanisms of action. This hyperpolarization was blocked by pre-application of the SSTR antagonist cyclo-somatostatin (cyclo-SST) and was non-reversible. SST neurons in PL were activated during EPM and OF exploration, indicating task-related recruitment of these neurons. Lastly, in line with this exploration-related activity profile, SSTR agonist administration directly into the PL enhanced open arm exploration in the EPM. Conclusions Here we reveal a novel role for the SST peptide system within the PL cortex, by demonstrating a peptide-induced hypoexcitability of PL circuits and modulation of PL-dependent exploratory behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-dependent stabilization of nascent dendritic spines requires non-enzymatic CaMKIIÎ± function</a></h4>

              
                The outgrowth and stabilization of nascent dendritic spines are crucial processes underlying learning and memory. Most new spines retract shortly after growth; only a small subset is stabilized and integrated into the new circuit connections that support learning. New spine stabilization has been shown to rely upon activity-dependent molecular mechanisms that also contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. Indeed, disruption of the activity-dependent targeting of the kinase CaMKII to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor disrupts both LTP and activity-dependent stabilization of new spines. Yet it is not known which of CaMKII's many enzymatic and structural functions are important for new spine stabilization. Here, we used two-photon imaging and photolysis of caged glutamate to monitor the activity-dependent stabilization of new dendritic spines on hippocampal CA1 neurons from mice of both sexes in conditions where CaMKII functional and structural interactions were altered. Surprisingly, we found that inhibiting CaMKII kinase activity either genetically or pharmacologically did not impair activity-dependent new spine stabilization. In contrast, shRNA knock-down of CaMKII abolished activity-dependent new spine stabilization, which was rescued by co-expressing shRNA-resistant CaMKII. Notably, overexpression of phospho-mimetic CaMKII-T286D, which exhibits activity-independent targeting to GluN2B, enhanced basal new spine survivorship in the absence of additional glutamatergic stimulation, even when kinase activity was disrupted. Together, our results suggest that nascent dendritic spine stabilization requires structural and scaffolding interactions mediated by CaMKII that are independent of its enzymatic activities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Versatile Multiple Object Tracking in Sparse 2D/3D Videos Via Diffeomorphic Image Registration</a></h4>

              
                Tracking body parts in behaving animals, extracting fluorescence signals from cells embedded in deforming tissue, and analyzing cell migration patterns during development all require tracking objects with partially correlated motion. As dataset sizes increase, manual tracking of objects becomes prohibitively inefficient and slow, necessitating automated and semi-automated computational tools. Unfortunately, existing methods for multiple object tracking (MOT) are either developed for specific datasets and hence do not generalize well to other datasets, or require large amounts of training data that are not readily available. This is further exacerbated when tracking fluorescent sources in moving and deforming tissues, where the lack of unique features and sparsely populated images create a challenging environment, especially for modern deep learning techniques. By leveraging technology recently developed for spatial transformer networks, we propose ZephIR, an image registration framework for semi-supervised MOT in 2D and 3D videos. ZephIR can generalize to a wide range of biological systems by incorporating adjustable parameters that encode spatial (sparsity, texture, rigidity) and temporal priors of a given data class. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach in a variety of applications, including tracking the body parts of a behaving mouse and neurons in the brain of a freely moving C. elegans. We provide an open-source package along with a web-based graphical user interface that allows users to provide small numbers of annotations to interactively improve tracking results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence of theory of mind reasoning in the human language network</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension and the ability to infer others' thoughts (theory of mind, ToM) are interrelated during development and language use. However, neural evidence that bears on the relationship between language and ToM mechanisms is mixed. Although robust dissociations have been reported in brain disorders, brain activations for contrasts that target language and ToM bear similarities, and some have reported overlap (Deen et al., 2015). We take another look at the language-ToM relationship by evaluating the response of the language network (Fedorenko et al., 2010), as measured with fMRI, to verbal and non-verbal ToM across 151 participants. Individual-subject analyses reveal that all core language regions respond more strongly when participants read vignettes about false beliefs compared to the control vignettes. However, we show that these differences are largely due to linguistic confounds, and no such effects appear in a non-verbal ToM task. These results argue against cognitive and neural overlap between language processing and ToM. In exploratory analyses, we find responses to social processing in the "periphery" of the language network'''right hemisphere homotopes of core language areas and areas in bilateral angular gyri---but these responses are not selectively ToM-related and may reflect general visual semantic processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MCT1-dependent energetic failure and neuroinflammation underlie optic nerve degeneration in Wolfram syndrome mice</a></h4>

              
                Wolfram syndrome 1 (WS1) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene leading to a wide spectrum of clinical dysfunctions, among which blindness, diabetes and neurological deficits are the most prominent. WFS1 encodes for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident transmembrane protein Wolframin with multiple functions in ER processes. However, the WFS1-dependent etiopathology in retinal cells is unknown. Herein, we showed that Wfs1 mutant mice developed early retinal electrophysiological impairments followed by marked visual loss. Interestingly, axons and myelin disruption in the optic nerve preceded the degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell bodies in the retina. Transcriptomics at pre-degenerative stage revealed the STAT3-dependent activation of proinflammatory glial markers with reduction of the homeostatic and pro-survival factors Glutamine synthetase and BDNF. Furthermore, label-free comparative proteomics identified a significant reduction of the monocarboxylate transport isoform 1 (MCT1) and its partner Basigin that are highly enriched on retinal astrocytes and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in optic nerve together with Wolframin. Loss of MCT1 caused a failure in lactate transfer from glial to neuronal cell bodies and axons leading to a chronic hypometabolic state. Thus, this bioenergetic impairment is occurring concurrently both in the axonal regions and cell bodies of the retinal ganglion cells, selectively endangering their survival while impacting less on other retinal cells. This metabolic dysfunction occurs months before the frank RGC degeneration suggesting an extended time window for intervening with new therapeutic strategies focused on boosting retinal and optic nerve bioenergetics in WS1.

	<p>The clinical differential diagnosis between Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is often challenging. The description of milder PSP phenotypes strongly resembling PD, such as PSP-Parkinsonism, further increased the diagnostic challenge and the need for reliable neuroimaging biomarkers to enhance the diagnostic certainty. This review aims to summarize the contribution of a relatively simple and widely available imaging technique such as MR planimetry in the differential diagnosis between PD and PSP, focusing on the recent advancements in this field. The development of accurate MR planimetric biomarkers, together with the implementation of automated algorithms, led to robust and objective measures for the differential diagnosis of PSP and PD at the individual level. Evidence from longitudinal studies also suggests a role of MR planimetry in predicting the development of the PSP clinical signs, allowing to identify PSP patients before they meet diagnostic criteria when their clinical phenotype can be indistinguishable from PD. Finally, promising evidence exists on the possible association between MR planimetric measures and the underlying pathology, with important implications for trials with new disease-modifying target therapies.</p>

	<p>Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include symptoms of vertigo and dizziness, which is rather unsurprising, since SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism may inflict a broad spectrum of neuropathic effects. The widespread nature of central and peripheral audiovestibular pathways suggests that there may be several probable pathophysiological mechanisms. The cytokine storm, CNS infiltration of the virus through ACE 2 receptors, and other systemic factors can be responsible for the significant number of COVID-19 patients reported to experience symptoms of vertigo and dizziness. In this paper, we present a systematic review of clinical studies reporting the detection of dizziness and vertigo as clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss their etiopathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Objective: fibromyalgia is a complex chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, insomnia and autonomic alterations. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is regarded as a promising treatment in fibromyalgia, but its impact on autonomic function remains uncertain. In this research, we studied the effect of CBT on autonomic functions in fibromyalgia. Methods: Twenty-five participants underwent overnight polysomnographic recordings before and after CBT programs focused on pain (CBT-P) or a hybrid modality focused on pain and insomnia (CBT-C). Sleep quality, daily pain, depression and anxiety were assessed by self-reported questionnaires. We analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) using high-frequency power (HF) as a marker for parasympathetic activity, and low-frequency power (LF) and the LF/HF ratio as relative sympathetic markers during wakefulness and at each sleep stage. Results: After treatment, 14 patients (/25, 58.0%) reported improvement in their sleep: 6 in the CBT-P condition (/12, 50%), and 8 in the CBT-C condition (/13, 61.5%). We found that, regardless of the type of CBT, patients who reported improvement in sleep quality (n = 14, 58%) had an increase in HF during stages N2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and N3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). These changes were related to improvement in sleep quality (N2, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.43, p = 0.033) but not to pain, depression or anxiety. Conclusions: This study showed an improvement in parasympathetic cardiac control during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep following CBT in fibromyalgia participants who reported better sleep after this therapy. CBT may have a cardio-protective effect and HRV could be used as a sleep monitoring tool in fibromyalgia.</p>

	<p>Eye movement disorders have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as saccadic disturbances. Several methods have been described for the assessment of saccades, including the K-D and DEM tests. The performance of these tests also involves attention, language, and other brain areas which have been reported to be altered in MS patients. The aim of the study was to determine how developmental eye movement (DEM) and King-Devick (K-D) tests are affected in MS-patients. It was also to analyze whether a resolved episode of optic neuritis (ON) has a negative influence. Subjects with MS showed worse outcomes (higher times) in DEM test (72 (26) s and a K-D test (56 (22) s compared to healthy subjects (64 (7) s and 55 (11) s, respectively). However, a previous ON episode did not worsen the MS-times of DEM (80 (33) s or of K-D (62 (33) s. Horizontal saccades with the DEM showed differences between subjects with MS (with and without ON) and healthy ones (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), whereas no such differences were found in the vertical saccades. According to the DEM instructions, MS patients would present heterogeneous oculomotor and non-visual disturbances. Regarding the K-D test, only the third card (the most complex one) showed differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) between groups. These tests can capture impairment of attention, language, and other areas that correlate with suboptimal brain function in addition to the oculomotor dysfunctions present in subjects with MS.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Previous evidence demonstrates that tight glycemic control and good physical function could reduce the risk of delirium. This study aimed to investigate whether the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in older hip fracture surgery patients is associated with preoperative glycemic control factors or pre-injury physical performance. (2) Methods: Three-hundred and nine individuals aged over 65 years and scheduled for hip fracture surgery were included at a single center. Glycemic control factors and pre-injury physical performance were assessed preoperatively. The presence of delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method on postoperative hospitalization days. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models and a risk prediction model of POD were established. (3) Results: Among the 309 patients, 52 (16.83%) experienced POD during the hospital stay. The numbers of pre-injury physical performance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were significantly different in the POD and non-POD groups. The multivariable model showed that development of delirium was significantly explained by preoperative fasting blood glucose (FBG) (OR 0.804, p = 0.004), stair climbing (OR 0.709, p = 0.003), T2DM (odds ratio (OR) 3.654, p = 0.001), and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI) (OR 1.270, p = 0.038). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the risk prediction model including those covariates was 0.770. (4) Conclusions: More older T2DM patients develop POD after hip fracture surgery than patients without T2DM. A simple assessment of preoperative FBG and pre-injury stair climbing capacity may identify those at high risk for the development of POD. Higher preoperative FBG and good pre-injury stair climbing capacity are protective factors for POD.</p>

	<p>During balance recovery from slip perturbations, forward flexion (elevation) of the arms serves to counterbalance the posteriorly displaced center of mass (CoM). We aimed to investigate whether aging affects modulation of arm responses to various intensities of unpredictable slip perturbations and whether arm responses are related to compensatory stepping stability. Ten healthy young adults and ten healthy older adults participated. Participants were asked to react naturally to three randomly administered levels of slip-like surface perturbations (intensity 1 (7.75 m/s2), intensity 2 (12.00 m/s2) and intensity 3 (16.75 m/s2), which occurred by means of forward acceleration of the treadmill belt while standing. Kinematic data were collected using a motion capture system. Outcomes included arm elevation displacement, velocity, and margin of stability (MoS) of compensatory stepping. The results reveal no modulation of arm elevation velocity in older adults from perturbation intensity 1 to 2, whereas younger adults demonstrated progressive increases from intensity 1 to 2 to 3. At intensity 3, older adults demonstrated reduced maximal arm elevation velocity compared to younger adults (p = 0.02). The results in both groups combined reveal a positive correlation between maximal arm elevation velocity and first compensatory step MoS at intensity 3 (p = 0.01). Together, these findings indicate age-related decreases in arm response modulation and the association of arm elevation response with protective stepping stability, suggesting that fall prevention interventions may benefit from an emphasis on arm elevation velocity control in response to greater perturbation intensities.</p>

	<p>Polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) are organic pollutants that are widely detected in the environment and organisms, posing potential threats to both ecosystems and human health. PS-NPs have been proven to penetrate the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and increase the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. However, information relating to the pathogenic molecular mechanism is still unclear. This study investigated the neurotoxicity and regulatory mechanisms of PS-NPs in human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells. The results show that PS-NPs caused obvious mitochondrial damages, as evidenced by inhibited cell proliferation, increased lactate dehydrogenase release, stimulated oxidative stress responses, elevated Ca2+ level and apoptosis, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate levels. The increased release of cytochrome c and the overexpression of apoptosis-related proteins apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3 (caspase-3), and caspase-9 indicate the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In addition, the upregulation of autophagy markers light chain 3-II (LC3-II), Beclin-1, and autophagy-related protein (Atg) 5/12/16L suggests that PS-NPs could promote autophagy in SHSY-5Y cells. The RNA interference of Beclin-1 confirms the regulatory role of autophagy in PS-NP-induced neurotoxicity. The administration of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity and autophagy activation induced by PS-NP exposure. Generally, PS-NPs could induce neurotoxicity in SHSY-5Y cells via autophagy activation and mitochondria dysfunction, which was modulated by mitochondrial oxidative stress. Mitochondrial damages caused by oxidative stress could potentially be involved in the pathological mechanisms for PS-NP-induced neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: An electrophysiological investigation with auditory brainstem response (ABR), round window electrocochleography (RW-ECoG), and electrical-ABR (E-ABR) was performed in children with suspected hearing loss with the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of the electrophysiological measures as diagnostic tools was assessed in this study. Methods: In this retrospective case series with chart review, 790 children below 3 years of age with suspected profound hearing loss were tested with impedance audiometry and underwent electrophysiological investigation (ABR, RW-ECoG, and E-ABR). All implanted cases underwent pure-tone audiometry (PTA) of the non-implanted ear at least 5 years after surgery for a long-term assessment of the reliability of the protocol. Results: Two hundred and fourteen children showed bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss. In 56 children with either ABR thresholds between 70 and 90 dB nHL or no response, RW-ECoG showed thresholds below 70 dB nHL. In the 21 infants with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss receiving a unilateral cochlear implant, no statistically significant differences were found in auditory thresholds in the non-implanted ear between electrophysiological measures and PTA at the last follow-up (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Eight implanted children showed residual hearing below 2000 Hz worse than 100 dB nHL and 2 children showed pantonal residual hearing worse than 100 dB nHL (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The audiological evaluation of infants with a comprehensive protocol is highly reliable. RW-ECoG provided a better definition of hearing thresholds, while E-ABR added useful information in cases of auditory nerve deficiency.</p>

     alt="Sex differences in morphine sensitivity are associated with differential glial expression in the brainstem of rats with neuropathic pain"/>
<p>It is well known that males and females show significant differences in both the analgesic and emetic effects of opiates. Our data provide evidence that changes in the morphology and activity of astrocytes in morphine sensitive and pain modulatory medullary regions might underlie these clinically important effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is more prevalent and reported to be more severe in women. Opioid analgesics are less effective in women and result in stronger nauseant effects. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these sex differences have yet to be clearly defined, though recent research has suggested neuronalâglial interactions are likely involved. We have previously shown that similar to people, morphine is less effective at reducing pain behaviors in female rats. In this study, we used the immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression to investigate sex differences in astrocyte density and morphology in six medullary regions known to be modulated by pain and/or opioids. Morphine administration had small sex-dependent effects on overall GFAP expression, but not on astrocyte morphology, in the rostral ventromedial medulla, the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis, and the area postrema. Significant sex differences in the density and morphology of GFAP immunopositive astrocytes were detected in all six regions. In general, GFAP-positive cells in females showed smaller volumes and reduced complexity than those observed in males. Furthermore, females showed lower overall GFAP expression in all regions except for the area postrema, the critical medullary region responsible for opioid-induced nausea and emesis.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Arginine vasopressin (AVP) serves as a neuromodulator in the brain. The hippocampus is one of the major targets for AVP, as it has been demonstrated that the hippocampus receives vasopressinergic innervation and expresses AVP receptors. The dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells (GCs) serve as a gate governing the inflow of information to the hippocampus. High densities of AVP receptors are expressed in the DG GCs. However, the roles and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of AVP in the DG GCs have not been determined. We addressed this question by recording from the DG GCs in rat hippocampal slices. Our results showed that application of AVP concentration-dependently evoked an inward holding current recorded from the DG GCs. AVP depolarized the DG GCs and increased their action potential firing frequency. The excitatory effects of AVP were mediated by activation of V<SUB>1a</SUB> receptors and required the function of phospholipase C&beta; (PLC&beta;). Whereas intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and protein kinase C activity were unnecessary, PLC&beta;-induced depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was involved in AVP-evoked excitation of the DG GCs. AVP excited the DG GCs by depression of the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels, which were required for AVP-elicited facilitation of long-term potentiation at the perforant path&ndash;GC synapses. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism to explain the physiological functions of AVP, such as learning and memory, and pathologic disorders like anxiety.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Enhancement of Motor Cortical Gamma Oscillations and Sniffing Activity by Medial Forebrain Bundle Stimulation Precedes Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial forebrain bundle (MFB) is a white matter pathway that traverses through mesolimbic structures and includes dopaminergic neural fibers ascending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Since dopaminergic signals represent hedonic responses, electrical stimulation of the MFB in animals has been used as a neural reward for operant and spatial tasks. MFB stimulation strongly motivates animals to rapidly learn to perform a variety of behavioral tasks to obtain a reward. Although the MFB is known to connect various brain regions and MFB stimulation dynamically modulates animal behavior, how central and peripheral functions are affected by MFB stimulation per se is poorly understood. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded electrocorticograms (ECoGs) in the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and olfactory bulb (OB) of behaving rats while electrically stimulating the MFB. We found that MFB stimulation increased the locomotor activity of rats. Spectral analysis confirmed that immediately after MFB stimulation, sniffing activity was facilitated and the power of gamma oscillations in the M1 was increased. After sniffing activity and motor cortical gamma oscillations were facilitated, animals started to move. These results provide insight into the importance of sniffing activity and cortical gamma oscillations for motor execution and learning facilitated by MFB stimulation.</p>

                Constipation is a commonly reported disorder in many patients. Constipation treatment using laxatives on a regular and long term basis can lead to patient dependence, especially among the elderly. However, there is scanty data on the habit-forming potential of laxatives in Indian constipated patients. This review has explored literature evidence and expert opinion on patientsâ experience regarding habit-forming attributes of stimulant and osmotic laxatives. Additionally, structured face-to-face discussions were conducted with 2 key opinion leaders to understand their clinical experience on the habit-forming aspects stimulant and osmotic laxatives in patients with constipation. Based on literature evidence, lactulose is not known to lead to any habit-forming behaviors in patients. Furthermore, experts pointed out that dependence on stimulant laxatives is common, but not on osmotic laxatives, and emphasized that milk of magnesia is not habit forming. In conclusion, no habit-forming characteristics or dependence was observed with the use of osmotic laxatives in India. Nevertheless, real-world, studies exploring patient and physician perspectives are warranted to establish the dependence and habit forming attributes of laxatives.

                The web tool Adamant has been developed to systematically collect research metadata as early as the conception of the experiment. Adamant enables a continuous, consistent, and transparent research data management (RDM) process, which is a key element of good scientific practice ensuring the path to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) research data. It simplifies the creation of on-demand metadata schemas and the collection of metadata according to established or new standards. The approach is based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schema, where any valid schema can be presented as an interactive web-form. Furthermore, Adamant eases the integration of numerous available RDM methods and software tools into the everyday research activities of especially small independent laboratories. A programming interface allows programmatic integration with other software tools such as electronic lab books or repositories. The user interface (UI) of Adamant is designed to be as user friendly as possible. Each UI element is self-explanatory and intuitive to use, which makes it accessible for users that have little to no experience with JSON format and programming in general. Several examples of research data management workflows that can be implemented using Adamant are introduced. Adamant (client-only version) is available from: https://plasma-mds.github.io/adamant.

                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinaryÂ discussion. It provides contradictory evidence on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, also which are main reasons for the use of CT and what efforts in psychiatry have been made to reduce, replace and refine it.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Suboptimal human inference can invert the bias-variance trade-off for decisions with asymmetric evidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tahra L. Eissa, Joshua I. Gold, KreÅ¡imir JosiÄ, Zachary P. Kilpatrick</p>

Solutions to challenging inference problems are often subject to a fundamental trade-off between: 1) bias (being systematically wrong) that is minimized with complex inference strategies, and 2) variance (being oversensitive to uncertain observations) that is minimized with simple inference strategies. However, this trade-off is based on the assumption that the strategies being considered are optimal for their given complexity and thus has unclear relevance to forms of inference based on suboptimal strategies. We examined inference problems applied to rare, asymmetrically available evidence, which a large population of human subjects solved using a diverse set of strategies that varied in form and complexity. In general, subjects using more complex strategies tended to have lower bias and variance, but with a dependence on the form of strategy that reflected an inversion of the classic bias-variance trade-off: subjects who used more complex, but imperfect, Bayesian-like strategies tended to have lower variance but higher bias because of incorrect tuning to latent task features, whereas subjects who used simpler heuristic strategies tended to have higher variance because they operated more directly on the observed samples but lower, near-normative bias. Our results help define new principles that govern individual differences in behavior that depends on rare-event inference and, more generally, about the information-processing trade-offs that can be sensitive to not just the complexity, but also the optimality, of the inference process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modulation transfer functions for audiovisual speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolai F. Pedersen, Torsten Dau, Lars Kai Hansen, Jens HjortkjÃ¦r</p>

Temporal synchrony between facial motion and acoustic modulations is a hallmark feature of audiovisual speech. The moving face and mouth during natural speech is known to be correlated with low-frequency acoustic envelope fluctuations (below 10 Hz), but the precise rates at which envelope information is synchronized with motion in different parts of the face are less clear. Here, we used regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) to learn speech envelope filters whose outputs correlate with motion in different parts of the speakers face. We leveraged recent advances in video-based 3D facial landmark estimation allowing us to examine statistical envelope-face correlations across a large number of speakers (â¼4000). Specifically, rCCA was used to learn modulation transfer functions (MTFs) for the speech envelope that significantly predict correlation with facial motion across different speakers. The AV analysis revealed bandpass speech envelope filters at distinct temporal scales. A first set of MTFs showed peaks around 3-4 Hz and were correlated with mouth movements. A second set of MTFs captured envelope fluctuations in the 1-2 Hz range correlated with more global face and head motion. These two distinctive timescales emerged only as a property of natural AV speech statistics across many speakers. A similar analysis of fewer speakers performing a controlled speech task highlighted only the well-known temporal modulations around 4 Hz correlated with orofacial motion. The different bandpass ranges of AV correlation align notably with the average rates at which syllables (3-4 Hz) and phrases (1-2 Hz) are produced in natural speech. Whereas periodicities at the syllable rate are evident in the envelope spectrum of the speech signal itself, slower 1-2 Hz regularities thus only become prominent when considering crossmodal signal statistics. This may indicate a motor origin of temporal regularities at the timescales of syllables and phrases in natural speech.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sheltering of deleterious mutations explains the stepwise extension of recombination suppression on sex chromosomes and other supergenes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Jay, Emilie Tezenas, Amandine VÃ©ber, Tatiana Giraud</p>

Many organisms have sex chromosomes with large nonrecombining regions that have expanded stepwise, generating âevolutionary strataâ of differentiation. The reasons for this remain poorly understood, but the principal hypotheses proposed to date are based on antagonistic selection due to differences between sexes. However, it has proved difficult to obtain empirical evidence of a role for sexually antagonistic selection in extending recombination suppression, and antagonistic selection has been shown to be unlikely to account for the evolutionary strata observed on fungal mating-type chromosomes. We show here, by mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation, that recombination suppression on sex chromosomes and around supergenes can expand under a wide range of parameter values simply because it shelters recessive deleterious mutations, which are ubiquitous in genomes. Permanently heterozygous alleles, such as the male-determining allele in XY systems, protect linked chromosomal inversions against the expression of their recessive mutation load, leading to the successive accumulation of inversions around these alleles without antagonistic selection. Similar results were obtained with models assuming recombination-suppressing mechanisms other than chromosomal inversions and for supergenes other than sex chromosomes, including those without XY-like asymmetry, such as fungal mating-type chromosomes. However, inversions capturing a permanently heterozygous allele were found to be less likely to spread when the mutation load segregating in populations was lower (e.g., under large effective population sizes or low mutation rates). This may explain why sex chromosomes remain homomorphic in some organisms but are highly divergent in others. Here, we model a simple and testable hypothesis explaining the stepwise extensions of recombination suppression on sex chromosomes, mating-type chromosomes, and supergenes in general.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alternative splicing of METTL3 explains apparently METTL3-independent m6A modifications in mRNA</a></h4>

<i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is a highly prevalent mRNA modification that promotes degradation of transcripts encoding proteins that have roles in cell development, differentiation, and other pathways. METTL3 is the major methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA. As 30% to 80% of m<sup>6</sup>A can remain in mRNA after METTL3 depletion by CRISPR/Cas9-based methods, other enzymes are thought to catalyze a sizable fraction of m<sup>6</sup>A. Here, we reexamined the source of m<sup>6</sup>A in the mRNA transcriptome. We characterized mouse embryonic stem cell lines that continue to have m<sup>6</sup>A in their mRNA after <i>Mettl3</i> knockout. We show that these cells express alternatively spliced <i>Mettl3</i> transcript isoforms that bypass the CRISPR/Cas9 mutations and produce functionally active methyltransferases. We similarly show that other reported <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins. We find that gene dependency datasets show that most cell lines fail to proliferate after <i>METTL3</i> deletion, suggesting that reported <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins rather than have full knockout. Finally, we reassessed METTL3âs role in synthesizing m<sup>6</sup>A using an exon 4 deletion of <i>Mettl3</i> and found that METTL3 is responsible for >95% of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA. Overall, these studies suggest that METTL3 is responsible for the vast majority of m<sup>6</sup>A in the transcriptome, and that remaining m<sup>6</sup>A in putative <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines is due to the expression of altered but functional METTL3 isoforms.

     alt="The subfornical organ regulates acidosis-evoked fear by engaging microglial acid-sensor TDAG8 and forebrain neurocircuits in male mice"/>
<p>Homeostatic pH disturbance, specifically acidosis, is a trigger for panic attacks relevant to panic disorder; however, contributory mechanisms are still unclear. Here we report a role of microglial acid chemosensory G proteinâcoupled receptor, T-cell death-associated gene 8, within the subfornical organ in orchestrating acidosis-evoked, fear-associated behavior of relevance to panic.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>An important role of pH homeostasis has been suggested in the physiology of panic disorder, with acidosis as an interoceptive trigger leading to fear and panic. Identification of novel mechanisms that can translate acidosis into fear will promote a better understanding of panic physiology. The current study explores a role of the subfornical organ (SFO), a bloodâbrain barrier compromised brain area, in translating acidosis to fear-relevant behaviors. We performed SFO-targeted acidification in male, wild-type mice and mice lacking microglial acid-sensing G proteinâcoupled receptorâT-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8). Localized SFO acidification evoked significant freezing and reduced exploration that was dependent on the presence of acid-sensor TDAG8. Acidosis promoted the activation of SFO microglia and neurons that were absent in TDAG8-deficient mice. The assessment of regional neuronal activation in wild-type and TDAG8-deficient mice following SFO acidification revealed significant acidosis and genotype-dependent alterations in the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray nuclei. Furthermore, mapping of interregional co-activation patterns revealed that SFO acidosis promoted positive hypothalamic-cortex associations and desynchronized SFO-cortex and amygdala-cortex associations, suggesting an interplay of homeostatic and fear regulatory areas. Importantly, these alterations were not evident in TDAG8-deficient mice. Overall, our data support a regulatory role of subfornical organ microglial acid sensing in acidosis-evoked fear, highlighting a centralized role of bloodâbrain barrier compromised nodes in interoceptive sensing and behavioral regulation. Identification of pathways by which humoral information can modulate fear behavior is relevant to panic disorder, where aberrant interoceptive signaling has been reported.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are widely used to test the involvement of specific cortical regions in various domains such as cognition and emotion. Despite the capability of stimulation techniques to test causal directions, this approach has been only sparsely used to examine the cortical regulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) and to test current models in this regard. In this preregistered (PROSPERO) systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate, based on meta-regression, whether NIBS represents an effective method for modulating HR and HRV measures, and to evaluate whether the ANS is modulated by cortical mechanisms affected by NIBS. Here we have adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. In a series of four meta-analyses, a total of 131 effect sizes from 35 sham-controlled trials were analyzed using robust variance estimation random-effects meta-regression technique. NIBS was found to effectively modulate HR and HRV with small to medium effect sizes. Moderator analyses yielded significant differences in effects between stimulation of distinct cortical areas. Our results show that NIBS is a promising tool to investigate the cortical regulation of ANS, which may add to the existing brain imaging and animal study literature. Future research is needed to identify further factors modulating the size of effects. As many of the studies reviewed were found to be at high risk of bias, we recommend that methods to reduce potential risk of bias be used in the design and conduct of future studies.</p>

Additionally, exercised groups had increased astrocytic BDNF expression that was visualized using proximity ligase assay.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Exercise is an effective neuroprotective intervention that preserves retinal function and structure in several animal models of retinal degeneration. However, the retinal cell types governing exercise-induced neuroprotection remain elusive. Previously, we found exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection was associated with increased levels of retinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact signal transduction with its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB). Brain studies have shown astrocytes express BDNF and TrkB and that decreased BDNFâTrkB signaling in astrocytes contributes to neurodegeneration. Additionally, exercise has been shown to alter astrocyte morphology. Using a light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) model, we investigated how exercise influences retinal astrocytes in adult male BALB/c mice. Treadmill exercise in dim control and LIRD groups had increased astrocyte density, GFAP labeling, branching, dendritic endpoints, and arborization. Meanwhile, inactive LIRD animals had significant reductions in all measured parameters. Additionally, exercised groups had increased astrocytic BDNF expression that was visualized using proximity ligase assay. Isolated retinal astrocytes from exercised LIRD groups had significantly increased expression of a specific isoform of TrkB associated with cell survival, TrkB.FL. Conversely, inactive LIRD isolated retinal astrocytes had significantly increased expression of TrkB.T1, which has been implicated in neuronal cell death. Our data indicate exercise not only alters retinal astrocyte morphology but also promotes specific BDNFâTrkB signaling associated with cell survival and protection during retinal degeneration. These findings provide novel insights into the effects of treadmill exercise on retinal astrocyte morphology and cellular expression, highlighting retinal astrocytes as a potential cell type involved in BDNFâTrkB signaling.</p>

<p>We have determined cuprizone demyelination and remyelination is correlated with a loss and restoration of bladder continence. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressively debilitating demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Nearly 80% of MS patients experience lower urinary tract dysfunction early in their diagnosis. This significantly affects the quality of life, and in latter stages of disease is a leading cause of hospitalization. Previously, animal models have shown that inflammatory demyelination in the CNS causes profound bladder dysfunction, but the confounding influence of systemic inflammation limits the potential interpretation of the contribution of CNS demyelination to bladder dysfunction. Since the micturition circuit has myelinated neuronal connections in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, we examined alterations in bladder function in the cuprizone model characterized by demyelinating lesions in the cortex and corpus callosum that are independent of T-cellâmediated autoimmunity. Herein, we report that a 4-week dietary cuprizone treatment in C57Bl/6J mice induced alterations in voiding behavior with increased micturition frequency and reduced volume voided, similar to human MS bladder dysfunction. Subsequently, recovery from cuprizone treatment restored normal bladder function. Demyelination and remyelination were confirmed by Luxol Fast Blue staining of the corpus callosum. Additionally, we also determined that an 8-week cuprizone treatment, resulting in chronic demyelination lacking spontaneous remyelination potential, is associated with an exacerbated voiding phenotype. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged, as confirmed by urethane-anesthetized cystometry. This is the first study to show that cortical demyelination independent of inflammation can negatively impact urinary function.</p>

<p>NURR1 regulates the production of dopamine. Dopamine is present in dopaminergic neurons to regulate movement and emotion and in blood to control cardiac functions. Here, we demonstrated motor impairment, increased brain DA level and heart rate in old NURR1-deficient mice independently from sex, although sex affects their spontaneous locomotion.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transcription factor NURR1 is essential to the generation and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons and its deregulation is involved in the development of dopamine (DA)-associated brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The old male NURR1 heterozygous knockout (NURR1-KO) mouse has been proposed as a model of PD due to its altered motor performance that was, however, not confirmed in a subsequent study. Based on these controversial results, we explored the effects of the NURR1 deficiency on locomotor activity, motor coordination, brain and plasma DA levels, blood pressure and heart rate of old mice, also focusing on the potential effect of sex. As a probable consequence of the role of NURR1 in DA pathway, we observed that the old NURR1-KO mouse is characterized by motor impairment, and increased brain DA level and heart rate, independently from sex. However, we also observed an alteration in spontaneous locomotor activity that only affects males. In conclusion, NURR1 deficiency triggers sex- and age-specific alterations of behavioral responses, of DA levels and cardiovascular abnormalities. Further studies in simplified systems will be necessary to dissect the mechanism underlying these observations.</p>

<p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. Once ASICs are activated by H<sup>+</sup>, cation influx (largely Na<sup>+</sup>) will cause depolarization of membrane potentials and bursts of action potentials (APs), then resulting in pain. Resveratrol can inhibit ASICs, so that H<sup>+</sup> produces reduced responses in the amplitude of membrane currents and the number of APs, leading to a relief of acid-induced pain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resveratrol can relieve pain under various pain conditions. One of the mechanisms of resveratrol analgesia is the regulation of ion channels. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed predominantly in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. ASICs are important players in pain associated with tissue acidification. However, it is still unclear whether ASICs are resveratrol targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that resveratrol decreased acid-induced and ASIC-mediated currents in male rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Resveratrol downwardly shifted the concentrationâresponse curve for protons, suggesting that it inhibited ASICs not by changing the pH<sub>0.5</sub>, but by suppressing the proton-induced maximum response. It also suppressed acid-triggered action potentials in the rat DRG neurons. Finally, intraplantar pretreatment with resveratrol relieved acid-induced nociceptive responses in male rats in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that resveratrol inhibited ASIC-mediated electrophysiological activity and nociception, suggesting a novel peripheral mechanism underlying its analgesic effect.</p>

<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is one of the most common chronic diseases in the elderly. Our cross-sectional study examined pathophysiology of ARHL and provided evidence for impaired performance of all parts of the auditory system including central auditory processing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is due to a variety of lifetime damages to the auditory system and is characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, impaired speech understanding in noise and central sound processing deficits. Despite its commonness, the pathogenesis has not been completely clarified yet; especially the existence of an independent central ARHL component still remains controversial. We present the results of a cross-sectional topodiagnostic test battery study which aimed at separating aging- and hearing loss-related effects on all parts of the auditory system by current test procedures. Three groups of 30 participants each underwent extensive topodiagnostic test procedures (otoscopy, tympanometry, questionnaires, pure-tone audiometry, DPOAE threshold measurements, auditory brainstem response, central auditory discrimination tests, and speech-in-noise test). By comparing the results of the normally hearing young (18â26âyears) and healthy control group, the normally hearing elderly group (60â80âyears) and the hearing-impaired elderly group (60â80âyears), we deduced aging and hearing loss-related effects on auditory performance. All measurements indicated a significant deterioration of auditory performance in the elderly, partly associated with aging and partly with age-related hearing loss. Our study thereby contributes to a multifocal concept of ARHL. All parts of the auditory system are impaired by aging, age-related hearing loss, or a combination of both. Further evidence for an independent central ARHL component, not attributable to peripheral hearing loss, is provided by the results of the central auditory discrimination test.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Connectivity changes after spinal cord injury (SCI) appear as dynamic post-injury procedures. The present study aimed to investigate the alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) in different injury duration in complete SCI using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A total of 30 healthy controls (HCs) and 27 complete SCI patients were recruited in this study. A seed-based connectivity analysis compared FC differences between HCs and SCI and among SCI subgroups (SCI patients with post-injury within 6âmonths (early stage, <i>n</i>Â =Â 13) vs. those with post-injury beyond 6âmonths (late stage, <i>n</i>Â =Â 14)). Compared to HCs, SCI patients showed an increase in FC between sensorimotor cortex and cognitive, visual, and auditory cortices. The FC between motor cortex and cognitive cortex increased over time after injury. The FC between sensory cortex and visual cortex increased within 6âmonths after SCI, while FC between the sensory cortex and auditory cortex increased beyond 6âmonths after injury. The FC between sensorimotor cortex and cognitive, visual, auditory regions increased in complete SCI patients. The brain FC changed dynamically, and rehabilitation might be adapted over time after SCI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD), as a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, particularly affects the elderly population, and is clinically identified by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Pathophysiologically, PD is characterized by an early loss of dopaminergic neurons in the <i>Substantia nigra pars compacta</i>, accompanied by the extensive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (<i>Î±-Syn</i>) in the form of Lewy bodies. The onset of PD has been reported to be influenced by multiple biological molecules. In this context, circular RNAs (circRNAs), as tissue-specific noncoding RNAs with closed structures, have been recently demonstrated to involve in a set of PD's pathogenic processes. These RNA molecules can either up- or downregulate the expression of <i>Î±-Syn</i>, as well as moderating its accumulation through different regulatory mechanisms, in which targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) is considered the most common pathway. Since circRNAs have prominent structural and biological characteristics, they could also be considered as promising candidates for PD diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, PD has become a global health concern, and a large number of its pathogenic processes are still unclear; thus, it is crucial to elucidate the ambiguous aspects of PD pathophysiology to improve the efficiency of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In line with this fact, the current review aims to highlight the interplay between circRNAs and PD pathogenesis, and then discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circRNAs in PD progression. This study will thus be the first of its kind reviewing the relationship between circRNAs and PD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Space environment provides many challenges to pilots, astronauts, and space scientists, which are constantly subjected to unique conditions, including microgravity, radiations, hypoxic condition, absence of the day and night cycle, etc. These stressful stimuli have the potential to affect many human physiological systems, triggering physical and biological adaptive changes to re-establish the homeostatic state. A particular concern regards the risks for the effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system (CNS), as several lines of evidence reported a great impact on neuroplasticity, cognitive functions, neurovestibular system, short-term memory, cephalic fluid shift, reduction in motor function, and psychological disturbances, especially during long-term missions. Aside these potential detrimental effects, the other side of the coin reflects the potential benefit of applicating space-related conditions on Earth-based life sciences, as cancer research. Here, we focused on examining the effect of real and simulated microgravity on CNS functions, both in humans and in cellular models, browsing the different techniques to experience or mime microgravity on-ground. Increasing evidence demonstrate that cancer cells, and brain cancer cells in particular, are negatively affected by microgravity, in terms of alteration in cell morphology, proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, representing an advancing novel side of space-based investigations. Overall, deeper understandings about the mechanisms by which space environment influences CNS and tumor biology may be promisingly translated into many clinical fields, ranging from aerospace medicine to neuroscience and oncology, representing an enormous pool of knowledge for the implementation of countermeasures and therapeutic applications.</p>

<p>We demonstrate that administration of a novel selenopeptide named PSELT to a lesioned facial nerve improved its regeneration and ameliorated motor performances in rat, strongly suggesting that PSELT is a valuable therapeutic candidate to treat peripheral nerve injuries.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is frequent and many patients suffer lifelong disabilities in severe cases. Although the peripheral nervous system is able to regenerate, its potential is limited. In this study, we tested in a nerve regeneration model in rat the potential beneficial effect of a short mimetic peptide, named PSELT, which derives from SELENOT, an essential thioredoxin-like selenoprotein endowed with neuroprotective and antioxidant activities. For this purpose, the right facial nerve of female LongâEvans rats was axotomized then bridged with a free femoral vein interposition graft. PSELT (1âÎ¼M) was injected into the vein immediately and 48âh after the injury, and the effects observed were compared to those found after an end-to-end suture used as a gold standard treatment. Whisking behavior, electrophysiological potential, and histological analyses were performed 3Â months after injury to determine the effects of these treatments. These analyses revealed that PSELT-treated animals exhibit a better motor recovery in terms of protraction amplitude and velocity of vibrissae compared to control and end-sutured nerve animal groups. Moreover, administration of PSELT following injury enhanced muscle innervation, axonal elongation, and myelination of newly formed nerve fibers. Altogether, these results indicate that a PSELT-based treatment is sufficient to enhance facial nerve myelination and regeneration and could represent a new therapeutic tool to treat PNI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females primarily caused by loss of function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MeCP2. Loss of MeCP2 leads to a host of synaptic phenotypes that are believed to underlie Rett syndrome pathophysiology. Synaptic deficits vary by brain region upon MeCP2 loss, suggesting distinct molecular alterations leading to disparate synaptic outcomes. In this study, we examined the contribution of MeCP2's newly described role in miRNA regulation to regional molecular and synaptic impairments. Two miRNAs, miR-101a and miR-203, were identified and confirmed as upregulated in MeCP2 KO mice in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. miR-101a overexpression in hippocampal cultures led to opposing effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and in spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission, revealing the potential for a single miRNA to broadly regulate synapse function in the hippocampus. These results highlight the importance of regional alterations in miRNA expression and the specific impact on synaptic function with potential implications for Rett syndrome.</p>

                Stimulation of the vagus nerve paired with behavior has been shown to enhance rehabilitation following neurologic injury, but the mechanism remains unknown. Bowles, Hickman, Peng etÂ al. demonstrate that VNS applied after a successful reach improves skilled motor learning via a cholinergic reinforcement mechanism, resulting in selective modulation of M1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Methionine metabolism regulates pluripotent stem cell pluripotency and differentiation through zinc mobilization</a></h4>

              
                Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are highly dependent on methionine. Sim etÂ al. show that Zn signaling lies downstream of methionine metabolism. Methionine depletion of PSCs triggers a decreased intracellular protein-bound Zn. Zn depletion of PSCs mimicked the effects of methionine depletion, leading to impaired pluripotency and proliferation.

                Infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown promise as an alternative to anti-retroviral therapy against HIV. A key challenge is to suppress viral escape, which is more effectively achieved with a combination of bNAbs. Here, we propose a computational approach to predict the efficacy of a bNAb therapy based on the population genetics of HIV escape, which we parametrize using high-throughput HIV sequence data from bNAb-naive patients. By quantifying the mutational target size and the fitness cost of HIV-1 escape from bNAbs, we predict the distribution of rebound times in three clinical trials. We show that a cocktail of three bNAbs is necessary to effectively suppress viral escape, and predict the optimal composition of such bNAb cocktail. Our results offer a rational therapy design for HIV, and show how genetic data can be used to predict treatment outcomes and design new approaches to pathogenic control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recruitment of clathrin to intracellular membranes is sufficient for vesicle formation</a></h4>

              
                The formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is a major membrane remodeling process that is crucial for membrane traffic in cells. Besides clathrin, these vesicles contain at least 100 different proteins although it is unclear how many are essential for the formation of the vesicle. Here, we show that intracellular clathrin-coated formation can be induced in living cells using minimal machinery and that it can be achieved on various membranes, including the mitochondrial outer membrane. Chemical heterodimerization was used to inducibly attach a clathrin-binding fragment 'hook' to an 'anchor' protein targeted to a specific membrane. Endogenous clathrin assembled to form coated pits on the mitochondria, termed MitoPits, within seconds of induction. MitoPits are double-membraned invaginations that form preferentially on high curvature regions of the mitochondrion. Upon induction, all stages of CCV formation - initiation, invagination, and even fission - were faithfully reconstituted. We found no evidence for the functional involvement of accessory proteins in this process. In addition, fission of MitoPit-derived vesicles was independent of known scission factors including dynamins and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), suggesting that the clathrin cage generates sufficient force to bud intracellular vesicles. Our results suggest that, following its recruitment, clathrin is sufficient for intracellular clathrin-coated vesicle formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ndc1 drives nuclear pore complex assembly independent of membrane biogenesis to promote nuclear formation and growth</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear envelope (NE) assembles and grows from bilayer lipids produced at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How ER membrane incorporation coordinates with assembly of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to generate a functional NE is not well understood. Here, we use the stereotypical first division of the early <i>C. elegans</i> embryo to test the role of the membrane-associated nucleoporin Ndc1 in coupling NPC assembly to NE formation and growth. 3D-EM tomography of reforming and expanded NEs establishes that Ndc1 determines NPC density. Loss of <i>ndc1</i> results in faster turnover of the outer scaffold nucleoporin Nup160 at the NE, providing an explanation for how Ndc1 controls NPC number. NE formation fails in the absence of both Ndc1 and the inner ring component Nup53, suggesting partially redundant roles in NPC assembly. Importantly, upregulation of membrane synthesis restored the slow rate of nuclear growth resulting from loss of <i>ndc1</i> but not from loss of <i>nup53</i>. Thus, membrane biogenesis can be decoupled from Ndc1-mediated NPC assembly to promote nuclear growth. Together, our data suggest that Ndc1 functions in parallel with Nup53 and membrane biogenesis to control NPC density and nuclear size.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Both prey and predator features predict the individual predation risk and survival of schooling prey</a></h4>

              
                Predation is one of the main evolutionary drivers of social grouping. While it is well appreciated that predation risk is likely not shared equally among individuals within groups, its detailed quantification has remained difficult due to the speed of attacks and the highly-dynamic nature of collective prey response. Here, using high-resolution tracking of solitary predators (Northern pike) hunting schooling fish (golden shiners), we not only provide insights into predator decision-making, but show which key spatial and kinematic features of predator and prey predict the risk of individuals to be targeted and to survive attacks. We found that pike tended to stealthily approach the largest groups, and were often already inside the school when launching their attack, making prey in this frontal 'strike zone' the most vulnerable to be targeted. From the prey's perspective, those fish in central locations, but relatively far from, and less aligned with, neighbours, were most likely to be targeted. While the majority of attacks were successful (70%), targeted individuals that did manage to avoid being captured exhibited a higher maximum acceleration response just before the attack and were further away from the pike's head. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between predators' attack strategy and response of prey underlying the predation risk within mobile animal groups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impact of energy limitations on function and resilience in long-wavelength photosystem II</a></h4>

              
                Photosystem II (PSII) uses the energy from red light to split water and reduce quinone, an energy-demanding process based on chlorophyll a (Chl-a) photochemistry. Two types of cyanobacterial PSII can use chlorophyll d (Chl-d) and chlorophyll f (Chl-f) to perform the same reactions using lower energy, far-red light. PSII from <i>Acaryochloris marina</i> has Chl-d replacing all but one of its 35 Chl-a, while PSII from <i>Chroococcidiopsis thermalis</i>, a facultative far-red species, has just 4 Chl-f and 1 Chl-d and 30 Chl-a. From bioenergetic considerations, the far-red PSII were predicted to lose photochemical efficiency and/or resilience to photodamage. Here, we compare enzyme turnover efficiency, forward electron transfer, back-reactions and photodamage in Chl-f-PSII, Chl-d-PSII and Chl-a-PSII. We show that: i) all types of PSII have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover; ii) the modified energy gaps on the acceptor side of Chl-d-PSII favour recombination via P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Phe<sup>-</sup> repopulation, leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII; iii) the acceptor-side energy gaps in Chl-f-PSII are tuned to avoid harmful back reactions, favouring resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage. The results are explained by the differences in the redox tuning of the electron transfer cofactors Phe and Q<sub>A</sub> and in the number and layout of the chlorophylls that share the excitation energy with the primary electron donor. PSII has adapted to lower energy in two distinct ways, each appropriate for its specific environment but with different functional penalties.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interplay of surface interaction and magnetic torque in single-cell motion of magnetotactic bacteria in microfluidic confinement</a></h4>

              
                Swimming microorganisms often experience complex environments in their natural habitat. The same is true for microswimmers in envisioned biomedical applications. The simple aqueous conditions typically studied in the lab differ strongly from those found in these environments and often exclude the effects of small volume confinement or the influence that external fields have on their motion. In this work, we investigate magnetically steerable microswimmers, specifically magnetotactic bacteria, in strong spatial confinement and under the influence of an external magnetic field. We trap single cells in micrometer-sized microfluidic chambers and track and analyze their motion, which shows a variety of different trajectories, depending on the chamber size and the strength of the magnetic field. Combining these experimental observations with simulations using a variant of an active Brownian particle model, we explain the variety of trajectories by the interplay between the wall interactions and the magnetic torque. We also analyze the pronounced cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which makes single-cell tracking essential for an understanding of the motility patterns. In this way, our work establishes a basis for the analysis and prediction of microswimmer motility in more complex environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurophysiological markers of successful learning in healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to learn and memorize is a key determinant for the quality of life, but is known to decline to varying degrees with age. Previous ERP research methods had the limitation that their design did not allow to track the gradual memory formation process. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation and the critical features that determine the extent to which aging affects learning are still unknown. By using a visual sequence learning task, which consists of the repeated presentation of a simple sequence of tokens, we are able to track the progress of gradual memory formation through both neurophysiological and behavioral markers. On a neurophysiological level, we focused on two learning related centroparietal ERP components: the P300 and broad positivity. Our results revealed that although both age groups showed significant learning progress, young individuals learned faster and remembered more stimuli than older participants. Successful learning was directly linked to a decrease of P300 amplitude. However, young participants showed larger P300 amplitude with a sharper decrease during the memory formation process. The P300 amplitude predicted learning success in both age groups, was associated with increased fronto-parietal brain network activation and showed good test-retest reliability. Highly, similar results were found for the broad positivity component, which raises the questions if the BP is a distinct component or just a prolonged P300. In a series of analyses, including topographic analysis of variance (TANOVA), equivalence testing and source reconstruction analysis, we addressed the unresolved questions. These analyses revealed concordant distributed brain activation patterns within parietal circuits. Thus, there is no evidence (rather evidence for equivalence) for distinct underlying neural generators for the two components. Taken together, the results highlight the importance of the P300 as a neurophysiological marker of learning, and may enable the development of preventive measures for age-related impeded learning.

                Accumulating evidence suggests a central role for sleep spindles in the consolidation of new memories. However, no meta-analysis of the association between sleep spindles and memory performance has been conducted so far. Here, we report meta-analytical evidence for spindle-memory associations and investigate how multiple factors, including memory type, spindle type, spindle characteristics, and EEG topography affect this relationship. The literature search yielded 53 studies reporting 1424 effect sizes, resulting in a small to moderate effect for the average association. We further found that spindle-memory associations were significantly stronger for procedural memory than for declarative memory. Neither spindle types nor EEG scalp topography had an impact on the strength of the spindle-memory relation, but we observed a distinct functional role of global and fast sleep spindles, especially for procedural memory. We also found a moderation effect of spindle characteristics, with spindle frequency and power showing the largest effect sizes. Collectively, our findings suggest that sleep spindles are involved in learning and plasticity, thereby representing a general physiological mechanism for memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical observation on activity-dependent nanoscale dynamics of myelinated axons</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian brain, rapid conduction of neural information is supported by the myelin, whose functional efficacy shows steep dependence on its nanoscale cytoarchitecture. Although previous in vitro studies suggested that neural activity accompanies nanometer-scale cellular deformations, it has remained unexplored whether neural activity can dynamically remodel the myelinated axon due to the technical challenge in observing its nanostructural dynamics in living tissues. To this end, we introduced a novel all-optical approach combining a nanoscale dynamic readout based on spectral interferometry and optogenetic control of neural excitation on a living brain slice preparation. In response to optogenetically evoked neuronal burst firing, the myelinated axons exhibited progressive and reversible spectral redshifts, corresponding to the transient swelling at a subnanometer scale. We further revealed that the activity-dependent nanostructural dynamics was localized to the paranode. In summary, our novel all-optical studies substantiate that myelinated axon exhibits activity-dependent nanoscale swelling, which potentially serves to dynamically tune the transmission speed of neural information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabidiol prevents spontaneous fear recovery after extinction and ameliorates stress-induced extinction resistance</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol, the main non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, has potential as a treatment for anxiety-related disorders since it reduces learned fear expression and enhances fear extinction. The return of fear over time after successful extinction and stress-induced extinction resistance are potential barriers to the treatment of these disorders with extinction-based psychological therapy. In two experiments using rats subjected to auditory fear conditioning, we determined the effects of systemic cannabidiol treatment on (1) delayed extinction and later spontaneous fear recovery, and (2) extinction resistance caused by immediate extinction (the immediate extinction deficit (IED)). In Experiment 1, cannabidiol was given before delayed extinction occurring 24 hr after conditioning, with extinction recall and spontaneous fear recovery tested drug-free 1 and 21 days after extinction, respectively. We found that cannabidiol had no effect on extinction recall but it prevented spontaneous fear recovery. In Experiment 2, the IED procedure was first validated, with immediate extinction occurring 30 min after conditioning. We confirmed that immediate extinction impaired extinction recall, compared to delayed extinction. Next, cannabidiol was given before immediate or no extinction, with extinction recall tested drug-free the next day. We found that cannabidiol rescued the IED, which did not involve effects on fear memory consolidation. In summary, cannabidiol prevented spontaneous fear recovery after delayed extinction and ameliorated extinction resistance caused by immediate extinction. Although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, our results add to evidence indicating that cannabidiol might prove useful as an adjunct for potentiating the psychological treatment of anxiety-related disorders.

                Could non-pharmacological constructs, such as beliefs, impact brain activities in a dose-dependent manner as drugs do? Here, nicotine-addicted human participants were made to believe that an electronic cigarette they were about to vape contained either 'low', 'medium', or 'high' levels of nicotine, while nicotine strength was held constant. We then measured their brain signals during decision-making with functional MRI. Across the entire brain, we found that only the thalamus, a brain region rich in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, showed a dose-dependent response to beliefs in both neural activity and connectivity with the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate a dose-response relationship between beliefs and neurobiology, a mechanism previously known to only apply to pharmacological agents.

                In this paper, we propose a simplified and robust model for Place cell generation based on the Oscillatory Interference (OI) model concept. Aiming toward hardware implementation in bio-inspired Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems for mobile robotics, we base our model on logic operations that reduce its computational complexity. The model compensates for parameter variations in the behaviors of the population of constituent Theta cells, and allows the Theta cells to have square-wave oscillation profiles. The robustness of the model, with respect to mismatch in the Theta cell's base oscillation frequency and gain as a function of modulatory inputs is demonstrated. Place cell composed of 48 Theta cells with base frequency variations with a 25% standard deviation from the mean and a gain error with 20% standard deviation from the mean only result in a 20% deformations within the place field and 0.24% outer side lobes, and an overall pattern with 0.0015 mean squared error on average. We also present how the model can be used to achieve the localization and path-tracking functionalities of SLAM.

                Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to play key roles in learning by conveying the difference between expected and actual outcomes. While this teaching signal is often considered to be uniform, recent evidence instead supports diversity in dopamine signaling. However, it remains poorly understood how heterogeneous signals might be organized to facilitate the role of downstream circuits mediating distinct aspects of behavior. Here we investigated the organizational logic of dopaminergic signaling by recording and labeling individual midbrain dopamine neurons during associative behavior. We defined combinations of protein expression and cellular localization to sort recorded neurons according to the striatal regions they innervate. Our findings show that reward information and task variables are not only heterogeneously encoded, with multiplexing, but also differentially distributed across populations of dopamine neurons projecting to different regions of striatum. These data, supported by computational modelling, indicate that such distributional coding can maximize dynamic range and tailor dopamine signals to facilitate the specialized roles of different striatal regions.

                Neurogenesis persists in the mammalian subventricular zone after birth, producing various populations of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. These include GABAergic and mixed dopaminergic/GABAergic double neurotransmitter neurons for the glomerular layer. While olfactory sensory activity is one of the main factors controlling newborn neuron integration, its effect on specific neuronal subtypes is far less clear. Here we use a reversible unilateral deprivation paradigm in combination with longitudinal in vivo imaging to characterize the behavior of newborn glomerular neurons. We find that a substantial fraction of purely GABAergic neurons die after four weeks of sensory deprivation. Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive dopaminergic/ GABAergic neurons show no signifficant cell death under deprivation, but react with an important decrease in TH expression levels. Importantly, this effect reverses after naris reopening, pointing to a specific adaptation of this neuron population to the level of sensory activity. We conclude that sensory deprivation induces adjustments in the excitation/inhibition balance of the OB implicating cell death and adaptation of neurotransmitter use in specific neuron types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">X chromosome factor Kdm6a enhances memory independent of its demethylase function in the aging XY male brain</a></h4>

              
                Males exhibit shorter lifespan and more cognitive deficits in aging human populations. In mammals, the X chromosome is enriched for neural genes and is a major source of biologic sex difference, in part, because males show decreased expression of select X factors. While each sex (XX and XY) harbors one active X due to X chromosome inactivation in females, some genes, such as Kdm6a, transcriptionally escape silencing in females - resulting in lower levels in males. Kdm6a is a known histone demethylase (H3K27me2/3) with multiple functional domains that is linked with synaptic plasticity and cognition. Whether elevating Kdm6a could benefit the aging male brain, and whether this requires its demethylase function remains unknown. We used lentiviral-mediated overexpression of the X factor in the hippocampus of aging male mice and tested their cognition and behavior in the Morris water maze. We found that acutely increasing Kdm6a - in a form without demethylase function - selectively improved learning and memory, without altering total activity or anxiety-like measures, in the aging XY brain. Further understanding the demethylase-independent downstream mechanisms of Kdm6a may lead to novel therapies for treating age-induced cognitive deficits in both sexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ASOs are an effective treatment for disease-associated oligodendrocyte signatures in premanifest and symptomatic SCA3 mice</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common dominantly inherited ataxia. Currently, no preventative or disease-modifying treatments exist for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder, although efforts using gene silencing approaches are under clinical trial investigation. The disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the mutant gene, ATXN3, which produces an abnormally enlarged polyglutamine tract in the mutant ATXN3 protein. Similar to other paradigmatic neurodegenerative diseases, studies evaluating the pathogenic mechanism focus primarily on neuronal implications. Consequently, therapeutic interventions generated to target these deficiencies often overlook non-neuronal contributions to disease. Our lab recently reported that oligodendrocytes display some of the earliest and most progressive dysfunction in SCA3 mice. Evidence of disease-associated oligodendrocyte signatures has also been reported in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, ALS, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Here, we assess the effects of anti-ATXN3 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment on oligodendrocyte dysfunction in both premanifest and symptomatic SCA3 mouse models. We report a severe, but modifiable, deficit in oligodendrocyte maturation caused by the toxic gain-of-function of mutant ATXN3 early in SCA3 disease progression that is transcriptionally, biochemically, and functionally rescued with anti-ATXN3 ASO. Our results establish the necessity of considering non-neuronal targets in future neurodegenerative disease therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deletion induced splicing in RIC3 drives nicotinic acetylcholine receptor regulation with implications for endoplasmic reticulum stress in human astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) dysregulation in astrocytes is reported in neurodegenerative disorders. Modulation of nAChRs through agonists confers protection to astrocytes from stress but regulation of chaperones is unclear. Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 3 (RIC3) is a potential chaperone of nAChRs but poorly studied in humans. We characterized RIC3 in astrocytes derived from an isogenic wild-type and a Cas9 edited del human iPSC line harboring a 25bp homozygous deletion in exon2. Altered RIC3 transcript ratio due to deletion induced splicing and an unexpected gain of alpha7nAChR expression were observed in del astrocytes. Transcriptome analysis showed higher expression of neurotransmitter/G-protein coupled receptors mediated by cAMP and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase signaling. Functional implications of these observations were examined using tunicamycin induced ER stress. Wild-type astrocyte stress model showed cell cycle arrest, RIC3 upregulation, reduction in alpha7nAChR surface levels but increased alpha4nAChR surface expression. Conversely, tunicamycin treated del astrocytes showed a comparatively higher alpha4nAChR surface expression and upsurged cAMP signaling. In addition, reduced expression of stress markers CHOP, phospho-PERK and lowered XBP1 splicing in western blot and qPCR, validated by proteome-based pathway analysis indicated lowered disease severity. These findings indicate i) a complex RNA regulatory mechanism via exonic deletion induced splicing; ii) RIC-3 as a disordered protein having contrasting effects on co-expressed nAChR subtypes under basal/stress conditions; and iii) RIC3 as a potential drug target against ER stress in astrocytes for nicotine related brain disorders. Furthermore, cellular rescue mechanism through deletion induced exon skipping possibly opens up ASO based therapies for tauopathies.

	<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder, with 30&amp;amp;ndash;40% of OCD patients being unresponsive to adequate trials of anti-OCD drugs and cognitive behavior therapy. The aim of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on treating refractory OCD. With PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library used on 15 February 2022, 24 randomized controlled trials involving 663 patients were included. According to this analysis, NIBS including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta-burst stimulation (TBS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), had a moderate effect on the reduction of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores (SMD = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.81; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). In the subgroup analysis, rTMS seemed to produce a better therapeutic effect (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.38&amp;amp;ndash;1.08; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, excitatory (SMD = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.24&amp;amp;ndash;2.01; p = 0.01) and inhibitory (SMD = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;1.36; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) both alleviated OCD symptoms. In the secondary outcome of clinical response rates, NIBS treatment led to an increase in response rates (RR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.57&amp;amp;ndash;3.25; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01).</p>

	<p>The instructor&amp;amp;rsquo;s presence on the screen has become a popular feature in the video lectures of online learning and has drawn increasing research interest. Studies on the instructor presence effect of video lectures mainly focused on the features of the instructor, and few have taken learners&amp;amp;rsquo; differences, such as gender, into consideration. The current study examined whether male and female learners differed in their learning performance and eye movement features when learning video lectures with and without the instructor&amp;amp;rsquo;s presence. All participants (N = 64) were asked to watch three different types of video lectures: audio-video without instructor presence (AV), picture-video with instructor presence (PV), and video-video with instructor presence (VV). They watched nine videos, three of each condition, and completed a reading comprehension test after each video. Their eye movement data were simultaneously collected when they watched these videos. Results showed that learners gained better outcomes after watching the videos with a talking instructor (VV) than those with the instructor&amp;amp;rsquo;s picture (PV) or without the instructor (AV). This finding suggests that the dynamic presence of the instructor in video lectures could enhance learning through increased social presence and agency. Gender differences were found in their attention allocation, but not behavioral learning performance. When watching the videos with a talking instructor (VV), female learners dwelt longer on the instructor, while males transited more between the instructor and the text. Our results highlight the value of instructor presence in video lectures and call for more comprehensive explorations of gender differences in online learning outcomes and attention distribution.</p>
