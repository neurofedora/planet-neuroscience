Based on morphology it is often challenging to distinguish between the many different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, outcome of disease is highly variable even between patients with the same disease. Machine learning on transcriptome sequencing data could be a valuable new tool to understand differences between and within entities. Here we used machine learning analysis to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for soft tissue sarcomas. Gene expression data was used from the Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression data and the French Sarcoma Group. We identified three groups of tumors that overlap in their molecular profile as seen with unsupervised t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering and a deep neural network. The three groups corresponded to subtypes that are morphologically overlapping. Using a random forest algorithm, we identified novel diagnostic markers for soft tissue sarcoma that distinguished between synovial sarcoma and MPNST, and that we validated using qRT-PCR in an independent series. Next, we identified prognostic genes that are strong predictors of disease outcome when used in a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The prognostic genes were further validated in expression data from the French Sarcoma Group. One of these, <i>HMMR</i>, was validated in an independent series of leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry on tissue micro array as a prognostic gene for disease-free interval. Furthermore, reconstruction of regulatory networks combined with data from the Connectivity Map showed, amongst others, that HDAC inhibitors could be a potential effective therapy for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. A viability assay with two HDAC inhibitors confirmed that both leiomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma are sensitive to HDAC inhibition. In this study we identified novel diagnostic markers, prognostic markers and therapeutic leads from multiple soft tissue sarcoma gene expression datasets. Thus, machine learning algorithms are powerful new tools to improve our understanding of rare tumor entities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nvDdAFQafQ0" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25442?af=R">High frequency oscillation networks and surgical outcome in adult focal epilepsy</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether high frequency oscillations (HFOs) show spatiotemporal propagation and assess the relevance of the earliest oscillations in relation to the seizure onset zone and postsurgical outcome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral EEG of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during one hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs, and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the seizure onset zone than the rest of the network channels (15/27, 56% vs. 93/262, 35%; p=0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (Ripples: 13/27, 48% vs. 65/262, 25%; p=0.01. Fast ripples: 8/9, 89% vs. 17/40, 43%; p=0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks, and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During the 1990s we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, prior concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. 95% of twins are now deceased. Here we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Probandwise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed <span>&lt;</span>50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1539?rss=1">Increased Resurgent Sodium Currents in Nav1.8 Contribute to Nociceptive Sensory Neuron Hyperexcitability Associated with Peripheral Neuropathies</a></h4>

<p>Neuropathic pain is a significant public health challenge, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN) may be caused by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, a sodium channel subtype predominantly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, it is not clear how Nav1.8 disease mutations induce sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Here we studied two mutations in Nav1.8 associated with hypersensitive sensory neurons: G1662S reported in painful SFN; and T790A, which underlies increased pain behaviors in the <i>Possum</i> transgenic mouse strain. We show that, in male DRG neurons, these mutations, which impair inactivation, significantly increase TTX-resistant resurgent sodium currents mediated by Nav1.8. The G1662S mutation doubled resurgent currents, and the T790A mutation increased them fourfold. These unusual currents are typically evoked during the repolarization phase of action potentials. We show that the T790A mutation greatly enhances DRG neuron excitability by reducing current threshold and increasing firing frequency. Interestingly, the mutation endows DRG neurons with multiple early afterdepolarizations and leads to substantial prolongation of action potential duration. In DRG neurons, siRNA knockdown of sodium channel β4 subunits fails to significantly alter T790A current density but reduces TTX-resistant resurgent currents by 56%. Furthermore, DRG neurons expressing T790A channels exhibited reduced excitability with fewer early afterdepolarizations and narrower action potentials after β4 knockdown. Together, our data demonstrate that open-channel block of TTX-resistant currents, enhanced by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, can make major contributions to the hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, likely leading to altered sensory phenotypes including neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work demonstrates that two disease mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 that induce nociceptor hyperexcitability increase resurgent currents. Nav1.8 is crucial for pain sensations. Because resurgent currents are evoked during action potential repolarization, they can be crucial regulators of action potential activity. Our data indicate that increased Nav1.8 resurgent currents in DRG neurons greatly prolong action potential duration and enhance repetitive firing. We propose that Nav1.8 open-channel block is a major factor in Nav1.8-associated pain mechanisms and that targeting the molecular mechanism underlying these unique resurgent currents represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of aberrant pain sensations.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1525?rss=1">Aberrant Somatosensory Processing and Connectivity in Mice Lacking Engrailed-2</a></h4>

<p>Overreactivity and defensive behaviors in response to tactile stimuli are common symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Similarly, somatosensory hypersensitivity has also been described in mice lacking ASD-associated genes such as <i>Fmr1</i> (fragile X mental retardation protein 1). <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice also show reduced functional connectivity between sensory cortical areas, which may represent an endogenous biomarker for their hypersensitivity. Here, we measured whole-brain functional connectivity in <i>Engrailed-2</i> knock-out (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup>) adult mice, which show a lower expression of <i>Fmr1</i> and anatomical defects common to <i>Fmr1</i> knock-outs. MRI-based resting-state functional connectivity in adult <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice revealed significantly reduced synchronization in somatosensory-auditory/associative cortices and dorsal thalamus, suggesting the presence of aberrant somatosensory processing in these mutants. Accordingly, when tested in the whisker nuisance test, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> but not WT mice of both sexes showed fear behavior in response to repeated whisker stimulation. <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice undergoing this test exhibited decreased c-Fos-positive neurons (a marker of neuronal activity) in layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex and increased immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala compared with WT littermates. Conversely, when tested in a sensory maze, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> and WT mice spent a comparable time in whisker-guided exploration, indicating that whisker-mediated behaviors are otherwise preserved in <i>En2</i> mutants. Therefore, fearful responses to somatosensory stimuli in <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice are accompanied by reduced basal connectivity of sensory regions, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that impaired somatosensory processing is a common feature in mice lacking ASD-related genes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Overreactivity to tactile stimuli is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Recent studies performed in mice bearing ASD-related mutations confirmed these findings. Here, we evaluated the behavioral response to whisker stimulation in mice lacking the ASD-related gene <i>Engrailed-2</i> (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice). Compared with WT controls, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice showed reduced functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, which was paralleled by fear behavior, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala in response to repeated whisker stimulation. These results suggest that impaired somatosensory signal processing is a common feature in mice harboring ASD-related mutations.</p>

<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin, are photosensitive neurons in the retina and are essential for non-image-forming functions, circadian photoentrainment, and pupillary light reflexes. Five subtypes of ipRGCs (M1–M5) have been identified in mice. Although ipRGCs are spared in several forms of inherited blindness, they are affected in Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the <i>huntingtin</i> gene. In addition to motor function impairment, HD mice also show impaired circadian rhythms and loss of ipRGC. Here, we found that, in HD mouse models (R6/2 and N171-82Q male mice), the expression of melanopsin was reduced before the onset of motor deficits. The expression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, was associated with the survival of ipRGCs. The number of M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 male mice was reduced due to apoptosis, whereas non-M1 ipRGCs were relatively resilient to HD progression. Most importantly, the reduced innervations of M1 ipRGCs, which was assessed by X-gal staining in R6/2-OPN4<sup>Lacz/+</sup> male mice, contributed to the diminished light-induced c-fos and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which may explain the impaired circadian photoentrainment in HD mice. Collectively, our results show that M1 ipRGCs were susceptible to the toxicity caused by mutant Huntingtin. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and disrupted circadian regulation during HD progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian disruption is a common nonmotor symptom of Huntington's disease (HD). In addition to the molecular defects in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the cause of circadian disruption in HD remains to be further explored. We hypothesized that ipRGCs, by integrating light input to the SCN, participate in the circadian regulation in HD mice. We report early reductions in melanopsin in two mouse models of HD, R6/2, and N171-82Q. Suppression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, by mutant Huntingtin might mediate the reduced number of ipRGCs. Importantly, M1 ipRGCs showed higher susceptibility than non-M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 mice. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and the circadian abnormality during HD progression.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1484?rss=1">Activation of 5-HT1A Receptors Promotes Retinal Ganglion Cell Function by Inhibiting the cAMP-PKA Pathway to Modulate Presynaptic GABA Release in Chronic Glaucoma</a></h4>

<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor agonists are neuroprotective in CNS injury models. However, the neuroprotective functional implications and synaptic mechanism of 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) agonist, in an adult male Wistar rat model of chronic glaucoma model remain unknown. We found that ocular hypertension decreased 5-HT1A receptor expression in rat retinas because the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was significantly reduced in rats with induced ocular hypertension relative to that in control retinas and 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the RGC viability. The protective effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by intravitreal administration of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or the selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531. Using patch-clamp techniques, spontaneous and miniature GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) of RGCs in rat retinal slices were recorded. 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic sIPSCs and mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs. Among the signaling cascades mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, the role of cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling was investigated. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes at the synaptic level were enhanced by PKA inhibition by H-89 and blocked by PKA activation with bucladesine. Furthermore, the density of phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA)/PKA was significantly increased in glaucomatous retinas and 8-OH-DPAT significantly decreased p-PKA/PKA expression, which led to the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation upon relieving neurotransmitter GABA release. These results showed that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in retinas facilitated presynaptic GABA release functions by suppressing cAMP-PKA signaling and decreasing PKA phosphorylation, which could lead to the de-excitation of RGC circuits and suppress excitotoxic processes in glaucoma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found that serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the retina (5-HT1A receptors) were downregulated after intraocular pressure elevation. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrated differences in the frequencies of miniature GABAergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) in ON- and OFF-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGCs in normal and glaucomatous retinal slices. Therefore, phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition upon release of the neurotransmitter GABA was eliminated by 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), which led to increased levels of GABAergic mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs, thus enhancing RGC viability and function. These protective effects were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635. This study identified a novel mechanism by which activation of 5-HT1A receptors protects damaged RGCs via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that modulates GABAergic presynaptic activity.</p>

<p>An essential human skill is our capacity to monitor and execute a sequence of tasks in the service of an overarching goal. Such a sequence can be as mundane as making a cup of coffee or as complex as flying a fighter plane. Previously, we showed that, during sequential control, the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits activation that ramps steadily through the sequence and is necessary for sequential task execution using fMRI in humans (Desrochers et al., 2015). It remains unknown what computations may underlie this ramping dynamic. Across two independent fMRI experiments, we manipulated three features that were unique to the sequential control task to determine whether and how they modulated ramping activity in the RLPFC: (1) sequence position uncertainty, (2) sequential monitoring without external position cues (i.e., from memory), and (3) sequential monitoring without multilevel decision making (i.e., task execution). We replicated the ramping activation in RLPFC and found it to be remarkably robust regardless of the level of task abstraction or engagement of memory functions. Therefore, these results both replicate and extend previous findings regarding the function of the RLPFC. They suggest that sequential control processes are integral to the dynamics of RLPFC activity. Advancing knowledge of the neural bases of sequential control is crucial for our understanding of the sequential processes that are necessary for daily living.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We perform sequences of tasks every day, but little is known about how they are controlled in the brain. Previously we found that ramping activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) was necessary to perform a sequence of tasks. We designed two independent fMRI experiments in human participants to determine which features of the previous sequential task potentially engaged ramping in the RLPFC. We found that any demand to monitor a sequence of state transitions consistently elicited ramping in the RLPFC, regardless of the level of the decisions made at each step in the sequence or engagement of memory functions. These results provide a framework for understanding RLPFC function during sequential control, and consequently, daily life.</p>

<p>Dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission at cortical inputs to the dorsal striatum is considered critical for flexible and efficient action learning and control. Presynaptic mechanisms governing the properties and plasticity of glutamate release from these inputs are not fully understood, and the corticostriatal synaptic processes that support normal action learning and control remain unclear. Here we show in male and female mice that conditional deletion of presynaptic proteins RIM1αβ (RIM1) from excitatory cortical neurons impairs corticostriatal synaptic transmission in the dorsolateral striatum. Key forms of presynaptic G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated short- and long-term striatal plasticity are spared following RIM1 deletion. Conditional RIM1 KO mice show heightened novelty-induced locomotion and impaired motor learning on the accelerating rotarod. They further show heightened self-paced instrumental responding for food and impaired learning of a habitual instrumental response strategy. Together, these findings reveal a selective role for presynaptic RIM1 in neurotransmitter release at prominent basal ganglia synapses, and provide evidence that RIM1-dependent processes help to promote the refinement of skilled actions, constrain goal-directed behaviors, and support the learning and use of habits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our daily functioning hinges on the ability to flexibly and efficiently learn and control our actions. How the brain encodes these capacities is unclear. Here we identified a selective role for presynaptic proteins RIM1αβ in controlling glutamate release from cortical inputs to the dorsolateral striatum, a brain structure critical for action learning and control. Behavioral analysis of mice with restricted genetic deletion of RIM1αβ further revealed roles for RIM1αβ-dependent processes in the learning and refinement of motor skills and the balanced expression of goal-directed and habitual actions.</p>

<p>Learning and decision-making are modulated by socio-emotional processing and such modulation is implicated in clinically relevant personality traits of social anxiety. The present study elucidates the computational and neural mechanisms by which emotionally aversive cues disrupt learning in socially anxious human individuals. Healthy volunteers with low or high trait social anxiety performed a reversal learning task requiring learning actions in response to angry or happy face cues. Choice data were best captured by a computational model in which learning rate was adjusted according to the history of surprises. High trait socially anxious individuals used a less-dynamic strategy for adjusting their learning rate in trials started with angry face cues and unlike the low social anxiety group, their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity did not covary with the learning rate. Our results demonstrate that trait social anxiety is accompanied by disruption of optimal learning and dACC activity in threatening situations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social anxiety is known to influence a broad range of cognitive functions. This study tests whether and how social anxiety affects human value-based learning as a function of uncertainty in the learning environment. The findings indicate that, in a threatening context evoked by an angry face, socially anxious individuals fail to benefit from a stable learning environment with highly predictable stimulus–response–outcome associations. Under those circumstances, socially anxious individuals failed to use their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region known to adjust learning rate to environmental uncertainty. These findings open the way to modify neurobiological mechanisms of maladaptive learning in anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>

<p>Dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum are increased by many therapeutic drugs, such as methylphenidate (MPH), which also alters behavioral and cognitive functions thought to be controlled by the PFC dose-dependently. We linked DA changes and functional connectivity (FC) using simultaneous [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride PET and resting-state fMRI in awake male rhesus monkeys after oral administration of various doses of MPH. We found a negative correlation between [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride nondisplaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) and MPH dose in the head of the caudate (hCd), demonstrating increased extracellular DA resulting from MPH administration. The decreased BP<sub>ND</sub> was negatively correlated with FC between the hCd and the PFC. Subsequent voxelwise analyses revealed negative correlations with FC between the hCd and the dorsolateral PFC, hippocampus, and precuneus. These results, showing that MPH-induced changes in DA levels in the hCd predict resting-state FC, shed light on a mechanism by which changes in striatal DA could influence function in the PFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine transmission is thought to play an essential role in shaping large scale-neural networks that underlie cognitive functions. It is the target of therapeutic drugs, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), which blocks the dopamine transporter, thereby increasing extracellular dopamine levels. Methylphenidate is used extensively to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, even though its effects on cognitive functions and their underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. To date, little is known about the link between changes in dopamine levels and changes in functional brain organization. Using simultaneous PET/MR imaging, we show that methylphenidate-induced changes in endogenous dopamine levels in the head of the caudate predict changes in resting-state functional connectivity between this structure and the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and hippocampus.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1420?rss=1">Frequency Shifts and Depth Dependence of Premotor Beta Band Activity during Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

<p>Neural activity in the premotor and motor cortices shows prominent structure in the beta frequency range (13–30 Hz). Currently, the behavioral relevance of this beta band activity (BBA) is debated. The underlying source of motor BBA and how it changes as a function of cortical depth are also not completely understood. Here, we addressed these unresolved questions by investigating BBA recorded using laminar electrodes in the dorsal premotor cortex of 2 male rhesus macaques performing a visual reaction time (RT) reach discrimination task. We observed robust BBA before and after the onset of the visual stimulus but not during the arm movement. While poststimulus BBA was positively correlated with RT throughout the beta frequency range, prestimulus correlation varied by frequency. Low beta frequencies (~12–20 Hz) were positively correlated with RT, and high beta frequencies (~22–30 Hz) were negatively correlated with RT. Analysis and simulations suggested that these frequency-dependent correlations could emerge due to a shift in the component frequencies of the prestimulus BBA as a function of RT, such that faster RTs are accompanied by greater power in high beta frequencies. We also observed a laminar dependence of BBA, with deeper electrodes demonstrating stronger power in low beta frequencies both prestimulus and poststimulus. The heterogeneous nature of BBA and the changing relationship between BBA and RT in different task epochs may be a sign of the differential network dynamics involved in cue expectation, decision-making, motor preparation, and movement execution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Beta band activity (BBA) has been implicated in motor tasks, in disease states, and as a potential signal for brain–machine interfaces. However, the behavioral relevance of BBA and its laminar organization in premotor cortex have not been completely elucidated. Here we addressed these unresolved issues using simultaneous recordings from multiple cortical layers of the premotor cortex of monkeys performing a decision-making task. Our key finding is that BBA is not a monolithic signal. Instead, BBA consists of at least two frequency bands. The relationship between BBA and eventual behavior, such as reaction time, also dynamically changes depending on task epoch. We also provide further evidence that BBA is laminarly organized, with greater power in deeper electrodes for low beta frequencies.</p>

<p>One of the challenges facing neuroscience entails localization of circuits and mechanisms accounting for how multiple features of stress responses are organized to promote survival during adverse experiences. The rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is generally regarded as a key site for cognitive and affective information processing, and the anteroventral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (avBST) integrates homeostatic information from a variety of sources, including the mPFC. Thus, we proposed that the mPFC is capable of generating multiple features (endocrine, behavioral) of adaptive responses via its influence over the avBST. To address this possibility, we first optogenetically inhibited input to avBST from the rostral prelimbic cortical region of mPFC and observed concurrent increases in immobility and hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) output in male rats during tail suspension, whereas photostimulation of this pathway decreased immobility during the same challenge. Anatomical tracing experiments confirmed projections from the rostral prelimbic subfield to separate populations of avBST neurons, and from these to HPA effector neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and to aspects of the midbrain periaqueductal gray that coordinate passive defensive behaviors. Finally, stimulation and inhibition of the prelimbic–avBST pathway, respectively, decreased and increased passive coping in the shock-probe defensive burying test, without having any direct effect on active coping (burying) behavior. These results define a new neural substrate in the coordination of a <i>response set</i> that involves the gating of passive, rather than active, coping behaviors while restraining neuroendocrine activation to optimize adaptation during threat exposure.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The circuits and mechanisms accounting for how multiple features of responses are organized to promote adaptation have yet to be elucidated. Our report identifies a prefrontal–bed nucleus pathway that organizes a <i>response set</i> capable of gating passive coping behaviors while concurrently restraining neuroendocrine activation during exposure to inescapable stressors. These data provide insight into the central organization of how multiple features of responses are integrated to promote adaptation during adverse experiences, and how disruption in one neural pathway may underlie a broad array of maladaptive responses in stress-related psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Heparan sulfate (HS) is a cell surface and extracellular matrix carbohydrate extensively modified by differential sulfation. HS interacts physically with canonical fibroblast growth factor (FGF) proteins that signal through the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. At the embryonic mouse telencephalic midline, FGF/ERK signaling drives astroglial precursor somal translocation from the ventricular zone of the corticoseptal boundary (CSB) to the induseum griseum (IG), producing a focus of <i>Slit2</i>-expressing astroglial guidepost cells essential for interhemispheric corpus callosum (CC) axon navigation. Here, we investigated the cell and molecular function of a specific form of HS sulfation, 2-O HS sulfation catalyzed by the enzyme Hs2st, in midline astroglial development and in regulating FGF protein levels and interaction with HS. <i>Hs2st</i><sup>–/–</sup> embryos of either sex exhibit a grossly enlarged IG due to precocious astroglial translocation and conditional <i>Hs2st</i> mutagenesis and <i>ex vivo</i> culture experiments show that <i>Hs2st</i> is not required cell autonomously by CC axons or by the IG astroglial cell lineage, but rather acts non-cell autonomously to suppress the transmission of translocation signals to astroglial precursors. Rescue of the <i>Hs2st</i><sup>–/–</sup> astroglial translocation phenotype by pharmacologically inhibiting FGF signaling shows that the normal role of Hs2st is to suppress FGF-mediated astroglial translocation. We demonstrate a selective action of Hs2st on FGF protein by showing that <i>Hs2st</i> (but not <i>Hs6st1</i>) normally suppresses the levels of Fgf17 protein in the CSB region <i>in vivo</i> and use a biochemical assay to show that <i>Hs2st</i> (but not <i>Hs6st1</i>) facilitates a physical interaction between the Fgf17 protein and HS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report a novel non-cell-autonomous mechanism regulating cell signaling in developing brain. Using the developing mouse telencephalic midline as an exemplar, we show that the specific sulfation modification of the cell surface and extracellular carbohydrate heparan sulfate (HS) performed by Hs2st suppresses the supply of translocation signals to astroglial precursors by a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We further show that Hs2st modification selectively facilitates a physical interaction between Fgf17 and HS and suppresses Fgf17 protein levels <i>in vivo</i>, strongly suggesting that Hs2st acts selectively on Fgf17 signaling. HS interacts with many signaling proteins potentially encoding numerous selective interactions important in development and disease, so this class of mechanism may apply more broadly to other biological systems.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1374?rss=1">Cross-Modal Competition: The Default Computation for Multisensory Processing</a></h4>

<p>Mature multisensory superior colliculus (SC) neurons integrate information across the senses to enhance their responses to spatiotemporally congruent cross-modal stimuli. The development of this neurotypic feature of SC neurons requires experience with cross-modal cues. In the absence of such experience the response of an SC neuron to congruent cross-modal cues is no more robust than its response to the most effective component cue. This "default" or "naive" state is believed to be one in which cross-modal signals do not interact. The present results challenge this characterization by identifying interactions between visual-auditory signals in male and female cats reared without visual-auditory experience. By manipulating the relative effectiveness of the visual and auditory cross-modal cues that were presented to each of these naive neurons, an active competition between cross-modal signals was revealed. Although contrary to current expectations, this result is explained by a neuro-computational model in which the default interaction is mutual inhibition. These findings suggest that multisensory neurons at all maturational stages are capable of some form of multisensory integration, and use experience with cross-modal stimuli to transition from their initial state of competition to their mature state of cooperation. By doing so, they develop the ability to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events thereby increasing their impact on the sensorimotor circuitry of the SC, and the likelihood that biologically significant events will elicit SC-mediated overt behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present results demonstrate that the default mode of multisensory processing in the superior colliculus is competition, not non-integration as previously characterized. A neuro-computational model explains how these competitive dynamics can be implemented via mutual inhibition, and how this default mode is superseded by the emergence of cooperative interactions during development.</p>

<p>Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) impacts cognitive development and mental health, but its association with human structural brain development is not yet well characterized. Here, we analyzed 1243 longitudinally acquired structural MRI scans from 623 youth (299 female/324 male) to investigate the relation between SES and cortical and subcortical morphology between ages 5 and 25 years. We found positive associations between SES and total volumes of the brain, cortical sheet, and four separate subcortical structures. These associations were stable between ages 5 and 25. Surface-based shape analysis revealed that higher SES is associated with areal expansion of lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and superior parietal cortices and ventrolateral thalamic, and medial amygdalo-hippocampal subregions. Meta-analyses of functional imaging data indicate that cortical correlates of SES are centered on brain systems subserving sensorimotor functions, language, memory, and emotional processing. We further show that anatomical variation within a subset of these cortical regions partially mediates the positive association between SES and IQ. Finally, we identify neuroanatomical correlates of SES that exist above and beyond accompanying variation in IQ. Although SES is clearly a complex construct that likely relates to development through diverse, nondeterministic processes, our findings elucidate potential neuroanatomical mediators of the association between SES and cognitive outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with developmental disparities in mental health, cognitive ability, and academic achievement, but efforts to understand underlying SES–brain relationships are ongoing. Here, we leverage a unique developmental neuroimaging dataset to longitudinally map the associations between SES and regional brain anatomy at high spatiotemporal resolution. We find widespread associations between SES and global cortical and subcortical volumes and surface area and localize these correlations to a distributed set of cortical, thalamic, and amygdalo-hippocampal subregions. Anatomical variation within a subset of these regions partially mediates the positive relationship between SES and IQ. Our findings help to localize cortical and subcortical systems that represent candidate biological substrates for the known relationships between SES and cognition.</p>

<p>Mutations in the Joubert syndrome-associated small GTPase ARL13B are linked to photoreceptor impairment and vision loss. To determine the role of ARL13B in the development, function, and maintenance of ciliated photoreceptors, we generated a pan-retina knock-out (<i>Six3</i>-Cre) and a rod photoreceptor-specific inducible conditional knock-out (<i>Pde6g</i>-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>) of ARL13B using murine models. Embryonic deletion of ARL13B led to defects in retinal development with reduced cell proliferation. In the absence of ARL13B, photoreceptors failed to develop outer segment (OS) membranous discs and axonemes, resulting in loss of function and rapid degeneration. Additionally, the majority of photoreceptor basal bodies did not dock properly at the apical edge of the inner segments. The removal of ARL13B in adult rod photoreceptor cells after maturation of OS resulted in loss of photoresponse and vesiculation in the OS. Before changes in photoresponse, removal of ARL13B led to mislocalization of rhodopsin, prenylated phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6), and intraflagellar transport protein-88 (IFT88). Our findings show that ARL13B is required at multiple stages of retinogenesis, including early postnatal proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, development of photoreceptor cilia, and morphogenesis of photoreceptor OS discs regardless of sex. Last, our results establish a need for ARL13B in photoreceptor maintenance and protein trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The normal development of photoreceptor cilia is essential to create functional, organized outer segments with stacked membrane discs that house the phototransduction proteins necessary for sight. Our study identifies a complex role for ARL13B, a small GTPase linked to Joubert syndrome and visual impairment, at various stages of photoreceptor development. Loss of ARL13B led to defects in retinal proliferation, altered placement of basal bodies crucial for components of the cilium (transition zone) to emanate, and absence of photoreceptor-stacked discs. These defects led to extinguished visual response and dysregulated protein trafficking. Our findings show the complex role ARL13B plays in photoreceptor development, viability, and function. Our study accounts for the severe retinal impairment observed in ARL13B-linked Joubert syndrome patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1334?rss=1">Loss of Adult 5-HT1A Autoreceptors Results in a Paradoxical Anxiogenic Response to Antidepressant Treatment</a></h4>

<p>Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants but require several weeks to elicit their actions. Chronic SSRI treatment induces desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors to enhance 5-HT neurotransmission. Mice (both sexes) with gene deletion of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in adult 5-HT neurons (<i>1AcKO</i>) were tested for response to SSRIs. Tamoxifen-induced recombination in adult <i>1AcKO</i> mice specifically reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels. The <i>1AcKO</i> mice showed a loss of 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated hypothermia and electrophysiological responses, but no changes in anxiety- or depression-like behavior. Subchronic fluoxetine (FLX) treatment induced an unexpected anxiogenic effect in <i>1AcKO</i> mice in the novelty suppressed feeding and elevated plus maze tests, as did escitalopram in the novelty suppressed feeding test. No effect was seen in wild-type (<i>WT</i>) mice. Subchronic FLX increased 5-HT metabolism in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and raphe of <i>1AcKO</i> but not <i>WT</i> mice, suggesting hyperactivation of 5-HT release. To detect chronic cellular activation, FosB<sup>+</sup> cells were quantified. FosB<sup>+</sup> cells were reduced in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (CA2/3) and increased in dorsal raphe 5-HT cells of <i>1AcKO</i> mice, suggesting increased raphe activation. In <i>WT</i> but not <i>1AcKO</i> mice, FLX reduced FosB<sup>+</sup> cells in the median raphe, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and median septum, which receive rich 5-HT projections. Thus, in the absence of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, SSRIs induce a paradoxical anxiogenic response. This may involve imbalance in activation of dorsal and median raphe to regulate septohippocampal or fimbria-fornix pathways. These results suggest that markedly reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptors may provide a marker for aberrant response to SSRI treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating anxiety and depression in humans and mouse models. However, in some cases, SSRIs can increase anxiety, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we show that, rather than enhancing SSRI benefits, adulthood knockout (KO) of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, a critical negative regulator of 5-HT activity, results in an SSRI-induced anxiety effect that appears to involve a hyperactivation of the 5-HT system in certain brain areas. Thus, subjects with very low levels of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, such as during childhood or adolescence, may be at risk for an SSRI-induced anxiety response.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inward. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a "surface‐in" process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We focused on the thalamus, which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxelwise volume changes were calculated using deformation‐based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up = 4.6 years, standard deviation = 1.9). A total of 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional surface‐in gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.58, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12–0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.0021).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis disease‐specific surface‐in process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–12</p>

<p>A major tenet in theoretical neuroscience is that cognitive and behavioral
processes are ultimately implemented in terms of the neural system dynamics.
Accordingly, a major aim for the analysis of neurophysiological measurements
should lie in the identification of the computational dynamics underlying task
processing. Here we advance a state space model (SSM) based on generative
piecewise-linear recurrent neural networks (PLRNN) to assess dynamics from
neuroimaging data. In contrast to many other nonlinear time series models which
have been proposed for reconstructing latent dynamics, our model is easily
interpretable in neural terms, amenable to systematic dynamical systems
analysis of the resulting set of equations, and can straightforwardly be
transformed into an equivalent continuous-time dynamical system. The major
contributions of this paper are the introduction of a new observation model
suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupled to the latent
PLRNN, an efficient stepwise training procedure that forces the latent model to
capture the 'true' underlying dynamics rather than just fitting (or predicting)
the observations, and of an empirical measure based on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence to evaluate from empirical time series how well this goal of
approximating the underlying dynamics has been achieved. We validate and
illustrate the power of our approach on simulated 'ground-truth' dynamical
(benchmark) systems as well as on actual experimental fMRI time series. Given
that fMRI is one of the most common techniques for measuring brain activity
non-invasively in human subjects, this approach may provide a novel step toward
analyzing aberrant (nonlinear) dynamics for clinical assessment or
neuroscientific research.

<p>We show that \emph{stochastic bursting} is observed in a ring of
unidirectional delay-coupled noisy excitable systems, thanks to the
combinational action of time-delayed coupling and noise. Under the
approximation of timescale separation, i.e., when the time delays in each
connection are much larger than the characteristic duration of the spikes, the
observed rather coherent spike pattern can be described by idealized coupled
point processes with a leader-follower relationship. We derive analytically the
statistics of the spikes in each unit, pairwise correlations between any two
units, and the spectrum of the total output from the network. Theory is in a
good agreement with the simulations with a network of theta-neurons.

<p>Network inference algorithms are valuable tools for the study of large-scale
neuroimaging datasets. Multivariate transfer entropy is well suited for this
task, being a model-free measure that captures nonlinear and lagged
dependencies between time series to infer a minimal directed network model.
Greedy algorithms have been proposed to efficiently deal with high-dimensional
datasets while avoiding redundant inferences and capturing synergistic effects.
However, multiple statistical comparisons may inflate the false positive rate
and are computationally demanding, which limited the size of previous
validation studies. The algorithm we present---as implemented in the IDTxl
open-source software---addresses these challenges by employing hierarchical
statistical tests to control the family-wise error rate and to allow for
efficient parallelisation. The method was validated on synthetic datasets
involving random networks of increasing size (up to 100 nodes), for both linear
and nonlinear dynamics. The performance increased with the length of the time
series, reaching consistently high precision, recall, and specificity (&gt;98% on
average) for 10000 time samples. Varying the statistical significance threshold
showed a more favourable precision-recall trade-off for longer time series.
Both the network size and the sample size are one order of magnitude larger
than previously demonstrated, showing feasibility for typical EEG and MEG
experiments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44396">Schnyder corneal dystrophy-associated UBIAD1 Inhibits ER-associated degradation of HMG CoA reductase in mice</a></h4>

Autosomal-dominant Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) is characterized by corneal opacification owing to overaccumulation of cholesterol. SCD is caused by mutations in UBIAD1, which utilizes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Using cultured cells, we previously showed that sterols trigger binding of UBIAD1 to the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), thereby inhibiting its endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) (Schumacher et al. 2015). GGpp triggers release of UBIAD1 from HMGCR, allowing maximal ERAD and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. SCD-associated UBIAD1 resists GGpp-induced release and is sequestered in ER to inhibit ERAD. We now report knockin mice expressing SCD-associated UBIAD1 accumulate HMGCR in several tissues resulting from ER sequestration of mutant UBIAD1 and inhibition of HMGCR ERAD. Corneas from aged knockin mice exhibit signs of opacification and sterol overaccumulation. These results establish the physiological significance of UBIAD1 in cholesterol homeostasis and indicate inhibition of HMGCR ERAD contributes to SCD pathogenesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44365">Cryo-EM structures and functional characterization of the murine lipid scramblase TMEM16F</a></h4>

The lipid scramblase TMEM16F initiates blood coagulation by catalyzing the exposure of phosphatidylserine in platelets. The protein is part of a family of membrane proteins, which encompasses calcium-activated channels for ions and lipids. Here, we reveal features of murine TMEM16F (mTMEM16F) that underlie its function as a lipid scramblase and an ion channel. The cryo-EM data of mTMEM16F in absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> define the ligand-free closed conformation of the protein and the structure of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound intermediate. Both conformations resemble their counterparts of the scrambling-incompetent anion channel mTMEM16A, yet with distinct differences in the region of ion and lipid permeation. In conjunction with functional data, we demonstrate the relationship between ion conduction and lipid scrambling. Although activated by a common mechanism, both functions appear to be mediated by alternate protein conformations that are at equilibrium in the ligand-bound state.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44364">Stepwise activation mechanism of the scramblase nhTMEM16 revealed by cryo-EM</a></h4>

Scramblases catalyze the movement of lipids between both leaflets of a bilayer. Whereas the X-ray structure of the protein nhTMEM16 has previously revealed the architecture of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lipid scramblase, its regulation mechanism has remained elusive. Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays to address this question. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformations of nhTMEM16 in detergent and lipid nanodiscs illustrate the interactions with its environment and they reveal the conformational changes underlying its activation. In this process, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding induces a stepwise transition of the catalytic subunit cavity, converting a closed cavity that is shielded from the membrane in the absence of ligand, into a polar furrow that becomes accessible to lipid headgroups in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state. Additionally, our structures demonstrate how nhTMEM16 distorts the membrane at both entrances of the subunit cavity, thereby decreasing the energy barrier for lipid movement.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44213">Pyrophosphate modulates plant stress responses via SUMOylation</a></h4>

Pyrophosphate (PPi), a byproduct of macromolecule biosynthesis is maintained at low levels by soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPase) found in all eukaryotes. In plants, H<sup>+</sup>-pumping pyrophosphatases (H<sup>+</sup>-PPase) convert the substantial energy present in PPi into an electrochemical gradient. We show here, that both cold- and heat stress sensitivity of <i>fugu5</i> mutants lacking the major H<sup>+</sup>-PPase isoform AVP1 is correlated with reduced SUMOylation. In addition, we show that increased PPi concentrations interfere with SUMOylation in yeast and we provide evidence that SUMO activating E1-enzymes are inhibited by micromolar concentrations of PPi in a non-competitive manner. Taken together, our results do not only provide a mechanistic explanation for the beneficial effects of AVP1 overexpression in plants but they also highlight PPi as an important integrator of metabolism and stress tolerance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43676">Structural insights into SETD3-mediated histidine methylation on β-actin</a></h4>

SETD3 is a member of the SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of zeste, and Trithorax) domain protein superfamily and plays important roles in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, muscle differentiation, and carcinogenesis. Previously we identified SETD3 as the actin-specific methyltransferase that methylates the N<sup>3</sup> of His73 on β-actin (Kwiatkowski et al. 2018). Here, we present two structures of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-homocysteine-bound SETD3 in complex with either an unmodified β-actin peptide or its His-methylated variant. Structural analyses, supported by biochemical experiments and enzyme activity assays, indicate that the recognition and methylation of β-actin by SETD3 are highly sequence specific, and both SETD3 and β-actin adopt pronounced conformational changes upon binding to each other. In conclusion, this study is the first to show a catalytic mechanism of SETD3-mediated histidine methylation on β-actin, which not only throws light on the protein histidine methylation phenomenon, but also facilitates the design of small molecule inhibitors of SETD3.

The linguistic foundations of science and technology include many terms that have been borrowed from ancient languages. In the case of terms with origins in the Greek language, the modern meaning can often differ significantly from the original one. Here we use the PubMed database to demonstrate the prevalence of words of Greek origin in the language of modern science, and call for scientists to exercise care when coining new terms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42736">Programmed conversion of hypertrophic chondrocytes into osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes within zebrafish bones</a></h4>

Much of the vertebrate skeleton develops from cartilage templates that are progressively remodeled into bone. Lineage tracing studies in mouse suggest that chondrocytes within these templates persist and become osteoblasts, yet the underlying mechanisms of this process and whether chondrocytes can generate other derivatives remain unclear. We find that zebrafish cartilages undergo extensive remodeling and vascularization during juvenile stages to generate fat-filled bones. Growth plate chondrocytes marked by <i>sox10 </i>and <i>col2a1a</i> contribute to osteoblasts, marrow adipocytes, and mesenchymal cells within adult bones. At the edge of the hypertrophic zone, chondrocytes re-enter the cell cycle and express <i>leptin receptor </i>(<i>lepr</i>), suggesting conversion into progenitors. Further, mutation of <i>matrix metalloproteinase 9 </i>(<i>mmp9</i>) results in delayed growth plate remodeling and fewer marrow adipocytes. Our data support Mmp9-dependent growth plate remodeling and conversion of chondrocytes into osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes as conserved features of bony vertebrates.

Tau is one of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, and bears a much closer relationship to local neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment than the other hallmark, {beta}-amyloid. Cell and rodent models have shown evidence that tau spreads from cell to cell through anatomical neuronal connections, and that this process is facilitated by the presence of {beta}-amyloid. We test this hypothesis in humans by using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate the spread of tau over human neuronal connections, and we compare the simulated pattern of progression to the observed pattern measured in the brains of 295 individuals on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum, using PET. Fitting our model, we found that the majority of variance in the overall pattern of tau progression could be explained by diffusion of an agent through the human connectome, measured using either functional connectivity or diffusion tractograpy. These models far exceeded chance, and outperformed models testing the extracellular spread of tau over Euclidian space. Surprisingly, the ESM predicted the spatial patterns of sub-threshold tau in cognitively normal elderly without significant amyloid burden with impressive accuracy. In addition, in amyloid-positive subjects only, regions with greater amyloid burden showed greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of amyloid in accelerating the spread of tau in certain isocortical regions. Altogether, our results provide strong evidence that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain {beta}-amyloid.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/555649v1?rss=1">The relationship between neural variability and neural oscillations</a></h4>

Neural activity fluctuates over time, creating considerable variability across trials. This trial-by-trial neural variability is dramatically reduced ("quenched") after the presentation of sensory stimuli. Likewise, the power of neural oscillations, primarily in the alpha-beta band, is also reduced. Despite their similarity, these phenomena have been discussed independently. We hypothesized that the two phenomena are tightly coupled. To test this, we examined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of healthy subjects viewing repeated presentations of a visual stimulus. The timing, amplitude, and spatial topography of variability quenching and power suppression were remarkably similar. Neural variability quenching was eliminated by excluding the alpha-beta band from the recordings, but not by excluding other frequency-bands. Moreover, individual magnitudes of alpha-beta band power explained 86% of between-subject differences in variability quenching. In contrast, inter-trial-phase-coherence (ITPC) was not correlated with variability quenching. These results reveal that neural variability quenching reflects stimulus-induced changes in the power of alpha-beta band oscillations.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/555573v1?rss=1">Reward prediction error modulates saccade vigor</a></h4>

Movements toward rewarding stimuli exhibit greater vigor, i.e., increased velocity and reduced reaction-times. This invigoration may be due to release of dopamine before movement onset. Dopamine release is strongly modulated by reward prediction error (RPE). Here, we generated an RPE event in the milliseconds before movement onset and tested whether there was a causal relationship between RPE and vigor. Human subjects made saccades toward an image. During the execution of their primary saccade, we probabilistically changed the position and content of the image. This led to a secondary saccade following completion of the primary saccade. We focused on properties of this secondary saccade. On some trials, the content of the secondary image was more valuable than the first image, resulting in a +RPE event that preceded the secondary saccade. On other trials, this content was less valuable, resulting in a -RPE event. We found that reaction-time and velocity of the secondary saccade were affected in an orderly fashion by the magnitude and direction of the preceding RPE event: the most vigorous saccades followed the largest +RPE, whereas the least vigorous saccades followed the largest -RPE. Presence of the secondary saccade indicated that the primary saccade had experienced a movement error, inducing trial-to-trial adaptation: the subsequent primary saccade was changed in the direction of the movement error in the previous trial. However, motor learning from error was not affected by the RPE event. Therefore, reward prediction error, and not reward per se, modulated vigor of saccades.

Classical models of cerebellar learning posit that climbing fibers operate according to a supervised learning rule to instruct changes in motor output by signaling the occurrence of movement errors. However, cerebellar output is also associated with non-motor behaviors, and recently with modulating reward association pathways in the VTA. To test how the cerebellum processes reward related signals in the same type of classical conditioning behavior typically studied to evaluate reward processing in the VTA and striatum, we have used calcium imaging to visualize instructional signals carried by climbing fibers across the lateral cerebellum before and after learning. We find distinct climbing fiber responses in three lateral cerebellar regions that can each signal reward prediction, but not reward prediction errors per se. These instructional signals are well suited to guide cerebellar learning based on reward expectation and enable a cerebellar contribution to reward driven behaviors.

Mutations in the mitochondrial complex IV assembly factor SURF1 represent a major cause of Leigh syndrome (LS), a rare fatal neurological disorder. SURF1-deficient animals have failed to recapitulate the neuronal pathology of LS, hindering our understanding of the disease mechanisms. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells from LS patients carrying homozygous SURF1 mutations (SURF1 iPS) and performed biallelic correction via CRISPR/Cas9. In contrast to corrected cells, SURF1 iPS showed impaired neuronal differentiation. Aberrant bioenergetics in SURF1 iPS occurred already in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), disrupting their neurogenic potency. Cerebral organoids from SURF1 iPS were smaller and recapitulated the neurogenesis defects. Our data imply that SURF1 mutations cause a failure in the development of maturing neurons. Using NPC function as an interventional target, we identified SURF1 gene augmentation as a potential strategy for restoring neurogenesis in LS patients carrying SURF1 mutations.

<p>by Daniel Rüdiger, Sascha Young Kupke, Tanja Laske, Pawel Zmora, Udo Reichl</p>

Influenza A viruses (IAV) are commonly used to infect animal cell cultures for research purposes and vaccine production. Their replication is influenced strongly by the multiplicity of infection (MOI), which ranges over several orders of magnitude depending on the respective application. So far, mathematical models of IAV replication have paid little attention to the impact of the MOI on infection dynamics and virus yields. To address this issue, we extended an existing model of IAV replication in adherent MDCK cells with kinetics that explicitly consider the time point of cell infection. This modification does not only enable the fitting of high MOI measurements, but also the successful prediction of viral release dynamics of low MOI experiments using the same set of parameters. Furthermore, this model allows the investigation of defective interfering particle (DIP) propagation in different MOI regimes. The key difference between high and low MOI conditions is the percentage of infectious virions among the total virus particle release. Simulation studies show that DIP interference at a high MOI is determined exclusively by the DIP content of the seed virus while, in low MOI conditions, it is predominantly controlled by the <i>de novo</i> generation of DIPs. Overall, the extended model provides an ideal framework for the prediction and optimization of cell culture-derived IAV manufacturing and the production of DIPs for therapeutic use.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NatcusQY3NQ" width="1" />

<p>by Hongyu Zhou, Zheng Dong, Gennady Verkhivker, Brian D. Zoltowski, Peng Tao</p>

The fungal circadian clock photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) contains a photosensitive allosteric light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domain that undergoes a large N-terminal conformational change. The mechanism by which a blue-light driven covalent bond formation leads to a global conformational change remains unclear, which hinders the further development of VVD as an optogenetic tool. We answered this question through a novel computational platform integrating Markov state models, machine learning methods, and newly developed community analysis algorithms. Applying this new integrative approach, we provided a quantitative evaluation of the contribution from the covalent bond to the protein global conformational change, and proposed an atomistic allosteric mechanism leading to the discovery of the unexpected importance of A’α/Aβ and previously overlooked Eα/Fα loops in the conformational change. This approach could be applicable to other allosteric proteins in general to provide interpretable atomistic representations of their otherwise elusive allosteric mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJ65cTk-XxE" width="1" />

<p>by Koichiro Uriu, Hajime Tei</p>

Negative feedback loops (NFLs) for circadian clocks include light-responsive reactions that allow the clocks to shift their phase depending on the timing of light signals. Phase response curves (PRCs) for light signals in various organisms include a time interval called a dead zone where light signals cause no phase shift during daytime. Although the importance of the dead zone for robust light entrainment is known, how the dead zone arises from the biochemical reactions in an NFL underlying circadian gene expression rhythms remains unclear. In addition, the observation that the light-responsive reactions in the NFL vary between organisms raises the question as to whether the mechanism for dead zone formation is common or distinct between different organisms. Here we reveal by mathematical modeling that the saturation of a biochemical reaction in repressor synthesis in an NFL is a common mechanism of daytime dead zone generation. If light signals increase the degradation of a repressor protein, as in <i>Drosophila</i>, the saturation of repressor mRNA transcription nullifies the effect of light signals, generating a dead zone. In contrast, if light signals induce the transcription of repressor mRNA, as in mammals, the saturation of repressor translation can generate a dead zone by cancelling the influence of excess amount of mRNA induced by light signals. Each of these saturated reactions is located next to the light-responsive reaction in the NFL, suggesting a design principle for daytime dead zone generation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fl8k8W5KC3g" width="1" />

<p>by Muhammad Ali Al-Radhawi, Domitilla Del Vecchio, Eduardo D. Sontag</p>

Phenotypical variability in the absence of genetic variation often reflects complex energetic landscapes associated with underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this view, different phenotypes are associated with alternative states of complex nonlinear systems: stable attractors in deterministic models or modes of stationary distributions in stochastic descriptions. We provide theoretical and practical characterizations of these landscapes, specifically focusing on stochastic Slow Promoter Kinetics (SPK), a time scale relevant when transcription factor binding and unbinding are affected by epigenetic processes like DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. In this case, largely unexplored except for numerical simulations, adiabatic approximations of promoter kinetics are not appropriate. In contrast to the existing literature, we provide rigorous analytic characterizations of multiple modes. A general formal approach gives insight into the influence of parameters and the prediction of how changes in GRN wiring, for example through mutations or artificial interventions, impact the possible number, location, and likelihood of alternative states. We adapt tools from the mathematical field of singular perturbation theory to represent stationary distributions of Chemical Master Equations for GRNs as mixtures of Poisson distributions and obtain explicit formulas for the locations and probabilities of metastable states as a function of the parameters describing the system. As illustrations, the theory is used to tease out the role of cooperative binding in stochastic models in comparison to deterministic models, and applications are given to various model systems, such as toggle switches in isolation or in communicating populations, a synthetic oscillator, and a trans-differentiation network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXjE6wxdvww" width="1" />

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and computational technologies have enabled routine analysis of large-scale single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, scRNA-seq technologies have suffered from several technical challenges, including low mean expression levels in most genes and higher frequencies of missing data than bulk population sequencing technologies. Identifying functional gene sets and their regulatory networks that link specific cell types to human diseases and therapeutics from scRNA-seq profiles are daunting tasks. In this study, we developed a Component Overlapping Attribute Clustering (COAC) algorithm to perform the localized (subpopulation) gene co-expression network analysis from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles. Gene subnetworks that represent specific gene co-expression patterns are inferred from the components of a decomposed matrix of scRNA-seq profiles. We showed that single-cell gene subnetworks identified by COAC from multiple time points within cell phases can be used for cell type identification with high accuracy (83%). In addition, COAC-inferred subnetworks from melanoma patients’ scRNA-seq profiles are highly correlated with survival rate from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Moreover, the localized gene subnetworks identified by COAC from individual patients’ scRNA-seq data can be used as pharmacogenomics biomarkers to predict drug responses (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranges from 0.728 to 0.783) in cancer cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. In summary, COAC offers a powerful tool to identify potential network-based diagnostic and pharmacogenomics biomarkers from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles.

<p>by Masayuki Maeda, Hideaki Yamashita</p>

The presence of treatment-resistant cells is an important factor that limits the efficacy of cancer therapy, and the prospect of resistance is considered the major cause of the treatment strategy. Several recent studies have employed mathematical models to elucidate the dynamics of generating resistant cancer cells and attempted to predict the probability of emerging resistant cells. The purpose of this paper is to present numerical approach to compute the number of resistant cells and the emerging probability of resistance. Stochastic model was designed and developed a method to approximately but efficiently compute the number of resistant cells and the probability of resistance. To model the progression of cancer, a discrete-state, two-dimensional Markov process whose states are the total number of cells and the number of resistant cells was employed. Then exact analysis and approximate aggregation approaches were proposed to calculate the number of resistant cells and the probability of resistance when the cell population reaches detection size. To confirm the accuracy of computed results of approximation, relative errors between exact analysis and approximation were computed. The numerical values of our approximation method were very close to those of exact analysis calculated in the range of small detection size M = 500, 100, and 1500. Then computer simulation was performed to confirm the accuracy of computed results of approximation when the detection size was M = 10000,30000,50000,100000 and 1000000. All the numerical results of approximation fell between the upper level and the lower level of 95% confidential intervals and our method took less time to compute over a broad range of cell size. The effects of parameter change on emerging probabilities of resistance were also investigated by computed values using approximation method. The results showed that the number of divisions until the cell population reached the detection size is important for emerging the probability of resistance. The next step of numerical approach is to compute the emerging probabilities of resistance under drug administration and with multiple mutation. Another effective approximation would be necessary for the analysis of the latter case.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aiyrMkQ6Zrc" width="1" />

<p>by Ivar Grytten, Knut D. Rand, Alexander J. Nederbragt, Geir O. Storvik, Ingrid K. Glad, Geir K. Sandve</p>

Graph-based representations are considered to be the future for reference genomes, as they allow integrated representation of the steadily increasing data on individual variation. Currently available tools allow <i>de novo</i> assembly of graph-based reference genomes, alignment of new read sets to the graph representation as well as certain analyses like variant calling and haplotyping. We here present a first method for calling ChIP-Seq peaks on read data aligned to a graph-based reference genome. The method is a graph generalization of the peak caller MACS2, and is implemented in an open source tool, <i>Graph Peak Caller</i>. By using the existing tool <i>vg</i> to build a pan-genome of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we validate our approach by showing that Graph Peak Caller with a pan-genome reference graph can trace variants within peaks that are not part of the linear reference genome, and find peaks that in general are more motif-enriched than those found by MACS2.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5eBzGrN_ang" width="1" />

Rare variants are of increasing interest to genetic association studies because of their etiological contributions to human complex diseases. Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal. Constructed under a kernel machine framework, POINT performs local association testing by borrowing information from neighboring variants in the 3-dimensional protein space in a data-adaptive fashion. Besides merely providing a list of promising variants, POINT assigns each variant a p-value to permit variant ranking and prioritization. We assess the selection performance of POINT using simulations and illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants in <i>PCSK9, ANGPTL4</i> and <i>CETP</i> in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LIYyATJn8_E" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiologic studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tHcy (n=18), folate (n=3), vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (n=1), and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (n=14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n=16 952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404 630 non‐cases).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13‐1.58, <i>P</i>=6.7×10<sup>‐4</sup>) per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by single‐nucleotide polymorphisms at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> levels were 0.49 (95% 0.34‐0.71, <i>p</i>=1.3×10<sup>‐4</sup>) and 0.70 (95% 0.52‐0.94, <i>p</i>=0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0366-18.2019v1?rss=1">An adenosine A2A receptor antagonist improves multiple symptoms of repeated quinpirole induced psychosis</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the repeated rise of concerns (obsessions) and repetitive unwanted behavior (compulsions). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-choice drug, response rates to SSRI treatment vary between symptom dimensions. In this study, to find a therapeutic target for SSRI-resilient OCD symptoms, we evaluated treatment responses of quinpirole sensitization-induced OCD-related behaviors in mice. SSRI administration rescued the cognitive inflexibility, as well as hyperactivity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), while no improvement was observed for the repetitive behavior. D<sub>2</sub> receptor signaling in the central striatum (CS) was involved in SSRI-resistant repetitive behavior. An adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist, istradefylline, which rescued abnormal excitatory synaptic function in the CS indirect pathway medium spiny neurons of sensitized mice, alleviated both of the QNP-induced abnormal behaviors with only short-term administration. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant OCD symptoms and indicate the potential of A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists as a rapid-acting anti-OCD drug.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Clinical studies show distinct therapeutic efficacies for SSRIs between subtypes of OCD symptoms. While abnormal activity in the cortico-striatal pathway is critically involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, the neurological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant symptoms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that repeated injection of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist, quinpirole elicited two distinct OCD-related behaviors; cognitive inflexibility (SSRI-responsive) and repetitive behavior (SSRI-resistant). While SSRI treatment normalized hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, we also demonstrated the imbalanced excitatory inputs in the central striatum of quinpirole-treated mice and the therapeutic potential of an A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist as a modulator of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs).</p>

<p>Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, together with place, speed and border
cells, are major contributors to the organization of spatial representations in
the brain. In this contribution we introduce a novel theoretical and
algorithmic framework able to explain the emergence of hexagonal grid-like
response patterns from the statistics of the input stimuli. We show that this
pattern is a result of minimal variance encoding of neurons. The novelty lies
into the formulation of the encoding problem through the modern Frame Theory
language, specifically that of equiangular Frames, providing new insights about
the optimality of hexagonal grid receptive fields. The model proposed overcomes
some crucial limitations of the current attractor and oscillatory models. It is
based on the well-accepted and tested hypothesis of Hebbian learning, providing
a simplified cortical-based framework that does not require the presence of
theta velocity-driven oscillations (oscillatory model) or translational
symmetries in the synaptic connections (attractor model). We moreover
demonstrate that the proposed encoding mechanism naturally maps shifts,
rotations and scaling of the stimuli onto the shape of grid cells' receptive
fields, giving a straightforward explanation of the experimental evidence of
grid cells remapping under transformations of environmental cues.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06352">Metabolic basis of brain-like electrical signalling in bacterial communities. (arXiv:1902.06352v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Information processing in the mammalian brain relies on a careful regulation
of the membrane potential dynamics of its constituent neurons, which propagates
across the neuronal tissue via electrical signalling. We recently reported the
existence of electrical signalling in a much simpler organism, the bacterium
Bacillus subtilis. In dense bacterial communities known as biofilms,
nutrient-deprived B. subtilis cells in the interior of the colony use
electrical communication to transmit stress signals to the periphery, which
interfere with the growth of peripheral cells and reduce nutrient consumption,
thereby relieving stress from the interior. Here we explicitly address the
interplay between metabolism and electrophysiology in bacterial biofilms, by
introducing a spatially-extended mathematical model that combines the metabolic
and electrical components of the phenomenon in a discretised reaction-diffusion
scheme. The model is experimentally validated by environmental and genetic
perturbations, and confirms that metabolic stress is transmitted through the
bacterial population via a potassium wave. Interestingly, this behaviour is
reminiscent of cortical spreading depression in the brain, characterised by a
wave of electrical activity mediated by potassium diffusion that has been
linked to various neurological disorders, calling for future studies on the
evolutionary link between the two phenomena.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06250">Afferent Fiber Activity-Induced Cytoplasmic Calcium Signaling in Parvalbumin-Positive Inhibitory Interneurons of the Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn. (arXiv:1902.06250v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Neuronal calcium (Ca2+) signaling represents a molecular trigger for diverse
central nervous system adaptations and maladaptions. The altered function of
dorsal spinal inhibitory interneurons is strongly implicated in the mechanisms
underlying central sensitization in chronic pain. Surprisingly little is known,
however, about the characteristics and consequences of Ca2+ signaling in these
cells, including whether and how they are changed following a peripheral insult
or injury and how such alterations might influence maladaptive pain plasticity.
As a first step towards clarifying the precise role of Ca2+ signaling in dorsal
spinal inhibitory neurons for central sensitization, we established methods for
characterizing Ca2+ signals in genetically defined populations of these cells.
In particular, we employed recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors to
deliver subcellularly targeted, genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators into
parvalbumin-positive spinal inhibitory neurons. Using wide-field microscopy, we
observed both spontaneous and afferent fiber activity triggered Ca2+ signals in
these cells. We propose that these methods may be adapted in future studies for
the precise characterization and manipulation of Ca2+ signaling in diverse
spinal inhibitory neuron subtypes, thereby enabling the clarification of its
role in the mechanisms underlying pain chronicity and opening the door for
possibly novel treatment directions.

<p>When designing experimental studies with human participants, experimenters
must decide how many trials each participant will complete, as well as how many
participants to test. Most discussion of statistical power (the ability of a
study design to detect an effect) has focussed on sample size, and assumed
sufficient trials. Here we explore the influence of both factors on statistical
power, represented as a two-dimensional plot on which iso-power contours can be
visualised. We demonstrate the conditions under which the number of trials is
particularly important, i.e. when the within-participant variance is large
relative to the between-participants variance. We then derive power contour
plots using existing data sets for eight experimental paradigms and
methodologies (including reaction times, sensory thresholds, fMRI, MEG, and
EEG), and provide estimates of the within- and between-participant variance for
each method. In all cases, the within-participant variance was larger than the
between-participants variance, meaning that the number of trials has a
meaningful influence on statistical power in commonly used paradigms. An online
tool is provided (https://shiny.york.ac.uk/powercontours/) for generating power
contours, from which the optimal combination of trials and participants can be
calculated when designing future studies.

Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing proteins in plants and animals mediate intracellular pathogen-sensing. Plant NLRs typically detect strain-specific pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses often linked to localized host cell death. The barley <i>Mla</i> disease resistance locus has undergone extensive functional diversification in the host population and encodes numerous allelic NLRs each detecting a matching isolate-specific avirulence effector (AVR<sub>A</sub>) of the fungal pathogen <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i> (<i>Bgh</i>). We report here the isolation of <i>Bgh</i> <i>AVR<sub>a7</sub></i>, <i>AVR<sub>a9</sub></i>, <i>AVR<sub>a10</sub></i>,<sub> </sub>and <i>AVR<sub>a22</sub></i>, which encode small secreted proteins recognized by allelic MLA7, MLA9, MLA10, and MLA22 receptors, respectively. These effectors are sequence-unrelated, except for allelic <i>AVR<sub>a10 </sub></i>and <i>AVR<sub>a22</sub></i> that are co-maintained in pathogen populations in the form of a balanced polymorphism. Contrary to numerous examples of indirect recognition of bacterial effectors by plant NLRs, co-expression experiments with matching <i>Mla</i>-<i>AVR<sub>a</sub></i> pairs indicate direct detection of the sequence-unrelated fungal effectors by MLA receptors.

The vertebrate eye originates from the eye field, a domain of cells specified by a small number of transcription factors. In this study, we show that Tcf7l1a is one such transcription factor that acts cell-autonomously to specify the eye field in zebrafish. Despite the much-reduced eye field in <i>tcf7l1a</i> mutants, these fish develop normal eyes revealing a striking ability of the eye to recover from a severe early phenotype. This robustness is not mediated through genetic compensation at neural plate stage; instead, the smaller optic vesicle of <i>tcf7l1a</i> mutants shows delayed neurogenesis and continues to grow until it achieves approximately normal size. Although the developing eye is robust to the lack of Tcf7l1a function, it is sensitised to the effects of additional mutations. In support of this, a forward genetic screen identified mutations in <i>hesx1</i>, <i>cct5</i> and <i>gdf6a</i>, which give synthetically enhanced eye specification or growth phenotypes when in combination with the <i>tcf7l1a</i> mutation.

Over a billion people worldwide are affected by vitamin D deficiency. Although vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired cognition, the mechanisms mediating this link are poorly understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has now emerged as an important participant of synaptic plasticity and a new hypothesis is that vitamin D may interact with aggregates of the ECM, perineuronal nets (PNNs), to regulate brain plasticity. Dysregulation of PNNs caused by vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the presentation of cognitive deficits.

From an evolutionary perspective, the genes of enteric microbes transmitted reliably across generations are nearly as much a part of the human organism as our own genes. Disruption of the microbiome leading to extinction of key ‘heirloom’ taxa can deprive individuals of metabolic pathways that have been present in their ancestors for millennia. Some of these pathways support essential synthesis and toxin clearance processes, including the generation of blood–brain barrier-crossing metabolic products crucial for normal brain function.

Myriad cell types comprise the human neocortex, but their roles in normal brain function and disease are largely unknown because few tools exist. To find enhancer elements useful for cell type-specific genetic tools, we examined chromatin accessibility in &gt;2,800 high-quality single human neocortical nuclei. Accessible elements frequently are conserved in mouse (34%), often overlap with hypomethylated sites (27%), and connect cell types with neurological diseases via trait-associated SNPs. Directly testing these elements in viral vectors demonstrates functional enhancer activity with cell type specificity predicted by their chromatin accessibility patterns. In summary we present a catalog of human cell class-specific epigenetic elements, and utilize them for new species-agnostic cell type-specific viral genetic tools, which will illuminate human neuron function and drive gene therapy applications.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are gaining traction as the benchmark model of visual object recognition, with performance now surpassing humans. While CNNs can accurately assign one image to potentially thousands of categories, network performance could be the result of layers that are tuned to represent the visual shape of objects, rather than object category, since both are often confounded in natural images. Using two stimulus sets that explicitly dissociate shape from category, we correlate these two types of information with each layer of multiple CNNs. We also compare CNN output with fMRI activation along the human visual ventral stream by correlating artificial with biological representations. We find that CNNs encode category information independently from shape, peaking at the final fully connected layer in all tested CNN architectures. Comparing CNNs with fMRI brain data, early visual cortex (V1) and early layers of CNNs encode shape information. Anterior ventral temporal cortex encodes category information, which correlates best with the final layer of CNNs. The interaction between shape and category that is found along the human visual ventral pathway is echoed in multiple deep networks. Our results suggest CNNs represent category information independently from shape, much like the human visual system.

Changes in cortical neural activity are coupled to changes in local arterial diameter and blood flow. However, the neuronal types and the signaling mechanisms that control the basal diameter of cerebral arteries or their evoked dilations are not well understood. Using chronic two-photon microscopy, electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and pharmacology in awake, head-fixed mice, we dissected the cellular mechanisms controlling the basal diameter and evoked dilation in cortical arteries. We found that modulation of overall neural activity up or down caused corresponding increases or decreases in basal arterial diameter. Surprisingly, modulation of pyramidal neuron activity had minimal effects on basal or evoked arterial dilation. Instead, the neurally-mediated component of arterial dilation was largely regulated through nitric oxide released by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing neurons, whose activity was not reflected in electrophysiological measures of population activity. Our results show that cortical hemodynamic signals are not controlled by the average activity of the neural population, but rather the activity of a small 'oligarchy' of neurons.

A central goal in visual neuroscience is to understand computational mechanisms and to identify neural structures responsible for integrating local visual features into global representations. When probed with complex stimuli that extend beyond their classical receptive field, neurons display non-linear behaviours indicative of such integration processes already in early stages of visual processing. Recently some progress has been made in explaining these effects from first principles by sparse coding models with a neurophysiologically realistic inference dynamics. They reproduce some of the complex response characteristics observed in primary visual cortex, but only when the context is located near the classical receptive field, since the connection scheme they propose include interactions only among neurons with overlapping input fields. Longer-range interactions required for addressing the plethora of contextual effects reaching beyond this range do not exist. Hence, a satisfactory explanation of contextual phenomena in terms of realistic interactions and dynamics in visual cortex is still missing. Here we propose an extended generative model for visual scenes that includes spatial dependencies among different features. We derive a neurophysiologically realistic inference scheme under the constraint that neurons have direct access to only local image information. The scheme can be interpreted as a network in primary visual cortex where two neural populations are organized in different layers within orientation hypercolumns that are connected by local, short-range and long-range recurrent interactions. When trained with natural images, the model predicts a connectivity structure linking neurons with similar orientation preferences matching the typical patterns found for long-ranging horizontal axons and feedback projections in visual cortex. Subjected to contextual stimuli typically used in empirical studies our model replicates several hallmark effects of contextual processing and predicts characteristic differences for surround modulation between the two model populations. In summary, our model provides a novel framework for contextual processing in the visual system proposing a well-defined functional role for horizontal axons and feedback projections.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/555102v1?rss=1">The Multidimensional Battery of Prosody Perception (MBOPP)</a></h4>

Prosody can be defined as the rhythm and intonation patterns spanning words, phrases and sentences. Accurate perception of prosody is an important component of many aspects of language processing, such as parsing grammatical structures, recognizing words, and determining where emphasis may be placed. Prosody perception is important for language acquisition and can be impaired in language-related developmental disorders. However, existing assessments of prosodic perception suffer from some shortcomings. These include being unsuitable for use with typically developing adults due to ceiling effects, or failing to allow the investigator to distinguish the unique contributions of individual acoustic features such as pitch and temporal cues. Here we present the Multi-Dimensional Battery of Prosody Perception (MBOPP), a novel tool for the assessment of prosody perception. It consists of two subtests -- Linguistic Focus, which measures the ability to hear emphasis or sentential stress, and Phrase Boundaries, which measures the ability to hear where in a compound sentence one phrase ends, and another begins. Perception of individual acoustic dimensions (Pitch and Time) can be examined separately, and test difficulty can be precisely calibrated by the the experimenter because stimuli were created using a continuous voice morph space. We present validation analyses from a sample of 57 individuals and discuss how the battery might be deployed to examine perception of prosody in various populations.

Congenital nystagmus, involuntary oscillating small eye movements, is commonly thought to originate from aberrant interactions between brainstem nuclei and foveal cortical pathways. Here we investigated whether nystagmus associated with congenital stationary nightblindness (CSNB) can result from primary deficits in the retina. We found that CSNB patients as well as an animal model (nob mice), both of which lack functional nyctalopin protein (NYX, nyx) in ON bipolar cells (ON-BC) at their synapse with photoreceptors, showed oscillating eye movements at a frequency of 4-7Hz. nob ON direction selective ganglion cells (ON-DSGC), which detect global motion and project to the accessory optic system (AOS), oscillated with the same frequency as their eyes. In the dark, individual ganglion cells (GC) oscillated asynchronously, but their oscillations became synchronized by light stimulation. Likewise, both patient and nob mice oscillating eye movements were only present in the light. Retinal pharmacological manipulations that blocked nob ON-DSGC oscillations also eliminated their oscillating eye movements, and retinal pharmacological manipulations that reduced oscillation frequency of nob ON-DSGCs also reduced oscillation frequency of their eye movements. We conclude that, in nob mice, oscillations of retinal ON-DSGCs cause nystagmus with properties similar to those associated with CSNB in humans. These results show that the nob mouse is the first animal model for a form of congenital nystagmus paving the way for development of therapeutic strategies.

Information processing in the neocortex is performed by GABAergic interneurons that are integrated with excitatory neurons into precisely structured circuits. To reveal how each neuron type shapes sensory representations, we measured spikes and membrane potential of specific types of neurons in the barrel cortex while mice performed an active, whisker-dependent object localization task. Whiskers were tracked with millisecond precision. Fast-spiking (FS) neurons were activated by touch with short latency and by whisking. FS neurons track thalamic input and provide feedforward inhibition. Somatostatin (SOM)-expressing neurons were also excited by touch, but with a delay (5 ms) compared to excitatory (E) and FS neurons. SOM neurons monitor local excitation and provide feedback inhibition. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons were not driven by touch but elevated their spike rate during whisking, disinhibiting E and FS neurons. Our data reveal rules of recruitment for specific interneuron types, providing foundations for understanding cortical computations.

Human medial parietal cortex (MPC) is implicated in multiple cognitive processes including memory recall, visual scene processing and navigation. It is also considered a core component of the default mode network. Here, we combine fMRI data across three independent experiments to demonstrate distinct subdivisions of MPC that are selectively recruited during memory recall of either specific places or specific people. First, distinct regions of MPC were identified on the basis of differential functional connectivity with medial and lateral regions of anterior ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Second, these same medial regions exhibited differential responses to the visual presentation of different stimulus categories, with clear preferences for scenes and faces, respectively. Third, and most critically, these regions were selectively recruited during either place or people memory recall. These subdivisions also showed a striking relationship with ventral and dorsal divisions of the default mode network. Taken together, these data reveal distinct subdivisions within MPC for the recall of places and people and moreover, suggest that the organizing principle defining the medial-lateral axis of VTC is reflected in MPC, but in the context of memory recall.

Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common cause of dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). A proportion of LRRK2 PD exhibits Lewy pathology with accumulations of -synuclein and ubiquitin in intracellular aggregates that are indistinguishable from idiopathic PD. LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein with both GTPase and kinase activities that has been shown to affect various cellular processes including protein homeostasis, however how PD mutations in LRRK2 may lead to accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates remains unclear. A main cellular pathway to remove aggregated ubiquitinated proteins is aggrephagy: the histone deacetylase HDAC6 recognizes ubiquitinated misfolded proteins and recruits them to the molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein which transports them to the perinuclear region where they are trapped in aggresomes that are subsequently removed by macroautophagy. Here we identified HDAC6 as a novel LRRK2 substrate and show that LRRK2 regulates HDAC6-dependent aggresome formation. LRRK2 directly interacted with the HDAC6 deacetylase domains via its Roc domain and phosphorylated HDAC6 on serine-22. Serine-22 phosphorylation of HDAC6 enhanced its interaction with cytoplasmic dynein and stimulated recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to aggresomes. Knockdown or knockout of LRRK2 impaired HDAC6-mediated aggresome formation. PD mutant LRRK2 G2019S showed reduced interaction with HDAC6 and did not support aggresome formation to the same extend as wild type LRRK2. This was recapitulated in LRRK2 G2019S patient-derived iAstrocytes that showed an aggresome formation defect. In conclusion our data reveal HDAC6 as a target of LRRK2 and suggest that deregulation of HDAC6-mediated aggresome formation and aggrephagy could contribute to the pathology of PD.

Calcium (Ca2+) dysregulation has been linked to neuronal cell death, including in hereditary retinal degeneration. Ca2+ dysregulation is thought to cause rod and cone photoreceptor cell death. Validation of this hypothesis has been hampered so far by spatial and temporal heterogeneities in retinal disease models. Here, we examined the role of Ca2+ in photoreceptor degeneration by assessing the activation pattern of Ca2+-dependent calpain proteases. We generated spatio-temporal maps of the entire retina in the cpfl1 mouse model for primary cone degeneration, as well as for primary rod degeneration in rd1 and rd10 mutant mice. In the latter two models, the spatio-temporal pattern of increased calpain activity matched the progression of primary rod degeneration. High calpain activity coincided with activation of the calpain-2 isoform but not with calpain-1, suggesting differential roles for the two calpain isoforms. Furthermore, primary rod loss was associated with an upregulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), even though only a minute fraction of cells showed activity of the apoptotic marker caspase-3. However, after the conclusion of primary rod degeneration, caspase-3 activation appeared in cones, suggesting apoptosis as the dominant mechanism for secondary cone loss. To distinguish the temporal sequences of degenerative molecular processes from other sources of variability, we used Gaussian process models, which highlighted calpain activity as a key event during primary rod photoreceptor cell death. Taken together, our data suggests a causal link between Ca2+ dysregulation and primary, non-apoptotic degeneration of photoreceptors. On the other hand, it also suggests a role for apoptosis in secondary degeneration of cones. This systematic investigation of retinal degeneration highlights the importance of the spatial and temporal location of key molecular events, and may guide the design of future studies, including the evaluation of new therapies.

Seizures in patients with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) epilepsy cannot be controlled with drugs. For focal MRE, seizures originate in the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which is the minimum amount of cortex that must be treated to be seizure free. Localizing the EZ is often a laborious process wherein clinicians first inspect scalp EEG recordings during several seizure events, and then formulate an implantation plan for subsequent invasive monitoring. The goal of implantation is to place electrodes into the brain region covering the EZ. Then, during invasive monitoring, clinicians visually inspect intracranial EEG recordings to more precisely localize the EZ. The EZ is then surgically removed. Unfortunately surgical success rates average at 50%. Such grim outcomes call for analytical assistance in creating more accurate implantation plans from scalp EEG. In this paper, we introduce a method that combines imaging data (CT and MRI scans) with scalp EEG to derive an implantation distribution. Specifically, scalp EEG data recorded over a seizure event is converted into a time-gamma frequency map, which is then processed to derive a spectrally annotated implantation distribution (SAID). The SAID represents a distribution of gamma power in each of the eight cortical lobe/hemisphere partitions. We applied this method to 4 MRE patients who underwent treatment, and found that the SAID distribution overlapped more with clinical implantations in success cases than in failed cases. These preliminary findings suggest that the SAID may help in improving EZ localization accuracy and surgical outcomes.

Reliable identification of brain cell types is necessary for studying brain cell biology. Many brain cell marker genes have been proposed, but their reliability has not been fully validated. We evaluated 540 commonly-used marker genes of astrocyte, microglia, neuron, and oligodendrocyte with six transcriptome and proteome datasets from purified human and mouse brain cells (n=125). By setting new criteria of cell-specific fold change, we identified 22 gold standard marker genes (GSM) with stable cell-specific expression. Our results call into question the specificity of many proposed marker genes. We used two single-cell transcriptome datasets from human and mouse brains to explore the co-expression of marker genes (n=3337). The mouse co-expression modules were perfectly preserved in human transcriptome, but the reverse was not. Also, we proposed new criteria for identifying marker genes based on both differential expression and co-expression data. We identified 16 novel candidate marker genes (NCM) for mouse and 18 for human independently, which have the potential for use in cell sorting or other tagging techniques. We validated the specificity of GSM and NCM by in-silico deconvolution analysis. Our systematic evaluation provides a list of credible marker genes to facilitate correct cell identification, cell labeling, and cell function studies.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/554576v1?rss=1">Classification of visual cortex plasticity phenotypes following treatment for amblyopia</a></h4>

Monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period (CP) has enduring effects on visual acuity and the functioning of the visual cortex (V1). This experience-dependent plasticity has become a model for studying the mechanisms, especially glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors, that regulate amblyopia. Less is known, however, about treatment-induced changes to those receptors and if those changes differentiate among treatments that support good recovery of acuity versus persistent acuity deficits. Here we studied the effects of 3 treatments for MD started during the CP (n=24, 10 male and 14 female). Two treatments (reverse occlusion -- RO, binocular deprivation -- BD) resulted in poor acuity, but one treatment (binocular vision --BV) promoted good acuity. We classified plasticity phenotypes using the expression of a collection of glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor subunits in V1. Analyzing individual proteins showed an intricate pattern of changes, but principal component analysis identified features that we used to construct the plasticity phenotypes and classify treatments into clusters suggesting adaptive versus maladaptive plasticity. The RO plasticity phenotype was similar to an adult pattern with high expression of GluA2, while the BD phenotypes were dominated by GABAA1, highlighting that multiple plasticity phenotypes can underlie persistent acuity deficits. In contrast, BV for 2-4 days promoted recovery of a phenotype resembling CP plasticity, but only one feature, the GluN2A:GluA2 balance, returned to normal levels. This suggests that balancing homeostatic and Hebbian mechanisms is needed for good visual recovery. These findings and the plasticity phenotyping approach may be useful for classifying different forms of persistent amblyopia and identifying new treatment targets.

New techniques for quantifying large numbers of proteins or genes are transforming the study of plasticity mechanisms in visual cortex (V1) into the era of big data. With those changes comes the challenge of applying new analytical methods designed for high-dimensional data. Studies of V1, however, can take advantage of the known functions that many proteins have in regulating experience-dependent plasticity to facilitate linking big data analyses with neurobiological functions. Here we discuss two workflows and provide example R code for analyzing high-dimensional changes in a group of proteins (or genes) using two data sets. The first data set includes 7 neural proteins, 9 visual conditions, and 3 regions in V1 from an animal model for amblyopia. The second data set includes 23 neural proteins and 31 ages (20d-80yrs) from human post-mortem samples of V1. Each data set presents different challenges and we describe using PCA, tSNE, and various clustering algorithms including sparse high-dimensional clustering. Also, we describe a new approach for identifying high-dimensional features and using them to construct a plasticity phenotype that identifies neurobiological differences among clusters. We include an R package v1hdexplorer that aggregates the various coding packages and custom visualization scripts written in R Studio.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/554360v1?rss=1">A novel population of long-range inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

The hippocampus, a brain region important for spatial navigation and episodic memory, benefits from a rich diversity of neuronal cell-types. Recent work suggests fundamental gaps in our knowledge of these basic building blocks (i.e., neuronal types) in the hippocampal circuit, despite extensive prior examination. Through the use of an intersectional genetic viral vector approach, we report a novel hippocampal neuronal population, which has not previously been characterized, and which we refer to as LINCs. LINCs are GABAergic, but, in addition to broadly targeting local CA1 cells, also have long-range axons. LINCs are thus both interneurons and projection neurons. We demonstrate that LINCs, despite being relatively few in number, can have a strong influence on both hippocampal and extrahippocampal network synchrony and function. Identification and characterization of this novel cell population advances our basic understanding of both hippocampal circuitry and neuronal diversity.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25428?af=R">The blood pressure paradox in acute ischemic stroke</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the association of poststroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0–1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time &gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time &gt;3 seconds/delay time &gt;6 seconds).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10 mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion, and active blood pressure–lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R">Functional deficiency in endogenous interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist in patients with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and CSF. The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. <i>IL1RN</i> gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n=7) relative to healthy controls (n=10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in three FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of <i>IL1RN</i> in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25438?af=R">SCN1A gain‐of‐function in early infantile encephalopathy</a></h4>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense <i>SCN1A</i> variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype‐phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early‐infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than the typical <i>SCN1A</i> Dravet syndrome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive active potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neuron. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and also showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>From a biophysical perspective the T226M mutation produces gain‐of‐function. Somewhat paradoxically our data suggest that this gain‐of‐function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05915">Disruption of the prefrontal cortex improves implicit contextual memory-guided attention: combined behavioural and electrophysiological evidence. (arXiv:1902.05915v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Many studies have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays
an important role in top-down cognitive control over intentional and deliberate
behavior. However, recent studies have reported that DLPFC-mediated top-down
control interferes with implicit forms of learning. Here we used continuous
theta burst stimulation (cTBS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to
investigate the causal role of DLPFC in implicit contextual memory-guided
attention. We aimed to test whether transient disruption of the DLPFC would
interfere with implicit learning performance and related electrical brain
activity. We applied neuronavigation-guided cTBS to the DLPFC or to the vertex
as a control region prior to the performance of an implicit contextual learning
task. We found that cTBS applied over the DLPFC significantly improved
performance during implicit contextual learning. We also noted that beta-band
(13-19 Hz) oscillatory power was reduced at fronto-central channels about 140
to 370 ms after visual stimulus onset in cTBS DLPFC compared with cTBS vertex.
Taken together, our results provide evidence that DLPFC-mediated top-down
control interferes with contextual memory-guided attention and beta-band
oscillatory activity.

<p>Pain is a multidimensional process, which can be modulated by emotions,
however, the mechanisms underlying this modulation are unknown. We used
pictures with different emotional valence (negative, positive, neutral) as
primes and applied electrical painful stimuli as targets to healthy
participants. We assessed pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings and
recorded electroencephalograms (EEG). We found that pain unpleasantness, and
not pain intensity ratings were modulated by emotion, with increased ratings
for negative and decreased for positive pictures. We also found two consecutive
gamma band oscillations (GBOs) related to pain processing from time frequency
analyses of the EEG signals. An early GBO had a cortical distribution
contralateral to the painful stimulus, and its amplitude was positively
correlated with intensity and unpleasantness ratings, but not with prime
valence. The late GBO had a centroparietal distribution and its amplitude was
larger for negative compared to neutral and positive pictures. The emotional
modulation effect (negative versus positive) of the late GBO amplitude was
positively correlated with pain unpleasantness. The early GBO might reflect the
overall pain perception, possibly involving the thalamocortical circuit, while
the late GBO might be related to the affective dimension of pain and top-down
related processes.

<p>This paper proposes a prototype of a new biofeedback training based on
mathematical models of cardiovascular control. For this purpose we develop a
low-cost device that is able to record and process arterial pulse wave via
photoplethysmograph and skin temperature on the peripheral part of the arm. A
benchmark analysis of our device against a registered cardiovascular
measurement system (Biopac MP35 from Biopac Inc., USA) shows that heart rate
and skin temperature values delivered by our device are acceptable with a very
low residual error (+/-1 beat/min, +/-1 oC).
</p>
<p>Both measured signals are feed into a mathematical model which estimates the
level of activity of both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the
autonomic nervous system. That information is used jointly with other
biological parameters for investigating the stress score of the subject. The
data is processed in real-time and continuously displayed to the user for
effective biofeedback training.
</p>
<p>The complete solution was preliminary tested on three volunteers who used the
displayed biofeedback information in order to regulate their emotional state
successfully during Biofeedback training. They exhibited a significant
reduction in stress score compared to three control subjects who did not used
our solution during biofeedback training. This supports the benefits of
biofeedback training with autonomic nervous tone assessment as effective
holistic healing method.

<p>Sleep stages classification is a crucial task in the context of sleep
studies. It involves the simultaneous analysis of multiple signals recorded
during sleep. However, it is complex and tedious, and even the trained expert
can spend several hours scoring a single night recording. Multiple automatic
methods have tried to solve these problems in the past, most of them by
classifying a feature vector that is engineered for a specific dataset. In this
work, we avoid this bias using a deep learning model that learns relevant
features without human intervention. Particularly, we propose an ensemble of 5
convolutional networks that achieves a kappa index of 0.83 when classifying a
dataset of 500 sleep recordings.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05568">Tractography and machine learning: Current state and open challenges. (arXiv:1902.05568v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms have recently been proposed as an
alternative to traditional tractography methods in order to address some of
their weaknesses. They can be path-based and local-model-free, and easily
incorporate anatomical priors to make contextual and non-local decisions that
should help the tracking process. ML-based techniques have thus shown promising
reconstructions of larger spatial extent of existing white matter bundles,
promising reconstructions of less false positives, and promising robustness to
known position and shape biases of current tractography techniques. But as of
today, none of these ML-based methods have shown conclusive performances or
have been adopted as a de facto solution to tractography. One reason for this
might be the lack of well-defined and extensive frameworks to train, evaluate,
and compare these methods.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we describe several datasets and evaluation tools that contain
useful features for ML algorithms, along with the various methods proposed in
the recent years. We then discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate and
compare those methods, as well as their shortcomings. Finally, we describe the
particular needs of ML tractography methods and discuss tangible solutions for
future works.

Hypoosmotic conditions activate volume-regulated anion channels in vertebrate cells. These channels are formed by leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8 (LRRC8) family members and contain LRRC8A in homo- or hetero-hexameric assemblies. Here we present single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of <i>Mus musculus</i> LRRC8A in complex with the inhibitor DCPIB reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. DCPIB plugs the channel like a cork in a bottle - binding in the extracellular selectivity filter and sterically occluding ion conduction. Constricted and expanded structures reveal coupled dilation of cytoplasmic LRRs and the channel pore, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by internal stimuli. Conformational and symmetry differences between LRRC8A structures determined in detergent micelles and lipid bilayers related to reorganization of intersubunit lipid binding sites demonstrate a critical role for the membrane in determining channel structure. These results provide insight into LRRC8 gating and inhibition and the role of lipids in the structure of an ionic-strength sensing ion channel.

Mitochondria play important roles in cellular processes and disease, yet little is known about how the transcriptional regime of the mitochondrial genome varies across individuals and tissues. By analyzing &gt;11,000 RNA-sequencing libraries across 36 tissue/cell types, we find considerable variation in mitochondrial-encoded gene expression along the mitochondrial transcriptome, across tissues and between individuals, highlighting the importance of cell-type specific and post-transcriptional processes in shaping mitochondrial-encoded RNA levels. Using whole-genome genetic data we identify 64 nuclear loci associated with expression levels of 14 genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome, including missense variants within genes involved in mitochondrial function (<i>TBRG4</i>, <i>MTPAP</i> and <i>LONP1</i>), implicating genetic mechanisms that act in <i>trans</i> across the two genomes. We replicate ~21% of associations with independent tissue-matched datasets and find genetic variants linked to these nuclear loci that are associated with cardio-metabolic phenotypes and Vitiligo, supporting a potential role for variable mitochondrial-encoded gene expression in complex disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40472">Mechanics and dynamics of translocating MreB filaments on curved membranes</a></h4>

MreB is an actin homolog that is essential for coordinating the cell wall synthesis required for the rod shape of many bacteria. Previously we have shown that filaments of MreB bind to the curved membranes of bacteria and translocate in directions determined by principal membrane curvatures to create and reinforce the rod shape (Hussain et al., 2018). Here, in order to understand how MreB filament dynamics affects their cellular distribution, we model how MreB filaments bind and translocate on membranes with different geometries. We find that it is both energetically favorable and robust for filaments to bind and orient along directions of largest membrane curvature. Furthermore, significant localization to different membrane regions results from processive MreB motion in various geometries. These results demonstrate that the <i>in vivo</i> localization of MreB observed in many different experiments, including those examining negative Gaussian curvature, can arise from translocation dynamics alone.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39598">Mitochondrial biogenesis is transcriptionally repressed in lysosomal lipid storage diseases</a></h4>

Perturbations in mitochondrial function and homeostasis are pervasive in lysosomal storage diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report a transcriptional program that represses mitochondrial biogenesis and function in lysosomal storage diseases Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASM), in patient cells and mouse tissues. This mechanism is mediated by the transcription factors KLF2 and ETV1, which are both induced in NPC and ASM patient cells. Mitochondrial biogenesis and function defects in these cells are rescued by the silencing of KLF2 or ETV1. Increased ETV1 expression is regulated by KLF2, while the increase of KLF2 protein levels in NPC and ASM stems from impaired signaling downstream sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), which normally represses KLF2. In patient cells, S1PR1 is barely detectable at the plasma membrane and thus unable to repress KLF2. This manuscript provides a mechanistic pathway for the prevalent mitochondrial defects in lysosomal storage diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38485">Generation of the squamous epithelial roof of the 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle</a></h4>

We use the transparency of zebrafish embryos to reveal the <i>de novo</i> generation of a simple squamous epithelium and identify the cellular architecture in the epithelial transition zone that ties this squamous epithelium to the columnar neuroepithelium within the embryo's brain. The simple squamous epithelium of the rhombencephalic roof plate is pioneered by distinct mesenchymal cells at the dorsal midline of the neural tube. Subsequently, a progenitor zone is established at the interface between columnar epithelium of the rhombic lip and the expanding squamous epithelium of the roof plate. Surprisingly, this interface consists of a single progenitor cell type that we have named the veil cell. Veil cells express <i>gdf6a</i> and constitute a lineage restricted stem zone that generates the squamous roof plate by direct transformation and asymmetrically fated divisions. Experimental restriction of roof plate expansion leads to extrusion of veil cell daughters and squamous cells, suggesting veil cell fate is regulated by the space available for roof plate growth.

Adler et al. reveal mechanisms underlying learning-dependent sequential activation of pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex. SST-expressing interneurons and CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity control the establishment of sequential activity during motor training and prevent the interference from new learning.

<p>by Ardi Tampuu, Tambet Matiisen, H. Freyja Ólafsdóttir, Caswell Barry, Raul Vicente</p>

Place cells in the mammalian hippocampus signal self-location with sparse spatially stable firing fields. Based on observation of place cell activity it is possible to accurately decode an animal’s location. The precision of this decoding sets a lower bound for the amount of information that the hippocampal population conveys about the location of the animal. In this work we use a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder to infer the location of freely moving rats from single unit hippocampal recordings. RNNs are biologically plausible models of neural circuits that learn to incorporate relevant temporal context without the need to make complicated assumptions about the use of prior information to predict the current state. When decoding animal position from spike counts in 1D and 2D-environments, we show that the RNN consistently outperforms a standard Bayesian approach with either flat priors or with memory. In addition, we also conducted a set of sensitivity analysis on the RNN decoder to determine which neurons and sections of firing fields were the most influential. We found that the application of RNNs to neural data allowed flexible integration of temporal context, yielding improved accuracy relative to the more commonly used Bayesian approaches and opens new avenues for exploration of the neural code.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lLRmD88blGo" width="1" />

<p>by Nico M. Franz, Lukas J. Musher, Joseph W. Brown, Shizhuo Yu, Bertram Ludäscher</p>

Phylogenomic research is accelerating the publication of landmark studies that aim to resolve deep divergences of major organismal groups. Meanwhile, systems for identifying and integrating the products of phylogenomic inference–such as newly supported clade concepts–have not kept pace. However, the ability to <i>verbalize</i> node concept congruence and conflict across multiple, in effect simultaneously endorsed phylogenomic hypotheses, is a prerequisite for building synthetic data environments for biological systematics and other domains impacted by these conflicting inferences. Here we develop a novel solution to the conflict verbalization challenge, based on a logic representation and reasoning approach that utilizes the language of Region Connection Calculus (RCC–5) to produce consistent <i>alignments</i> of node concepts endorsed by incongruent phylogenomic studies. The approach employs clade concept labels to individuate concepts used by each source, even if these carry identical names. Indirect RCC–5 modeling of <i>intensional</i> (property-based) node concept definitions, facilitated by the local relaxation of coverage constraints, allows parent concepts to attain congruence in spite of their differentially sampled children. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we align two recent phylogenomic reconstructions of higher-level avian groups that entail strong conflict in the "neoavian explosion" region. According to our representations, this conflict is constituted by 26 instances of input "whole concept" overlap. These instances are further resolvable in the output labeling schemes and visualizations as "split concepts", which provide the labels and relations needed to build truly synthetic phylogenomic data environments. Because the RCC–5 alignments fundamentally reflect the trained, logic-enabled judgments of systematic experts, future designs for such environments need to promote a culture where experts routinely assess the intensionalities of node concepts published by our peers–even and especially when we are not in agreement with each other.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UeKsJptfnwM" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Large-scale slow oscillations allow the integration of neuronal activity across brain regions during sensory or cognitive processing. However, evidence that this form of coding also holds for pathological networks, such as for distributed networks in epileptic disorders, does not yet exist. Here, we show in a mouse model of unilateral hippocampal epilepsy that epileptic fast ripples generated in the neocortex distant from the primary focus occur during transient trains of interictal epileptic discharges. During these epileptic paroxysms, local phase-locking of neuronal firing and a phase–amplitude coupling of the epileptic discharges over a slow oscillation at 3–5 Hz are detected. Furthermore, the buildup of the slow oscillation begins in the bihippocampal network that includes the focus, which synchronizes and drives the activity across the large-scale epileptic network into the frontal cortex. This study provides the first functional description of the emergence of neocortical fast ripples in hippocampal epilepsy and shows that cross-frequency coupling might be a fundamental mechanism underlying the spreading of epileptic activity.</p>

Abstract
<p>Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative visual word form area (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, HouseFont, in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called parahippocampal place area (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest (ROIs), the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre-training versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre-training to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.</p>

Abstract
<p>The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, <i>Ambystoma tigrinum</i>, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> or from exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO<sub>2</sub> was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.</p>

<p>Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species-dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. Although we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types are statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X<sub>c</sub><sup>–</sup> cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0007-19.2019?rss=1">Synaptic Organization of VGLUT3 Expressing Low-Threshold Mechanosensitive C Fiber Terminals in the Rodent Spinal Cord</a></h4>

<p>Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here, we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMRs formed central terminals of Type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C (PKC) interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R)-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of Type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in Type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.</p>

<p>Dopamine, a neurotransmitter well known for regulating movement, reward, and
learning, is emerging as one of the neuromodulators of wakefulness. Drugs that
increase the level of dopamine in the brain (including, but not limited to,
nicotine) also increase feelings of wakefulness. Diseases that are
characterized by low dopamine levels, like Parkinson's disease, also are
related to sleep disorders.
</p>
<p>In this work we investigate the influence that nicotine and alcohol exert on
sleep, modeling the coupling of reward and thalamocortical circuits in a
reward-attention circuit. Computer simulations of the circuit reflect the
spiking behavior of neurons in the network under the presence or absence of
nicotine or alcohol.
</p>
<p>Each neuron in the reward-attention model represents a population of cells in
the circuit, and is described by a coupled system of nonlinear differential
equations that replicates essential neurophysiological properties of the
population. The computational simulations highlight aspects of clinical
insomnia symptoms in Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and autism spectrum disorder.
</p>
<p>Our results imply that nicotine can disrupt sleep, promoting wakefulness. In
contrast, alcohol increases sleep latency (time to fall asleep). Also, the
simulations suggest that alcohol has a sedative effect in people with insomnia.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43284">Arabidopsis RCD1 coordinates chloroplast and mitochondrial functions through interaction with ANAC transcription factors</a></h4>

Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling pathways from chloroplasts and mitochondria merge at the nuclear protein RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1). RCD1 interacts <i>in vivo</i> and suppresses the activity of the transcription factors ANAC013 and ANAC017, which mediate a ROS-related retrograde signal originating from mitochondrial complex III. Inactivation of <i>RCD1</i> leads to increased expression of mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes regulated by ANAC013 and ANAC017. Accumulating MDS gene products, including alternative oxidases (AOXs), affect redox status of the chloroplasts, leading to changes in chloroplast ROS processing and increased protection of photosynthetic apparatus. ROS alter the abundance, thiol redox state and oligomerization of the RCD1 protein <i>in vivo</i>, providing feedback control on its function. RCD1-dependent regulation is linked to chloroplast signaling by 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). Thus, RCD1 integrates organellar signaling from chloroplasts and mitochondria to establish transcriptional control over the metabolic processes in both organelles.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41873">A Y-chromosome shredding gene drive for controlling pest vertebrate populations</a></h4>

Self-replicating gene drives that modify sex ratios or infer a fitness cost could be used to control populations of invasive alien species. The targeted deletion of Y sex chromosomes using CRISPR technology offers a new approach for sex bias that could be incorporated within gene-drive designs. We introduce a novel gene-drive strategy termed Y-CHromosome deletion using Orthogonal Programmable Endonucleases (Y-CHOPE), incorporating a programmable endonuclease that 'shreds' the Y chromosome, thereby converting XY males into fertile XO females. Firstly, we demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas12a system can eliminate the Y chromosome in embryonic stem cells with high efficiency (<i>c</i>. 90 %). Next, using stochastic, individual-based models of a pest mouse population, we show that a Y-shredding drive that progressively depletes the pool of XY males could effect population eradication through mate limitation. Our molecular and modelling data suggest that a Y-CHOPE gene drive could be a viable tool for vertebrate pest control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41556">Combined transcriptome and proteome profiling reveals specific molecular brain signatures for sex, maturation and circalunar clock phase</a></h4>

Many marine animals, ranging from corals to fishes, synchronise reproduction to lunar cycles. In the annelid <i>Platynereis dumerilii,</i> this timing is orchestrated by an endogenous monthly (circalunar) clock entrained by moonlight. Whereas daily (circadian) clocks cause extensive transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the quality and quantity of regulations by circalunar clocks have remained largely elusive. By establishing a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach, we provide first systematic insight into the molecular changes in <i>Platynereis</i> heads between circalunar phases, and across sexual differentiation and maturation. Whereas maturation elicits large transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the circalunar clock exhibits only minor transcriptomic, but strong proteomic regulation. Our study provides a versatile extraction technique and comprehensive resources. It corroborates that circadian and circalunar clock effects are likely distinct and identifies key molecular brain signatures for reproduction, sex and circalunar clock phase. Examples include prepro-whitnin/proctolin and ependymin-related proteins as circalunar clock targets.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38065">A multicellular rosette-mediated collective dendrite extension</a></h4>

Coordination of neurite morphogenesis with surrounding tissues is crucial to the establishment of neural circuits, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that neurons in a <i>C. elegans </i>sensory organ, called the amphid, undergo a collective dendrite extension to form the sensory nerve. The amphid neurons first assemble into a multicellular rosette. The vertex of the rosette, which becomes the dendrite tips, is attached to the anteriorly migrating epidermis and carried to the sensory depression, extruding the dendrites away from the neuronal cell bodies. Multiple adhesion molecules including DYF-7, SAX-7, HMR-1 and DLG-1 function redundantly in rosette-to-epidermis attachment. PAR-6 is localized to the rosette vertex and dendrite tips, and promotes DYF-7 localization and dendrite extension. Our results suggest a collective mechanism of neurite extension that is distinct from the classical pioneer-follower model and highlight the role of mechanical cues from surrounding tissues in shaping neurites.

<p>by Brandon Monier, Adam McDermaid, Cankun Wang, Jing Zhao, Allison Miller, Anne Fennell, Qin Ma</p>

Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale Omics data, providing unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. Specifically, the value of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has been confirmed in inferring how gene regulatory systems will respond under various conditions (bulk data) or cell types (single-cell data). RNA-Seq can generate genome-scale gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, integration and interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a Shiny web server for expression data analysis. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses on user-provided RNA-Seq or Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Specifically, three commonly used R packages (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Seven discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, IRIS-EDA provides a framework to expedite submission of data and results to NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Data Principles.

<p>by Giuseppe Passucci, Megan E. Brasch, James H. Henderson, Vasily Zaburdaev, M. Lisa Manning</p>

We seek to characterize the motility of mouse fibroblasts on 2D substrates. Utilizing automated tracking techniques, we find that cell trajectories are super-diffusive, where displacements scale faster than <i>t</i><sup>1/2</sup> in all directions. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such statistics in other cell types: run and tumble behavior with Lévy-distributed run times, and ensembles of cells with heterogeneous speed and rotational noise. We develop an automated toolkit that directly compares cell trajectories to the predictions of each model and demonstrate that ensemble-averaged quantities such as the mean-squared displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions are equally well-fit by either model. However, neither model correctly captures the short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability distribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that includes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs, which correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the run times are not Lévy distributed. The analysis tools developed here should be broadly useful for distinguishing between mechanisms for superdiffusivity in other cells types and environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KIPDgR1gWNs" width="1" />

The dynamic nature of technological developments invites us to rethink the learning spaces. In this context, science education can be enriched by the contribution of new computational resources, making the educational process more up-to-date, challenging, and attractive. Bioinformatics is a key interdisciplinary field, contributing to the understanding of biological processes that is often underrated in secondary schools. As a useful resource in learning activities, bioinformatics could help in engaging students to integrate multiple fields of knowledge (logical-mathematical, biological, computational, etc.) and generate an enriched and long-lasting learning environment. Here, we report our recent project in which high school students learned basic concepts of programming applied to solving biological problems. The students were taught the Python syntax, and they coded simple tools to answer biological questions using resources at hand. Notably, these were built mostly on the students’ own smartphones, which proved to be capable, readily available, and relevant complementary tools for teaching. This project resulted in an empowering and inclusive experience that challenged differences in social background and technological accessibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DU--q7uExMA" width="1" />

In this review, we summarize progress on the understanding of the dopamine release apparatus and evaluate how its properties may shape dopamine signaling during firing. We discuss how mechanisms of regulation may act through this machinery and propose that striatal architecture for dopamine signaling may have evolved to support rapid dopamine coding.</p></div>

Abstract
<p>Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release were investigated in this study. Using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested whether the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed that neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.</p>

Abstract<p>Increased expression of the <i>FK506-binding protein 5</i> (<i>FKBP5)</i> gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in <i>FKBP5</i> remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress <i>FKBP5,</i> which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA receptor. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor <i>FKBP5</i>.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Candidate studies have identified a link between <i>FKBP5</i> allelic variants and psychiatric disorders. Patients with these disorders often present with cognitive defects. <i>FKBP5</i> variants have been correlated to decreased hippocampal volume, but a direct connection between <i>FKBP5</i> and cognitive function has not been established. Here, we have found that mice with high levels of <i>FKBP5</i> have altered reversal learning and memory, which may be through direct regulation of neuronal activity by regulating AMPA receptors.</p>

<p>In recent years artificial neural networks achieved performance close to or
better than humans in several domains: tasks that were previously human
prerogatives, such as language processing, have witnessed remarkable
improvements in state of the art models. One advantage of this technological
boost is to facilitate comparison between different neural networks and human
performance, in order to deepen our understanding of human cognition. Here, we
investigate which neural network architecture (feed-forward vs. recurrent)
matches human behavior in artificial grammar learning, a crucial aspect of
language acquisition. Prior experimental studies proved that artificial
grammars can be learnt by human subjects after little exposure and often
without explicit knowledge of the underlying rules. We tested four grammars
with different complexity levels both in humans and in feedforward and
recurrent networks. Our results show that both architectures can 'learn' (via
error back-propagation) the grammars after the same number of training
sequences as humans do, but recurrent networks perform closer to humans than
feedforward ones, irrespective of the grammar complexity level. Moreover,
similar to visual processing, in which feedforward and recurrent architectures
have been related to unconscious and conscious processes, our results suggest
that explicit learning is best modeled by recurrent architectures, whereas
feedforward networks better capture the dynamics involved in implicit learning.

<p>Originally inspired by neurobiology, deep neural network models have become a
powerful tool of machine learning and artificial intelligence, where they are
used to approximate functions and dynamics by learning from examples. Here we
give a brief introduction to neural network models and deep learning for

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44239">The structure of the Ctf19c/CCAN from budding yeast</a></h4>

Eukaryotic kinetochores connect spindle microtubules to chromosomal centromeres. A group of proteins called the Ctf19 complex (Ctf19c) in yeast and the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) in other organisms creates the foundation of a kinetochore. The Ctf19c/CCAN influences the timing of kinetochore assembly, sets its location by associating with a specialized nucleosome containing the histone H3 variant Cse4/CENP-A, and determines the organization of the microtubule attachment apparatus. We present here the structure of a reconstituted 13-subunit Ctf19c determined by cryo-electron microscopy at ~4 Å resolution. The structure accounts for known and inferred contacts with the Cse4 nucleosome and for an observed assembly hierarchy. We describe its implications for establishment of kinetochores and for their regulation by kinases throughout the cell cycle.

A well-established notion in cognitive neuroscience proposes that multiple brain systems contribute to choice behaviour. These include: (1) a model-free system that uses values cached from the outcome history of alternative actions, and (2) a model-based system that considers action outcomes and the transition structure of the environment. The widespread use of this distinction, across a range of applications, renders it important to index their distinct influences with high reliability. Here we consider the two-stage task, widely considered as a gold standard measure for the contribution of model-based and model-free systems to human choice. We tested the internal/temporal stability of measures from this task, including those estimated via an established computational model, as well as an extended model using drift-diffusion. Drift-diffusion modeling suggested that both choice in the first stage, and RTs in the second stage, are directly affected by a model-based/free trade-off parameter. Both parameter recovery and the stability of model-based estimates were poor but improved substantially when both choice and RT were used (compared to choice only), and when more trials (than conventionally used in research practice) were included in our analysis. The findings have implications for interpretation of past and future studies based on the use of the two-stage task, as well as for characterising the contribution of model-based processes to choice behaviour.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/86pzuygctls" width="1" />

<p>by Yangchun Frank Chen, Yu Xia</p>

An important goal of systems medicine is to study disease in the context of genetic and environmental perturbations to the human interactome network. For diseases with both genetic and infectious contributors, a key postulate is that similar perturbations of the human interactome by either disease mutations or pathogens can have similar disease consequences. This postulate has so far only been tested for a few viral species at the level of whole proteins. Here, we expand the scope of viral species examined, and test this postulate more rigorously at the higher resolution of protein domains. Focusing on diseases with both genetic and viral contributors, we found significant convergent perturbation of the human domain-resolved interactome by endogenous genetic mutations and exogenous viral proteins inducing similar disease phenotypes. Pan-cancer, pan-oncovirus analysis further revealed that domains of human oncoproteins either physically targeted or structurally mimicked by oncoviruses are enriched for cancer driver rather than passenger mutations, suggesting convergent targeting of cancer driver pathways by diverse oncoviruses. Our study provides a framework for high-resolution, network-based comparison of various disease factors, both genetic and environmental, in terms of their impacts on the human interactome.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SPabstvBCoc" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>LRRK2</i> mutations, the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) display incomplete penetrance, indicating the importance of other genetic and environmental influences on disease pathogenesis in <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. The present study investigates whether urate, an antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, and inverse risk factor for idiopathic PD, is one such candidate biomarker of PD risk modulation in pathogenic <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Banked plasma samples or urate levels were obtained for three cohorts of age‐ and sex‐matched subjects with and without a known <i>LRRK2</i> mutation in PD and unaffected controls to conduct a pilot study of 192 subjects from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC) and two validation studies of 380 additional subjects from the LCC and of 922 subjects from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative. Urate levels were compared by multiple regression between subjects with and without a PD diagnosis conditional on <i>LRRK2</i> status, controlling for age and sex.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Non‐manifesting <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of urate than those who developed PD in each of the three independent cohorts. A meta‐analysis demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 0.62 mg/dL (p&lt;0.001), with similar results for separate assessments of women (p&lt;0.02) and men (p&lt;0.001). A 2 mg/dL increment in urate concentration decreased the odds of having PD by more than 50% (OR = 0.48; p = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings identify and substantiate urate as a biomarker of resistance to PD among <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 MS patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of PML during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab‐treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab‐treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab‐treated patients NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML.</p>

<p><b>Significance statement</b> Motor and reinforcement learning have been classically linked to functionally independent brain networks centered on the cerebellum and the basal ganglia respectively. In a recent study published in <i>eNeuro,</i> Therrien et al. (2018) showed that increasing motor noise in healthy subjects disrupts reinforcement learning. However, this impairment remained well below that detected in cerebellar patients even when motor noise in healthy subjects was adjusted to match that observed in the patients. This suggests that impaired reinforcement learning following cerebellar damage cannot be solely accounted for by altered motor noise in these patients. Based on recent anatomical and functional evidence, we argue that the cerebellum may directly contribute to reinforcement learning, consistent with its tight connections with the basal ganglia.</p>

Abstract<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to striatal dopamine depletion. A partial unilateral striatal 6-OHDA lesion causes 40 – 60% dopamine depletion in the lesioned rat striatum, modeling the early stage of PD. In this study, we explored the connectivity between the brain regions in partially 6-OHDA lesioned male Wistar rats under urethane anesthesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 5 weeks after the 6-OHDA infusion. Under urethane anesthesia, the brain fluctuates between the two states, resembling rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep states. We observed clear urethane-induced sleep-like states in 8/19 lesioned animals and 8/18 control animals. 6-OHDA lesioned animals exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity between the brain regions. However, we observed these differences only during the REM-like sleep state, suggesting the involvement of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in REM sleep regulation. Corticocortical and corticostriatal connections were decreased in both hemispheres, reflecting the global effect of the lesion. Overall, this study describes a promising model to study PD-related sleep disorders in rats using fMRI.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Disturbances in sleep patterns and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder are among the first symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, PD-related sleep disorders have been virtually unexplored in animal models. This is a first study which has examined the functional connectivity (FC) during urethane-induced sleep-like states in the partial striatal 6-OHDA lesion rat model of early-stage PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that FC is significantly decreased in 6-OHDA lesioned animals, but only during the REM-like state. These changes affected both the lesioned and intact hemispheres, mostly involving corticocortical and corticostriatal connections. The results suggest that this rat model is a promising tool for studying sleep disturbances in early-stage Parkinson’s disease with resting-state fMRI.</p>

<p>Individuals with sleep apnea often exhibit changes in cognitive behaviors consistent with alterations in the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is an ongoing process that maintains normal hippocampal function in many mammalian species, including humans. However, the impact of chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a principal consequence of sleep apnea, on hippocampal adult neurogenesis remains unclear. Using a murine model, we examined the impact of 30 d of IH (IH<sub>30</sub>) on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Although IH<sub>30</sub> did not affect paired-pulse facilitation, IH<sub>30</sub> suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP). Immunohistochemical experiments also indicate that IH perturbs multiple aspects of adult neurogenesis. IH<sub>30</sub> increased the number of proliferating Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells in the subgranular zone yet reduced the number of doublecortin-positive neurons. Consistent with these findings, cell lineage tracing revealed that IH<sub>30</sub> increased the proportion of radial glial cells in the subgranular zone, yet decreased the proportion of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus. While administration of a superoxide anion scavenger during IH did not prevent neural progenitor cell proliferation, it mitigated the IH-dependent suppression of LTP and prevented adult-born neuron loss. These data demonstrate that IH causes both reactive oxygen species-dependent and reactive oxygen species-independent effects on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Our findings identify cellular and neurophysiological changes in the hippocampus that may contribute to cognitive and behavioral deficits occurring in sleep apnea.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Individuals with sleep apnea experience periods of intermittent hypoxia (IH) that can negatively impact many aspects of brain function. Neurons are continually generated throughout adulthood to support hippocampal physiology and behavior. This study demonstrates that IH exposure attenuates hippocampal long-term potentiation and reduces adult neurogenesis. Antioxidant treatment mitigates these effects indicating that oxidative signaling caused by IH is a significant factor that impairs synaptic plasticity and reduces adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1301?rss=1">Dissociable Disruptions in Thalamic and Hippocampal Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Youth with 22q11.2 Deletions</a></h4>

<p>The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a recurrent copy number variant with high penetrance for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Study of individuals with 22q11DS therefore may offer key insights into neural mechanisms underlying such complex illnesses. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI studies in idiopathic schizophrenia have consistently revealed disruption of thalamic and hippocampal circuitry. Here, we sought to test whether this circuitry is similarly disrupted in the context of this genetic high-risk condition. To this end, resting-state functional connectivity patterns were assessed in a sample of human youth with 22q11DS (<i>n</i> = 42; 59.5% female) and demographically matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 39; 53.8% female). Neuroimaging data were acquired via single-band protocols and analyzed in line with methods provided by the Human Connectome Project. We computed functional relationships between individual-specific anatomically defined thalamic and hippocampal seeds and all gray matter voxels in the brain. Whole-brain Type I error protection was achieved through nonparametric permutation-based methods. The 22q11DS patients displayed dissociable disruptions in thalamic and hippocampal functional connectivity relative to control subjects. Thalamocortical coupling was increased in somatomotor regions and reduced across associative networks. The opposite effect was observed for the hippocampus in regards to somatomotor and associative network connectivity. The thalamic and hippocampal dysconnectivity observed in 22q11DS suggests that high genetic risk for psychiatric illness is linked with disruptions in large-scale corticosubcortical networks underlying higher-order cognitive functions. These effects highlight the translational importance of large-effect copy number variants for informing mechanisms underlying neural disruptions observed in idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Investigation of neuroimaging biomarkers in highly penetrant genetic syndromes represents a more biologically tractable approach to identify neural circuit disruptions underlying developmental neuropsychiatric conditions. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome confers particularly high risk for psychotic disorders and is thus an important translational model in which to investigate systems-level mechanisms implicated in idiopathic illness. Here, we show resting-state fMRI evidence of large-scale sensory and executive network disruptions in youth with 22q11DS. In particular, this study provides the first evidence that these networks are disrupted in a dissociable fashion with regard to the functional connectivity of the thalamus and hippocampus, suggesting circuit-level dysfunction.</p>

<p>Emotionally evocative messages can be an effective way to change behavior, but the neural pathways that translate messages into effects on individuals and populations are not fully understood. We used a human functional neuroimaging approach to ask how affect-, value-, and regulation-related brain systems interact to predict effects of graphic anti-smoking messages for individual smokers (both males and females) and within a population-level messaging campaign. Results indicated that increased activity in the amygdala, a region involved in affective reactivity, predicted both personal quit intentions and population-level information-seeking and this was mediated by activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region involved in computing an integrative value signal. Further, the predictive value of these regions was moderated by expression of a meta-analytically defined brain pattern indexing emotion regulation. That is, amygdala and vmPFC activity strongly tracked with population behavior only when participants showed low recruitment of this brain pattern, which consists of regions involved in goal-driven regulation of affective responses. Overall, these findings suggest that affective and value-related brain responses can predict the success of persuasive messages and that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape these responses, moderating the extent to which they track with population-level message impact.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People and organizations often appeal to our emotions to persuade us, but how these appeals engage the brain to drive behavior is not fully understood. We present an fMRI-based model that integrates affect-, control-, and value-related brain responses to predict the impact of graphic anti-smoking stimuli within a small group of smokers and a larger-scale public messaging campaign. This model indicated that amygdala activity predicted the impact of the anti-smoking messages, but that this relationship was mediated by ventromedial prefrontal cortex and moderated by expression of a distributed brain pattern associated with regulating emotion. These results suggest that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape the extent to which affect and value-related brain responses track with population behavioral effects.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1275?rss=1">Upregulation of Anandamide Hydrolysis in the Basolateral Complex of Amygdala Reduces Fear Memory Expression and Indices of Stress and Anxiety</a></h4>

<p>Increased anandamide (AEA) signaling through inhibition of its catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the basolateral complex of amygdala (BLA) is thought to buffer against the effects of stress and reduces behavioral signs of anxiety and fear. However, examining the role of AEA signaling in stress, anxiety, and fear through pharmacological depletion has been challenging due to the redundant complexity of its biosynthesis and the lack of a pharmacological synthesis inhibitor. We developed a herpes simplex viral vector to rapidly yet transiently overexpress FAAH specifically within the BLA to assess the impact of suppressing AEA signaling on stress, fear, and anxiety in male rats. Surprisingly, FAAH overexpression in BLA dampened stress-induced corticosterone release, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and decreased conditioned fear expression. Interestingly, depleting AEA signaling in the BLA did not prevent fear conditioning itself or fear reinstatement. These effects were specific to the overexpression of FAAH because they were reversed by intra-BLA administration of an FAAH inhibitor. Moreover, the fear-suppressive effects of FAAH overexpression were also mitigated by intra-BLA administration of a low dose of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, but not an NMDA/AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, suggesting that they were mediated by an increase in GABAergic neurotransmission. Our data suggest that a permissive AEA tone within the BLA might gate GABA release and that loss of this tone through elevated AEA hydrolysis increases inhibition in the BLA, which in turn reduces stress, anxiety, and fear. These data provide new insights on the mechanisms by which amygdalar endocannabinoid signaling regulates emotional behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Amygdala endocannabinoid signaling is involved in the regulation of stress, anxiety, and fear. Our data indicate that viral-mediated augmentation of anandamide hydrolysis within the basolateral amygdala reduces behavioral indices of stress, anxiety, and conditioned fear expression. These same effects have been previously documented with inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis in the same brain region. Our results indicate that the ability of anandamide signaling to regulate emotional behavior is nonlinear and may involve actions at distinct neuronal populations, which could be influenced by the basal level of anandamide. Modulation of anandamide signaling is a current clinical therapeutic target for stress-related psychiatric illnesses, so these data underscore the importance of fully understanding the mechanisms by which anandamide signaling regulates amygdala-dependent changes in emotionality.</p>

Abstract
<p>Stress causes divergent patterns of structural and physiological plasticity in the hippocampus versus amygdala. However, a majority of earlier studies focused primarily on neurons. Despite growing evidence for the importance of glia in health and disease, relatively little is known about how stress affects astrocytes. Further, previous work focused on hippocampal astrocytes. Hence, we examined the impact of chronic immobilization stress (2 h/d, 10 d), on the number and structure of astrocytes in the rat hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a reduction in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the basal amygdala (BA), 1 d after the end of 10 d of chronic stress. Detailed morphometric analysis of individual dye-filled astrocytes also revealed a decrease in the neuropil volume occupied by these astrocytes in the BA, alongside a reduction in the volume fraction of fine astrocytic protrusions rather than larger dendrite-like processes. By contrast, the same chronic stress had no effect on the number or morphology of astrocytes in hippocampal area CA3. We also confirmed previous reports that chronic stress triggers dendritic hypertrophy in dye-filled BA principal neurons that were located adjacent to astrocytes that had undergone atrophy. Thus, building on earlier evidence for contrasting patterns of stress-induced plasticity in neurons across brain areas, our findings offer new evidence that the same stress can also elicit divergent morphological effects in astrocytes in the hippocampus versus the amygdala.</p>

Abstract
<p>The biological mechanisms underlying complex forms of learning requiring the understanding of rules based on previous experience are not yet known. Previous studies have raised the intriguing possibility that improvement in complex learning tasks requires the long-term modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of the slow calcium-dependent potassium current (sI<sub>AHP</sub>) simultaneously in most neurons in the relevant neuronal networks in several key brain areas. Such sI<sub>AHP</sub> reduction is expressed in attenuation of the postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potential, and thus in enhanced repetitive action potential firing. Using complex olfactory discrimination (OD) learning as a model for complex learning, we show that brief activation of the GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor results in long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability in neurons from controls, but not from trained rats. Such an effect can be obtained by a brief tetanic synaptic stimulation or by direct application of kainate, both of which reduce the postburst AHP in pyramidal neurons. Induction of long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability is mediated via a metabotropic process that requires PKC and ERK activation. Intrinsic neuronal excitability cannot be modulated by synaptic activation in neurons from GluK2 knock-out mice. Accordingly, these mice are incapable of learning the complex OD task. Moreover, viral-induced overexpression of Gluk2 in piriform cortex pyramidal neurons results in remarkable enhancement of complex OD learning. Thus, signaling via kainate receptors has a central functional role in higher cognitive abilities.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>To determine the familial aggregation of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), neurodegenerative diseases, and related biomarkers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 404 and 387 first‐degree relatives of 102 patients with iRBD and 89 controls were recruited, respectively. Among them, 204 and 208 relatives of patients and controls underwent face‐to‐face clinical assessment, while 97 and 75 relatives underwent further video‐polysomnographic assessment, respectively.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with relatives of controls, relatives of patients demonstrated higher levels of RBD features including chin tonic electromyography activity (mean: 1.5&amp;pm7.5 vs. 0.3&amp;pm1.0, p=0.04) and behavioral events (n [weighted %]: 12 [11.3] vs. 2 [1.9], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.54‐33.33, p=0.009) during rapid eye movement sleep, probable diagnosis (n [%]: 57 [14.9] vs. 20 [4.9], aHR=3.45, 95% CI=1.96‐6.25, p &lt;0.001), and definite diagnosis (n [weighted %]: 10 [8.4] vs. 2 [1.4], aHR=5.56, 95% CI=1.16‐25.00, p=0.03). They also had higher risks of Parkinson's disease (3.1% vs 0.5%, aHR=5.88, 95% CI=1.37‐25.00, p=0.02), dementia (6.9% vs. 2.6%, aHR=2.44, 95% CI=1.15‐5.26, p=0.02), constipation (8.3% vs. 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio=4.21, 95% CI=1.34‐13.17, p=0.01), and motor dysfunction (MDS‐UPDRS part III motor score, mean: 1.9&amp;pm3.2 vs. 0.9&amp;pm2.3, p=0.002). The unaffected relatives of patients demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of prodromal Parkinson's disease (median [interquartile range]: 0.27 [1.19] vs. 0.22 [0.51], p=0.03).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>iRBD is familial aggregated from isolated features to full‐blown sleep disorder. Relatives of patients carry a higher risk of alpha‐synucleinopathy in terms of neurodegenerative diseases and prodromal markers, suggesting a familial aggregation and staging pathology of alpha‐synucleinopathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25434?af=R">Blood pressure variability and hemorrhagic transformation in patients with successful recanalization after endovascular recanalization therapy: a retrospective observational study</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although BP variability has been regarded as a risk factor for hemorrhagic transformation (HTF) after intravenous thrombolysis, its effect on HTF after endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) remains to be elucidated. We aimed to study the relationship between BP variability and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after successful recanalization with ERT.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 211 patients with acute ischemic stroke and successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3) after ERT were included between January 2013 and May 2017. The BP data following ERT was obtained over the first 24 hours using parameters including mean, maximum, minimum, difference between maximum and minimum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, successive variations, and time rate (TR) of BP variation for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). sICH was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 with neurological deterioration of 4 points of more on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the included patients, 20 (9.5%) developed sICH after successful ERT. The parameters linked with BP fluctuation over time were significantly related to sICH. After adjusting for confounders, the TR of SBP (per 0.1 mmHg/min increase) variation was independently associated with sICH (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.013–2.886).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Time‐related BP variability in the first 24 hours following successful ERT was more correlated with sICH than other absolute BP level. This suggests that maintaining a stable BP may be an important factor in preventing sICH after successful ERT.</p>

<p>According to the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness,
consciousness is a fundamental observer-independent property of physical
systems, and the measure Phi of integrated information is identical to the
quantity or level of consciousness. For this to be plausible, there should be
no alternative formulae for Phi consistent with the axioms of IIT, and there
should not be cases of Phi being ill-defined. This article presents three ways
in which Phi, in its current formulation, fails to meet these standards, and
discusses how this problem might be addressed.

Farías et al. report that the localization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the axon is controlled by the interaction between ER-shaping proteins and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Local ER and microtubule crosstalk promotes ER tubule-microtubule stabilization and drives neuronal polarity.

Using cellular-resolution activity mapping and innovative population analyses, Minderer et al. show that navigation-related information is distributed and varies gradually across large parts of the posterior cortex, even across retinotopic boundaries. This suggests a distance-based principle for cortical encoding and multimodal integration.

<p>by Damien G. Hicks, Terence P. Speed, Mohammed Yassin, Sarah M. Russell</p>

New approaches to lineage tracking have allowed the study of differentiation in multicellular organisms over many generations of cells. Understanding the phenotypic variability observed in these lineage trees requires new statistical methods. Whereas an invariant cell lineage, such as that for the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, can be described by a lineage map, defined as the pattern of phenotypes overlaid onto the binary tree, a traditional lineage map is static and does not describe the variability inherent in the cell lineages of higher organisms. Here, we introduce lineage variability maps which describe the pattern of second-order variation in lineage trees. These maps can be undirected graphs of the partial correlations between every lineal position, or directed graphs showing the dynamics of bifurcated patterns in each subtree. We show how to infer these graphical models for lineages of any depth from sample sizes of only a few pedigrees. This required developing the generalized spectral analysis for a binary tree, the natural framework for describing tree-structured variation. When tested on pedigrees from <i>C. elegans</i> expressing a marker for pharyngeal differentiation potential, the variability maps recover essential features of the known lineage map. When applied to highly-variable pedigrees monitoring cell size in T lymphocytes, the maps show that most of the phenotype is set by the founder naive T cell. Lineage variability maps thus elevate the concept of the lineage map to the population level, addressing questions about the potency and dynamics of cell lineages and providing a way to quantify the progressive restriction of cell fate with increasing depth in the tree.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NySPD1pQXwY" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Whilst the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles, accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) to include regulating the transmitter content of synaptic vesicles. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the <i>Drosophila</i> VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (<i>13Q to 12Q</i>), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic mEPSCs recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (<i>13Q to 14Q</i>) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked synaptic vesicle release. Finally, a complete deletion of the PolyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure synaptic vesicles are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neurotransmitter-loading of synaptic vesicles is tightly regulated and underpins the quantal theory of neurotransmission. However, although observed at every synapse studied, the mechanistic basis that ensures vesicle-filling stops at a fixed, pre-determined, level remains poorly understood. In this study we identify a C-terminal poly-glutamine region in the <i>Drosophila</i> VAChT to be critical for vesicle-loading of ACh. Reduction or extension of this region, by just one glutamine residue, is sufficient to increase or decrease, respectively, the amount of ACh loaded. Our work significantly advances the field of synaptic physiology by identifying a region of a vesicular transporter that regulates the extent to which synaptic vesicles are filled.</p>

Abstract<p>Cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic (CCK-GABA) neurons are perisomatic inhibitory cells that have been argued to regulate emotion and sculpt the network oscillations associated with cognition. However, no study has selectively manipulated CCK-GABA neuron activity during behavior in freely-moving animals. To explore the behavioural effects of activating CCK-GABA neurons on emotion and cognition, we utilized a novel intersectional genetic mouse model coupled with a chemogenetic approach. Specifically, we generated triple transgenic <i>CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe;RC::FL-hM3Dq</i> (CCK-GABA/hM3Dq) mice that expressed the synthetic excitatory hM3Dq receptor in CCK-GABA neurons. Results showed that CNO-mediated activation of CCK-GABA neurons did not alter open field or tail suspension performance and only slightly increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze. Though CNO treatment had only modestly affected emotional behavior, it significantly enhanced multiple cognitive and memory behaviors including social recognition, contextual fear conditioning, contextual discrimination, object recognition and problem-solving in the puzzle box. Collectively, these findings suggest that systemic activation of CCK-GABA neurons minimally affects emotion but significantly enhances cognition and memory. Our results imply that CCK-GABA neurons are more functionally diverse than originally expected and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive/memory disorders.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> CCK-GABA neurons are thought to play an important role in pathologies such as schizophrenia, but their contributions to behavior in the healthy states are poorly understood. Here we report a novel method for selectively targeting CCK-GABA neurons and manipulating their activity during behavioural tasks. Our data demonstrate that activating CCK-GABA neurons subtly affects emotional behavior but surprisingly enhances multiple memory and cognitive processes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0018-18.2019v1?rss=1">The Role of Glutamatergic and Dopaminergic Neurons in the Periaqueductal Gray/Dorsal Raphe: Separating Analgesia and Anxiety</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a significant modulator of both analgesic and fear behaviors in both humans and rodents, but the underlying circuitry responsible for these two phenotypes is incompletely understood. Importantly, it is not known if there is a way to produce analgesia without anxiety by targeting the PAG, as modulation of glutamate or GABA neurons in this area initiates both antinociceptive and anxiogenic behavior. While dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) /dorsal raphe display a supraspinal antinociceptive effect, their influence on anxiety and fear are unknown. Using DAT-cre and Vglut2-cre male mice, we introduced Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to DA and glutamate neurons within the vlPAG using viral-mediated delivery and found that levels of analgesia were significant and quantitatively similar when DA and glutamate neurons were selectively stimulated. Activation of glutamatergic neurons, however, reliably produced higher indices of anxiety, with increased freezing time and more time spent in the safety of a dark enclosure. In contrast, animals in which PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons were stimulated failed to show fear behaviors. DA-mediated antinociception was inhibitable by haloperidol and was sufficient to prevent persistent inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan. In summary, only activation of DA neurons in the PAG/dorsal raphe produced profound analgesia without signs of anxiety, indicating that PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons are an important target involved in analgesia that may lead to new treatments for pain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Clinicians have long had the goal of separating analgesia from anxiety when using deep brain electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) for difficult to treat pain. Here we show that selective activation of dopamine neurons within the PAG produces analgesia without other behavioral effects, while stimulating glutamate neurons mediates stress-induced anxiety and analgesia. Our results suggest that dopamine agonists may represent a novel class of analgesic drugs and elucidate target neurons that could mediate their effect.</p>

<p>We study temporal correlations of interspike intervals (ISIs), quantified by
the network-averaged serial correlation coefficient (SCC), in networks of both
current- and conductance-based purely inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons.
Numerical simulations reveal transitions to negative SCCs at intermediate
values of bias current drive and network size. As bias drive and network size
are increased past these values, the SCC returns to zero. The SCC is maximally
negative at an intermediate value of the network oscillation strength. The
dependence of the SCC on two canonical schemes for synaptic connectivity is
studied, and it is shown that the results occur robustly in both schemes. For
conductance-based synapses, the SCC becomes negative at the onset of both a
fast and slow coherent network oscillation. Finally, we devise a noise-reduced
diffusion approximation for current-based networks that accounts for the
observed temporal correlation transitions.

<p>The Caf\'e Wall illusion is one of a class of tilt illusions where lines that
are parallel appear to be tilted. We demonstrate that a simple Differences of
Gaussian model provides an explanatory mechanism for the illusory tilt
perceived in a family of Caf\'e Wall illusion generalizes to the dashed
versions of Caf\'e Wall. Our explanation models the visual mechanisms in
low-level stages that can reveal tilt cues in Geometrical distortion illusions
such as Tile illusions particularly Caf\'e Wall illusions. For this, we
simulate the activation of the retinal/cortical simple cells in responses to
these patterns based on a Classical Receptive Field (CRF) model to explain tilt
effects in these illusions. Previously, it was assumed that all these visual
experiences of tilt arise from the orientation selectivity properties described
for more complex cortical cells. An estimation of an overall tilt angle
perceived in these illusions is based on the integration of the local tilts
detected by simple cells which is presumed to be a key mechanism utilized by
the complex cells to create our final perception of tilt.

<p>When the human brain manifests the birth of organised communication among
local and large-scale neuronal populations activity remains undescribed. We
report, in resting-state EEG source-estimates of 100 infants at term age, the
existence of macro-scale dynamic functional connectivity, which have rich
topological organisations, distinct spectral fingerprints and scale-invariance
temporal dynamics. These functional networks encompass the default mode,
primary sensory-limbic system, thalamo-frontal, thalamo-sensorimotor and
visual-limbic system confined in the delta and low-alpha frequency intervals
(1-8 Hz). The temporal dynamics of these networks not only are nested within
much slower timescale (&lt;0.1 Hz) but also correlated in a hierarchical
leading-following organisation. We show that the anatomically constrained
richly organised spatial topologies, spectral contents and temporal
fluctuations of resting-state networks reflect an established intrinsic dynamic
functional connectome in the human brain at term age. The graph theoretical
analysis of the spatial architectures of the networks revealed small-world
topology and distinct rich-club organisations of interconnected cortical hubs
that exhibit rich synchronous dynamics at multiple timescales. The approach
opens new avenues to advance our understanding about the early configuration
organisation of dynamic networks in the human brain and offers a novel
monitoring platform to investigate functional brain network development in sick
preterm infants.

<p>The brain is an intricately structured organ responsible for the rich
emergent dynamics that support the complex cognitive functions we enjoy as
humans. With around $10^{11}$ neurons and $10^{15}$ synapses, understanding how
the human brain works has proven to be a daunting endeavor, requiring concerted
collaboration across traditional disciplinary boundaries. In some cases, that
collaboration has occurred between experimentalists and technicians, who offer
new physical tools to measure and manipulate neural function. In other
contexts, that collaboration has occurred between experimentalists and
theorists, who offer new conceptual tools to explain existing data and inform
new directions for empirical research. In this chapter, we offer an example of
the latter. Specifically, we focus on the simple but powerful framework of
linear systems theory as a useful tool both for capturing biophysically
relevant parameters of neural activity and connectivity, and for analytical and
numerical study. We begin with a brief overview of state-space representations
and linearization of neural models for non-linear dynamical systems. We then
derive core concepts in the theory of linear systems such as the impulse and
controlled responses to external stimuli, achieving desired state transitions,
controllability, and minimum energy control. Afterwards, we discuss recent
advances in the application of linear systems theory to structural and
functional brain data across multiple spatial and temporal scales, along with
methodological considerations and limitations. We close with a brief discussion

Myelin is a multilayer lipid membrane structure that wraps and insulates axons, allowing for the efficient propagation of action potentials. During developmental myelination of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate and migrate to their final destination, where they terminally differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and myelinate axons. Lineage progression and terminal differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells are under tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional control.

Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dohLaSUCB4U" width="1" />

Plant tissue architecture and organ morphogenesis rely on the proper orientation of cell divisions. Previous attempts to predict division planes from cell geometry in plants mostly focused on 2D symmetric divisions. Using the stereotyped division patterns of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> early embryogenesis, we investigated geometrical principles underlying plane selection in symmetric and in asymmetric divisions within complex 3D cell shapes. Introducing a 3D computational model of cell division, we show that area minimization constrained on passing through the cell centroid predicts observed divisions. Our results suggest that the positioning of division planes ensues from cell geometry and gives rise to spatially organized cell types with stereotyped shapes, thus underlining the role of self-organization in the developing architecture of the embryo. Our data further suggested the rule could be interpreted as surface minimization constrained by the nucleus position, which was validated using live imaging of cell divisions in the stomatal cell lineage.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TM2g1M-Iy2U" width="1" />

Electrocorticography (ECoG) is becoming more prevalent due to improvements in fabrication and recording technology as well as its ease of implantation compared to intracortical electrophysiology, larger cortical coverage, and potential advantages for use in long term chronic implantation. Given the flexibility in the design of ECoG grids, which is only increasing, it remains an open question what geometry of the electrodes is optimal for an application. Conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS, coated microelectrodes have an advantage that they can be made very small without losing low impedance. This makes them suitable for evaluating the required granularity of ECoG recording in humans and experimental animals. We used two-dimensional (2D) micro-ECoG grids to record intra-operatively in humans and during acute implantations in mouse with separation distance between neighboring electrodes (i.e., pitch) of 0.4 mm and 0.2/0.25 mm respectively. To assess the spatial properties of the signals, we used the average correlation between electrodes as a function of the pitch. In agreement with prior studies, we find a strong frequency dependence in the spatial scale of correlation. By applying independent component analysis (ICA), we find that the spatial pattern of correlation is largely due to contributions from multiple spatially extended, time-locked sources present at any given time. Our analysis indicates the presence of spatially structured activity down to the sub-millimeter spatial scale in ECoG despite the effects of volume conduction, justifying the use of dense micro-ECoG grids.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ux3pcYLlGPE" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative "visual word form area" (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, "HouseFont," in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called "parahippocampal place area" (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two-weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest, the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre- versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre- to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Fluent reading recruits a portion of the brain known as the visual word form area (VWFA), but it is less well understood how malleable the VWFA remains after acquiring literacy in a native language. There is also debate about the type of visual information the VWFA can process as orthographically meaningful. We tested whether native English-speaking adults could learn a second, visually atypical writing system for English and used neuroimaging data to assess the location of any learning effects. Participants acquired basic reading ability and learning effects were found in the neural territory that underlies English reading. This suggests that the VWFA remains plastic after initial literacy and is not restricted by the visual features of a writing system.</p>

Abstract<p>Despite the profound influence on coding capacity of sensory neurons, the measurements of noise correlations have been inconsistent. This is, possibly, because nonstationarity, i.e. drifting baselines, engendered the spurious long-term correlations even if no actual short-term correlation existed. Although attempts to separate them have been made previously, they were ad hoc for specific cases or computationally too demanding. Here we proposed an information-geometric method to unbiasedly estimate pure short-term noise correlations irrespective of the background brain activities without demanding computational resources. First, the benchmark simulations demonstrated that the proposed estimator is more accurate and computationally e cient than the conventional correlograms and the residual correlations with Kalman filters or moving averages of length three or more, while the best moving average of length two coincided with the propose method regarding correlation estimates. Next, we analyzed the cat V1 neural responses to demonstrate that the statistical test accompanying the proposed method combined with the existing nonstationarity test enabled us to dissociate short- and long-term noise correlations. When we excluded the spurious noise correlations of purely long-term nature, only small fraction of neuron pairs showed significant short-term correlations, possibly reconciling the previous inconsistent observations on existence of significant noise correlations. The decoding accuracy was slightly improved by the short-term correlations. Although the long-term correlations deteriorated the generalizability, the generalizability was recovered by the decoder with trend removal, suggesting that brains could overcome nonstationarity. Thus the proposed method enables us to elucidate the impacts of short- and long-term noise correlations in a dissociated manner.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The proposed measure for spike-count noise correlations, based on the local temporal detrending, enables us to decompose the correlated responses into long- and short-timescale components. The proposed method is essential to elucidate the population codes in the era of large-scale electrophysiology as it works for large number of simultaneously recorded neurons while existing methods do not. With the additional help of the machine learning that classifies stimuli from neural activities, we demonstrate proper ways to assess the impacts on decoding of the presence of short- or long-term noise correlations, separately. The well-designed decoding analysis with dissociated correlated activities will help to gain insight into the brain’s decoding strategies under changing environments.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The consolidation of newly formed memories and their retrieval are energetically demanding processes. Aerobic glycolysis (AG), also known as the Warburg effect, consists of the production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. The astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis posits that astrocytes process glucose by AG to generate lactate, which is used as a fuel source within neurons to maintain synaptic activity. Studies in mice have demonstrated that lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons is required for long-term memory formation, yet the role of lactate production in memory acquisition and retrieval has not previously been explored. Here, we examined the effect of dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of lactate production, on spatial learning and memory in mice using the Morris Water Maze (MWM). <i>In vivo</i> hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the mouse brain following DCA administration, concomitant with a reduction in phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). DCA exposure before each training session in the MWM impaired learning, which subsequently resulted in impaired memory during the probe trial. In contrast, mice that underwent training without DCA exposure, but received a single DCA injection before the probe trial exhibited normal memory. Our findings indicate that AG plays a key role during memory acquisition but is less important for retrieval of established memories. Thus, activation of AG may be important for learning-dependent synaptic plasticity rather than the activation of signaling cascades required for memory retrieval.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE</b> Neuronal activation is an energetically demanding process. The brain is mainly fueled by glucose, yet a substantial portion of this metabolite is converted to lactate despite the presence of adequate oxygen, a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis (AG). The transport of lactate between astrocytes and neurons is key for learning and memory, yet the role of lactate production in these processes is poorly understood. Here we report that administration of dichloroacetate (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of AG, attenuates conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the brains of mice. DCA exposure impaired spatial learning but had no effect on the retrieval of an established memory. These observations suggest that lactate production may be required for memory acquisition but not retrieval.</p>

Abstract<p>Odor information is transmitted from olfactory sensory neurons to principal neurons at the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The intraglomerular neuronal circuit also includes hundreds of interneurons referred to as juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. Stimulus selectivity is well correlated among many JG cells that are associated with the same glomerulus, consistent with their highly homogeneous sensory inputs. However, much less is known about the temporal aspects of their activity, including the temporal coordination of their odor-evoked responses. As many JG cells within a glomerular module respond to the same stimulus, the extent to which their activity is temporally aligned will affect the temporal profile of their population inhibitory inputs. Using random-access high-speed two-photon microscopy, we recorded the odor-evoked calcium transients of mouse JG cells and compared the onset latency and rise time among neurons putatively associated with the same and different glomeruli. Whereas the overall onset latencies of odor-evoked transients were distributed across a ~150 ms time window, those from cells putatively associated with the same glomerulus were confined to a much narrower window of several tens of milliseconds. This result suggests that onset latency primarily depends on the associated glomerulus. We also observed glomerular specificity in the rise time. The glomerulus-specific temporal pattern of odor-evoked activity implies that the temporal patterns of inputs from the intraglomerular circuit are unique to individual glomerulus–odor pairs, which may contribute to efficient shaping of the temporal pattern of activity in the principal neurons.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The sense of smell is essential for assessing chemicals in one’s atmospheric environment. In understanding the biological mechanisms by which humans and animals recognize various odorous chemicals, a key question is how the signals sent from the nose are transformed in the brain. In this work, we studied the temporal pattern of activity in interneurons that tune the sensory inputs to the principal (signal-carrying) neurons in the olfactory bulb via structures known as glomeruli. We found that the odor responses of these interneurons are precisely coordinated in time, suggesting that the glomerulus is a temporally well-organized unit. Our finding suggests that the temporal coordination of glomerular activity is important in signal transformation in the olfactory system.</p>

<p>Disorders of consciousness (DOC) are a common consequence of severe brain injuries, and clinical evaluation is critical to provide a correct diagnosis and prognosis. The revised Motor Behavior Tool (MBT‐r) is a clinical complementary tool aiming to identify subtle motor behaviors that might reflect residual cognition in DOC. In this prospective study including 30 DOC patients in the early stage after brain injury, we show that the revised MBT‐r has an excellent inter‐rater agreement and has the ability to identify a subgroup of patients, underestimated by the Coma Recovery Scale‐Revised, showing residual cognition and a subsequent recovery of consciousness.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is no scale for rating the severity of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). In this study, we aimed to develop a novel scale for rating severity in patients with diverse AE syndromes and to verify the reliability and validity of the developed scale.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The key items were generated by a panel of experts and selected according to content validity ratios. The developed scale was initially applied to 50 patients with AE (development cohort) to evaluate its acceptability, reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity. Then, the scale was applied to another independent cohort (validation cohort, n = 38).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A new scale consisting of 9 items (seizure, memory dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms, consciousness, language problems, dyskinesia/dystonia, gait instability and ataxia, brainstem dysfunction, and weakness) was developed. Each item was assigned a value of up to 3 points. The total score could therefore range from 0 to 27. We named the scale the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). The new scale showed excellent interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.97) and intraobserver (ICC = 0.96) reliability for total scores, was highly correlated with modified Rankin scale (<i>r</i> = 0.86, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88). Additionally, in the validation cohort, the scale showed high interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.92).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CASE is a novel clinical scale for AE with a high level of clinimetric properties. It would be suitable for application in clinical practice and might help overcome the limitations of current outcome scales for AE. Ann Neurol 2019</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Gladys Lima Caldeira, João Peça, Ana Luísa Carvalho</p><div><p>Growing evidence implicates synaptic proteins in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia. In fact, mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins are enriched and overlap among different conditions highlighting the complex and pleiotropic nature of these disorders. In this review, we discuss recently described candidate genes that affect excitatory synapse function and result in changes in spine number and morphology. Spine pathology has been observed in several animal models of disease and in human brain post-mortem samples from ID, ASD, and schizophrenia patients. Recent data point to convergent mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and dysfunction of microglia synaptic remodeling, underlying dendritic spine dysgenesis. Interestingly, the reversion of important pathologic features, including spine abnormalities, has been observed in adult animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that therapies may not be restricted to a specific developmental window. Shedding light on the specific mechanisms impacted in neuropsychiatric disorders will undeniably contribute to the development of more directed and personalized therapies.</p></div>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small‐fiber sensory and autonomic symptoms are early presentations of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) with transthyretin (TTR) mutations. This study aimed to explore the potential of skin nerve pathologies as early and disease‐progression biomarkers and their relationship with skin amyloid deposits.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Skin biopsies were performed in patients and carriers to measure intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density, sweat gland innervation index of structural protein gene product 9.5 [SGII(PGP9.5)] and peptidergic vasoactive intestinal peptide [SGII(VIP)], and cutaneous amyloid index. These skin pathologies were analyzed with clinical disability assessed by FAP stage score (stage 0~4) and compared to neurophysiological and psychophysical tests.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 70 TTR‐mutant subjects (22 carriers and 48 patients) and 66 cases were TTR‐A97S. Skin nerve pathologies were distinct according to stage. In carriers, both skin denervation and peptidergic sudomotor denervation were evident: (1) IENF density was gradually reduced from stage 0 through 4, and (2) SGII(VIP) was markedly reduced from stage 1 to 2. In contrast, SGII(PGP9.5) was similar between carriers and controls, but it declined in patients from stage 2. Skin amyloids were absent in carriers and became detectable from stage 1. Cutaneous amyloid index was correlated with SGII(PGP9.5) and stage in a multivariable mixed‐effect model. When all tests were compared, only IENF density, SGII(PGP9.5), and cutaneous amyloid index were correlated with stage, and IENF density had the highest abnormal rate in carriers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biomarkers of sensory and sudomotor innervation exhibited a stage‐dependent progression pattern, with sensory nerve degeneration as the early skin nerve pathology.</p>

These differences, coupled with microtubule post-translational modifications, combine to locally regulate intracellular transport, morphology, and function. Recent discoveries provide new insight into the regulation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in neurons, the relationship between microtubule acetylation and mechanosensation, and the spatial patterning of microtubules that regulates motor activity and cargo delivery in axons and dendrites. Together, these new studies bring us closer to understanding how microtubule function is locally tuned to match the specialized tasks associated with signal reception and transmission.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In real-life situations, the appearance of a person’s face can vary substantially across different encounters, making face recognition a challenging task for the visual system. Recent fMRI decoding studies have suggested that face recognition is supported by identity representations located in regions of the occipitotemporal cortex. Here, we used EEG to elucidate the temporal emergence of these representations. Human participants viewed a set of highly variable face images of 4 highly familiar celebrities (2 males and 2 females), while performing an orthogonal task. Univariate analyses of event-related EEG responses revealed a pronounced differentiation between male and female faces, but not between identities of the same sex. Using multivariate representational similarity analysis, we observed a gradual emergence of face identity representations, with an increasing degree of invariance. Face identity information emerged rapidly, starting shortly after 100 ms from stimulus onset, but was modulated by sex differences and image similarities. From 400 ms after onset and predominantly in the right hemisphere, identity representations showed 2 invariance properties: 1) they equally discriminated identities of opposite sexes and of the same sex, and 2) they were tolerant to image-based variations. These invariant representations may be a crucial prerequisite for successful face recognition in everyday situations, where the appearance of a familiar person can vary drastically.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, and anhedonia, precede the onset of debilitating motor symptoms in Huntington’s disease (HD), and their development may give insight into early disease progression and treatment. However, the neuronal and circuit mechanisms of premanifest HD pathophysiology are not well-understood. Here, using a transgenic rat model expressing the full-length human mutant HD gene, we find early and profound deficits in reward motivation in the absence of gross motor abnormalities. These deficits are accompanied by significant and progressive dysfunction in corticostriatal processing and communication among brain areas critical for reward-driven behavior. Together, our results define early corticostriatal dysfunction as a possible pathogenic contributor to psychiatric disturbances and may help identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of HD.</span>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with high risk of ischemic heart disease, but whether this is also the case for ischemic stroke is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that high remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>102,964 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with information on remnant cholesterol at baseline in 2003‐15 were included in a prospective observational association study. Individuals were followed for up to 14 years, during which time 2,488 were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results were independently confirmed in 9,548 individuals enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991‐94; 983 ischemic strokes developed during up to 26 years of follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stepwise higher remnant cholesterol concentrations were associated with stepwise higher ischemic stroke risk in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with multivariable adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.99(95%confidence interval: 1.49‐2.67) for individuals with remnant cholesterol concentrations ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL), compared to individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL). Results were similar in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke at age 80 in the Copenhagen General Population Study ranged from 7.3% for individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL) to 11.5% for individuals with remnant cholesterol ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Individuals with high remnant cholesterol concentrations had higher risk of ischemic stroke. These results indicate that randomized clinical trials with remnant cholesterol lowering in individuals with high concentrations, with the aim of preventing ischemic strokes, are needed.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &gt; 700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from <i>MR Base</i> and <i>LD‐hub</i>. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We have shown via linkage disequilibrium score regression that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we have developed a public resource (<a href="https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://lng‐nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny</a>) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated LDL cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior acetylcholinesterase PET imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([<sup>18</sup>F]FEOBV) PET.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (P=0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to non‐fallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (P=0.0012) and limbic archicortex (P=0.004) in freezers compared to non‐freezers. Whole brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal and mesiofrontal limbic regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FOG in PD.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We mapped alterations of the functional structure of the cerebral cortex using a novel imaging approach in a sample of 160 obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Whole-brain functional connectivity maps were generated using multidistance measures of intracortical neural activity coupling defined within isodistant local areas. OCD patients demonstrated neural activity desynchronization within the orbitofrontal cortex and in primary somatosensory, auditory, visual, gustatory, and olfactory areas. Symptom severity was significantly associated with the degree of functional structure alteration in OCD-relevant brain regions. By means of a novel imaging perspective, we once again identified brain alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex, involving areas purportedly implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD. However, our results also indicated that weaker intracortical activity coupling is also present in each primary sensory area. On the basis of previous neurophysiological studies, such cortical activity desynchronization may best be interpreted as reflecting deficient inhibitory neuron activity and altered sensory filtering.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dysfunction of motor cortices is thought to contribute to motor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little is known on the link between cortical dopaminergic loss, abnormalities in motor cortex neural activity and motor deficits. We address the role of dopamine in modulating motor cortical activity by focusing on the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing a cued-licking task. We first demonstrate licking deficits and concurrent alterations of spiking activity in ALM of head-fixed mice with unilateral depletion of dopaminergic neurons (i.e., mice injected with 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle). Hemilesioned mice displayed delayed licking initiation, shorter duration of licking bouts, and lateral deviation of tongue protrusions. In parallel with these motor deficits, we observed a reduction in the prevalence of cue responsive neurons and altered preparatory activity. Acute and local blockade of D1 receptors in ALM recapitulated some of the key behavioral and neural deficits observed in hemilesioned mice. Altogether, our data show a direct relationship between cortical D1 receptor modulation, cue-evoked, and preparatory activity in ALM, and licking initiation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To uncover the ontogenesis of the human indusium griseum (IG), 28 post-mortem fetal human brains, 12–40 postconceptional weeks (PCW) of age, and 4 adult brains were analyzed immunohistochemically and compared with post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 28 fetal brains (14–41 PCW). The morphogenesis of the IG occurred between 12 and 15 PCW, transforming the bilateral IG primordia into a ribbon-like cortical lamina. The histogenetic transition of sub-laminated zones into the three-layered cortical organization occurred between 15 and 35 PCW, concomitantly with rapid cell differentiation that occurred from 18 to 28 PCW and the elaboration of neuronal connectivity during the entire second half of gestation. The increasing number of total cells and neurons in the IG at 25 and 35 PCW confirmed its continued differentiation throughout this period. High-field 3.0 T post-mortem MRI enabled visualization of the IG at the mid-fetal stage using T2-weighted sequences. In conclusion, the IG had a distinct histogenetic differentiation pattern than that of the neighboring intralimbic areas of the same ontogenetic origin, and did not show any signs of regression during the fetal period or postnatally, implying a functional role of the IG in the adult brain, which is yet to be disclosed.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In many species of Mammalia, the surface of the brain develops from a smooth structure to one with many fissures and folds, allowing for vast expansion of the surface area of the cortex. The importance of understanding what drives cortical folding extends beyond mere curiosity, as conditions such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal alcohol syndrome are associated with impaired folding in the infant and child. Despite being a key feature of brain development, the mechanisms driving cortical folding remain largely unknown. In this review we discuss the possible role of the subplate, a developmentally transient compartment, in directing region-dependent development leading to sulcal and gyral formation. We discuss the development of the subplate in species with lissencephalic and gyrencephalic cortices, the characteristics of the cells found in the subplate, and the possible presence of molecular cues that guide axons into, and out of, the overlying and multilayered cortex before the appearance of definitive cortical folds. An understanding of what drives cortical folding is likely to help in understanding the origins of abnormal folding patterns in clinical pathologies.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>During early development, the infant brain is highly plastic and sensory experiences modulate emerging cortical maps, enhancing processing efficiency as infants set up key linguistic precursors. Early interactive acoustic experience (IAE) with spectrotemporally-modulated non-speech has been shown to facilitate optimal acoustic processing and generalizes to novel non-speech sounds at 7-months-of-age. Here we demonstrate that effects of non-speech IAE endure well beyond the immediate training period and robustly generalize to speech processing. Infants who received non-speech IAE differed at 9-months-of-age from both naïve controls and those with only passive acoustic exposure, demonstrating broad modulation of oscillatory dynamics. For the standard syllable, increased high-gamma (&gt;70 Hz) power within auditory cortices indicates that IAE fosters native speech processing, facilitating establishment of phonemic representations. The higher left beta power seen may reflect increased linking of sensory information and corresponding articulatory patterns, while bilateral decreases in theta power suggest more mature automatized speech processing, as less neuronal resources were allocated to process syllabic information. For the deviant syllable, left-lateralized gamma (&lt;70 Hz) enhancement suggests IAE promotes phonemic-related discrimination abilities. Theta power increases in right auditory cortex, known for favoring slow-rate decoding, implies IAE facilitates the more demanding processing of the sporadic deviant syllable.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Alcohol abuse is a major public health problem worldwide. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control regular drinking may help to reduce hazards of alcohol consumption. While immunological mechanisms have been related to alcohol drinking, most studies reported changes in immune function that are secondary to alcohol use. In this report, we analyse how the gene “TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator” (<span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span>) affects alcohol drinking behavior. Based on our recent discovery in a large GWAS dataset that suggested an association of <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span>, SNP rs197273, with alcohol drinking, we report that SNP rs197273 in <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span> is associated both with gene expression (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 1.16 × 10<sup>−19</sup>) and regional methylation (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 5.90 × 10<sup>−25</sup>). A <span style="font-style: italic;">tank</span> knock out mouse model suggests a role of TANK in alcohol drinking, anxiety-related behavior, as well as alcohol exposure induced activation of insular cortex NF-κB. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies among up to 1896 adolescents reveal that TANK is involved in the control of brain activity in areas of aversive interoceptive processing, including the insular cortex, but not in areas related to reinforcement, reward processing or impulsiveness. Our findings suggest that the cortical neuroimmune regulator TANK is associated with enhanced aversive emotional processing that better protects from the establishment of alcohol drinking behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus displays a complex organization and function that is perturbed in many neuropathologies. Histological work revealed a complex arrangement of subfields along the medial–lateral and the ventral–dorsal dimension, which contrasts with the anterior–posterior functional differentiation. The variety of maps has raised the need for an integrative multimodal view. We applied connectivity-based parcellation to 1) intrinsic connectivity 2) task-based connectivity, and 3) structural covariance, as complementary windows into structural and functional differentiation of the hippocampus. Strikingly, while functional properties (i.e., intrinsic and task-based) revealed similar partitions dominated by an anterior–posterior organization, structural covariance exhibited a hybrid pattern reflecting both functional and cytoarchitectonic subdivision. Capitalizing on the consistency of functional parcellations, we defined robust functional maps at different levels of partitions, which are openly available for the scientific community. Our functional maps demonstrated a head–body and tail partition, subdivided along the anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axis. Behavioral profiling of these fine partitions based on activation data indicated an emotion–cognition gradient along the anterior–posterior axis and additionally suggested a self-world-centric gradient supporting the role of the hippocampus in the construction of abstract representations for spatial navigation and episodic memory.</span>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Swathi Ayloo, Chenghua Gu</p><div><p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a functional interface separating the brain from the circulatory system and is essential for homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.</p></div>
