              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Simulation model for the dynamics of dengue with asymptomatic transmission and the effect of temperature [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the fastest spreading vector-borne diseases in tropical and subtropical regions is dengue, which generates cost overruns for public health entities. Several factors can influence the dynamics of dengue virus transmission: environmental and climatic (abundance of vectors), interactions between hosts (infections by asymptomatic individuals), and population immunological factors. Given these conditions, it is necessary to carry out theoretical studies based on meteorological factors and asymptomatic transmission that are associated with both the existence of the vector and its incidence, in order to provide a scientific basis for health entities in decision-making. Methods: A mathematical model based on nonlinear ordinary differential equations is proposed to interpret the dynamics of dengue transmission in humans coupled to the dynamics of the Aedes aegypti species, considering the population of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected humans and the effect of temperature variability. The basic reproduction number was found and some simulation results based on the Runge-Kutta numerical method were obtained. Results: The simulations showed that the temperature had a directly proportional relationship with the basic reproduction number. The cases of infected people and carrier mosquitoes increased when the temperature peaks increased drastically; in low temperatures the infection persisted with low morbidity due to the survival of asymptomatic people. Conclusions: High temperatures tolerable by mosquitoes increase their life expectancy and their numbers in the environment which, together with a reservoir of asymptomatic infected people, leads to a higher incidence of the dengue virus in certain seasons or maintains its circulation in seasons of low temperatures, despite lower vector survival rates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Indirect Pathway of the Basal Ganglia Promotes Negative Reinforcement, But Not Motor Suppression</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic stimulation of Adora2a receptor expressing spiny projection neurons (A2A-SPN) in the striatum drives locomotor suppression and negative reinforcement, results attributed to activation of the indirect pathway. The sole long-range projection target of A2A-SPNs is the external globus pallidus (GPe). Unexpectedly, we found that inhibition of the GPe did not suppress movement, but did drive robust negative reinforcement in a real-time place preference assay. Within the striatum, A2A-SPNs inhibit other SPNs through a short-range inhibitory collateral network, and we found that optogenetic stimuli that drove motor suppression shared a common mechanism of recruiting this inhibitory collateral network. Our results suggest that the indirect pathway plays a more prominent role in negative reinforcement than in motor control and challenges the assumption that activity of A2A-SPNs is synonymous with indirect pathway activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergent low-frequency activity in cortico-cerebellar networks with motor skill learning</a></h4>

              
                The motor cortex controls skilled arm movement by recruiting a variety of targets in the nervous system, and it is important to understand the emergent activity in these regions as refinement of a motor skill occurs. One fundamental projection of the motor cortex is to the cerebellum. However, the emergent activity in the motor cortex and the cerebellum that appears as a dexterous motor skill is consolidated is incompletely understood. Here, we report on low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity that emerges in cortico-cerebellar networks with learning the reach-to-grasp motor skill. We chronically recorded the motor and the cerebellar cortices in rats which revealed the emergence of coordinated movement-related activity in the local-field potentials (LFPs) as the reaching skill consolidated. We found that the local and cross-area spiking activity was coordinated with LFOs. Finally, we also found that these neural dynamics were more prominently expressed during accurate behavior. This work furthers our understanding on emergent dynamics in the cortico-cerebellar loop that underlie learning and execution of precise skilled movement.

	<p>The topic of the therapeutic use of cannabinoids in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is broadly discussed and frequently comes up in the outpatient clinic. So far, there are only a few randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of cannabinoids in PD. We are able to demonstrate a reduction in non-motor symptom (NMS) burden after the administration of nabilone. As impairment of attention and working memory have been described earlier as possible side effects, we assess cognitive performance using saccadic paradigms measured by an eye tracker. We do not observe a significant difference in any of the saccadic paradigms between PD patients on placebo versus those treated with nabilone. We, therefore, conclude that top-down inhibitory control is not affected by the tetrahydrocannabinol analogue. Nabilone did not significantly worsen cognitive performance and appears to be safe to use in selected PD patients who suffer from disabling NMS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase enzyme activity and susceptibility to lead toxicity in Uganda’s urban children [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa escalate environmental lead levels and subsequently blood lead levels in children. Its levels in one’s environment account for their blood lead levels. One’s susceptibility to lead toxicity is governed by nutrition status, age and genetics. This study aimed at expounding susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda. Methods: A total of 198 blood samples were spectrophotometrically analysed for blood lead levels (BLL), hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism.  Results: Up to 99.5% of the total samples analyzed coded for ALAD1 allele compared to 0.05% that coded for ALAD2. There was a significant relationship between BLL, Hb status and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2 and ALAD2-2) in strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p -value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, p -value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, p -value = ˂ 0.001). Conclusions: Majority of children in Uganda code for the ALAD1 allele, which is important for blood lead ions hoarding during lead toxicity. Hoarding of blood lead not only delays exposure effects but also accumulates its levels in deposit tissues and this poses adverse effects later in their lives

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Gustatory Cortex Is Involved in Evidence Accumulation during Food Choice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Food choice is one of the most fundamental and most frequent value-based decisions for all animals including humans. However, the neural circuitry involved in food-based decisions is only recently being addressed. Given the relatively fast dynamics of decision formation, electroencephalography (EEG)-informed fMRI analysis is highly beneficial for localizing this circuitry in humans. Here, by using the EEG correlates of evidence accumulation in a simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI dataset, we found a significant role for the right temporal-parietal operculum (PO) and medial insula including gustatory cortex (GC) in binary choice between food items. These activations were uncovered by using the "EEG energy" (power 2 of EEG) as the BOLD regressor and were missed if conventional analysis with the EEG signal itself were to be used, in agreement with theoretical predictions for EEG and BOLD relations. No significant positive correlations were found with higher powers of EEG (powers 3 or 4) pointing to specificity and sufficiency of EEG energy as the main correlate of the BOLD response. This finding extends the role of cortical areas traditionally involved in palatability processing to value-based decision-making and offers the "EEG energy" as a key regressor of BOLD response in simultaneous EEG-fMRI designs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Glutamate Transporters EAAT2 and EAAT5 Differentially Shape Synaptic Transmission from Rod Bipolar Cell Terminals</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) control visual signal transmission in the retina by rapidly removing glutamate released from photoreceptors and bipolar cells (BCs). Although it has been reported that EAAT2 and EAAT5 are expressed at presynaptic terminals of photoreceptors and some BCs in mammals, the distinct functions of these two glutamate transporters in retinal synaptic transmission, especially at a single synapse, remain elusive. In this study, we found that EAAT2 was expressed in all BC types while coexisting with EAAT5 in rod bipolar (RB) cells and several types of cone BCs from mice of either sex. Our immunohistochemical study, together with a recently published literature (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B17">Gehlen et al., 2021</cross-ref>), showed that EAAT2 and EAAT5 were both located in RB axon terminals near release sites. Optogenetic, electrophysiological and pharmacological analyses, however, demonstrated that EAAT2 and EAAT5 regulated neurotransmission at RB-&gt;AII amacrine cell synapses in significantly different ways: EAAT5 dramatically affected both the peak amplitude and kinetics of postsynaptic responses in AIIs, whereas EAAT2 had either relatively small or opposite effects. By contrast, blockade of EAAT1/GLAST, which was exclusively expressed in Mu&#x0308;ller cells, showed no obvious effect on AII responses, indicating that glutamate uptake by Mu&#x0308;ller cells did not influence synaptic transmission from RB terminals. Furthermore, we found that temporal resolution at RB-&gt;AII synapses was reduced substantially by blockade of EAAT5 but not EAAT2. Taken together, our work reveals the distinct functions of EAAT2 and EAAT5 in signal transmission at RB ribbon synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Cortical Inflammation, Cognitive Impairment, and Immune Reactivity Associated with Diffuse Brain Injury Are Ameliorated by Forced Turnover of Microglia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative complications that may develop after injury. Increased microglial reactivity following TBI may underlie chronic neuroinflammation, neuropathology, and exaggerated responses to immune challenges. Therefore, the goal of this study was to force turnover of trauma-associated microglia that develop after diffuse TBI and determine whether this alleviated chronic inflammation, improved functional recovery and attenuated reduced immune reactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Male mice received a midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI) and 7 d later were subjected to a forced microglia turnover paradigm using CSF1R antagonism (PLX5622). At 30 d postinjury (dpi), cortical gene expression, dendritic complexity, myelin content, neuronal connectivity, cognition, and immune reactivity were assessed. Myriad neuropathology-related genes were increased 30 dpi in the cortex, and 90% of these gene changes were reversed by microglial turnover. Reduced neuronal connectivity was evident 30 dpi and these deficits were attenuated by microglial turnover. TBI-associated dendritic remodeling and myelin alterations, however, remained 30 dpi independent of microglial turnover. In assessments of functional recovery, increased depressive-like behavior, and cognitive impairment 30 dpi were ameliorated by microglia turnover. To investigate microglial priming and reactivity 30 dpi, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS. This immune challenge caused prolonged lethargy, sickness behavior, and microglial reactivity in the TBI mice. These extended complications with LPS in TBI mice were prevented by microglia turnover. Collectively, microglial turnover 7 dpi alleviated behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with microglial priming and immune reactivity 30 dpi.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A striking feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), even mild injuries, is that over 70% of individuals have long-term neuropsychiatric complications. Chronic inflammatory processes are implicated in the pathology of these complications and these issues can be exaggerated by immune challenge. Therefore, our goal was to force the turnover of microglia 7 d after TBI. This subacute 7 d postinjury (dpi) time point is a critical transitional period in the shift toward chronic inflammatory processes and microglia priming. This forced microglia turnover intervention in mice attenuated the deficits in behavior and cognition 30 dpi. Moreover, microglia priming and immune reactivity after TBI were also reduced with microglia turnover. Therefore, microglia represent therapeutic targets after TBI to reduce persistent neuroinflammation and improve recovery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human APOER2 Isoforms Have Differential Cleavage Events and Synaptic Properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (APOER2) is a type I transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain (ECD) and a short cytoplasmic tail. APOER2-ECD contains several ligand-binding domains (LBDs) that are organized into exons with aligning phase junctions, which allows for in-frame exon cassette splicing events. We have identified 25 human APOER2 isoforms from cerebral cortex using gene-specific APOER2 primers, where the majority are exon-skipping events within the N-terminal LBD regions compared with six identified in the heart. APOER2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage in response to ligand binding that releases a C-terminal fragment (CTF) and transcriptionally active intracellular domain (ICD). We tested whether the diversity of human brain-specific APOER2 variants affects APOER2 cleavage. We found isoforms with differing numbers of ligand-binding repeats generated different amounts of CTFs compared with full-length APOER2 (APOER2-FL). Specifically, APOER2 isoforms lacking exons 5&ndash;8 (ex5&ndash;8) and lacking exons 4&ndash;6 (ex4&ndash;6) generated the highest and lowest amounts of CTF generation, respectively, in response to APOE peptide compared with APOER2-FL. The differential CTF generation of ex5&ndash;8 and ex4&ndash;6 coincides with the proteolytic release of the ICD, which mediates transcriptional activation facilitated by the Mint1 adaptor protein. Functionally, we demonstrated loss of mouse <I>Apoer2</I> decreased miniature event frequency in excitatory synapses, which may be because of a decrease in the total number of synapses and/or VAMP2 positive neurons. Lentiviral infection with human APOER2-FL or ex4&ndash;6 isoform in <I>Apoer2</I> knockout neurons restored the miniature event frequency but not ex5&ndash;8 isoform. These results suggest that human APOER2 isoforms have differential cleavage events and synaptic properties.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans and mice share virtually the same number of protein-coding genes. However, humans have greater complexity of any higher eukaryotic organisms by encoding multiple protein forms through alternative splicing modifications. Alternative splicing allows pre-mRNAs transcribed from genes to be spliced in different arrangements, producing structurally and functionally distinct protein variants that increase proteomic diversity and are particularly prevalent in the human brain. Here, we identified 25 distinct human APOER2 splice variants from the cerebral cortex using gene-specific APOER2 primers, where the majority are exon-skipping events that exclude N-terminal ligand-binding regions of APOER2. We show that some of the APOER2 variants have differential proteolytic properties in response to APOE ligand and exhibit distinct synaptic properties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Fibroblastic SMOC2 Suppresses Mechanical Nociception by Inhibiting Coupled Activation of Primary Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nociceptive information is detected and transmitted by neurons in the DRG. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed the molecular profile of various cell types, including fibroblasts in the DRG. However, the role of molecules in fibroblasts needs to be elucidated in nociceptive regulation. Here, we found that secreted modular calcium-binding protein 2 (SMOC2) was secreted by fibroblasts to become a component of basement membrane and envelop the unit consisting of DRG neurons and attached satellite glial cells. KO of <I>Smoc2</I> in both sexes of mice led to increased neuronal clusters and decreased mechanical threshold, but unchanged noxious thermal response. Knockdown of <I>Smoc2</I> in the DRG phenocopied the behavioral performance by <I>Smoc2</I> KO in both sexes of mice. <I>In vivo</I> calcium imaging showed that <I>Smoc2</I> KO increased coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons induced by nociceptive mechanical stimuli, which was reversed by DRG injection of SMOC2. Importantly, SMOC2 interacted with P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and suppressed ATP-induced activation in HEK293 cells expressing this receptor. Injection of A740003, an antagonist of P2X7R, to the DRG reduced coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons induced by nociceptive mechanical stimuli but did not further enhance the SMOC2-inhibited effect. Furthermore, peripheral inflammation resulted in a decreased SMOC2 and increased neuronal clusters. DRG injection of SMOC2 inhibited the neuronal coupling resulted from peripheral inflammation. This study reveals a specific role of fibroblastic SMOC2 in suppressing mechanical nociception through inhibiting the communication of adjacent DRG neurons, which provides an important mechanism of fibroblasts in nociceptive regulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The function of fibroblastic molecules is rarely noticed in the regulation of nociceptive sensation. Here, we reveal that fibroblastic SMOC2 is secreted to be a component of basement membrane and surrounded the unit consisting of DRG neuron and attached satellite glial cells. SMOC2 is required for maintaining the basal mechanical nociceptive threshold in the DRG. Loss of SMOC2 leads to the increased coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons induced by noxious mechanical stimuli. Peripheral inflammation causes decreased fibroblast cells and SMOC2, which may result in the increase of coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons. Mechanistically, SMOC2 interacts with and suppresses satellite glial P2X7 receptor to inhibit the coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Nogo-66 Receptors NgR1 and NgR3 Are Required for Commissural Axon Pathfinding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nogo-66 receptors (NgR1-3) are glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-linked proteins that belong to the leucine-rich repeat superfamily. Through binding to myelin-associated inhibitors, NgRs contribute to the inhibition of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury. Their role in limiting synaptic plasticity and axonal outgrowth in the adult CNS has been described previously, but not much is known about their role during the development of the nervous system. Here, we show that NgR1 and NgR3 mRNAs are expressed during spinal cord development of the chicken embryo. In particular, they are expressed in the dI1 subpopulation of commissural neurons during the time when their axons navigate toward and across the floorplate, the ventral midline of the spinal cord. To assess a potential role of NgR1 and NgR3 in axon guidance, we downregulated them using <I>in ovo</I> RNAi and analyzed the trajectory of commissural axons by tracing them in open-book preparations of spinal cords. Our results show that loss of either NgR1 or NgR3 causes axons to stall in the midline area and to interfere with the rostral turn of postcrossing axons. In addition, we also show that NgR1, but not NgR3, requires neuronal PlexinA2 for the regulation of commissural axon guidance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over the last decades, many studies have focused on the role of NgRs, particularly NgR1, in axonal regeneration in the injured adult CNS. Here, we show a physiological role of NgRs in guiding commissural axons during early development of the chicken spinal cord <I>in vivo</I>. Both NgR1 and NgR3 are required for midline crossing and subsequent turning of postcrossing axons into the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord. NgR1, but not NgR3, forms a receptor complex with PlexinA2 during axon guidance. Overall, these findings provide a link between neural regenerative mechanisms and developmental processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Retinal Basis of Light Aversion in Neonatal Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aversive responses to bright light (photoaversion) require signaling from the eye to the brain. Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) encode absolute light intensity and are thought to provide the light signals for photoaversion. Consistent with this, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion before the developmental onset of image vision, and melanopsin deletion abolishes photoaversion in neonates. It is not well understood how the population of ipRGCs, which constitutes multiple physiologically distinct types (denoted M1-M6 in mouse), encodes light stimuli to produce an aversive response. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that M1 ipRGCs that lack the Brn3b transcription factor drive photoaversion in neonatal mice. First, neonatal mice lacking TRPC6 and TRPC7 ion channels failed to turn away from bright light, while two photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of their acutely isolated retinas revealed reduced photosensitivity in M1 ipRGCs, but not other ipRGC types. Second, mice in which all ipRGC types except for Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs are ablated exhibited normal photoaversion. Third, pharmacological blockade or genetic knockout of gap junction channels expressed by ipRGCs, which reduces the light sensitivity of M2-M6 ipRGCs in the neonatal retina, had small effects on photoaversion only at the brightest light intensities. Finally, M1s were not strongly depolarized by spontaneous retinal waves, a robust source of activity in the developing retina that depolarizes all other ipRGC types. M1s therefore constitute a separate information channel between the neonatal retina and brain that could ensure behavioral responses to light but not spontaneous retinal waves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At an early stage of development, before the maturation of photoreceptor input to the retina, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion. On exposure to bright light, they turn away and emit ultrasonic vocalizations, a cue to their parents to return them to the nest. Neonatal photoaversion is mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), a small percentage of the retinal ganglion cell population that express the photopigment melanopsin and depolarize directly in response to light. This study shows that photoaversion is mediated by a subset of ipRGCs, called M1-ipRGCs. Moreover, M1-ipRGCs have reduced responses to retinal waves, providing a mechanism by which the mouse distinguishes light stimulation from developmental patterns of spontaneous activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Robust Coding of Eye Position in Posterior Parietal Cortex despite Context-Dependent Tuning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) encode many aspects of the sensory world (e.g., scene structure), the posture of the body, and plans for action. For a downstream computation, however, only some of these dimensions are relevant; the rest are "nuisance variables" because their influence on neural activity changes with sensory and behavioral context, potentially corrupting the read-out of relevant information. Here we show that a key postural variable for vision (eye position) is represented robustly in male macaque PPC across a range of contexts, although the tuning of single neurons depended strongly on context. Contexts were defined by different stages of a visually guided reaching task, including (1) a visually sparse epoch, (2) a visually rich epoch, (3) a "go" epoch in which the reach was cued, and (4) during the reach itself. Eye position was constant within trials but varied across trials in a 3 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 3 grid spanning 24&deg; <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 24&deg;. Using demixed principal component analysis of neural spike-counts, we found that the subspace of the population response encoding eye position is orthogonal to that encoding task context. Accordingly, a context-naive (fixed-parameter) decoder was nevertheless able to estimate eye position reliably across contexts. Errors were small given the sample size (~1.78&deg;) and would likely be even smaller with larger populations. Moreover, they were comparable to that of decoders that were optimized for each context. Our results suggest that population codes in PPC shield encoded signals from crosstalk to support robust sensorimotor transformations across contexts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) which are sensitive to gaze direction are thought to play a key role in spatial perception and behavior (e.g., reaching, navigation), and provide a potential substrate for brain-controlled prosthetics. Many, however, change their tuning under different sensory and behavioral contexts, raising the prospect that they provide unreliable representations of egocentric space. Here, we analyze the structure of encoding dimensions for gaze direction and context in PPC during different stages of a visually guided reaching task. We use demixed dimensionality reduction and decoding techniques to show that the coding of gaze direction in PPC is mostly invariant to context. This suggests that PPC can provide reliable spatial information across sensory and behavioral contexts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity Subspaces in Medial Prefrontal Cortex Distinguish States of the World</a></h4>

              
                <p>Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behavior, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyze here mPfC population activity of male rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm end followed by a self-paced return during the intertrial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a role in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task, the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Common Microscale and Macroscale Principles of Connectivity in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain requires efficient information transfer between neurons and large-scale brain regions. Brain connectivity follows predictable organizational principles. At the cellular level, larger supragranular pyramidal neurons have larger, more branched dendritic trees, more synapses, and perform more complex computations; at the macroscale, region-to-region connections display a diverse architecture with highly connected hub areas facilitating complex information integration and computation. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the branching structure of large-scale region-to-region connectivity follows similar organizational principles as the neuronal scale. We examine microscale connectivity of basal dendritic trees of supragranular pyramidal neurons (300+) across 10 cortical areas in five human donor brains (1 male, 4 female). Dendritic complexity was quantified as the number of branch points, tree length, spine count, spine density, and overall branching complexity. High-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI was used to construct white matter trees of corticocortical wiring. Examining complexity of the resulting white matter trees using the same measures as for dendritic trees shows heteromodal association areas to have larger, more complex white matter trees than primary areas (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.0001) and macroscale complexity to run in parallel with microscale measures, in terms of number of inputs (<I>r</I> = 0.677, <I>p</I> = 0.032), branch points (<I>r</I> = 0.797, <I>p</I> = 0.006), tree length (<I>r</I> = 0.664, <I>p</I> = 0.036), and branching complexity (<I>r</I> = 0.724, <I>p</I> = 0.018). Our findings support the integrative theory that brain connectivity follows similar principles of connectivity at neuronal and macroscale levels and provide a framework to study connectivity changes in brain conditions at multiple levels of organization.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Within the human brain, cortical areas are involved in a wide range of processes, requiring different levels of information integration and local computation. At the cellular level, these regional differences reflect a predictable organizational principle with larger, more complexly branched supragranular pyramidal neurons in higher order regions. We hypothesized that the 3D branching structure of macroscale corticocortical connections follows the same organizational principles as the cellular scale. Comparing branching complexity of dendritic trees of supragranular pyramidal neurons and of MRI-based regional white matter trees of macroscale connectivity, we show that macroscale branching complexity is larger in higher order areas and that microscale and macroscale complexity go hand in hand. Our findings contribute to a multiscale integrative theory of brain connectivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Neurodevelopmental Shift in Reward Circuitry from Mother's to Nonfamilial Voices in Adolescence</a></h4>

              
                <p>The social worlds of young children primarily revolve around parents and caregivers, who play a key role in guiding children's social and cognitive development. However, a hallmark of adolescence is a shift in orientation toward nonfamilial social targets, an adaptive process that prepares adolescents for their independence. Little is known regarding neurobiological signatures underlying changes in adolescents' social orientation. Using functional brain imaging of human voice processing in children and adolescents (ages 7-16), we demonstrate distinct neural signatures for mother's voice and nonfamilial voices across child and adolescent development in reward and social valuation systems, instantiated in nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. While younger children showed greater activity in these brain systems for mother's voice compared with nonfamilial voices, older adolescents showed the opposite effect with increased activity for nonfamilial compared with mother's voice. Findings uncover a critical role for reward and social valuative brain systems in the pronounced changes in adolescents' orientation toward nonfamilial social targets. Our approach provides a template for examining developmental shifts in social reward and motivation in individuals with pronounced social impairments, including adolescents with autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Children's social worlds undergo a transformation during adolescence. While socialization in young children revolves around parents and caregivers, adolescence is characterized by a shift in social orientation toward nonfamilial social partners. Here we show that this shift is reflected in neural activity measured from reward processing regions in response to brief vocal samples. When younger children hear their mother's voice, reward processing regions show greater activity compared with when they hear nonfamilial, unfamiliar voices. Strikingly, older adolescents show the opposite effect, with increased activity for nonfamilial compared with mother's voice. Findings identify the brain basis of adolescents' switch in social orientation toward nonfamilial social partners and provides a template for understanding neurodevelopment in clinical populations with social and communication difficulties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Isolating the Neural Substrates of Visually Guided Attention Orienting in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural processes that enable healthy humans to orient attention to sudden visual events are poorly understood because they are tightly intertwined with purely sensory processes. Here we isolated visually guided orienting activity from sensory activity using event-related potentials (ERPs). By recording ERPs to a lateral stimulus and comparing waveforms obtained under conditions of attention and inattention, we identified an early positive deflection over the ipsilateral visual cortex that was associated with the covert orienting of visual attention to the stimulus. Across five experiments with male and female adult participants, this ipsilateral visual orienting activity (VOA) could be distinguished from purely sensory-evoked activity and from other top-down spatial attention effects. The VOA was linked with behavioral measures of orienting, being significantly larger when the stimulus was detected rapidly than when it was detected more slowly, and its presence was independent of saccadic eye movements toward the targets. The VOA appears to be a specific neural index of the visually guided orienting of attention to a stimulus that appears abruptly in an otherwise uncluttered visual field.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The study of visual attention orienting has been an important impetus for the field of cognitive neuroscience. Seminal reaction-time studies demonstrated that a suddenly appearing visual stimulus attracts attention involuntarily, but the neural processes associated with visually guided attention orienting have been difficult to isolate because they are intertwined with sensory processes that trigger the orienting. Here, we disentangled orienting activity from sensory activity using scalp recordings of event-related electrical activity in the human brain. A specific neural index of visually guided attention orienting was identified. Surprisingly, whereas peripheral sensory stimulation is processed initially and predominantly by the contralateral visual cortex, this electrophysiological index of visual orienting was recorded over the cerebral hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the attention-capturing stimulus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aberrant Phase Precession of Lateral Septal Cells in a Maternal Immune Activation Model of Schizophrenia Risk May Disrupt the Integration of Location with Reward</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spatial memory and reward processing are known to be disrupted in schizophrenia. Since the lateral septum (LS) may play an important role in the integration of location and reward, we examined the effect of maternal immune activation (MIA), a known schizophrenia risk factor, on spatial representation in the rat LS. In support of a previous study, we found that spatial location is represented as a phase code in the rostral LS of adult male rats, so that LS cell spiking shifts systematically against the phase of the hippocampal, theta-frequency, local field potential as an animal moves along a track toward a reward (phase precession). Whereas shallow precession slopes were observed in control group cells, they were steeper in the MIA animals, such that firing frequently precessed across several theta cycles as the animal moved along the length of the apparatus, with subsequent ambiguity in the phase representation of location. Furthermore, an analysis of the phase trajectories of the control group cells revealed that the population tended to converge toward a common firing phase as the animal approached the reward location. This suggested that phase coding in these cells might signal both reward location and the distance to reward. By comparison, the degree of phase convergence in the MIA-group cells was weak, and the region of peak convergence was distal to the reward location. These findings suggest that a schizophrenia risk factor disrupts the phase-based encoding of location&ndash;reward relationships in the LS, potentially smearing reward representations across space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is unclear how spatial or contextual information generated by hippocampal cells is converted to a code that can be used to signal reward location in regions, such as the VTA. Here we provide evidence that the firing phase of cells in the lateral septum, a region that links the two areas, may code reward location in the firing phase of cells. This phase coding is disrupted in a maternal immune activation model of schizophrenia risk such that representations of reward may be smeared across space in maternal immune activation animals. This could potentially underlie erroneous reward processing and misattribution of salience in schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Outcome-Locked Cholinergic Signaling Suppresses Prefrontal Encoding of Stimulus Associations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetylcholine (ACh) is thought to control arousal, attention, and learning by slowly modulating cortical excitability and plasticity. Recent studies, however, discovered that cholinergic neurons emit precisely timed signals about the aversive outcome at millisecond precision. To investigate the functional relevance of such phasic cholinergic signaling, we manipulated and monitored cholinergic terminals in the mPFC while male mice associated a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) with mildly aversive eyelid shock (US) over a short temporal gap. Optogenetic inhibition of cholinergic terminals during the US promoted the formation of the CS&ndash;US association. On the contrary, optogenetic excitation of cholinergic terminals during the US blocked the association formation. The bidirectional behavioral effects paralleled the corresponding change in the expression of an activity-regulated gene, c-Fos in the mPFC. In contrast, optogenetic inhibition of cholinergic terminals during the CS impaired associative learning, whereas their excitation had marginal effects. In parallel, photometric recording from cholinergic terminals in the mPFC revealed strong innate phasic responses to the US. With subsequent CS&ndash;US pairings, cholinergic terminals weakened the responses to the US while developing strong responses to the CS. The across-session changes in the CS- and US-evoked terminal responses were correlated with associative memory strength. These findings suggest that phasic cholinergic signaling in the mPFC exerts opposite effects on aversive associative learning depending on whether it is emitted by the outcome or the cue.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Drugs compensating for the decline of acetylcholine (ACh) are used for cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, their beneficial effects are limited, demanding new strategies based on better understandings of how ACh modulates cognition. Here, we report that by manipulating ACh signals in the mPFC, we can control the strength of aversive associative learning in mice. Specifically, the suppression of ACh signals during an aversive outcome facilitated its association with a preceding cue. In contrast, the suppression of ACh signals during the cue impaired learning. Considering that this paradigm depends on the brain regions affected in Alzheimer's disease, our findings indicate that precisely timed control of ACh signals is essential to refine ACh-based strategies for cognitive enhancement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of genetic factors in microtia: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microtia is a congenital malformation of the outer ears caused by improper embryonic development. The origin of microtia and causes of its variations remain unknown. Because of the lack of clarity regarding the role of genetic variables in microtia, we conducted a systematic review to qualitatively identify the genes most important in the development of microtia to provide an up-to-date review. Methods: Using six search engines, we searched all published studies related to the genetic factors of isolated microtia and syndromic microtia. The identified publications were screened and selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by the authors and assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. We found 40 studies, including 22 studies on syndromic microtia and 18 studies on isolated microtia. Data extraction of each study was arranged in tabulation for syndromic and isolated microtia. The extracted data were: first author’s surname, year of publication, country of origin, study design, sample characteristic and gene assessed. Results: After the data were extracted, analyzed, and reviewed, the most common gene suspected to be involved in isolated microtia was Homeobox A2 (HOXA2, 12.1%). Conversely, in syndromic microtia, the two most common genes supposed to play a role were Fibroblast Growth Factor 3 (FGF3, 47.2%) and Treacher–Collins–Franceschetti syndrome 1 (TCOF1, 30.2%). From the studies, the three most prevalent genes associated with microtia were HOXA2 (10%), FGF3 (8.4%), and TCOF1 (5.4%). In syndromic microtia, the most common mutation types were deletion in TCOF1 (46.9%) and missense and deletion in FGF3 (both 38%), and in isolated microtia, the most common mutation type was silent in HOXA2 (54.2%). Conclusions: In summary, genetic factors are involved in microtia; thus, molecular analysis is strongly advised. PROSPERO registration: CRD42021287294 (25/10/21).

                COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with a rapidly developing global health and economic crisis. Variations in the disease have been observed and have been associated with the genomic sequence of either the human host or the pathogen. Worldwide scientists scrambled initially to recruit patient cohorts to try and identify risk factors. A resource that presented itself early on was the UK Biobank (UKBB), which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. To enable COVID-19 studies, UKBB is now receiving COVID-19 test data for their participants every two weeks. In addition, UKBB is delivering more frequent updates of death and hospital inpatient data (including critical care admissions) on the UKBB Data Portal. This frequently changing dataset requires a tool that can rapidly process and analyse up-to-date data. We developed an R package specifically for the UKBB COVID-19 data, which summarises COVID-19 test results, performs association tests between COVID-19 susceptibility/severity and potential risk factors such as age, sex, blood type, comorbidities and generates input files for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By applying the R package to data released in April 2021, we found that age, body mass index, socioeconomic status and smoking are positively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Males are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than females. People staying in aged care homes have a higher chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By performing GWAS, we replicated the 3p21.31 genetic finding for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The ability to iteratively perform such analyses is highly relevant since the UKBB data is updated frequently. As a caveat, users must arrange their own access to the UKBB data to use the R package.

                The increase in the consumption of pulses can perform a key role in preventing protein deficiency among people specifically in developing countries. The fortification of whole wheat bread with pulses is an efficient approach to boost the nutritional profile of bread as protein, starches, dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals are all abundant in pulses. The optimum ratio of the pulse to whole wheat flour is necessary to determine for producing bread with good quality, sensory attributes, and handling properties. This review investigated the impact of the pulse addition on the whole wheat dough rheology, bread quality, and sensory characteristics, with a particular focus on dough stability, elasticity, strength, and bread volume. The improvement in the nutritional value as well as the negative impact of pulses on whole-wheat bread was also reviewed. The research gaps in pulse supplemented whole grains bread were identified, and further study directions were recommended. Fortification of whole wheat bread with pulses produced affordable bread with a balanced diet for all classes of people. The addition of a higher level of pulses develops a weak gluten structure, which negatively affects dough stability, strength, elasticity, and handling properties. The volume of bread also decreased, and the off-flavor compound produced at a higher level of pulse fortification. The addition of additives and prior processing of pulses not only promote the nutritional value but also produce bread with better dough stability, bread volume, and sensory score.

                Research that investigates respective researchers’ engagement in Open Science varies widely in the topics addressed, methods employed, and disciplines investigated, which makes it difficult to integrate and compare its results. To investigate current outcomes of Open Science research, and to get a better understanding on well-researched topics and research gaps, we aimed at providing an openly accessible overview of empirical studies that focus on different aspects of Open Science in different scientific disciplines, academic groups and geographical regions. In this paper, we describe a data set of studies about Open Science practices retrieved following a PRISMA approach to compile a literature review. We included studies from the Scopus and Web of Science databases with keywords relating to Open Science between the years 2000 and 2020, as well as a snowball search for relevant articles. Studies that did not investigate any aspect of Open Science, or weren’t peer-reviewed were excluded, resulting in a total of 695 remaining studies. The data set was collaboratively annotated to ensure intercoder reliability of the coded data.

                Background: In recent years, human activity recognition (HAR) has been an active research topic due to its widespread application in various fields such as healthcare, sports, patient monitoring, etc. HAR approaches can be categorised as handcrafted feature methods (HCF) and deep learning methods (DL). HCF involves complex data pre-processing and manual feature extraction in which the models may be exposed to high bias and crucial implicit pattern loss. Hence, DL approaches are introduced due to their exceptional recognition performance. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts spatial features while preserving localisation. However, it hardly captures temporal features. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learns temporal features, but it is susceptible to gradient vanishing and suffers from short-term memory problems. Unlike RNN, Long-Short Term Memory network has a relatively longer-term dependency. However, it consumes higher computation and memory because it computes and stores partial results at each level. Methods: This work proposes a novel multiscale temporal convolutional network (MSTCN) based on the Inception model with a temporal convolutional architecture. Unlike HCF methods, MSTCN requires minimal pre-processing and no manual feature engineering. Further, multiple separable convolutions with different-sized kernels are used in MSTCN for multiscale feature extraction. Dilations are applied to each separable convolution to enlarge the receptive fields without increasing the model parameters. Moreover, residual connections are utilised to prevent information loss and gradient vanishing. These features enable MSTCN to possess a longer effective history while maintaining a relatively low in-network computation. Results: The performance of MSTCN is evaluated on UCI and WISDM datasets using a subject independent protocol with no overlapping subjects between the training and testing sets. MSTCN achieves accuracies of 97.42 on UCI and 96.09 on WISDM. Conclusion: The proposed MSTCN dominates the other state-of-the-art methods by acquiring high recognition accuracies without requiring any manual feature engineering.

A number of nonsynonymous mutations located at different SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been reported by multiple studies. However, there are limited computational studies on the biological impacts of these mutations on the structure and function of the proteins.   Methods: In our study nonsynonymous mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their frequencies were identified from 30,229 sequences. Subsequently, the effects of the top 10 highest frequency nonsynonymous mutations of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed using bioinformatics tools including co-mutation analysis, prediction of the protein structure stability and flexibility analysis, and prediction of the protein functions.   Results: A total of 231 nonsynonymous mutations were identified from 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The top 10 nonsynonymous mutations affecting nine amino acid residues were ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF1b nsp12 P323L and A423V, S protein N501Y and D614G, ORF3a Q57H, N protein P151L, R203K and G204R. Many nonsynonymous mutations showed a high concurrence ratio, suggesting these mutations may evolve together and interact functionally. Our result showed that ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF3a Q57H and N protein P151L mutations may be deleterious to the function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In addition, ORF1a nsp5 P108S and S protein D614G may destabilize the protein structures while S protein D614G may have a more open conformation compared to the wild type.   Conclusion: The biological consequences of these nonsynonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins should be further validated by in vivo and in vitro experimental studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatially resolved in silico modeling of NKG2D signaling kinetics suggests a key role of NKG2D and Vav1 Co-clustering in generating natural killer cell activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rajdeep Kaur Grewal, Jayajit Das</p>

Natural Killer (NK) cells provide key resistance against viral infections and tumors. A diverse set of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors (NKRs) interact with cognate ligands presented by target host cells, where integration of dueling signals initiated by the ligand-NKR interactions determines NK cell activation or tolerance. Imaging experiments over decades have shown micron and sub-micron scale spatial clustering of activating and inhibitory NKRs. The mechanistic roles of these clusters in affecting downstream signaling and activation are often unclear. To this end, we developed a preDISCLOSUREdictive in silico framework by combining spatially resolved mechanistic agent based modeling, published TIRF imaging data, and parameter estimation to determine mechanisms by which formation and spatial movements of activating NKG2D microclusters affect early time NKG2D signaling kinetics in a human cell line NKL. We show co-clustering of NKG2D and the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 in NKG2D microclusters plays a dominant role over ligand (ULBP3) rebinding in increasing production of phospho-Vav1(pVav1), an activation marker of early NKG2D signaling. The in silico model successfully predicts several scenarios of inhibition of NKG2D signaling and time course of NKG2D spatial clustering over a short (~3 min) interval. Modeling shows the presence of a spatial positive feedback relating formation and centripetal movements of NKG2D microclusters, and pVav1 production offers flexibility towards suppression of activating signals by inhibitory KIR ligands organized in inhomogeneous spatial patterns (e.g., a ring). Our in silico framework marks a major improvement in developing spatiotemporal signaling models with quantitatively estimated model parameters using imaging data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CBEA: Competitive balances for taxonomic enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quang P. Nguyen, Anne G. Hoen, H. Robert Frost</p>

Research in human-associated microbiomes often involves the analysis of taxonomic count tables generated via high-throughput sequencing. It is difficult to apply statistical tools as the data is high-dimensional, sparse, and compositional. An approachable way to alleviate high-dimensionality and sparsity is to aggregate variables into pre-defined sets. Set-based analysis is ubiquitous in the genomics literature and has demonstrable impact on improving interpretability and power of downstream analysis. Unfortunately, there is a lack of sophisticated set-based analysis methods specific to microbiome taxonomic data, where current practice often employs abundance summation as a technique for aggregation. This approach prevents comparison across sets of different sizes, does not preserve inter-sample distances, and amplifies protocol bias. Here, we attempt to fill this gap with a new single-sample taxon enrichment method that uses a novel log-ratio formulation based on the competitive null hypothesis commonly used in the enrichment analysis literature. Our approach, titled competitive balances for taxonomic enrichment analysis (CBEA), generates sample-specific enrichment scores as the scaled log-ratio of the subcomposition defined by taxa within a set and the subcomposition defined by its complement. We provide sample-level significance testing by estimating an empirical null distribution of our test statistic with valid p-values. Herein, we demonstrate, using both real data applications and simulations, that CBEA controls for type I error, even under high sparsity and high inter-taxa correlation scenarios. Additionally, CBEA provides informative scores that can be inputs to downstream analyses such as prediction tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Negative feedback may suppress variation to improve collective foraging performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andreagiovanni Reina, James A. R. Marshall</p>

Social insect colonies use negative as well as positive feedback signals to regulate foraging behaviour. In ants and bees individual foragers have been observed to use negative pheromones or mechano-auditory signals to indicate that forage sources are not ideal, for example being unrewarded, crowded, or dangerous. Here we propose an additional function for negative feedback signals during foraging, variance reduction. We show that while on average populations will converge to desired distributions over forage patches both with and without negative feedback signals, in small populations negative feedback reduces variation around the target distribution compared to the use of positive feedback alone. Our results are independent of the nature of the target distribution, providing it can be achieved by foragers collecting only local information. Since robustness is a key aim for biological systems, and deviation from target foraging distributions may be costly, we argue that this could be a further important and hitherto overlooked reason that negative feedback signals are used by foraging social insects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Anomalous diffusion and asymmetric tempering memory in neutrophil chemotaxis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Dieterich, Otto Lindemann, Mats Leif Moskopp, Sebastien Tauzin, Anna Huttenlocher, Rainer Klages, Aleksei Chechkin, Albrecht Schwab</p>

The motility of neutrophils and their ability to sense and to react to chemoattractants in their environment are of central importance for the innate immunity. Neutrophils are guided towards sites of inflammation following the activation of G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors such as CXCR2 whose signaling strongly depends on the activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable TRPC6 channels. It is the aim of this study to analyze data sets obtained in vitro (murine neutrophils) and in vivo (zebrafish neutrophils) with a stochastic mathematical model to gain deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms. The model is based on the analysis of trajectories of individual neutrophils. Bayesian data analysis, including the covariances of positions for fractional Brownian motion as well as for exponentially and power-law tempered model variants, allows the estimation of parameters and model selection. Our model-based analysis reveals that wildtype neutrophils show pure superdiffusive fractional Brownian motion. This so-called anomalous dynamics is characterized by temporal long-range correlations for the movement into the direction of the chemotactic CXCL1 gradient. Pure superdiffusion is absent vertically to this gradient. This points to an asymmetric ‘memory’ of the migratory machinery, which is found both in vitro and in vivo. CXCR2 blockade and TRPC6-knockout cause tempering of temporal correlations in the chemotactic gradient. This can be interpreted as a progressive loss of memory, which leads to a marked reduction of chemotaxis and search efficiency of neutrophils. In summary, our findings indicate that spatially differential regulation of anomalous dynamics appears to play a central role in guiding efficient chemotactic behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Networks of necessity: Simulating COVID-19 mitigation strategies for disabled people and their caregivers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas E. Valles, Hannah Shoenhard, Joseph Zinski, Sarah Trick, Mason A. Porter, Michael R. Lindstrom</p>

A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is the limiting of in-person contacts. However, limiting contacts is impractical or impossible for the many disabled people who do not live in care facilities but still require caregivers to assist them with activities of daily living. We seek to determine which interventions can best prevent infections of disabled people and their caregivers. To accomplish this, we simulate COVID-19 transmission with a compartmental model that includes susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatically ill, hospitalized, and removed/recovered individuals. The networks on which we simulate disease spread incorporate heterogeneity in the risk levels of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening measures, and interaction distributions for four different groups (caregivers, disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). Of these groups, we find that the probability of becoming infected is largest for caregivers and second largest for disabled people. Consistent with this finding, our analysis of network structure illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality of the four groups. We find that two interventions—contact-limiting by all groups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers—most reduce the number of infections in disabled and caregiver populations. We also test which group of people spreads COVID-19 most readily by seeding infections in a subset of each group and comparing the total number of infections as the disease spreads. We find that caregivers are the most potent spreaders of COVID-19, particularly to other caregivers and to disabled people. We test where to use limited infection-blocking vaccine doses most effectively and find that (1) vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people from infection than vaccinating the general population or essential workers and that (2) vaccinating caregivers protects disabled people from infection about as effectively as vaccinating disabled people themselves. Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing, contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the exposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phase-locking patterns underlying effective communication in exact firing rate models of neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Reyner-Parra, Gemma Huguet</p>

Macroscopic oscillations in the brain have been observed to be involved in many cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. One of the suggested functions of the oscillations is to dynamically modulate communication between neural circuits. The Communication Through Coherence (CTC) theory proposes that oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in excitability of the neuronal populations. Thus, populations need to be properly phase-locked so that input volleys arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population to communicate effectively. Here, we present a modeling study to explore synchronization between neuronal circuits connected with unidirectional projections. We consider an Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons modeling a Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma (PING) rhythm. The network receives an external periodic input from either one or two sources, simulating the inputs from other oscillating neural groups. We use recently developed mean-field models which provide an exact description of the macroscopic activity of the spiking network. This low-dimensional mean field model allows us to use tools from bifurcation theory to identify the phase-locked states between the input and the target population as a function of the amplitude, frequency and coherence of the inputs. We identify the conditions for optimal phase-locking and effective communication. We find that inputs with high coherence can entrain the network for a wider range of frequencies. Besides, faster oscillatory inputs than the intrinsic network gamma cycle show more effective communication than inputs with similar frequency. Our analysis further shows that the entrainment of the network by inputs with higher frequency is more robust to distractors, thus giving them an advantage to entrain the network and communicate effectively. Finally, we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs in selective attention.

Therapeutic methods to modulate skin pigmentation has important implications for skin cancer prevention and for treating cutaneous hyperpigmentary conditions. Towards defining new potential targets, we followed temporal dynamics of melanogenesis using a cell-autonomous pigmentation model. Our study elucidates 3 dominant phases of synchronized metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. The melanogenic trigger is associated with high MITF levels along with rapid uptake of glucose. The transition to pigmented state is accompanied by increased glucose channelisation to anabolic pathways that support melanosome biogenesis. SREBF1-mediated up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis results in a transient accumulation of lipid droplets and enhancement of fatty acids oxidation through mitochondrial respiration. While this heightened bioenergetic activity is important to sustain melanogenesis, it impairs mitochondria lately, shifting the metabolism towards glycolysis. This recovery phase is accompanied by activation of the NRF2 detoxication pathway. Finally, we show that inhibitors of lipid metabolism can resolve hyperpigmentary conditions in a guinea pig UV-tanning model. Our study reveals rewiring of the metabolic circuit during melanogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of cutaneous diseases manifesting hyperpigmentary phenotype.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Exercise is an effective neuroprotective intervention that preserves retinal function and structure in several animal models of retinal degeneration. However, the retinal cell types governing exercise-induced neuroprotection remain elusive. Previously, we found exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection was associated with increased levels of retinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact signal transduction with its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB). Brain studies have shown astrocytes express BDNF and TrkB and that decreased BDNF–TrkB signaling in astrocytes contributes to neurodegeneration. Additionally, exercise has been shown to alter astrocyte morphology. Using a light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) model, we investigated how exercise influences retinal astrocytes in adult male BALB/c mice. Treadmill exercise in dim control and LIRD groups had increased astrocyte density, GFAP labeling, branching, dendritic endpoints, and arborization. Meanwhile, inactive LIRD animals had significant reductions in all measured parameters. Additionally, exercised groups had increased astrocytic BDNF expression that was visualized using proximity ligase assay. Isolated retinal astrocytes from exercised LIRD groups had significantly increased expression of a specific isoform of TrkB associated with cell survival, TrkB.FL. Conversely, inactive LIRD isolated retinal astrocytes had significantly increased expression of TrkB.T1, which has been implicated in neuronal cell death. Our data indicate exercise not only alters retinal astrocyte morphology but also promotes specific BDNF–TrkB signaling associated with cell survival and protection during retinal degeneration. These findings provide novel insights into the effects of treadmill exercise on retinal astrocyte morphology and cellular expression, highlighting retinal astrocytes as a potential cell type involved in BDNF–TrkB signaling.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are widely used to test the involvement of specific cortical regions in various domains such as cognition and emotion. Despite the capability of stimulation techniques to test causal directions, this approach has been only sparsely used to examine the cortical regulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) and to test current models in this regard. In this preregistered (PROSPERO) systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate, based on meta-regression, whether NIBS represents an effective method for modulating HR and HRV measures, and to evaluate whether the ANS is modulated by cortical mechanisms affected by NIBS. Here we have adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. In a series of four meta-analyses, a total of 131 effect sizes from 35 sham-controlled trials were analyzed using robust variance estimation random-effects meta-regression technique. NIBS was found to effectively modulate HR and HRV with small to medium effect sizes. Moderator analyses yielded significant differences in effects between stimulation of distinct cortical areas. Our results show that NIBS is a promising tool to investigate the cortical regulation of ANS, which may add to the existing brain imaging and animal study literature. Future research is needed to identify further factors modulating the size of effects. As many of the studies reviewed were found to be at high risk of bias, we recommend that methods to reduce potential risk of bias be used in the design and conduct of future studies.</p>

                Regulating energy metabolism is critical to maintain homeostasis of cellular and systemic functions. In the brain, specialised centres for energy storage regulation finely communicate with the periphery and integrate signals about internal states. As a result, the behavioural responses can be directly adjusted accordingly to the energetic demands. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, one of these regulatory centres is the mushroom bodies (MBs), a brain region involved in olfactory memory. The integration of metabolic cues by the MBs has a crucial impact on learned behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Seipin transmembrane segments critically function in triglyceride nucleation and lipid droplet budding from the membrane</a></h4>

              
                Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles formed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to store triacylglycerol (TG) and sterol esters. The ER protein seipin is key for LD biogenesis. Seipin forms a cage-like structure, with each seipin monomer containing a conserved hydrophobic helix (HH) and two transmembrane (TM) segments. How the different parts of seipin function in TG nucleation and LD budding is poorly understood. Here, we utilized molecular dynamics simulations of human seipin, along with cell-based experiments, to study seipin's functions in protein-lipid interactions, lipid diffusion, and LD maturation. An all-atom (AA) simulation indicates that seipin TM segment residues and hydrophobic helices residues located in the phospholipid (PL) tail region of the bilayer attract TG. Simulating larger, growing LDs with coarse-grained (CG) models, we find that the seipin TM segments form a constricted neck structure to facilitate conversion of a flat oil lens into a budding LD. Using cell experiments and simulations, we also show that conserved, positively charged residues at the end of seipin's TM segments affect LD maturation. We propose a model in which seipin TM segments critically function in TG nucleation and LD growth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Notch-dependent and -independent transcription are modulated by tissue movements at gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Cells sense and integrate external information from diverse sources that include mechanical cues. Shaping of tissues during development may thus require coordination between mechanical forces from morphogenesis and cell-cell signalling to confer appropriate changes in gene expression. By live-imaging Notch-induced transcription in real time we have discovered that morphogenetic movements during Drosophila gastrulation bring about an increase in activity-levels of a Notch responsive enhancer. Mutations that disrupt the timing of gastrulation resulted in concomitant delays in transcription up-regulation that correlated with the start of mesoderm invagination. As a similar gastrulation-induced effect was detected when transcription was elicited by the intracellular domain NICD, it cannot be attributed to forces exerted on Notch receptor activation. A Notch independent vnd enhancer also exhibited a modest gastrulation-induced activity increase in the same stripe of cells. Together, these observations argue that gastrulation-associated forces act on the nucleus to modulate transcription levels. This regulation was uncoupled when the complex linking the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) was disrupted, indicating a likely conduit. We propose that the coupling between tissue level mechanics, arising from gastrulation, and enhancer activity represents a general mechanism for ensuring correct tissue specification during development and that Notch dependent enhancers are highly sensitive to this regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain computation of cognitive versus acoustic errors in music</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have evidenced how the local prediction of physical stimulus features may affect the neural processing of incoming stimuli. Less known are the effects of cognitive priors on predictive processes, and how the brain computes local versus cognitive predictions and their errors. Here, we determined the differential brain mechanisms underlying prediction errors related to high-level, cognitive priors for melody (rhythm, contour) versus low-level, local acoustic priors (tuning, timbre). We measured with magnetoencephalography the mismatch negativity (MMN) prediction error signal in 104 adults having varying levels of musical expertise. We discovered that the brain regions involved in predictive processes for local priors were primary and secondary auditory cortex and insula, whereas cognitive brain regions such as cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices were recruited for melodic errors in cognitive priors. The involvement of higher-level brain regions for computing cognitive errors was enhanced in musicians, especially in cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyri, and supplementary motor area. Overall, the findings expand knowledge on whole-brain mechanisms of predictive processing and the related MMN generators, previously mainly confined to the auditory cortex, to a frontal network that strictly depends on the type of priors that are to be computed by the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct nano-structures support a multifunctional role of actin at presynapses</a></h4>

              
                Synapses are the nexus of signal transmission and processing in the nervous system. Despite decades of work, the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton that concentrates at presynapses remain poorly known, hindering our comprehensive understanding of its roles in presynaptic physiology. In this work, we take advantage of a validated model of bead-induced presynapses to measure and visualize isolated presynaptic actin by diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopy. We first identify a major population of actin-enriched presynapses that concentrates more presynaptic components, and shows higher synaptic vesicle cycling than their non-enriched counterparts. Using pharmacological perturbations, we determine that an optimal amount of actin is necessary for this effect of actin enrichment. Contrasted modulation of this effect by actin nucleation inhibitors indicates its dependance on distinct presynaptic actin assemblies. Using Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM), we directly visualize these nano-structures in isolated presynapses, defining an actin mesh at the active zone, actin rails between the active zone and deeper reserve pools, and actin corrals around the whole presynaptic compartment. We finally show that these three types of presynaptic actin nano-structures are differentially affected by actin nucleation inhibitors, consistent with their effect on presynaptic component concentration and on synaptic vesicle cycling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the intrinsic curvature of animal whiskers</a></h4>

              
                Facial vibrissae (whiskers) are thin, tapered, and flexible hair-like structures that are an important source of tactile sensory information for many species of animals. In contrast to insect antennae, whiskers have no sensors along their lengths. Instead, when a whisker touches an object, the resulting deformation is transmitted to mechanoreceptors in a follicle at the whisker base. Previous work has shown that the mechanical signals transmitted along the whisker will depend strongly on the whiskers geometric parameters, in particular on its taper (how diameter varies with arc length) and on its intrinsic curvature. Although previous studies have largely agreed on how to define taper, multiple approaches have been used to quantify intrinsic curvature. The present work, compares and contrasts different mathematical methods to quantify intrinsic curvature, including polynomial, fractional exponent, elliptical, and Cesaro. Comparisons are performed across ten species of whiskered animals, ranging from rodents to pinnipeds. The fractional exponent model is shown to be a particularly promising approach for distinguishing between whiskers of different species. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using the different models for different modeling situations.

                Survival demands that safe and unsafe contexts are met with different locomotor profiles, yet whether striatal microcircuitry links contextual valence to spontaneous locomotor vigor is unresolved. Here we test for striosome contributions to spontaneous locomotion using ablation, calcium imaging and chemogenetics in the context of a modified Light/Dark box test. We found that locomotor speed reflects the unlearned, external valence differential present in this test, and that striosomes gate valence-oriented speed selection. Our data suggest that striosomes dampen motor vigor associated with lesser valence, or elevated anxiety.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual experience has opposing influences on the quality of stimulus representation in adult primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Transient dark exposure, typically 7-10 days in duration, followed by light reintroduction is an emerging treatment for improving the restoration of vison in amblyopic subjects whose occlusion is removed in adulthood. Dark exposure initiates homeostatic mechanisms that together with light-induced changes in cellular signaling pathways result in the re-engagement of juvenile-like plasticity in the adult such that previously deprived inputs can gain cortical territory. It is possible that dark exposure itself degrades visual responses, and this could place constraints on the optimal duration of dark exposure treatment. To determine whether eight days of dark exposure has a lasting negative impact on responses to classic grating stimuli, neural activity was recorded before and after dark exposure in awake head-fixed mice using 2-photon calcium imaging. Neural discriminability, assessed using classifiers, was transiently reduced following dark exposure; a decrease in response reliability across a broad range of spatial frequencies accounted for the disruption. Both discriminability and reliability recovered. Fixed classifiers were used to demonstrated that stimulus representation rebounded to the original, pre-deprivation state, thus DE did not appear to have a lasting negative impact on visual processing. Unexpectedly, we found that dark exposure significantly stabilized orientation preference and signal correlation. Our results reveal that natural vision exerts a disrupting influence on the stability of stimulus preference for classic grating stimuli, and at the same time improves neural discriminability for both low and high spatial frequency stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The vestibular calyceal junction is dismantled in response to diverse injuring stimuli in rats and humans</a></h4>

              
                Hair cell (HC) loss by epithelial extrusion has been described to occur in the vestibular system of rats and mice during the chronic ototoxicity caused by 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN). This is preceded by early dismantlement of the calyceal junction in the contact between type I HC (HCI) and calyx afferent terminals. In the present study, we evaluated whether these pathological phenomena have wider significance. First, we assessed their occurrence in rats receiving streptomycin for 3 to 8 weeks. Streptomycin caused a loss of vestibular function that was largely reversible and associated with a partial loss of HCI. In the calyces encasing the surviving HCI, we observed decreased expression of CASPR1 denoting calyceal junction dismantlement. We also recorded reduced numbers of pre-synaptic (ribeye) and post-synaptic (PSD95) puncta per cell, and KCNQ4 mislocalization. After washout, the CASPR1 label revealed calyceal junction rebuilding. Ultrastructural data also showed calyx junction dismantlement and calyx fragmentation. Limited but clear evidence for HC extrusion was obtained by scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescent analysis. Second, we evaluated human sensory epithelia from therapeutic labyrinthectomy and trans-labyrinthine. In some of the samples, patched CASPR1 label indicated that a process of calyx junction dismantlement could be in progress. The present data supports the hypothesis that dismantlement of the calyceal junction is a common response triggered by chronic stress in the vestibular sensory epithelium. This effect precedes HC loss, is reversible, and may explain, at least in part, observations of reversion in function loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inferring Neural Activity Before Plasticity: A Foundation for Learning Beyond Backpropagation</a></h4>

              
                For both humans and machines, the essence of learning is to pinpoint which components in its information processing pipeline are responsible for an error in its output -- a challenge that is known as credit assignment. How the brain solves credit assignment is a key question in neuroscience, and also of significant importance for artificial intelligence. Many recent studies presuppose that it is solved by backpropagation, which is also the foundation of modern machine learning. However, it has been questioned whether it is possible for the brain to implement backpropagation, and learning in the brain may actually be more efficient and effective than backpropagation. Here, we set out a fundamentally different principle on credit assignment, called prospective configuration. In prospective configuration, the network first infers the pattern of neural activity that should result from learning, and then the synaptic weights are modified to consolidate the change in neural activity. We demonstrate that this distinct mechanism, in contrast to backpropagation, (1) underlies learning in a well-established family of models of cortical circuits, (2) enables learning that is more efficient and effective in many contexts faced by biological organisms, and (3) reproduces surprising patterns of neural activity and behaviour observed in diverse human and animal learning experiments. Our findings establish a new foundation for learning beyond backpropagation, for both understanding biological learning and building artificial intelligence.

                Changes in the function of inhibitory interneurons (INs) during cortical development could contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using all-optical in vivo approaches in postnatal mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), we find that parvalbumin (PV) IN precursors are hypoactive and decoupled from excitatory neurons in Fmr1-/- mice, a model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This leads to a loss of PV-INs in both mice and humans with FXS. Increasing the activity of future PV-INs in neonatal Fmr1-/- mice restores PV density and ameliorates transcriptional dysregulation in S1, but not circuit dysfunction. Critically, administering a novel allosteric modulator of Kv3.1 channels after the S1 critical period does rescue circuit dynamics and tactile defensiveness. Symptoms in FXS and related disorders could be mitigated by targeting PV-INs

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maintaining a stable head direction representation in naturalistic visual environments</a></h4>

              
                Many animals rely on a representation of head direction for flexible, goal-directed navigation. In insects, a compass-like head direction representation is maintained in a conserved brain region called the central complex. This head direction representation is updated by self-motion information and by tethering to sensory cues in the surroundings through a plasticity mechanism. However, under natural settings, some of these sensory cues may temporarily disappear--for example, when clouds hide the sun--and prominent landmarks at different distances from the insect may move across the animal's field of view during translation, creating potential conflicts for a neural compass. We used two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila behaving in virtual reality to monitor the fly's compass during navigation in immersive naturalistic environments with approachable local landmarks. We found that the fly's compass remains stable even in these settings by tethering to available global cues, likely preserving the animal's ability to perform compass-driven behaviors such as maintaining a constant heading.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural theory for counting memories</a></h4>

              
                "I've never smelled anything like this." "I've seen you once before." "I've heard this song many times." Keeping track of the number of times different stimuli have been experienced is a critical computation for behavior. This computation occurs ubiquitously across sensory modalities, and naturally without reward or punishment. However, the neural circuitry that mediates this computation remains unknown. Here, we propose a theoretical two-layer neural circuit that can store counts of stimulus occurrence frequencies. This circuit implements a data structure, called a count sketch, that is commonly used in computer science to maintain item frequencies in streaming data. Our first model implements the count sketch data structure using Hebbian synapses and outputs stimulus-specific frequencies. Our second model uses anti-Hebbian plasticity and only tracks frequencies within four count categories ("1-2-3-many"), which we suggest makes a better trade-off between the number of categories that need to be distinguished and the potential ethological value of those categories. Using real-world datasets, we show how both models can closely track the frequencies of different stimuli experienced, while being robust to noise, thus expanding the traditional novelty-familiarity memory axis from binary to continuous. Finally, we show that an implementation of the "1-2-3-many" count sketch --- including network architecture, synaptic plasticity rule, and output neuron that encodes count categories --- exists in a novelty detection circuit in the insect mushroom body, and we argue that similar circuit motifs also appear in mammals, suggesting that basic memory counting machinery may be broadly conserved.

                A brief period of monocular deprivation (MD) in adults is known to induce short-term plasticity of the visual system. However, to what extent MD impacts beyond visual processing is unclear. Here, we investigated alterations of visual and audio-visual processing induced by MD measuring neural oscillations. Results revealed that MD modified neural activities associated with unimodal and multisensory processes in an eye-specific manner. Selectively for the Deprived eye, alpha activity was reduced within the first 150 ms of visual processing. Conversely, the response to audio-visual events was enhanced in the gamma range only for the Undeprived eye within 100-300 ms after stimulus onset. The analysis of gamma responses to unimodal auditory events clarified that MD elicited a crossmodal upweighting for the Undeprived eye. Source modeling suggested that the right parietal cortex played a major role in both visual and audio-visual MD effects. Notably, visual and audio-visual processing alterations emerged selectively for the induced (but not the evoked) component of the neural oscillations, indicating primary alterations in feedback connectivity. These findings support a model in which MD increases excitability for the Deprived eye and neural responsiveness to audio-visual and auditory events for the Undeprived eye. On the one hand, these results reveal the causal impact of MD on both unisensory and multisensory processes but with distinct frequency-specific profiles and, on the other hand, highlight the feedback nature of short-term neural plasticity. Overall this study shed light on the high flexibility and interdependence of the unimodal and multisensory functions.

                Age-related cognitive decline, a common component of the brain aging process, is associated with significant impairment in daily functioning and quality of life among geriatric adults. While the complexity of mechanisms underlying cognitive aging are still being elucidated, microbial exposure and the multifactorial inflammatory cascades associated with systemic infections is emerging as a potential driver of neurological senescence. The negative cognitive and neurobiological consequences of a single pathogen-associated inflammatory experience, such as that modeled through treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are well documented. Yet, the brain aging impacts of repeated, intermittent inflammatory challenges are less well studied. To extend the emerging literature assessing the impact of infection burden on cognitive function among normally aging mice, here, we repeatedly exposed adult mice to intermittent LPS challenges during the aging period. Male 10-month-old C57BL6 mice were systemically administered escalating doses of LPS once every two weeks for 2.5 months. We evaluated cognitive consequences using the non-spatial step-through inhibitory avoidance task and both spatial working and reference memory versions of the Morris water maze. We also probed several potential mechanisms, including cortical and hippocampal cytokine/chemokine gene expression as well as hippocampal neuronal function via extracellular field potential recordings. Though there was limited evidence for an ongoing inflammatory state in cortex and hippocampus, we observed impaired learning and memory and a disruption of hippocampal long-term potentiation. These data suggest that a history of intermittent exposure to LPS-induced inflammation is associated with a subtle but significantly accelerated trajectory of cognitive decline. The broader impact of these findings may have important implications for standard of care involving infections in aging individuals or populations at-risk for dementia.

                We have developed a novel inducible Huntington's disease (HD) mouse model that allows temporal control of whole-body allele-specific mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) expression. We asked whether moderate global lowering of mHtt (~50%) was sufficient for long-term amelioration of HD-related deficits and, if so, whether early mHtt lowering (before measurable deficits) was required. Both early and late mHtt lowering delayed behavioral dysfunction and mHTT protein aggregation, as measured biochemically. However, long-term follow up revealed that the benefits, in all mHtt lowering groups, attenuated by 12 months of age. While early mHtt lowering attenuated cortical and striatal transcriptional dysregulation evaluated at 6 months of age, the benefits diminished by 12- months of age and late mHtt lowering was unable to ameliorate striatal transcriptional dysregulation at 12 months of age. Only early mHtt lowering delayed the elevation in cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain that we observed in our model starting at 9 months of age. As small-molecule HTT-lowering therapeutics progress to the clinic, our findings suggest that moderate mHtt lowering allows disease progression to continue, albeit at a slower rate, and could be relevant to the degree of mHTT lowering required to sustain long-term benefit in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking and perceiving diverse motion signals: Directional biases in human smooth pursuit and perception</a></h4>

              
                Human smooth pursuit eye movements and motion perception behave similarly when observers track and judge the motion of simple objects, such as dots. But moving objects in our natural environment are complex and contain internal motion. We ask how pursuit and perception integrate the motion of objects with motion that is internal to the object. Observers (n = 20) tracked a moving random-dot kinematogram with their eyes and reported the object's perceived direction. Objects moved horizontally with vertical shifts of 0, +-3, +-6, or +-9 degs and contained internal dots that were static or moved +-90 degs up/down. Results show that whereas pursuit direction was consistently biased in the direction of the internal dot motion, perceptual biases differed between observers. Interestingly, the perceptual bias was related to the magnitude of the pursuit bias (r = 0.75): perceptual and pursuit biases were directionally aligned in observers that showed a large pursuit bias, but went in opposite directions in observers with a smaller pursuit bias. Dissociations between perception and pursuit might reflect different functional demands of the two systems. Pursuit integrates all available motion signals in order to maximize the ability to monitor and collect information from the whole scene. Perception needs to recognize and classify visual information, thus segregating the target from its context. Ambiguity in whether internal motion is part of the scene or contributes to object motion might have resulted in individual differences in perception. The perception-pursuit correlation suggests shared early-stage motion processing or perception-pursuit interactions.

                Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy often referred to as ''the silent thief of sight'', due to its late diagnosis, which is generally made when degeneration of the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells is already well under way. It is thus of utmost importance to have a better understanding of the disease, and to investigate more deeply the early causes of glaucoma. The transcriptional coactivator YAP recently emerged as an important regulator of eye homeostasis and is drawing attention in the glaucoma research field. Here we show that Yap conditional knockout mice (Yap cKO), in which the deletion of Yap is induced in both Muller glia (i.e. the only retinal YAP-expressing cells) and the non-pigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary body, exhibit breakdown of the aqueous-blood barrier accompanied by progressive collapse of the ciliary body as we observed in human uveitic patients. In addition, aged Yap cKO mice harbor glaucoma features, including alteration of glutamate recycling, deregulation of key homeostatic Muller-derived proteins, retinal vascular defects, optic nerve degeneration, and retinal ganglion cell death. Together, our findings reveal the essential role of YAP in preserving the ciliary body and the retinal ganglion cells, thereby preventing the onset of glaucoma features.

                Focal Task-Specific Dystonia (FTSD) is an intractable neurological disorder with no clear prevention or treatment that affects more than 1% of classical musicians and threatens the active lives of experts due to its task-specific tremor symptoms. In the present study, we focused on the motor learning function of the cerebellum, which has not been the focus of much attention in the past. We numerically simulated the firing of cerebellar Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei during eyeblink conditioning as a typical example of cerebellar-related timing motor learning, with the aim to find the principle of the pathogenesis of FTSD at the level of individual neurons. The results showed the sustained firing of cerebellar nuclei after the learning condition in which the climbing fiber input to Purkinje cells was continued randomly. Therefore, the present study claims a suggestive factor regarding the neural mechanism of the cerebellum in the motor learning-induced task-specific tremor, which is a symptom of FTSD. We also proposed a motor learning paradigm, "undesirable motor learning," in which the motor goal is too advanced to be achieved by repetitions alone and converges to a different result than the desired.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TOB is an effector of the hippocampus-mediated acute stress response</a></h4>

              
                Stress affects behavior and involves critical dynamic changes at multiple levels ranging from molecular pathways to neural circuits and behavior. Abnormalities at any of these levels lead to decreased stress resilience and pathological behavior. However, temporal modulation of molecular pathways underlying stress response remains poorly understood. Transducer of ErbB2.1, known as TOB, (TOB1) is involved in different physiological functions, including cellular stress and immediate response to stimulation. In this study, we investigated the role of TOB in the brain's stress machinery at molecular, neural circuit, and behavioral levels. Interestingly, TOB protein levels increased after mice were exposed to acute stress. At the neural circuit level, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggested that intra-hippocampal and hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity were dysregulated in Tob knockout (Tob-KO) mice. Electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices showed increased postsynaptic AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission, accompanied by decreased GABA neurotransmission and subsequently altered Excitatory/Inhibitory balance after Tob deletion. At the behavioral level, Tob-KO mice show abnormal, hippocampus-dependent, contextual fear conditioning and extinction, and depression-like behaviors. On the other hand, increased anxiety observed in Tob-KO mice is hippocampus-independent. At the molecular level, we observed decreased stress-induced LCN2 expression and ERK phosphorylation, as well as increased MKP-1 expression. This study suggests that TOB serves as an important modulator in hippocampal stress signaling machinery. In summary, we show a molecular pathway and neural circuit mechanism by which Tob deletion contributes to expression of pathological stress-related behavior.

	<p>Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is the reduction in the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) when the startling stimulus (pulse) is preceded by a weaker, non-starting stimulus. This can be enhanced by facilitating selective attention to the prepulse against a noise-masking background. On the other hand, the facilitation of selective attention to a target speech can release the target speech from masking, particularly from speech informational masking. It is not clear whether attentional regulation also affects PPI in this kind of auditory masking. This study used a speech syllable as the prepulse to examine whether the masker type and perceptual spatial attention can affect the PPI or the scalp EEG responses to the prepulse in healthy younger-adult humans, and whether the ERPs evoked by the prepulse can predict the PPI intensity of the ASR. The results showed that the speech masker produced a larger masking effect than the noise masker, and the perceptual spatial separation facilitated selective attention to the prepulse, enhancing both the N1 component of the prepulse syllable and the PPI of the ASR, particularly when the masker was speech. In addition, there was no significant correlation between the PPI and ERPs under any of the conditions, but the perceptual separation-induced PPI enhancement and ERP N1P2 peak-to-peak amplitude enhancement were correlated under the speech-masking condition. Thus, the attention-mediated PPI is useful for differentiating noise energetic masking and speech informational masking, and the perceptual separation-induced release of the prepulse from informational masking is more associated with attention-mediated early cortical unmasking processing than with energetic masking. However, the processes for the PPI of the ASR and the cortical responses to the prepulse are mediated by different neural mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Background: Recording the calibration data of a brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface is a laborious process and is an unpleasant experience for the subjects. Domain adaptation is an effective technology to remedy the shortage of target data by leveraging rich labeled data from the sources. However, most prior methods have needed to extract the features of the EEG signal first, which triggers another challenge in BCI classification, due to small sample sets or a lack of labels for the target. Methods: In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework, referred to as kernel-based Riemannian manifold domain adaptation (KMDA). KMDA circumvents the tedious feature extraction process by analyzing the covariance matrices of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Covariance matrices define a symmetric positive definite space (SPD) that can be described by Riemannian metrics. In KMDA, the covariance matrices are aligned in the Riemannian manifold, and then are mapped to a high dimensional space by a log-Euclidean metric Gaussian kernel, where subspace learning is performed by minimizing the conditional distribution distance between the sources and the target while preserving the target discriminative information. We also present an approach to convert the EEG trials into 2D frames (E-frames) to further lower the dimension of covariance descriptors. Results: Experiments on three EEG datasets demonstrated that KMDA outperforms several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods in classification accuracy, with an average Kappa of 0.56 for BCI competition IV dataset IIa, 0.75 for BCI competition IV dataset IIIa, and an average accuracy of 81.56% for BCI competition III dataset IVa. Additionally, the overall accuracy was further improved by 2.86% with the E-frames. KMDA showed potential in addressing subject dependence and shortening the calibration time of motor imagery-based brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Bisphenol A Exposure Induces Sensory Processing Deficits in Larval Zebrafish during Neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Because of their <I>ex utero</I> development, relatively simple nervous system, translucency, and availability of tools to investigate neural function, larval zebrafish are an exceptional model for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and the consequences of environmental toxins. Furthermore, early in development, zebrafish larvae easily absorb chemicals from water, a significant advantage over methods required to expose developing organisms to chemical agents <I>in utero</I>. Bisphenol A (BPA) and BPA analogs are ubiquitous environmental toxins with known molecular consequences. All humans have measurable quantities of BPA in their bodies. Most concerning, the level of BPA exposure is correlated with neurodevelopmental difficulties in people. Given the importance of understanding the health-related effects of this common toxin, we have exploited the experimental advantages of the larval zebrafish model system to investigate the behavioral and anatomic effects of BPA exposure. We discovered that BPA exposure early in development leads to deficits in the processing of sensory information, as indicated by BPA&rsquo;s effects on prepulse inhibition (PPI) and short-term habituation (STH) of the C-start reflex. We observed no changes in locomotion, thigmotaxis, and repetitive behaviors (circling). Despite changes in sensory processing, we detected no regional or whole-brain volume changes. Our results show that early BPA exposure can induce sensory processing deficits, as revealed by alterations in simple behaviors that are mediated by a well-defined neural circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Integration in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons Is Intact despite Deficits in GABAergic Transmission in the Scn1a Haploinsufficiency Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mutations of <I>SCN1A</I>, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.1, can cause epilepsy disorders such as Dravet syndrome (DS) that are comorbid with wide-ranging neurologic dysfunction. Many studies suggest that Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.1 haploinsufficiency causes forebrain GABAergic interneuron hypoexcitability, while pyramidal neuron physiology is mostly unaltered, and that this serves as a primary cell physiology phenotype linking mutation to disease. We hypothesized that deficits in inhibition would alter synaptic integration during activation of the hippocampal microcircuit, thus disrupting cellular information processing and leading to seizures and cognitive deficits. We tested this hypothesis using <I>ex vivo</I> whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in a heterozygous <I>Scn1a</I> knock-out mouse model and wild-type (WT) littermates, measuring responses to single and patterned synaptic stimulation and spontaneous synaptic activity. Overall, our experiments reveal a surprising normalcy of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic temporal integration in the hippocampus of <I>Scn1a</I> haploinsufficient mice. While miniature IPSCs and feedforward inhibition and were decreased, we did not identify a pattern or frequency of input that caused a failure of synaptic inhibition. We further show that reduced GABA release probability and subsequent reduced short-term depression may act to overcome deficits in inhibition normalizing input/output functions in the <I>Scn1a</I> haploinsufficient hippocampus. These experiments show that CA1 pyramidal neuron synaptic processing is surprisingly robust, even during decreased interneuron function, and more complex circuit activity is likely required to reveal altered function in the hippocampal microcircuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Slow Inactivation of Sodium Channels Contributes to Short-Term Adaptation in Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adaptation plays an important role in sensory systems as it dynamically modifies sensitivity to allow the detection of stimulus changes. The vomeronasal system controls many social behaviors in most mammals by detecting pheromones released by conspecifics. Stimuli activate a transduction cascade in vomeronasal neurons that leads to spiking activity. Whether and how these neurons adapt to stimuli is still debated and largely unknown. Here, we measured short-term adaptation performing current-clamp whole-cell recordings by using diluted urine as a stimulus, as it contains many pheromones. We measured spike frequency adaptation in response to repeated identical stimuli of 2&ndash;10 s duration that was dependent on the time interval between stimuli. Responses to paired current steps, bypassing the signal transduction cascade, also showed spike frequency adaptation. We found that voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels in VSNs undergo slow inactivation processes. Furthermore, recovery from slow inactivation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels occurs in several seconds, a time scale similar to that measured during paired-pulse adaptation protocols, suggesting that it partially contributes to short-term spike frequency adaptation. We conclude that vomeronasal neurons do exhibit a time-dependent short-term spike frequency adaptation to repeated natural stimuli and that slow inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels contributes to this form of adaptation. These findings not only increase our knowledge about adaptation in the vomeronasal system, but also raise the question of whether slow inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels may play a role in other sensory systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">High-Frequency Hearing Is Required to Compute a Topographic Map of Auditory Space in the Mouse Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A topographic map of auditory space is a feature found in the superior colliculus (SC) of many species, including CBA/CaJ mice. In this genetic background, high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural level differences (ILDs) are used to compute spatial receptive fields (RFs) that form a topographic map along the azimuth. Unfortunately, C57BL/6 mice, a strain widely used for transgenic manipulation, display age-related hearing loss (AHL) because of an inbred mutation in the Cadherin 23 gene (<I>Cdh23</I>) that affects hair cell mechanotransduction. To overcome this problem, researchers have used young C57BL/6 mice in their studies, as they have been shown to have normal hearing thresholds. However, important details of the auditory response characteristics of the SC such as spectral responses and spatial localization, have not been characterized in young C57BL/6 mice. Here, we show that two- to four-month C57BL/6 mice lack neurons with frontal auditory RFs and therefore lack a topographic representation of auditory space in the SC. Analysis of the spectrotemporal RFs (STRFs) of the SC auditory neurons shows that C57BL/6 mouse SC neurons lack the ability to detect the high-frequency (&gt;40 kHz) spectral cues that are needed to compute frontal RFs. We also show that crossing C57BL/6 mice with CBA/CaJ mice or introducing one copy of the wild-type <I>Cdh23</I> to C57BL/6 mice rescues the high-frequency hearing deficit and improves the topographic map of auditory space. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of high-frequency hearing in computing a topographic map of auditory space.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution of tunnels in α/β-hydrolase fold proteins—What can we learn from studying epoxide hydrolases?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maria Bzówka, Karolina Mitusińska, Agata Raczyńska, Tomasz Skalski, Aleksandra Samol, Weronika Bagrowska, Tomasz Magdziarz, Artur Góra</p>

The evolutionary variability of a protein’s residues is highly dependent on protein region and function. Solvent-exposed residues, excluding those at interaction interfaces, are more variable than buried residues whereas active site residues are considered to be conserved. The abovementioned rules apply also to α/β-hydrolase fold proteins—one of the oldest and the biggest superfamily of enzymes with buried active sites equipped with tunnels linking the reaction site with the exterior. We selected soluble epoxide hydrolases as representative of this family to conduct the first systematic study on the evolution of tunnels. We hypothesised that tunnels are lined by mostly conserved residues, and are equipped with a number of specific variable residues that are able to respond to evolutionary pressure. The hypothesis was confirmed, and we suggested a general and detailed way of the tunnels’ evolution analysis based on entropy values calculated for tunnels’ residues. We also found three different cases of entropy distribution among tunnel-lining residues. These observations can be applied for protein reengineering mimicking the natural evolution process. We propose a ‘perforation’ mechanism for new tunnels design <i>via</i> the merging of internal cavities or protein surface perforation. Based on the literature data, such a strategy of new tunnel design could significantly improve the enzyme’s performance and can be applied widely for enzymes with buried active sites.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">An evolutionary conserved detoxification system for membrane lipid–derived peroxyl radicals in Gram-negative bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marwa Naguib, Nicolás Feldman, Paulina Zarodkiewicz, Holly Shropshire, Christina Biamis, Omar M. El-Halfawy, Julia McCain, Clément Dezanet, Jean-Luc Décout, Yin Chen, Gonzalo Cosa, Miguel A. Valvano</p>

How double-membraned Gram-negative bacteria overcome lipid peroxidation is virtually unknown. Bactericidal antibiotics and superoxide ion stress stimulate the transcription of the <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia bcnA</i> gene that encodes a secreted lipocalin. <i>bcnA</i> gene orthologs are conserved in bacteria and generally linked to a conserved upstream gene encoding a cytochrome b<sub>561</sub> membrane protein (herein named <i>lcoA</i>, lipocalin-associated cytochrome oxidase gene). Mutants in <i>bcnA</i>, <i>lcoA</i>, and in a gene encoding a conserved cytoplasmic aldehyde reductase (peroxidative stress-associated aldehyde reductase gene, <i>psrA</i>) display enhanced membrane lipid peroxidation. Compared to wild type, the levels of the peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) increase in the mutants upon exposure to sublethal concentrations of the bactericidal antibiotics polymyxin B and norfloxacin. Microscopy with lipid peroxidation–sensitive fluorescent probes shows that lipid peroxyl radicals accumulate at the bacterial cell poles and septum and peroxidation is associated with a redistribution of anionic phospholipids and reduced antimicrobial resistance in the mutants. We conclude that BcnA, LcoA, and PsrA are components of an evolutionary conserved, hitherto unrecognized peroxidation detoxification system that protects the bacterial cell envelope from lipid peroxyl radicals.

The first animals appear during the late Ediacaran (572 to 541 Ma); an initial diversity increase was followed reduction in diversity, often interpreted as catastrophic mass extinction. We investigate Ediacaran ecosystem structure changes over this time period using the “Elements of Metacommunity Structure” framework to assess whether this diversity reduction in the Nama was likely caused by an external mass extinction, or internal metacommunity restructuring. The oldest metacommunity was characterised by taxa with wide environmental tolerances, and limited specialisation or intertaxa associations. Structuring increased in the second oldest metacommunity, with groups of taxa sharing synchronous responses to environmental gradients, aggregating into distinct communities. This pattern strengthened in the youngest metacommunity, with communities showing strong environmental segregation and depth structure. Thus, metacommunity structure increased in complexity, with increased specialisation and resulting in competitive exclusion, not a catastrophic environmental disaster, leading to diversity loss in the terminal Ediacaran. These results reveal that the complex eco-evolutionary dynamics associated with Cambrian diversification were established in the Ediacaran.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sentiments based on objectivity and subjectivity with self-attention mechanisms [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The proliferation of digital commerce has allowed merchants to reach out to a wider customer base, prompting a study of customer reviews to gauge service and product quality through sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can be enhanced through subjectivity and objectivity classification with attention mechanisms. Methods: This research includes input corpora of contrasting levels of subjectivity and objectivity from different databases to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews, incorporating attention mechanisms at the aspect level. Three large corpora are chosen as the subjectivity and objectivity datasets, the Shopee user review dataset (ShopeeRD) for subjectivity, together with the Wikipedia English dataset (Wiki-en) and Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for objectivity. Word embeddings are created using Word2Vec with Skip-Gram. Then, a bidirectional LSTM with an attention layer (LSTM-ATT) imposed on word vectors. The performance of the model is evaluated and benchmarked against classification models of Logistics Regression (LR) and Linear SVC (L-SVC). Three models are trained with subjectivity (70% of ShopeeRD) and the objectivity (Wiki-en) embeddings, with ten-fold cross-validation. Next, the three models are evaluated against two datasets (IMDb and 20% of ShopeeRD). The experiments are based on benchmark comparisons, embedding comparison and model comparison with 70-10-20 train-validation-test splits. Data augmentation using AUG-BERT is performed and selected models incorporating AUG-BERT, are compared. Results: L-SVC scored the highest accuracy with 56.9% for objective embeddings (Wiki-en) while the LSTM-ATT scored 69.0% on subjective embeddings (ShopeeRD).  Improved performances were observed with data augmentation using AUG-BERT, where the LSTM-ATT+AUG-BERT model scored the highest accuracy at 60.0% for objective embeddings and 70.0% for subjective embeddings, compared to 57% (objective) and 69% (subjective) for L-SVC+AUG-BERT, and 56% (objective) and 68% (subjective) for L-SVC. Conclusions: Utilizing attention layers with subjectivity and objectivity notions has shown improvement to the accuracy of sentiment analysis models.

                The climate change issue has constituted an ongoing political struggle since the first formal international climate negotiations were initiated in 1992 in Rio. It is crucial to understand and solve this collective action problem to pave the road for an effective climate treaty in the future. Thus, we raise the following main research question: How should the political, economic and psychological barriers to an effective climate treaty and sustainable energy be modelled? This 'PEP Triangle' may be applied to better understand and thus improve the ongoing climate negotiations and sustainability. For example, the PEP Triangle may be used in green diplomacy and assist the European External Action Service (EEAS) in accomplishing an effective Paris Treaty.

                The search for novel drugs that efficiently eliminate prokaryotic pathogens is one of the most urgent health topics of our time. Robust evaluation methods for monitoring the antibiotic stress response in prokaryotes are therefore necessary for developing respective screening strategies. Besides advantages of common in vitro techniques, there is a growing demand for in vivo information based on imaging techniques that allow to screen antibiotic candidates in a dynamic manner. Gathering information from imaging data in a reproducible manner, robust data processing and analysis workflows demand advanced (semi-)automation and data management to increase reproducibility. Here we demonstrate a versatile and robust semi-automated image acquisition, processing and analysis workflow to investigate bacterial cell morphology in a quantitative manner. The presented workflow, A.D.I.C.T, covers aspects of experimental setup deployment, data acquisition and handling, image processing (e.g. ROI management, data transformation into binary images, background subtraction, filtering, projections) as well as statistical evaluation of the cellular stress response (e.g. shape measurement distributions, cell shape modeling, probability density evaluation of fluorescence imaging micrographs) towards antibiotic-induced stress, obtained from time-course experiments. The imaging workflow is based on regular brightfield images combined with live-cell imaging data gathered from bacteria, in our case from recombinant Shewanella cells, which are processed as binary images. The model organism expresses target proteins relevant for membrane-biogenesis that are functionally fused to respective fluorescent proteins. Data processing and analysis are based on customized scripts using ImageJ2/FIJI, Celltool and R packages that can be easily reproduced and adapted by users. Summing up, our approach aims at supporting life-scientists to establish their own imaging-pipeline in order to exploit their data as versatile as possible and in a reproducible manner.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Women have a higher lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. Among cognitively normal (CN) older adults, women exhibit elevated tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal compared with men. We explored whether menopause exacerbates sex differences in tau deposition in middle-aged adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>328 CN participants from the Framingham Study (mean age = 57 years (±10 years), 161 women, of whom, 104 were post-menopausal) underwent tau and β-amyloid (Aβ)-PET neuroimaging. We examined global Aβ-PET, and tau-PET signal in 5 regions identified <i>a priori</i> as demonstrating significant sex differences in older adults (in temporal, inferior parietal, middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions). We examined sex and menopause status-related differences in each region-of-interest, using linear regressions, as well as interactions with Aβ and APOEε4 genotype.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Women exhibited higher tau-PET signal (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.002), and global Aβ-PET (<i>p</i> = 0.010), than men in inferior parietal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions. Compared with age-matched men, post-menopausal women showed significantly higher tau-PET signal in parieto-occipital regions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). By contrast, no differences in tau-PET signal existed between pre-menopausal women and men. Aβ-PET was not associated with menopausal status or age. Neither Aβ-PET nor APOEε4 status moderated sex or menopause associations with tau-PET.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clear divergence in tauopathy between the sexes are apparent approximately 20 years earlier than previously reported. Menopause status moderated sex differences in Aβ and tau-PET burden, with tau first appearing post-menopause. Sex and menopause differences consistently appeared in middle frontal and parieto-occipital regions but were not moderated by Aβ burden or APOEε4, suggesting that menopause-related tau vulnerability may be independent of AD-related pathways.

                Background: Obesity is a serious condition because it is associated with other chronic diseases which affect the quality of life. In addition to problems associated with diet and exercise, recent research has found that pesticide exposure might be another important risk factor. The objective of this study was to determine the association between pesticide exposure and obesity among farmers in Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok province, Thailand.  Methods: This study was a population-based cross-sectional study. Data on pesticide use and obesity prevalence from 20,295 farmers aged 20 years and older were collected using an in-person interview questionnaire. The association was analysed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for its potential confounding factors.  Results: Obesity was found to be associated with pesticide use in the past. The risk of obesity was significantly predicted by types of pesticides, including insecticides (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.00-4.38), herbicides (OR = 4.56, 95% CI 1.11-18.62), fungicides (OR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.34-3.36), rodenticides (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.61-4.05), and molluscicides (OR = 3.40, 95% CI 2.15-5.40). Among 35 surveyed individual pesticides, 22 were significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.88 to OR = 8.30, 95% CI 2.54-27.19), including herbicide butachlor, 15 insecticides (two carbamate insecticides, five organochlorine insecticides, and eight organophosphate insecticides), and six fungicides.  Conclusion: This study found obesity in farmers in Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok province, Thailand, to be associated with the long-term use of several types of pesticides. The issue should receive more public attention, and pesticide use should be strictly controlled.

                Background: All parts of the research community have an interest in understanding research impact whether that is around the pathways to impact, processes around impact, methods for measurement, describing impact and so on. This proof of concept study explored the relationship between research funding and research impact using the case studies submitted to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise in 2014 as a proxy for impact. Methods: The paper describes an approach to link the REF impact case studies with the underpinning research grants present in the Researchfish dataset, primarily using the publications captured in both datasets. Where possible the methodology utilised unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers and PubMed ID’s, and where this was not possible the funding information within each publication was used. Results: Through this automated approach 21% of the non-redacted case studies could be linked to a specific research grant. Additional qualitative analysis was then done for unlinked REF impact case studies, which involved reading the document to identify additional information to make the linkage. This approach was taken on 100 REF impact case studies selected at random and resulted in only seven having no identifiable research grants funding associated. The linked research grants were analysed to identify characteristics that are more frequently associated with these grants, than non-linked ones. Conclusions: This analysis did point to some interesting observations such as the grant funding linked to REF impact case studies are more likely to be longer, higher financial value, have more publications and be more collaborative (amongst other characteristics). These findings should be used with caution at present and not be over interpreted, this is due to the sample size for this proof of concept study and some potential limitations on the data which were not addressed at this stage.

                Background: The importance of esthetics has escalated over the years. The purpose of any perioplastic surgery is to address gingival recession while ensuring predictable root coverage and a pleasing appearance. An array of surgical procedures have been recommended for the management of recession defects. The present study compares the clinical and patient related outcome measures of coronally advanced flap with chorion membrane and connective tissue graft in the management of multiple adjacent gingival recessions. Methods: The study was a prospective randomized controlled trial which included eight systemically healthy patients with an age range of 30-44 years with 36 labial/buccal, multiple adjacent, Cairo’s RT1 gingival recession defects, bilaterally.  CAF+CM was performed on one side whereas CAF+CTG was performed on the other side. The two groups were compared clinically at three and six months postoperatively. Results: There was statistically significant decrease in recession depth, recession width, probing depth and clinical attachment level in both the groups from baseline to three and six months. However, intergroup comparisons revealed no statistically significant difference. At six months, both groups showed statistically significant improvements in keratinized tissue width and gingival thickness. The gingival thickness of the CAF+CM group increased significantly at three and six months. In terms of root coverage aesthetic score (RES), there was no significant difference observed between the two groups. In terms of patient reported outcome measures (PROMS), patients preferred the CAF+CM technique. Conclusion: Within the limits of the current study, the use of chorion membrane resulted in considerable root coverage and increased gingival thickness. Periodontal regeneration can be facilitated by the distinctive features of the chorion membrane. Coronally advanced flap plus chorion membrane is a novel approach for root coverage procedures.

                Background: More than 278 million cases and more than 5.4 million deaths due to coronavirus disease  (COVID-19) were reported worldwide by the end of 2021. More than 34 million cases and more than 478,000 deaths have been reported in India. Epidemiologists, physicians and virologists are working on a number of conceptual, theoretical or mathematical modelling techniques in the battle against COVID-19.  Protocol: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive review of published mathematical models on COVID-19 in India and the concepts behind the development of mathematical models on COVID-19, including assumptions, modelling techniques, and data inputs. Initially, related keywords and their synonyms will be searched in the Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database managed by World Health Organisation (WHO). The database includes searches of bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE etc.,), preprints (MEDRXIV), manual searching, and the addition of other expert-referred scientific articles. This database is updated daily (Monday through Friday). Two independent reviewers will be involved in screening the titles and abstracts at the first stage and full-texts at the second stage, and they will select studies as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies will be selected for their quality, transparency, and ethical aspects, using the Overview, Design concepts, Details (ODD) protocol and International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society for Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) guidelines. Data will be extracted using standardized data extraction tools and will be synthesized for analysis. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Conclusions: This systematic review will be performed to critically examine relevant literature of existing mathematical models of COVID-19 in India. The findings will help to understand the concepts behind the development of mathematical models on COVID-19 conducted in India in terms of their assumptions, modelling techniques, and data inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Glutamate released by Cajal-Retzius cells impacts specific hippocampal circuits and behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Anstötz et al. report that postnatal hippocampal Cajal-Retzius cells use vGluT2 as their main glutamate vesicular transporter. Conditional inactivation of vGluT2 in mice reveals both behavioral and network alterations. The observed results indicate the involvement of Cajal-Retzius cells in the regulation of innate anxiety/spatial memory and in potentially related neuronal circuits.

                Deng et al. report that FMRP interacts with GABAA receptors and regulates their single-channel activity. Functionally, this interaction controls tonic inhibition to ensure accurate signal integration in hippocampal granule cells. These findings reveal a mechanism underlying FMRP regulation of the GABAergic system and information processing in the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Toll-9 interacts with Toll-1 to mediate a feedback loop during apoptosis-induced proliferation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Shields et al. define a general role of Toll-9 in cellular stress situations leading to the expression of pro-apoptotic genes that trigger apoptosis and apoptosis-induced processes such as apoptosis-induced proliferation. This work identifies conceptual similarities between cell competition and apoptosis-induced proliferation.

                McCarthy et al. use mass cytometry to longitudinally characterize peripheral cellular immune features during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in non-pregnant adults. They identify distinct cellular immune signatures during acute infection that reliably predict the persistence of high versus low ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody levels 6 months after infection.

                The clinical development of phage therapy to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections requires understanding the dose-effect relationship. Delattre et al. use a murine pneumonia model to longitudinally record phage-bacteria interactions. Mathematical modeling characterizes the synergy between phages and the host immune response. Predictions of treatment outcome could guide clinicians.

                Schembs et al. investigate the role of primary cilia in human corticogenesis using INPP5E mutant cerebral organoids. The analyses show that overactive SHH signaling causes the formation of ventral telencephalic progenitors and neurons instead of cortical cells and imply important ciliary functions in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Zych and Ford uncover physiological differences in the modulation and release mechanisms of co-transmitted dopamine and GABA in the striatum. Despite dopamine and GABA being co-packaged by VMAT2 in SNc terminals, their transmission properties differed, including their release probability, calcium sensitivity, active zone scaffolding protein requirements, and presynaptic neuromodulation.

                Loss of photoreceptors in the retina through damage or disease causes irreversible vision loss that could potentially be treated with transplanted stem-cell-derived photoreceptors. Rempel et al. show that only very early-born stem-cell-derived PRs are capable of autonomous axon growth, which informs photoreceptor transplant strategies.

                Learning to make proper choices requires associating outcomes with the actions that preceded them. Parker et al. record and optogenetically manipulate two input pathways to a key brain area associated with action-outcome learning, the nucleus accumbens. The results motivate two alternative models for the circuitry and mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq revealed transit-amplifying thymic epithelial cells expressing autoimmune regulator</a></h4>

              
                Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are critical for self-tolerance induction in T cells via promiscuous expression of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs), which are controlled by the transcriptional regulator, AIRE. Whereas AIRE-expressing (Aire<sup>+</sup>) mTECs undergo constant turnover in the adult thymus, mechanisms underlying differentiation of postnatal mTECs remain to be discovered. Integrative analysis of single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) suggested the presence of proliferating mTECs with a specific chromatin structure, which express high levels of Aire and co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 (Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup>). Proliferating Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup> mTECs detected using Fucci technology express a minimal number of Aire-dependent TSAs and are converted into quiescent Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup> mTECs expressing high levels of TSAs after a transit amplification. These data provide evidence for the existence of transit-amplifying Aire<sup>+</sup>mTEC precursors during the Aire<sup>+</sup>mTEC differentiation process of the postnatal thymus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-rapid eye movement sleep and wake neurophysiology in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Motivated by the potential of objective neurophysiological markers to index thalamocortical function in patients with severe psychiatric illnesses, we comprehensively characterized key non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parameters across multiple domains, their interdependencies, and their relationship to waking event-related potentials and symptom severity. In 72 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 58 controls, we confirmed a marked reduction in sleep spindle density in SCZ and extended these findings to show that fast and slow spindle properties were largely uncorrelated. We also describe a novel measure of slow oscillation and spindle interaction that was attenuated in SCZ. The main sleep findings were replicated in a demographically distinct sample, and a joint model, based on multiple NREM components, statistically predicted disease status in the replication cohort. Although also altered in patients, auditory event-related potentials elicited during wake were unrelated to NREM metrics. Consistent with a growing literature implicating thalamocortical dysfunction in SCZ, our characterization identifies independent NREM and wake EEG biomarkers that may index distinct aspects of SCZ pathophysiology and point to multiple neural mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity. This study lays the groundwork for evaluating these neurophysiological markers, individually or in combination, to guide efforts at treatment and prevention as well as identifying individuals most likely to benefit from specific interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comparative multi-tissue profiling reveals extensive tissue-specificity in transcriptome reprogramming during thermal adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Thermal adaptation is an extensively used intervention for enhancing or suppressing thermogenic and mitochondrial activity in adipose tissues. As such, it has been suggested as a potential lifestyle intervention for body weight maintenance. While the metabolic consequences of thermal acclimation are not limited to the adipose tissues, the impact on the rest of the tissues in context of their gene expression profile remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the effects in a comparative multi-tissue RNA sequencing approach following exposure of mice to 10 °C, 22 °C, or 34 °C in a panel of organs consisting of spleen, bone marrow, spinal cord, brain, hypothalamus, ileum, liver, quadriceps, subcutaneous-, visceral- and brown adipose tissues. We highlight that transcriptional responses to temperature alterations exhibit a high degree of tissue-specificity both at the gene level and at GO enrichment gene sets, and show that the tissue-specificity is not directed by the distinct basic gene expression pattern exhibited by the various organs. Our study places the adaptation of individual tissues to different temperatures in a whole-organism framework and provides integrative transcriptional analysis necessary for understanding the temperature-mediated biological programming.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mitotically heritable, RNA polymerase II-independent H3K4 dimethylation stimulates INO1 transcriptional memory</a></h4>

              
                For some inducible genes, the rate and molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation depends on the prior experiences of the cell. This phenomenon, called <i>epigenetic transcriptional memory</i>, accelerates reactivation and requires both changes in chromatin structure and recruitment of poised RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to the promoter. Memory of inositol starvation in budding yeast involves a positive feedback loop between transcription factor-dependent interaction with the nuclear pore complex and histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). While H3K4me2 is essential for recruitment of RNAPII and faster reactivation, RNAPII is not required for H3K4me2. Unlike RNAPII-dependent H3K4me2 associated with transcription, RNAPII-independent H3K4me2 requires Nup100, SET3C, the Leo1 subunit of the Paf1 complex and, upon degradation of an essential transcription factor, is inherited through multiple cell cycles. The writer of this mark (COMPASS) physically interacts with the potential reader (SET3C), suggesting a molecular mechanism for the spreading and re-incorporation of H3K4me2 following DNA replication.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Typhoid toxin sorting and exocytic transport from Salmonella Typhi infected cells</a></h4>

              
                Typhoid toxin is an essential virulence factor for <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, the cause of typhoid fever in humans. This toxin has an unusual biology in that it is produced by <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi only when located within host cells. Once synthesized, the toxin is secreted to the lumen of the <i>Salmonella</i>-containing vacuole from where it is transported to the extracellular space by vesicle carrier intermediates. Here we report the identification of the typhoid toxin sorting receptor and components of the cellular machinery that packages the toxin into vesicle carriers, and exports it to the extracellular space. We found that the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor serves as typhoid toxin sorting receptor and that the coat protein COPII and the GTPase Sar1 mediate its packaging into vesicle carriers. Formation of the typhoid toxin carriers requires the specific environment of the <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi-containing vacuole, which is determined by the activities of specific effectors of its type III protein secretion systems. We also found that Rab11B and its interacting protein Rip11 control the intracellular transport of the typhoid toxin carriers, and the SNARE proteins VAMP7, SNAP23, and Syntaxin 4 their fusion to the plasma membrane. Typhoid toxin's cooption of specific cellular machinery for its transport to the extracellular space illustrates the remarkable adaptation of an exotoxin to exert its function in the context of an intracellular pathogen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aberrant causal inference and presence of a compensatory mechanism in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by a panoply of social, communicative, and sensory anomalies. As such, a central goal of computational psychiatry is to ascribe the heterogenous phenotypes observed in ASD to a limited set of canonical computations that may have gone awry in the disorder. Here, we posit causal inference - the process of inferring a causal structure linking sensory signals to hidden world causes - as one such computation. We show that audio-visual integration is intact in ASD and in line with optimal models of cue combination, yet multisensory behavior is anomalous in ASD because this group operates under an internal model favoring integration (vs. segregation). Paradoxically, during explicit reports of common cause across spatial or temporal disparities, individuals with ASD were less and not more likely to report common cause, particularly at small cue disparities. Formal model fitting revealed differences in both the prior probability for common cause (p-common) and choice biases, which are dissociable in implicit but not explicit causal inference tasks. Together, this pattern of results suggests (i) different internal models in attributing world causes to sensory signals in ASD relative to neurotypical individuals given identical sensory cues, and (ii) the presence of an explicit compensatory mechanism in ASD, with these individuals putatively having learned to compensate for their bias to integrate in explicit reports.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Residual force enhancement is affected more by quadriceps muscle length than stretch amplitude</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about how muscle length affects residual force enhancement (rFE) in humans. We therefore investigated rFE at short, long, and very long muscle lengths within the human quadriceps and patellar tendon (PT) using conventional dynamometry with motion capture (rFE<sub>TQ</sub>) and a new, non-invasive shear-wave tensiometry technique (rFE<sub>WS</sub>). Eleven healthy male participants performed submaximal (50% max.) EMG-matched fixed-end reference and stretch-hold contractions across these muscle lengths while muscle fascicle length changes of the vastus lateralis (VL) were captured using B-mode ultrasound. We found significant rFE<sub>TQ</sub> at long (7±5%) and very long (12±8%), but not short (2±5%) muscle lengths, whereas rFE<sub>WS</sub> was only significant at the very long (38±27%), but not short (8±12%) or long (6±10%) muscle lengths. We also found significant relationships between VL fascicle length and rFE<sub>TQ</sub> (<i>r</i>=0.63, <i>p</i>=.001) and rFE<sub>WS </sub>(<i>r</i>=0.52, <i>p</i>=.017), but relationships were not significant between VL fascicle stretch amplitude and rFE<sub>TQ</sub> (<i>r</i>=0.33, <i>p</i>=.126) or rFE<sub>WS </sub>(<i>r</i>=0.29, <i>p</i>=.201). PT shear-wave speed-angle relationships did not agree with estimated PT force-angle relationships, which indicates that estimating PT loads from shear-wave tensiometry might be inaccurate. We conclude that increasing muscle length rather than stretch amplitude contributes more to rFE during submaximal voluntary contractions of the human quadriceps.
