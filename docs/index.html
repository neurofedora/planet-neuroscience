              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PGFinder, a novel analysis pipeline for the consistent, reproducible, and high-resolution structural analysis of bacterial peptidoglycans</a></h4>

              
                Many software solutions are available for proteomics and glycomics studies, but none are ideal for the structural analysis of peptidoglycan (PG), the essential and major component of bacterial cell envelopes. It icomprises glycan chains and peptide stems, both containing unusual amino acids and sugars. This has forced the field to rely on manual analysis approaches, which are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and prone to error. The lack of automated tools has hampered the ability to perform high-throughput analyses and prevented the adoption of a standard methodology. Here, we describe a novel tool called PGFinder for the analysis of PG structure and demonstrate that it represents a powerful tool to quantify PG fragments and discover novel structural features. Our analysis workflow, which relies on open-access tools, is a breakthrough towards a consistent and reproducible analysis of bacterial PGs. It represents a significant advance towards peptidoglycomics as a full-fledged discipline.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep evolutionary origin of gamete-directed zygote activation by KNOX/BELL transcription factors in green plants</a></h4>

              
                KNOX and BELL transcription factors regulate distinct steps of diploid development in plants. In the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,</i> KNOX and BELL proteins are inherited by gametes of the opposite mating types and heterodimerize in zygotes to activate diploid development. By contrast, in land plants such as <i>Physcomitrium patens</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, KNOX and BELL proteins function in meristem maintenance and organogenesis during the later stages of diploid development. However, whether the contrasting functions of KNOX and BELL were acquired independently in algae and land plants is currently unknown. Here, we show that in the basal land plant species <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, gamete-expressed <i>KNOX</i> and <i>BELL</i> are required to initiate zygotic development by promoting nuclear fusion in a manner strikingly similar to that in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. Our results indicate that zygote activation is the ancestral role of KNOX/BELL transcription factors, which shifted toward meristem maintenance as land plants evolved.

	<p>The primary aim of this study was to reveal the effects of end-effector robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) on motor function, proprioception, balance, and gait ability in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). The secondary aim was to determine the correlation between clinical outcomes. This study was a prospective and multi-center study. A total of 13 incomplete SCI patients who met inclusion criteria received 30 min of RAGT with Morning Walk® (Curexo, Seoul, South Korea), and 1 h of conventional physiotherapy 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Clinical outcome measures were 10 m walk test (10MWT), 6 min walk test (6mWT), lower extremity motor score (LEMS), proprioception, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI)-II. All participants were assessed within 48 h before and after the intervention.&amp;amp;nbsp;All clinical outcomes were statistically improved after RAGT. Subgroup analysis according to the initial proprioception, WISCI-II in the normal group showed a statistically significant improvement compared to the abnormal group. Initial BBS and WISCI-II had a positive correlation with most of the final clinical outcomes. The final BBS had a strong positive correlation with the final 10MWT, 6mWT, and WISCI-II. Initial proprioception had a positive correlation with the final WISCI-II. The final proprioception also had a moderate positive correlation with 6mWT and BBS. This study’s results suggest that the end-effector RAGT could promote proprioception, balance ability and walking ability. Postural control ability and proprioception also had a positive relationship with gait ability.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to estimate the incidence of cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis (CVT) within 1 month from first dose administration and the frequency of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as the underlying mechanism after vaccination with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273, in Germany.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A web-based questionnaire was e-mailed to all departments of neurology. We requested a report of cases of CVT occurring within 1 month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of 9 German states.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were younger than 60 years. Fifty-three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%) vaccination, and none after mRNA-1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within 1 month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.78) per 100,000 person-months (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31 days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (95% CI = 1.00–2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (95% CI = 3.46–34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA-based vaccines and 3.14 (95% CI = 1.22–10.65) for females compared to non-females. In 26 of 45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Given an incidence of 0.02 to 0.15 per 100,000 person-months for CVT in the general population, these findings point toward a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:627–639</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autosomal recessive human thymidine kinase 2 (<i>TK2</i>) mutations cause TK2 deficiency, which typically manifests as a progressive and fatal mitochondrial myopathy in infants and children. Treatment with pyrimidine deoxynucleosides deoxycytidine and thymidine ameliorates mitochondrial defects and extends the lifespan of <i>Tk2</i> knock-in mouse (Tk2<sup>KI</sup>) and compassionate use deoxynucleoside therapy in TK2 deficient patients have shown promising indications of efficacy. To augment therapy for Tk2 deficiency, we assessed gene therapy alone and in combination with deoxynucleoside therapy in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated pAAVsc CB6 PI vectors containing human TK2 cDNA (<i>TK2</i>). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-<i>TK2</i> was administered to Tk2<sup>KI</sup>, which were serially assessed for weight, motor functions, and survival as well as biochemical functions in tissues. AAV-<i>TK2</i> treated mice were further treated with deoxynucleosides.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AAV9 delivery of human TK2 cDNA to Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice efficiently rescued Tk2 activity in all the tissues tested except the kidneys, delayed disease onset, and increased lifespan. Sequential treatment of Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice with AAV9 first followed by AAV2 at different ages allowed us to reduce the viral dose while further prolonging the lifespan. Furthermore, addition of deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine supplementation to AAV9 + AAV2 treated Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice dramatically improved mtDNA copy numbers in the liver and kidneys, animal growth, and lifespan.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicate that AAV-<i>TK2</i> gene therapy as well as combination deoxynucleoside and gene therapies is more effective in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice than pharmacological alone. Thus, combination of gene therapy with substrate enhancement is a promising therapeutic approach for TK2 deficiency and potentially other metabolic disorders.

                <p>Pain is a under-recognized association of leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) and contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. Of 147 patients with these autoantibodies, pain was experienced by 17 of 33 (52%) with CASPR2- versus 20 of 108 (19%) with LGI1 antibodies (<i>p</i> = 0.0005), and identified as neuropathic in 89% versus 58% of these, respectively. Typically, in both cohorts, normal nerve conduction studies and reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber densities were observed in the sampled patient subsets. In LGI1 antibody patients, pain responded to immunotherapy (<i>p</i> = 0.008), often rapidly, with greater residual patient-rated impairment observed in CASPR2 antibody patients (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Serum CASPR2 antibodies, but not LGI1 antibodies, bound in vitro to unmyelinated human sensory neurons and rodent dorsal root ganglia, suggesting pathophysiological differences that may underlie our clinical observations.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To noninvasively assess myelin status in chronic white matter lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), we developed and evaluated a simple classification scheme based on T1 relaxation time maps derived from 7-tesla postmortem and in vivo MRI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the MP2RAGE MRI sequence, we classified 36 lesions from 4 postmortem MS brains as “long-T1,” “short-T1,” and “mixed-T1” by visual comparison to neocortex. Within these groups, we compared T1 times to histologically derived measures of myelin and axons. We performed similar analysis of 235 chronic lesions with known date of onset in 25 MS cases in vivo and in a validation cohort of 222 lesions from 66 MS cases, investigating associations with clinical and radiological outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Postmortem, lesions classified qualitatively as long-T1, short-T1, and mixed-T1 corresponded to fully demyelinated, fully remyelinated, and mixed demyelinated/remyelinated lesions, respectively (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). Demyelination (rather than axon loss) dominantly contributed to initial T1 prolongation. We observed lesions with similar characteristics in vivo, allowing manual classification with substantial interrater and excellent intrarater reliability. Short-T1 lesions were most common in the deep white matter, whereas long-T1 and mixed-T1 lesions were prevalent in the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and were much more likely to have paramagnetic rims suggesting chronic inflammation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Older age at the time of lesion formation portended less remyelination (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>7-tesla T1 mapping with MP2RAGE, a clinically available MRI method, allows qualitative and quantitative classification of chronic MS lesions according to myelin content, rendering straightforward the tracking of lesional myelination changes over time.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) are the most effective targets in deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the common and specific effects on brain connectivity of stimulating the 2 nuclei remain unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with PD receiving STN-DBS (n = 27, 6 women, mean age 64.8 years) or GPi-DBS (n = 28, 13 women, mean age 64.6 years) were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the effects of STN-DBS and GPi-DBS on brain functional dynamics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The functional connectivity both between the somatosensory-motor cortices and thalamus, and between the somatosensory-motor cortices and cerebellum decreased in the DBS-on state compared with the off state (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The changes in thalamocortical connectivity correlated with DBS-induced motor improvement (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and were negatively correlated with the normalized intersection volume of tissues activated at both DBS targets (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). STN-DBS modulated functional connectivity among a wider range of brain areas than GPi-DBS (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Notably, only STN-DBS affected connectivity between the postcentral gyrus and cerebellar vermis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and between the somatomotor and visual networks (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight common alterations in the motor pathway and its relationship with the motor improvement induced by both STN- and GPi-DBS. The effects on cortico-cerebellar and somatomotor-visual functional connectivity differed between groups, suggesting differentiated neural modulation of the 2 target sites. Our results provide mechanistic insight and yield the potential to refine target selection strategies for focal brain stimulation in PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:670–682</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, a disease that, despite treatment with antibiotics, still is associated with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Diffuse brain swelling is a leading cause of morbidity in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. We hypothesized that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) disrupt cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport by the glymphatic system and contribute to edema formation in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used DNase I treatment to disrupt NETs and then assessed glymphatic function by cisterna magna injections of CSF tracers in a rat model of <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis showed that CSF influx into the brain parenchyma, as well as CSF drainage to the cervical lymph nodes, was significantly reduced in the rat model of <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. Degrading NETs by DNase treatment restored glymphatic transport and eliminated the increase in brain weight in the rats. In contrast, first-line antibiotic treatment had no such effect on restoring fluid dynamics.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that CSF accumulation is responsible for cerebral edema formation and identifies the glymphatic system and NETs as possible new treatment targets in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:653–669</p>

                <p>Central nervous system demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) and subsequent axonal degeneration represent a major cause of clinical morbidity. Learning, salient experiences, and stimulation of neuronal activity induce new myelin formation in rodents, and in animal models of demyelination, remyelination can be enhanced via experience- and activity-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, preliminary studies in MS patients support the use of neuromodulation and rehabilitation exercises for symptomatic improvement, suggesting that these interventions may represent nonpharmacological strategies for promoting remyelination. Here, we review the literature on myelin plasticity processes and assess the potential to leverage these mechanisms to develop remyelinating therapies. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:558–567</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although plasmapheresis is a treatment option for patients with autoimmune neurological diseases, treatment response varies greatly among patients. The main objective of this study was to find out if biological/immune traits correlate with a beneficial response.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We thoroughly analyzed immune phenotypes in paired blood samples from a cohort of 31 patients with multiple sclerosis before and after plasmapheresis, in parallel with clinical evaluation of treatment response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The frequency of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells was persistently higher in those who obtained benefit from plasmapheresis (responders) than nonresponders. The Th1 cell frequency before plasmapheresis provided a high predictive value for beneficial response, achieving area under the curve (AUC) of 0.902. Plasmapheresis treatment decreased inflammation-related gene expressions in Th1 cells. Meanwhile, <i>IFNG</i> expression in Th1 cells positively correlated with the frequency of CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells, of which a pathogenic role has been suggested in several autoimmune diseases. In line with this, in vitro experiments showed that CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells would increase in response to exogenous IFN-γ compared to IL-4, and secrete high amounts of IgG. B cell receptor analysis indicated that clonal expansion of CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells takes place in patients with multiple sclerosis. Interestingly, CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells, which showed unique gene expression profile, decreased after plasmapheresis treatment along with all the immunoglobulin subsets in the circulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, we postulate that Th1 cell - CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cell axis is involved in treatment response to plasmapheresis, giving us clues to better understanding of complicated pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and getting closer to a personalized therapy.

                <p>On behalf of the German Neurological Society (DGN), a study was conducted into how far former chairmen, honorary chairmen, and honorary members could be regarded as incriminated from the National Socialist period. While an online supplement of this journal presents seven individual biographies (in six papers) by way of example, this paper offers an overview summarizing the project results and introducing the biographies. The first part and the methodological section discuss the difficulties of retrospectively identifying neurologists involved in the Nazi movement. Formal characteristics (eg, membership of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) or other Nazi organizations or participation in Nazi crimes) and content-related clues (eg, statements reflecting Nazi ideology, personal contacts with Nazi officials or active support of the system) can be helpful. The second part summarizes the principal results of a study of 28 German and Austrian neuroscientists with regard to their involvement and their post-war careers. Six of the seven “founding fathers” of the DGN were former NSDAP members; 10 of the 13 presidents in office until 1976 had belonged to Nazi organizations—the NSDAP, the SA (“Brownshirts”) or the SS (“Blackshirts”). Moreover, seven out of 10 honorary presidents had formal or substantive links to National Socialism. Of the German and Austrian honorary members appointed up to 1985, two-thirds had leanings to Nazi ideology or the National Socialist system. This paper concludes by outlining how the DGN and its members are currently addressing this historical legacy in order to establish a responsible culture of remembrance.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine how preterm white matter injury (WMI) and long-term thalamic growth interact to predict 8-year neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A prospective cohort of 114 children born at 24 to 32 weeksʼ gestational age (GA) underwent structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging early in life (median 32 weeks), at term-equivalent age and at 8 years. Manual segmentation of neonatal WMI was performed on T1-weighted images and thalamic volumes were obtained using the MAGeT brain segmentation pipeline. Cognitive, motor, and visual-motor outcomes were evaluated at 8 years of age. Multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship among neonatal WMI volume, school-age thalamic volume, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>School-age thalamic volumes were predicted by neonatal thalamic growth rate, GA, sex, and neonatal WMI volume (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). After accounting for total cerebral volume, WMI volume remained associated with school-age thalamic volume (β = −0.31, <i>p</i> = 0.005). In thalamocortical tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA) at term-equivalent age interacted with early WMI volume to predict school-age thalamic volumes (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). School-age thalamic volumes and neonatal WMI interacted to predict full-scale IQ (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and adverse motor scores among those with significant WMI (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Visual-motor scores were predicted by thalamic volumes (<i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In very preterm-born children, neonatal thalamic growth and WMI volume predict school-age thalamic volumes. The emergence at term of an interaction between FA and WMI to impact school-age thalamic volume indicates dysmaturation as a mechanism of thalamic growth failure. Cognition is predicted by the interaction of WMI and thalamic growth, highlighting the need to consider multiple dimensions of brain injury in these children.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurological disease defined by progressive movement incoordination. We undertook a comprehensive characterization of the spatial profile and progressive evolution of structural brain abnormalities in people with FRDA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A coordinated international analysis of regional brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging data charted the whole-brain profile, interindividual variability, and temporal staging of structural brain differences in 248 individuals with FRDA and 262 healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The brainstem, dentate nucleus region, and superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles showed the greatest reductions in volume relative to controls (Cohen <i>d</i> = 1.5–2.6). Cerebellar gray matter alterations were most pronounced in lobules I–VI (<i>d</i> = 0.8), whereas cerebral differences occurred most prominently in precentral gyri (<i>d</i> = 0.6) and corticospinal tracts (<i>d</i> = 1.4). Earlier onset age predicted less volume in the motor cerebellum (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.35) and peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.36). Disease duration and severity correlated with volume deficits in the dentate nucleus region, brainstem, and superior/inferior cerebellar peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = −0.49); subgrouping showed these to be robust and early features of FRDA, and strong candidates for further biomarker validation. Cerebral white matter abnormalities, particularly in corticospinal pathways, emerge as intermediate disease features. Cerebellar and cerebral gray matter loss, principally targeting motor and sensory systems, preferentially manifests later in the disease course.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FRDA is defined by an evolving spatial profile of neuroanatomical changes beyond primary pathology in the cerebellum and spinal cord, in line with its progressive clinical course. The design, interpretation, and generalization of research studies and clinical trials must consider neuroanatomical staging and associated interindividual variability in brain measures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic Electrode-to-Image (DETI) mapping reveals the human brain’s spatiotemporal code of visual information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bruce C. Hansen, Michelle R. Greene, David J. Field</p>

A number of neuroimaging techniques have been employed to understand how visual information is transformed along the visual pathway. Although each technique has spatial and temporal limitations, they can each provide important insights into the visual code. While the BOLD signal of fMRI can be quite informative, the visual code is not static and this can be obscured by fMRI’s poor temporal resolution. In this study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of EEG to develop an encoding technique based on the distribution of responses generated by a population of real-world scenes. This approach maps neural signals to each pixel within a given image and reveals location-specific transformations of the visual code, providing a spatiotemporal signature for the image at each electrode. Our analyses of the mapping results revealed that scenes undergo a series of nonuniform transformations that prioritize different spatial frequencies at different regions of scenes over time. This mapping technique offers a potential avenue for future studies to explore how dynamic feedforward and recurrent processes inform and refine high-level representations of our visual world.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptomic profiling in canines and humans reveals cancer specific gene modules and biological mechanisms common to both species</a></h4>

Understanding relationships between spontaneous cancer in companion (pet) canines and humans can facilitate biomarker and drug development in both species. Towards this end we developed an experimental-bioinformatic protocol that analyzes canine transcriptomics data in the context of existing human data to evaluate comparative relevance of canine to human cancer. We used this protocol to characterize five canine cancers: melanoma, osteosarcoma, pulmonary carcinoma, B- and T-cell lymphoma, in 60 dogs. We applied an unsupervised, iterative clustering method that yielded five co-expression modules and found that each cancer exhibited a unique module expression profile. We constructed cancer models based on the co-expression modules and used the models to successfully classify the canine data. These canine-derived models also successfully classified human tumors representing the same cancers, indicating shared cancer biology between canines and humans. Annotation of the module genes identified cancer specific pathways relevant to cells-of-origin and tumor biology. For example, annotations associated with melanin production (<i>PMEL</i>, <i>GPNMB</i>, and <i>BACE2</i>), synthesis of bone material (<i>COL5A2</i>, <i>COL6A3</i>, and <i>COL12A1</i>), synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (<i>CTSH</i>, <i>LPCAT1</i>, and <i>NAPSA</i>), ribosomal proteins (<i>RPL8</i>, <i>RPS7</i>, and <i>RPLP0</i>), and epigenetic regulation (<i>EDEM1</i>, <i>PTK2B</i>, and <i>JAK1</i>) were unique to melanoma, osteosarcoma, pulmonary carcinoma, B- and T-cell lymphoma, respectively. In total, 152 biomarker candidates were selected from highly expressing modules for each cancer type. Many of these biomarker candidates are under-explored as drug discovery targets and warrant further study. The demonstrated transferability of classification models from canines to humans enforces the idea that tumor biology, biomarker targets, and associated therapeutics, discovered in canines, may translate to human medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">dGPredictor: Automated fragmentation method for metabolic reaction free energy prediction and de novo pathway design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lin Wang, Vikas Upadhyay, Costas D. Maranas</p>

Group contribution (GC) methods are conventionally used in thermodynamics analysis of metabolic pathways to estimate the standard Gibbs energy change (<i>Δ</i><sub>r</sub><i>G</i>′<sup>o</sup>) of enzymatic reactions from limited experimental measurements. However, these methods are limited by their dependence on manually curated groups and inability to capture stereochemical information, leading to low reaction coverage. Herein, we introduce an automated molecular fingerprint-based thermodynamic analysis tool called dGPredictor that enables the consideration of stereochemistry within metabolite structures and thus increases reaction coverage. dGPredictor has comparable prediction accuracy compared to existing GC methods and can capture Gibbs energy changes for isomerase and transferase reactions, which exhibit no overall group changes. We also demonstrate dGPredictor’s ability to predict the Gibbs energy change for novel reactions and seamless integration within <i>de novo</i> metabolic pathway design tools such as novoStoic for safeguarding against the inclusion of reaction steps with infeasible directionalities. To facilitate easy access to dGPredictor, we developed a graphical user interface to predict the standard Gibbs energy change for reactions at various pH and ionic strengths. The tool allows customized user input of known metabolites as KEGG IDs and novel metabolites as InChI strings (https://github.com/maranasgroup/dGPredictor).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">GRAFIMO: Variant and haplotype aware motif scanning on pangenome graphs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Manuel Tognon, Vincenzo Bonnici, Erik Garrison, Rosalba Giugno, Luca Pinello</p>

Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that promote or reduce the expression of genes by binding short genomic DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). While several tools have been developed to scan for potential occurrences of TFBS in linear DNA sequences or reference genomes, no tool exists to find them in pangenome variation graphs (VGs). VGs are sequence-labelled graphs that can efficiently encode collections of genomes and their variants in a single, compact data structure. Because VGs can losslessly compress large pangenomes, TFBS scanning in VGs can efficiently capture how genomic variation affects the potential binding landscape of TFs in a population of individuals. Here we present GRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences), a command-line tool for the scanning of known TF DNA motifs represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in VGs. GRAFIMO extends the standard PWM scanning procedure by considering variations and alternative haplotypes encoded in a VG. Using GRAFIMO on a VG based on individuals from the 1000 Genomes project we recover several potential binding sites that are enhanced, weakened or missed when scanning only the reference genome, and which could constitute individual-specific binding events. GRAFIMO is available as an open-source tool, under the MIT license, at https://github.com/pinellolab/GRAFIMO and https://github.com/InfOmics/GRAFIMO.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model of head direction and landmark coding in complex environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yijia Yan, Neil Burgess, Andrej Bicanski</p>

Environmental information is required to stabilize estimates of head direction (HD) based on angular path integration. However, it is unclear how this happens in real-world (visually complex) environments. We present a computational model of how visual feedback can stabilize HD information in environments that contain multiple cues of varying stability and directional specificity. We show how combinations of feature-specific visual inputs can generate a stable unimodal landmark bearing signal, even in the presence of multiple cues and ambiguous directional specificity. This signal is associated with the retrosplenial HD signal (inherited from thalamic HD cells) and conveys feedback to the subcortical HD circuitry. The model predicts neurons with a unimodal encoding of the egocentric orientation of the array of landmarks, rather than any one particular landmark. The relationship between these abstract landmark bearing neurons and head direction cells is reminiscent of the relationship between place cells and grid cells. Their unimodal encoding is formed from visual inputs via a modified version of Oja’s Subspace Algorithm. The rule allows the landmark bearing signal to disconnect from directionally unstable or ephemeral cues, incorporate newly added stable cues, support orientation across many different environments (high memory capacity), and is consistent with recent empirical findings on bidirectional HD firing reported in the retrosplenial cortex. Our account of visual feedback for HD stabilization provides a novel perspective on neural mechanisms of spatial navigation within richer sensory environments, and makes experimentally testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hybrid computational modeling demonstrates the utility of simulating complex cellular networks in type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhenzhen Shi, Yang Li, Majid Jaberi-Douraki</p>

Persistent destruction of pancreatic β-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from multifaceted pancreatic cellular interactions in various phase progressions. Owing to the inherent heterogeneity of coupled nonlinear systems, computational modeling based on T1D etiology help achieve a systematic understanding of biological processes and T1D health outcomes. The main challenge is to design such a reliable framework to analyze the highly orchestrated biology of T1D based on the knowledge of cellular networks and biological parameters. We constructed a novel hybrid in-silico computational model to unravel T1D onset, progression, and prevention in a non-obese-diabetic mouse model. The computational approach that integrates mathematical modeling, agent-based modeling, and advanced statistical methods allows for modeling key biological parameters and time-dependent spatial networks of cell behaviors. By integrating interactions between multiple cell types, model results captured the individual-specific dynamics of T1D progression and were validated against experimental data for the number of infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells. Our simulation results uncovered the correlation between five auto-destructive mechanisms identifying a combination of potential therapeutic strategies: the average lifespan of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells in islets; the initial number of apoptotic β-cells; recruitment rate of dendritic-cells (DCs); binding sites on DCs for naïve CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells; and time required for DCs movement. Results from therapy-directed simulations further suggest the efficacy of proposed therapeutic strategies depends upon the type and time of administering therapy interventions and the administered amount of therapeutic dose. Our findings show modeling immunogenicity that underlies autoimmune T1D and identifying autoantigens that serve as potential biomarkers are two pressing parameters to predict disease onset and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">FunOrder: A robust and semi-automated method for the identification of essential biosynthetic genes through computational molecular co-evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel A. Vignolle, Denise Schaffer, Leopold Zehetner, Robert L. Mach, Astrid R. Mach-Aigner, Christian Derntl</p>

Secondary metabolites (SMs) are a vast group of compounds with different structures and properties that have been utilized as drugs, food additives, dyes, and as monomers for novel plastics. In many cases, the biosynthesis of SMs is catalysed by enzymes whose corresponding genes are co-localized in the genome in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Notably, BGCs may contain so-called gap genes, that are not involved in the biosynthesis of the SM. Current genome mining tools can identify BGCs, but they have problems with distinguishing essential genes from gap genes. This can and must be done by expensive, laborious, and time-consuming comparative genomic approaches or transcriptome analyses. In this study, we developed a method that allows semi-automated identification of essential genes in a BGC based on co-evolution analysis. To this end, the protein sequences of a BGC are blasted against a suitable proteome database. For each protein, a phylogenetic tree is created. The trees are compared by treeKO to detect co-evolution. The results of this comparison are visualized in different output formats, which are compared visually. Our results suggest that co-evolution is commonly occurring within BGCs, albeit not all, and that especially those genes that encode for enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway are co-evolutionary linked and can be identified with FunOrder. In light of the growing number of genomic data available, this will contribute to the studies of BGCs in native hosts and facilitate heterologous expression in other organisms with the aim of the discovery of novel SMs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Meta-analysis of transcriptomic data reveals clusters of consistently deregulated gene and disease ontologies in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ilario De Toma, Cesar Sierra, Mara Dierssen</p>

Trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) causes Down syndrome (DS). The trisomy does not simply result in the upregulation of HSA21--encoded genes but also leads to a genome-wide transcriptomic deregulation, which may differently affect each tissue and cell type as results of epigenetic mechanisms and protein-protein interactions.
We performed a meta-analysis integrating the differential expression (DE) analyses of all publicly available transcriptomic datasets, both in human and mouse, comparing trisomic and euploid transcriptomes from different sources. We integrated all these data in a “DS network”.
We found that genome wide deregulation as a consequence of trisomy 21 is not arbitrary, but involves deregulation of specific molecular cascades in which both HSA21 genes and HSA21 interactors are more consistently deregulated compared to other genes. In fact, gene deregulation happens in “clusters”, so that groups from 2 to 13 genes are found consistently deregulated. Most of these events of “co-deregulation” involve genes belonging to the same GO category, and genes associated with the same disease class. The most consistent changes are enriched in interferon related categories and neutrophil activation, reinforcing the concept that DS is an inflammatory disease. Our results also suggest that the impact of the trisomy might diverge in each tissue due to the different gene set deregulation, even though the triplicated genes are the same.
Our original method to integrate transcriptomic data confirmed not only the importance of known genes, such as SOD1, but also detected new ones that could be extremely useful for generating or confirming hypotheses and supporting new putative therapeutic candidates. We created “metaDEA” an R package that uses our method to integrate every kind of transcriptomic data and therefore could be used with other complex disorders, such as cancer. We also created a user-friendly web application to query Ensembl gene IDs and retrieve all the information of their differential expression across the datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optima TB: A tool to help optimally allocate tuberculosis spending</a></h4>

Approximately 85% of tuberculosis (TB) related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries where health resources are scarce. Effective priority setting is required to maximise the impact of limited budgets. The Optima TB tool has been developed to support analytical capacity and inform evidence-based priority setting processes for TB health benefits package design. This paper outlines the Optima TB framework and how it was applied in Belarus, an upper-middle income country in Eastern Europe with a relatively high burden of TB. Optima TB is a population-based disease transmission model, with programmatic cost functions and an optimisation algorithm. Modelled populations include age-differentiated general populations and higher-risk populations such as people living with HIV. Populations and prospective interventions are defined in consultation with local stakeholders. In partnership with the latter, demographic, epidemiological, programmatic, as well as cost and spending data for these populations and interventions are then collated. An optimisation analysis of TB spending was conducted in Belarus, using program objectives and constraints defined in collaboration with local stakeholders, which included experts, decision makers, funders and organisations involved in service delivery, support and technical assistance. These analyses show that it is possible to improve health impact by redistributing current TB spending in Belarus. Specifically, shifting funding from inpatient- to outpatient-focused care models, and from mass screening to active case finding strategies, could reduce TB prevalence and mortality by up to 45% and 50%, respectively, by 2035. In addition, an optimised allocation of TB spending could lead to a reduction in drug-resistant TB infections by 40% over this period. This would support progress towards national TB targets without additional financial resources. The case study in Belarus demonstrates how reallocations of spending across existing and new interventions could have a substantial impact on TB outcomes. This highlights the potential for Optima TB and similar modelling tools to support evidence-based priority setting.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">XENet: Using a new graph convolution to accelerate the timeline for protein design on quantum computers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jack B. Maguire, Daniele Grattarola, Vikram Khipple Mulligan, Eugene Klyshko, Hans Melo</p>

Graph representations are traditionally used to represent protein structures in sequence design protocols in which the protein backbone conformation is known. This infrequently extends to machine learning projects: existing graph convolution algorithms have shortcomings when representing protein environments. One reason for this is the lack of emphasis on edge attributes during massage-passing operations. Another reason is the traditionally shallow nature of graph neural network architectures. Here we introduce an improved message-passing operation that is better equipped to model local kinematics problems such as protein design. Our approach, XENet, pays special attention to both incoming and outgoing edge attributes. We compare XENet against existing graph convolutions in an attempt to decrease rotamer sample counts in Rosetta’s rotamer substitution protocol, used for protein side-chain optimization and sequence design. This use case is motivating because it both reduces the size of the search space for classical side-chain optimization algorithms, and allows larger protein design problems to be solved with quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers with limited qubit counts. XENet outperformed competing models while also displaying a greater tolerance for deeper architectures. We found that XENet was able to decrease rotamer counts by 40% without loss in quality. This decreased the memory consumption for classical pre-computation of rotamer energies in our use case by more than a factor of 3, the qubit consumption for an existing sequence design quantum algorithm by 40%, and the size of the solution space by a factor of 165. Additionally, XENet displayed an ability to handle deeper architectures than competing convolutions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Memes: A motif analysis environment in R using tools from the MEME Suite</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Spencer L. Nystrom, Daniel J. McKay</p>

Identification of biopolymer motifs represents a key step in the analysis of biological sequences. The MEME Suite is a widely used toolkit for comprehensive analysis of biopolymer motifs; however, these tools are poorly integrated within popular analysis frameworks like the R/Bioconductor project, creating barriers to their use. Here we present memes, an R package that provides a seamless R interface to a selection of popular MEME Suite tools. memes provides a novel “data aware” interface to these tools, enabling rapid and complex discriminative motif analysis workflows. In addition to interfacing with popular MEME Suite tools, memes leverages existing R/Bioconductor data structures to store the multidimensional data returned by MEME Suite tools for rapid data access and manipulation. Finally, memes provides data visualization capabilities to facilitate communication of results. memes is available as a Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/memes, and the source code can be found at github.com/snystrom/memes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational analysis of GAL pathway pinpoints mechanisms underlying natural variation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiayin Hong, Julius Palme, Bo Hua, Michael Springer</p>

Quantitative traits are measurable phenotypes that show continuous variation over a wide phenotypic range. Enormous effort has recently been put into determining the genetic influences on a variety of quantitative traits with mixed success. We identified a quantitative trait in a tractable model system, the GAL pathway in yeast, which controls the uptake and metabolism of the sugar galactose. GAL pathway activation depends both on galactose concentration and on the concentrations of competing, preferred sugars such as glucose. Natural yeast isolates show substantial variation in the behavior of the pathway. All studied yeast strains exhibit bimodal responses relative to external galactose concentration, i.e. a set of galactose concentrations existed at which both GAL-induced and GAL-repressed subpopulations were observed. However, these concentrations differed in different strains. We built a mechanistic model of the GAL pathway and identified parameters that are plausible candidates for capturing the phenotypic features of a set of strains including standard lab strains, natural variants, and mutants. <i>In silico</i> perturbation of these parameters identified variation in the intracellular galactose sensor, Gal3p, the negative feedback node within the GAL regulatory network, Gal80p, and the hexose transporters, HXT, as the main sources of the bimodal range variation. We were able to switch the phenotype of individual yeast strains <i>in silico</i> by tuning parameters related to these three elements. Determining the basis for these behavioral differences may give insight into how the GAL pathway processes information, and into the evolution of nutrient metabolism preferences in different strains. More generally, our method of identifying the key parameters that explain phenotypic variation in this system should be generally applicable to other quantitative traits.

                Background - One of the problems encountered by all universities in realizing a sustainable Green Campus is solid waste management due to its complex and dynamic nature, which is known to have the potential risks of failure.  Aim – Application of a dynamic modeling approach with the FMEA and AHP methods to eliminate the risk associated with the inability of universities to process solid waste.   Methods– Data on risk factors and alternative evaluation methods were collected from five experts from various fields.  Results – The results of the risk assessment by experts show some of the highest risk values are associated with Technological Infrastructure, with a risk value of around 900, and the lowest risk is associated with Regulation collisions with a risk value of around 378. The results provided adequate information on the increased risk of each factor from 2019 to 2030 with verified moderate and optimistic conditions models comprising significant values of approximately 0.009 and 0.0273, respectively. This study assists higher education management in decreasing risk failure in the region by creating simulation models that will likely be utilized for scenario analysis in the future. The System Dynamic model's entire approach proved helpful in accomplishing long-term solid waste management in universities. Other dynamic insights that assisted universities improve their knowledge of solid waste management systems.  Research limitations– Further study needs to be conducted in the dynamic model to obtain a more comprehensive and detailed result. This is because the developed model provided an overview that needs further improvement, especially concerning several quantitative data, towards obtaining the adequate method for sustainable solid waste management.  Originality/value – This research used the hybrid method and AHP techniques to analyze solid waste in universities which were developed into a dynamic system model. However, further research is needed to enhance this hybrid method.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence and characteristics of cancer patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cancer patients are considered susceptible to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to an immunosuppressive state. This study determined the prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients, severe events, case fatality rate, history of anticancer therapy associated with severe events, and type of cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 in the world. Methods: This study used a meta-analysis study approach, sourcing studies from various countries related to cancer and COVID-19. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to select studies. A PRISMA flowchart was presented to assess the selection process. Data from inclusion studies were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4. Results: The prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients was 4.63% (95% CI, 3.78-5.49%) worldwide. The lowest prevalence was the Asian study group with 2.36% (95% CI, 1.86-2.87%) and the highest prevalence was the European study group with 10.93% (95% CI, 6.62-15.24%). About 43.26% (95% CI, 34.71-51.80%) of cancer patients with COVID-19 experienced severe events of COVID-19. In total, 58.13% (95% CI, 42.79-73.48%) of cancer patients with COVID-19 who in the last month had a history of anticancer therapy experienced severe events. The prevalence of lung cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 was 20.23% (95% CI, 7.67-32.78%). Forest plots are also presented related to the results of meta-analysis research. Conclusions: High prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients indicates the susceptibility of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer in COVID-19 patients and use of anticancer therapy increase severe events of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of the EQ-5D-5L and the EQ-5D-3L using individual patient data from the REFORM trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study compares the 5-level version of the EQ-5D (5L) with the 3-level version EQ-5D (3L) in older adults using individual patient data from the REFORM (REducing Falls with Orthoses and a Multifaceted podiatry intervention) trial. Methods: EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-3L were administered to men and women (n=151) over the age of 65 years alongside the REFORM trial. The two versions of the EQ-5D were assessed in terms of feasibility, level of consistency, ceiling effect and discriminatory power. We also undertook a comparison of the performance of different EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L value sets. Results: The proportion of participants that returned a complete questionnaire was higher for the 5L (96.7%) than for the 3L (92.7%). Missing values among dimensions were on average 1.59% (5L) and 1.45% (3L). The ceiling effect was reduced from 18.2% (3L) to 6% (5L). On average the proportion of inconsistent responses between both descriptive systems was 3.25%. Redistribution from 3L to 5L showed valid results for the majority of consistent level combinations, with slight inconsistency in the case of Anxiety/Depression. For the 5L, 67 unique health states were observed for the 5L compared to 27 for the 3L. The absolute informatively improved with the new classification system (5.48 for 5L versus 3.91 for 3L) and relative discriminatory power improved slightly on average (0.90 for 5L versus 0.84 for 3L). The mean difference between the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-3L values was 0.091 (range -0.345 to 0.505); whilst the mean difference between the EQ-5D-5L and the crosswalk values was 0.082 (range -0.035 to 0.293). Conclusion: In the REFORM clinical trial involving an elderly population, our study supported the feasibility and convergent validity of both EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L. Results suggest that the 5L improves the ceiling effect and discriminatory power. The EQ-5D-5L scores were significantly higher than both EQ-5D-3L and crosswalk.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A study protocol for the cardiac effects of a single dose of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg after caesarean delivery: a prospective randomized controlled multi-centre trial in Norway [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Both oxytocin and carbetocin are used to prevent uterine atony and post-partum haemorrhage after caesarean delivery in many countries, including Norway. Oxytocin causes dose-dependent ST-depression, troponin release, prolongation of QT-time and arrythmia, but little is known about myocardial effects of carbetocin. We have previously demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of oxytocin and carbetocin and are now undertaking a Phase 4 trial to investigate whether carbetocin causes similar changes to myocardial markers compared with oxytocin. Methods: Our randomized controlled trial will be conducted at three obstetrics units at Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Planned enrolment will be of 240 healthy, singleton pregnant women aged 18 to 50 years undergoing planned caesarean delivery. Based on pilot study data, each participant will receive a one-minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg during caesarean delivery. The prespecified primary outcome is the change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations at 6–10 hours after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes include uterine tone grade at 2.5 and five minutes after study drug administration, adverse events for up to 48 hours after study drug administration, estimated blood loss within eight hours of delivery, need for rescue treatment and direct/indirect costs. Enrolment and primary analysis are expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Discussion: Women undergoing caesarean delivery should be assessed for cardiovascular risk particularly as women with an obstetric history of pregnancy induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth are at increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. Any additional ischaemic myocardial risk from uterotonic agents will need to be balanced with the benefit of reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. Any potential cardiotoxicity difference between oxytocin and carbetocin will help inform treatment decisions for pregnant women. Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03899961 (02/04/2019).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online food delivery services: cross-sectional study of consumers’ attitude in Malaysia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysian consumers were more likely to purchase food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. To stay afloat, many restaurants were pushed to provide online food delivery services (OFDS), and this sector has grown tremendously. However, will the trend persist after the pandemic? This study aims to look into how consumers’ perceptions of OFDS affect their attitude towards them. It investigates the relationship between convenience motivation, perceived ease of use, time-saving orientation and price-saving orientation in terms of future intent to use OFDS. Method: Primary data was collected from 307 respondents in Malaysia using convenience sampling method through an online survey. Respondents’ demographic background was presented statistically in cross tabulation tables to study the ratio comparison implicitly. Consistent Partial Least Square approach and bootstrapping techniques with 5,000 subsamples was employed, with the aid of SmartPLS.V3 software, to identify the significant factors influencing consumers’ continuance intention after the pandemic. Result: Perceived ease of use does not contribute significantly to continuance intention as most consumers have prior online purchase experience.  Nevertheless, time-saving orientation has a positive correlation with perceived ease of use due to the simplicity of placing an order with just a click.  It is also found that price-saving orientation is related to convenience motivation, particularly when prices can be compared on the websites or online ordering platforms. Consumers’ intention to continue using OFDS even after the COVID-19 pandemic is positively influenced by all the parameters studied, except for perceived ease of use. Conclusion: Limited work has been done on the continuance intention to use OFDS beyond the pandemic. This study provides insight for food retailers on how to enhance their business and retain their customers with the support of technology, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a cross-sectional study on factors affecting health-related quality of life among Afghan refugees in Pakistan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pakistan served as a host for more than 1.4 million Afghan refugees for more than 40 years. Access to health care is the most important issue faced by refugees, because they might be at a higher risk for certain diseases. This risk can be attributed to a lack of awareness of health care facilities, health beliefs, inadequate hygiene, cultural differences, and malnutrition. Health of individuals is closely associated with their quality of life. Quality of life over the whole lifespan is pivotal to overall life satisfaction. It includes physical wellbeing, mental health, education, occupation, income, personal safety, as well as (religious) freedom. Until now, the health status of Afghan refugees has never been comprehensively investigated in Pakistan. Therefore, an assessment in this regard is needed to explore their health-related quality of life, for securing their human right to health. Methods: A cross-sectional study has been designed to describe and explain the health-related quality of life of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Multistage cluster sampling was applied for selection of study participants. The number of respondents from two regions in Pakistan was drawn through a proportionate sampling technique. A quantitative research method using pre-validated questionnaires was used for data collection. The questionnaire included items to assess well-being, mental health, health literacy, and factors affecting health and health care. Descriptive analysis was used, whereas inferential statistical tests (binary logistic regression model) was also performed. The study received ethically permission by the Advanced Studies and Research Board of the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Discussion: The assessment of Afghan refugee’s quality of life in Pakistan should lead to recommendations disseminated to public and health care officials. This evidence is needed for policymaking related to adequate measures for improving health conditions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine strategies for reducing the fast-food consumption of Cambodian adults.  Methods: This qualitative study was conducted among adults in Phnom Penh city, Cambodia, in 2018. 10 stakeholders were included from different institutions in Cambodia, mostly health institutions. The tools used in this study were a multidisciplinary meeting with stakeholders and the completion of observation forms. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, data were collected, and a thematic analysis was used. Results: Stakeholders’ viewpoints followed three identifiable themes with regard to approaches to reduce fast-food consumption among Cambodian adults. These comprised: (1) health education and health promotion (focusing on educational institutions), (2) reducing the availability and marketing impact of fast-food, and (3) implementing government policy. Conclusions: Knowing the important contributors to reduce the consumption of the fast food among Cambodia adults was the first priorities for all policy makers and other stakeholders to take action. This study provided essential findings for improving the decision-making abilities of those preparing strategy and policy for reducing fast-food consumption.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with lupus erythematosus in a sample of the Egyptian population: a hospital based cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Oral manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) are associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr EL Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Moreover, patients’ medical records were also evaluated.  The oral manifestations were recorded according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in LE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic. 74.3% of the patients had oral candidiasis. The prevalence of skin lesions in LE patients was 37.6%. The most common finding was malar rash 79%. Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with LE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of LE a widespread state associated with an increased risk of cancer. Also, implementation of oral hygiene measures and treatment to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life are recommended.

                <p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-antibody (Ab)–associated diseases (MOGAD) account for a substantial proportion of pediatric and adult patients who present with acquired demyelinating disorders. Its pathogenesis and optimal therapy are incompletely understood. We profiled systemic complement activation in adult and pediatric patients with MOGAD compared to patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, pediatric control and adult healthy donors. Proteins indicative of systemic classical and alternative complement activation were substantially increased in patients with MOGAD compared to control groups. Elevated levels were detected in both adult and pediatric cases and in across all clinical syndromes. Complement inhibition should be explored for its therapeutic merit in patients with MOGAD.</p>

Arora et al. provide evidence that B.1.617.2 may enter human lung cells and fuse neighboring cells more efficiently than the initially circulating virus. Further, the study suggests that B.1.617.2 may evade neutralization by antibodies elicited upon infection and vaccination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Linking spatial self-organization to community assembly and biodiversity</a></h4>

              
                Temporal shifts to drier climates impose environmental stresses on plant communities that may result in community reassembly and threatened ecosystem services, but also may trigger self-organization in spatial patterns of biota and resources, which act to relax these stresses. The complex relationships between these counteracting processes - community reassembly and spatial self-organization - have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to increasing water-deficit stress. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial self-organization buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A state space modeling approach to real-time phase estimation</a></h4>

              
                Brain rhythms have been proposed to facilitate brain function, with an especially important role attributed to the phase of low frequency rhythms. Understanding the role of phase in neural function requires interventions that perturb neural activity at a target phase, necessitating estimation of phase in real-time. Current methods for real-time phase estimation rely on bandpass filtering, which assumes narrowband signals and couples the signal and noise in the phase estimate, adding noise to the phase and impairing detections of relationships between phase and behavior. To address this, we propose a state space phase estimator for real-time tracking of phase. By tracking the analytic signal as a latent state, this framework avoids the requirement of bandpass filtering, separately models the signal and the noise, accounts for rhythmic confounds, and provides credible intervals for the phase estimate. We demonstrate in simulations that the state space phase estimator outperforms current state-of-the-art real-time methods in the contexts of common confounds such as broadband rhythms, phase resets and co-occurring rhythms. Finally, we show applications of this approach to in vivo data. The method is available as a ready-to-use plug-in for the OpenEphys acquisition system, making it widely available for use in experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TRPM7 is critical for short-term synaptic depression by regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                TRPM7 contributes to a variety of physiological and pathological processes in many tissues and cells. With a widespread distribution in the nervous system, TRPM7 is involved in animal behaviors and neuronal death induced by ischemia. However, the physiological role of TRPM7 in CNS neuron remains unclear. Here, we identify endocytic defects in neuroendocrine cells and neurons from TRPM7 knockout (KO) mice, indicating a role of TRPM7 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Our experiments further pinpoint the importance of TRPM7 as an ion channel in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging detects a defect in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in TRPM7 KO neuron, suggesting an importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via TRPM7 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Moreover, the short-term depression is enhanced in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission from TRPM7 KO mice. Taken together, our data suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via TRPM7 may be critical for short-term plasticity of synaptic strength by regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis in neurons.

                CNS neurons have no sensory function, protected by the skull. For this reason, brain neuromodulation by ultrasound were either done at a high intensity or through auditory nerves. We demonstrate in this study CNS neurons react to ultrasound stimulation at an intensity (5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) far lower than typical therapeutic ultrasound (&gt;30 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Using micropipette ultrasound in calcium imaging, we show ASIC1a channels play a role in the reactions of CNS neurons to ultrasound, pointing to the molecular basis for direct ultrasound neuromodulation at low intensity. Furthermore, we also show evidence of neurogenesis with the same ultrasound stimulation, suggesting potential therapeutic translation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human embryo polarization requires PLC signaling to mediate trophectoderm specification</a></h4>

              
                Apico-basal polarization of cells within the embryo is critical for the segregation of distinct lineages during mammalian development. Polarized cells become the trophectoderm (TE), which forms the placenta, and apolar cells become the inner cell mass (ICM), the founding population of the fetus. The cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to polarization of the human embryo and its timing during embryogenesis have remained unknown. Here, we show that human embryo polarization occurs in two steps: it begins with the apical enrichment of F-actin and is followed by the apical accumulation of the PAR complex. This two-step polarization process leads to the formation of an apical domain at the 8-16 cell stage. Using RNA interference, we show that apical domain formation requires Phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, specifically the enzymes PLCB1 and PLCE1, from the 8-cell stage onwards. Finally, we show that although expression of the critical TE differentiation marker GATA3 can be initiated independently of embryo polarization, downregulation of PLCB1 and PLCE1 decreases GATA3 expression through a reduction in the number of polarized cells. Therefore, apical domain formation reinforces a TE fate. The results we present here demonstrate how polarization is triggered to regulate the first lineage segregation in human embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hippocampal replay of experience at real-world speeds</a></h4>

              
                Representations related to past experiences play a critical role in memory and decision-making processes. The rat hippocampus expresses these types of representations during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events, and previous work identified a minority of SWRs that contain ‘replay’ of spatial trajectories at ∼20x the movement speed of the animal. Efforts to understand replay typically make multiple assumptions about which events to examine and what sorts of representations constitute replay. We therefore lack a clear understanding of both the prevalence and the range of representational dynamics associated with replay. Here, we develop a state space model that uses a combination of movement dynamics of different speeds to capture the spatial content and time evolution of replay during SWRs. Using this model, we find that the large majority of replay events contain spatially coherent, interpretable content. Furthermore, many events progress at real-world, rather than accelerated, movement speeds, consistent with actual experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergent and divergent brain structural and functional abnormalities associated with developmental dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Brain abnormalities in the reading network have been repeatedly reported in individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD); however, it is still not totally understood where the structural and functional abnormalities are consistent/inconsistent across languages. In the current multimodal meta-analysis, we found convergent structural and functional alterations in the left superior temporal gyrus across languages, suggesting a neural signature of DD. We found greater reduction in grey matter volume and brain activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in morpho-syllabic languages (e.g. Chinese) than in alphabetic languages, and greater reduction in brain activation in the left middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus in alphabetic languages than in morpho-syllabic languages. These language differences are explained as consequences of being DD while learning a specific language. In addition, we also found brain regions that showed increased grey matter volume and brain activation, presumably suggesting compensations and brain regions that showed inconsistent alterations in brain structure and function. Our study provides important insights about the etiology of DD from a cross-linguistic perspective with considerations of consistency/inconsistency between structural and functional alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-molecule imaging reveals the concerted release of myosin from regulated thin filaments</a></h4>

              
                Regulated thin filaments (RTFs) tightly control striated muscle contraction through calcium binding to troponin, which enables tropomyosin to expose myosin-binding sites on actin. Myosin binding holds tropomyosin in an open position, exposing more myosin-binding sites on actin, leading to cooperative activation. At lower calcium levels, troponin and tropomyosin turn off the thin filament; however, this is antagonised by the high local concentration of myosin, questioning how the thin filament relaxes. To provide molecular details of deactivation, we used single-molecule imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged myosin-S1 (S1-GFP) to follow the activation of RTF tightropes. In sub-maximal activation conditions, RTFs are not fully active, enabling direct observation of deactivation in real time. We observed that myosin binding occurs in a stochastic step-wise fashion; however, an unexpectedly large probability of multiple contemporaneous detachments is observed. This suggests that deactivation of the thin filament is a coordinated active process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformational changes in twitchin kinase in vivo revealed by FRET imaging of freely moving C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The force-induced unfolding and refolding of proteins is speculated to be a key mechanism in the sensing and transduction of mechanical signals in the living cell. Yet, little evidence has been gathered for its existence <i>in vivo</i>. Prominently, stretch-induced unfolding is postulated to be the activation mechanism of the twitchin/titin family of autoinhibited sarcomeric kinases linked to the mechanical stress response of muscle. To test the occurrence of mechanical kinase activation in living working muscle, we generated transgenic <i>C. elegans</i> expressing twitchin containing FRET moieties flanking the kinase domain and developed a quantitative technique for extracting FRET signals in freely moving <i>C. elegans</i>, using tracking and simultaneous imaging of animals in three channels (donor fluorescence, acceptor fluorescence, and transmitted light). Computer vision algorithms were used to extract fluorescence signals and muscle contraction states in each frame, in order to obtain fluorescence and body curvature measurements with spatial and temporal precision <i>in vivo</i>. The data revealed statistically significant periodic changes in FRET signals during muscle activity, consistent with a periodic change in the conformation of twitchin kinase. We conclude that stretch-unfolding of twitchin kinase occurs in the active muscle, whereby mechanical activity titrates the signalling pathway of this cytoskeletal kinase. We anticipate that the methods we have developed here could be applied to obtaining <i>in vivo</i> evidence for force-induced conformational changes or elastic behavior of other proteins not only in <i>C. elegans</i> but in other animals in which there is optical transparency (e.g zebrafish).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization and prediction of clinical pathways of vulnerability to psychosis through graph signal processing</a></h4>

              
                Causal interactions between specific psychiatric symptoms could contribute to the heterogenous clinical trajectories observed in early psychopathology. Current diagnostic approaches merge clinical manifestations that co-occur across subjects and could significantly hinder our understanding of clinical pathways connecting individual symptoms. Network analysis techniques have emerged as alternative approaches that could help shed light on the complex dynamics of early psychopathology. The present study attempts to address the two main limitations that have in our opinion hindered the application of network approaches in the clinical setting. Firstly, we show that a multi-layer network analysis approach, can move beyond a static view of psychopathology, by providing an intuitive characterization of the role of specific symptoms in contributing to clinical trajectories over time. Secondly, we show that a Graph-Signal-Processing approach, can exploit knowledge of longitudinal interactions between symptoms, to predict clinical trajectories at the level of the individual. We test our approaches in two independent samples of individuals with genetic and clinical vulnerability for developing psychosis. Novel network approaches can allow to embrace the dynamic complexity of early psychopathology and help pave the way towards a more a personalized approach to clinical care.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatiotemporal dynamics of PIEZO1 localization controls keratinocyte migration during wound healing</a></h4>

              
                Keratinocytes, the predominant cell type of the epidermis, migrate to reinstate the epithelial barrier during wound healing. Mechanical cues are known to regulate keratinocyte re-epithelialization and wound healing however, the underlying molecular transducers and biophysical mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show through molecular, cellular and organismal studies that the mechanically-activated ion channel PIEZO1 regulates keratinocyte migration and wound healing. Epidermal-specific <i>Piezo1</i> knockout mice exhibited faster wound closure while gain-of-function mice displayed slower wound closure compared to littermate controls. By imaging the spatiotemporal localization dynamics of endogenous PIEZO1 channels we find that channel enrichment at some regions of the wound edge induces a localized cellular retraction that slows keratinocyte collective migration. In migrating single keratinocytes, PIEZO1 is enriched at the rear of the cell, where maximal retraction occurs, and we find that chemical activation of PIEZO1 enhances retraction during single as well as collective migration. Our findings uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying single and collective keratinocyte migration that may suggest a potential pharmacological target for wound treatment. More broadly, we show that nanoscale spatiotemporal dynamics of Piezo1 channels can control tissue-scale events, a finding with implications beyond wound healing to processes as diverse as development, homeostasis, disease and repair.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness is poorly known. Using data from a cohort of cases and high-risk contacts, we reconstructed viral load at the time of contact and inferred the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was larger in household contacts than in non-household contacts, with a transmission probability as large as 48% when the viral load was greater than 10<sup>10</sup> copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset, with a mean probability of transmission of 29%, with large individual variations. The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by two- to eightfold with variants of concern and assuming no changes in the pattern of contacts across variants, the model predicts that larger viral load levels could lead to a relative increase in the probability of transmission of 24% to 58% in household contacts, and of 15% to 39% in non-household contacts.

                Neural circuits coordinate with muscles and sensory feedback to generate motor behaviors appropriate to an animal’s environment. In <i>C. elegans, </i>the mechanisms by which the motor circuit generates undulations and modulates them based on the environment are largely unclear. We quantitatively analyzed <i>C. elegans </i>locomotion during free movement and during transient optogenetic muscle inhibition. Undulatory movements were highly asymmetrical with respect to the duration of bending and unbending during each cycle. Phase response curves induced by brief optogenetic inhibition of head muscles showed gradual increases and rapid decreases as a function of phase at which the perturbation was applied. A relaxation oscillator model based on proprioceptive thresholds that switch the active muscle moment was developed and is shown to quantitatively agree with data from free movement, phase responses, and previous results for gait adaptation to mechanical loadings. Our results suggest a neuromuscular mechanism underlying <i>C. elegans</i> motor pattern generation within a compact circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A parameter-free statistical test for neuronal responsiveness</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological studies depend on a reliable quantification of whether and when a neuron responds to stimulation. Simple methods to determine responsiveness require arbitrary parameter choices, such as binning size, while more advanced model-based methods require fitting and hyperparameter tuning. These parameter choices can change the results, which invites bad statistical practice and reduces the replicability. New recording techniques that yield increasingly large numbers of cells would benefit from a test for cell-inclusion that requires no manual curation. Here, we present the parameter-free ZETA-test, which outperforms t-tests, ANOVAs, and renewal-process-based methods by including more cells at a similar false-positive rate. We show that our procedure works across brain regions and recording techniques, including calcium imaging and Neuropixels data. Furthermore, in illustration of the method, we show in mouse visual cortex that 1) visuomotor-mismatch and spatial location are encoded by different neuronal subpopulations; and 2) optogenetic stimulation of VIP cells leads to early inhibition and subsequent disinhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of type I interferon signaling and microglia in the abnormal long term potentiation and object place recognition deficits of male mice with a mutation of the Tuberous Sclerosis 2 gene</a></h4>

              
                Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder associated with high rates of intellectual disability and autism. Although previous studies focused on the role of neuronal deficits in the memory phenotypes of rodent models of TSC, the results presented here demonstrate a role for microglia in these deficits. Mice with a heterozygous null mutation of the Tsc2 gene (Tsc2+/-), show deficits in hippocampal dependent tasks, as well as abnormal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region. Here, we show that microglia and type I interferon signaling (IFN1) have a key role in the object place recognition (OPR; a hippocampal dependent task) deficits and abnormal LTP of Tsc2+/- male mice. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that male, but not female, Tsc2+/- mice showed OPR deficits. Importantly, these deficits can be rescued by depletion of microglia, as well as by a genetic manipulation of a signaling pathway known to modulate microglia function (interferon-alpha/beta receptor alpha chain null mutation). In addition to rescuing the OPR deficits, depletion of microglia also reversed the abnormal LTP of the Tsc2+/- mice. Altogether, our results suggest that altered IFN1 signaling in microglia cause the abnormal LTP and OPR deficits of male Tsc2+/- mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Convergent coding of recent and remote fear memory in the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Animals must learn to anticipate recently encountered threats as well as dangers experienced long ago. In both rodents and humans, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is essential for the encoding and retrieval conditioned fear memories. Although the BLA is a putative storage site for aversive memory, recent evidence suggests that these memories undergo time-dependent reorganization and no longer require the BLA after the passage of time. To explore this question, we systematically examined the role for the BLA in recent and remote fear memory using optogenetic, electrophysiological, and calcium imaging methods in male and female Long-Evans rats. Critically, we used a behavioral design that permits within-subjects comparison of recent and remote memory at the same time point. We found that BLA c-Fos expression was similar after the retrieval of recent (1 day) or remote (2 weeks) fear memories. Extracellular recordings in awake, behaving animals revealed that the majority of BLA neurons encoded both recent and remote memories, suggesting substantial overlap in the allocation of temporally distinct events. Fiber photometric recordings of BLA principal neurons also revealed similar patterns of CS-evoked activity to recent and remote CSs. Consistent with these results, continuous or CS-specific optogenetic inhibition of BLA principal neurons impaired conditioned freezing to both recent and remote CSs. Collectively, these data reveal that single BLA neurons encode both recent and remote fear memories. This may underlie the broad generalization of fear memories across both space and time. Ultimately, these results provide robust evidence that the BLA is a long-term storage site for emotional memories.

                To understand how cortical circuits generate complex behavior, it is crucial to investigate the cell types that comprise them. Functional differences across pyramidal neuron (PyN) types have been observed in sensory and frontal cortex, but it is not known whether these differences are the rule across all cortical areas or if different PyN types mostly follow the same cortex-wide dynamics. We used genetic and retrograde labeling to target pyramidal tract (PT), intratelencephalic (IT) and corticostriatal projection neurons and measured their cortex-wide activity. Each PyN type drove unique neural dynamics at a cortex-wide and within-area scale. Cortical activity and optogenetic inactivation during an auditory discrimination task also revealed distinct functional roles: all PyNs in parietal cortex were recruited during sensory stimulation but, surprisingly, PT neurons were most important for perception. In frontal cortex, all PyNs were required for accurate choices but showed distinct choice-tuning. Our results reveal that rich, cell-type-specific cortical dynamics shape perceptual decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast resupply of synaptic vesicles requires Synaptotagmin-3</a></h4>

              
                Sustained neuronal activity demands quick resupply of synaptic vesicles in order to maintain reliable synaptic transmission. Such vesicle replenishment is accelerated by sub-micromolar presynaptic Ca2+ signals by an as yet unidentified high-affinity Ca2+ sensor. Here we identify a novel presynaptic role for the high-affinity Ca2+ sensor Synaptotagmin-3 (SYT3) in driving vesicle replenishment and short-term synaptic plasticity. Synapses in Syt3 knockout mice exhibit enhanced short-term depression, and recovery is slower and insensitive to presynaptic residual Ca2+. During sustained neuronal firing, SYT3 speeds vesicle replenishment and increases the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles. SYT3 also mediates a second form of short-term enhancement called facilitation, under conditions of low vesicle release probability. Models of vesicle trafficking suggest that SYT3 could combat synaptic depression by accelerating vesicle docking at active zones. Our results reveal a critical role for presynaptic SYT3 in maintaining reliable high-frequency synaptic transmission in neural circuits.

                Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are a class of rapidly rising devastating diseases and the reason behind are might be an improper function of related genes or a mutation in a particular gene or even could be autoimmune also. Parkinsons disease (PD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntingtons disease (HD) are some of the NDs, and still, incurable fully. Apart from the similarities in symptoms, there are common genes that express somehow a differential manner in patients of PDs, MSs, and HDs. A total of 1197 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are obtained by analyzing the chosen datasets. The protein interactions by STRING online tool and degree sorted hubs obtained through a plug-in in Cytoscape; Cyto-Hubba. Among the sorted hubs KRAS, CREB1, PIK3CA, JAK2 are the ones that are not only common to all the studied datasets of NDs but also in other neurological disorders like Alzheimers. The enriched pathways with biological process, molecular function, cellular component, and KEGG pathway details are obtained and analyzed using Enricher. This paper frames that the obtained hub genes could be potential biomarkers also and a need for further drug design for finding a possible cure.

                Alzheimer's is a type of dementia symptom that slowly worsens over some time. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer's, the patient loses the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis, and neuronal loss. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most severe forms of inherited muscular dystrophies. It is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease and does not exhibit a predilection for any race or ethnic group. In this study, several gene expression study data were analyzed and there were 557 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in all three chosen Datasets. A protein-protein interaction network was created using STRING and CytoHubba plug-in was used to identify the top ten genes which are POLR2A, SETD2, EFTUD2, RBM25, PRPF40A, CDK13, BPTF, THOC2, SNRNP70, and SCAF11. Online software Enrichr was used for Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to find out the biological process, molecular function, cellular component, and the pathways that are commonly affected in these diseases.

                Axon loss is a cardinal neuropathological feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). Axonal injury in MS and experimental disease models is most frequently detected in acutely demyelinating regions. Furthermore, acute axonal injury consistently correlates with the extent of inflammatory demyelination. Following lysolecithin-induced demyelination, we recently reported a compensatory response in neurons, where mitochondria move from the cell body to the acutely demyelinated axon and increase the mitochondrial content. We termed this energetics phenomenon, that is also evident in MS, the axonal response of mitochondria to demyelination (ARMD). In the present study, we assessed axonal mitochondrial content as well as axonal mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV activity (COX) of axons and related these to axonal injury in nine different experimental disease models. We consistently found ARMD in all experimental disease models. However, the increase in mitochondrial content within demyelinated axons was not always accompanied by a proportionate increase in COX activity, particularly in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Axonal COX activity inversely correlated with the extent of axonal injury in experimental disease models. Our findings indicate that ARMD is a consistent and prominent finding and emphasises the need to preserve axonal mitochondrial COX activity in inflammatory demyelination, paving the way for the development of novel neuroprotective therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural oscillation coupling selectively predicts speech reception in young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Communication difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve a speech reception deficit, whose biological causes are not yet identified. This deficit could denote atypical neuronal ensemble activity, as reflected by neural oscillations. Atypical cross-frequency oscillation coupling in particular could disrupt the possibility to jointly track and predict dynamic acoustic stimuli, a dual process that is essential for speech comprehension. Whether such oscillation anomalies can already be found in very young children with ASD, and with what specificity they relate to individual language reception capacity is unknown. In this study, neural activity was collected using EEG in 64 very young children with and without ASD (mean age 3) while they were exposed to naturalistic-continuous speech via an age-appropriate cartoon. EEG power typically associated with phrase-level chunking (delta, 1-3Hz), phonemic encoding (low-gamma, 25-35Hz) and top-down control (beta, 12-20Hz) was markedly reduced in ASD relative to typically developing (TD) children. Speech neural-tracking by delta and theta oscillations was also weaker in ASD than TD children. Critically, children with ASD exhibited slightly atypical theta/gamma coupling (PAC) involving a higher-than-normal gamma frequency, and markedly atypical beta/gamma PAC. Even though many oscillation features were atypical in our sample of 31 very young children with ASD, the beta/gamma coupling anomaly was the single best predictor of individual speech reception difficulties. These findings suggest that early interventions targeting the normalization of low-gamma and low-beta activity, might help young children with ASD to engage more in oral interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-Related Differences in Reward-Based Modulation of Sequential Reaching Performance</a></h4>

              
                Reward can increase the speed and accuracy of movements in both simple and sequential reaching tasks. Two mechanisms are thought to be responsible for this: an increase in maximum velocity, due to increased muscle stiffness, resulting in faster, but energetically inefficient, individual movements; or coarticulation; the blending of sub-movements into single, smoother, more energetically efficient movements. Older adults have shown reduced sensitivity to reward in decision paradigms, but there is little research relating reward and motor performance in older adults. Using a novel online sequential reaching task, we compared the effects of reward on motor performance between young (18-23 years) and older (65-79 years) participants. We found that movement time decreased across training in all groups, and reward invigorated this decrease in both age groups. This suggests that reward is a viable facilitator of motor performance to compensate for age-related motor decline and has the potential for use in the design of rehabilitation programmes for age-related motor deficits or disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABAB receptor/HCN channel complexes in VTA dopamine neurons limit synaptic inhibition and prevent anxiety-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Aversive stimuli inhibiting dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (DAVTA neurons) induce anxiety-like behaviors. The inhibition of DAVTA neurons is prolonged by GABAB receptor (GBR)-activated K+-currents, which exhibit a rapid desensitization of unknown physiological relevance. We now report that GBRs associate via auxiliary KCTD16 subunits with HCN channels, which facilitates activation of hyperpolarization activated currents (Ih) by GBR-activated K+ currents. Activation of Ih underlies rapid K+ current desensitization in DAVTA neurons and limits GBR-mediated inhibition. Disruption of the GBR/HCN complex in KCTD16-/- mice or blockade of Ih prolongs optogenetically driven inhibition of DAVTA neuron firing. KCTD16-/- mice exhibit an increased anxiety-like behavior in response to stressful stimuli, which is reproduced by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KCTD16 ablation in DAVTA neurons or intra-VTA infusion of HCN antagonist to wild-type mice. Our data reveal that GBR-induced Ih protect DAVTA neurons from prolonged GBR mediated inhibition in response to stressors, which moderates anxiety-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell and circuit origins of fast network oscillations in the mammalian main olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Neural synchrony generates fast network oscillations throughout the brain, including the main olfactory bulb (MOB), the first processing station of the olfactory system. Identifying the mechanisms synchronizing neurons in the MOB will be key to understanding how network oscillations support the coding of a high-dimensional sensory space. Here, using paired recordings and optogenetic activation of glomerular sensory inputs in MOB slices, we uncovered profound differences in principal mitral cell (MC) vs. tufted cell (TC) spike-time synchrony: TCs robustly synchronized across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, while MC synchrony was weaker and concentrated in slow-gamma frequencies. Synchrony among both cell types was enhanced by shared glomerular input but was independent of intraglomerular lateral excitation. Cell-type differences in synchrony could also not be traced to any difference in the synchronization of synaptic inhibition. Instead, greater TC than MC synchrony paralleled the more periodic firing among resonant TCs than MCs and emerged in patterns consistent with densely synchronous network oscillations. Collectively, our results thus reveal a mechanism for parallel processing of sensory information in the MOB via differential TC vs. MC synchrony, and further contrast mechanisms driving fast network oscillations in the MOB from those driving the sparse synchronization of irregularly-firing principal cells throughout cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Direct neuronal conversion of microglia/macrophages reinstates neurological function after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Ischaemic brain injury causes permanent neuronal loss, which often results in persistent severe neurological dysfunctions. Although generating new neurons in the injured brain would be an ideal approach to replenish the lost neurons for repairing the damage, the adult mammalian brain retains only limited neurogenic capability. Here, we show that direct conversion of microglia/macrophages into neurons in the brain has great potential as a therapeutic strategy for ischaemic brain injury. After transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult mice, microglia/macrophages converge at the lesion core of the striatum, where neuronal loss is prominent. Targeted expression of a neurogenic transcription factor, NeuroD1, in microglia/macrophages in the injured striatum enables their conversion into induced neuronal cells that functionally integrate into the existing neuronal circuits. Furthermore, NeuroD1-mediated induced neuronal cell generation significantly improves neurological function in the mouse stroke model, and ablation of these cells abolishes the gained functional recovery. Our findings thus demonstrate that neuronal conversion contributes directly to functional recovery after stroke and shed further light on the development of therapies for ischaemic brain injury by in situ neuronal conversion technology.

	<p>Background. Autism Spectrum Disorder is often associated with deficits in executive functions (EFs), which is contributing significantly to individuals with ASD’s difficulties in conducting an independent life, particularly considering social skills. Technologies offer promising opportunities to structure EF intervention programs for children on the autistic spectrum. Methods. This study aimed to review the effectiveness of randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies of EF interventions delivered to children and young people (up to 23 years old) with a diagnosis of ASD. A special focus was dedicated to document the effectiveness of computerized and non-computerized cognitive training on (1) EFs and on (2) ASD symptomatology and social skills. Of 2601 studies retrieved, 19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results. Most of the interventions identified were effective in enhancing EFs and reducing symptoms in children and young people with ASD. Limited evidence is available on their generalization to untrained skills (i.e., social abilities) as well as long-term effects. Conclusions. There is growing evidence for overall effectiveness of EF training, particularly when computerized. However, caution should be taken when interpreting these findings owing to methodological limitations, the minimal number of papers retrieved, and a small samples of included studies.</p>

	<p>The paper discusses and provides support for diverse processes of brain plasticity in visual function after damage in infancy and childhood in comparison with injury that occurs in the adult brain. We provide support and description of neuroplastic mechanisms in childhood that do not seemingly exist in the same way in the adult brain. Examples include the ability to foster the development of thalamocortical connectivities that can circumvent the lesion and reach their cortical destination in the occipital cortex as the developing brain is more efficient in building new connections. Supporting this claim is the fact that in those with central visual field defects we can note that the extrastriatal visual connectivities are greater when a lesion occurs earlier in life as opposed to in the neurologically mature adult. The result is a significantly more optimized system of visual and spatial exploration within the ‘blind’ field of view. The discussion is provided within the context of “blindsight” and the “Sprague Effect”.</p>

                <p>Younger adults with epilepsy have an increased mortality. Some deaths are seizure-related, e.g. sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), while others, e.g. suicide, have multiple causes including adverse effects of the treatment on mood.</p>
<p>In this retrospective population-based study of all Danish persons with epilepsy aged 18–49 years during 2007–2009 we evaluated the risk of death from seizures and suicide.</p>
<p>SUDEP comprised 82.7% of all seizure-related death. Younger adults with epilepsy had an 8.3-fold increased risk of death from seizure-related causes compared with suicide. This underpins the importance of effective seizure control in preventing premature death.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a highly heterogeneous neurologic disorder characterized by lower-extremity spasticity. Here we set out to determine the genetic basis of an autosomal dominant, pure and infantile onset form of HSP in a cohort of eight patients with a uniform clinical presentation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Trio whole exome sequencing was utilized in five index patients with infantile onset pure HSP to determine the genetic cause of disease. The functional impact of identified genetic variants was verified utilizing bioinformatics and complementary cellular and biochemical assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct heterozygous <i>KPNA3</i> missense variants were found to segregate with the clinical phenotype in eight patients, in four of them <i>KPNA3</i> variants have occurred <i>de novo</i>. Mutant Karyopherin-α3 proteins exhibit a variable pattern of altered expression level, subcellular distribution and protein interaction.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our genetic findings implicate heterozygous variants in <i>KPNA3</i> as a novel cause for autosomal dominant, early onset and pure HSP. Mutant Karyopherin-α3 proteins display varying deficits in molecular and cellular functions, thus for the first time implicating dysfunctional nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as a novel pathomechanism causing HSP.</p>

                Brainstem to spinal cord pathways modulate spinal neuronal activity. We implemented locus coeruleus (LC) targeting strategies by microinjecting CAV-PRS-ChR2 virus in the spinal cord (LC:SC module) or LC (LC:LC module). While activation of both modules inhibited evoked spinal neuronal firing via 1-adrenoceptor-mediated actions, LC:SC opto-activation abolished diffuse noxious inhibitory controls. The LC as a pain generator is likely mechanistically underpinned by maladaptive communication with discrete descending modulatory pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">KLC4 shapes axon arbors during development and mediates adult behavior</a></h4>

              
                Development of elaborate and polarized neuronal morphology requires precisely regulated transport of cellular cargos by motor proteins such as kinesin-1. Kinesin-1 has numerous cellular cargos which must be delivered to unique neuronal compartments. The process by which this motor selectively transports and delivers cargo to regulate neuronal morphogenesis is poorly understood. Our work implicates one kinesin light chain subunit, KLC4, as an essential regulator of axon branching and arborization pattern of sensory neurons during development. Using several live imaging approaches in klc4 mutant zebrafish, we show that KLC4 is required for stabilization of nascent axon branches and for proper microtubule (MT) dynamics. Furthermore, KLC4 is required for the contact repulsion necessary for tiling of peripheral axon arbors: in klc4 mutants, peripheral axons showed abnormal fasciculation, a behavior characteristic of central axons, suggesting that KLC4 patterns axonal compartments and helps define axon identity. Finally, we find that klc4 mutant adults show anxiety-like behavior in a novel tank test, implicating klc4 as a novel gene involved in stress response circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Neuromuscular Model of Human Locomotion Combines Spinal Reflex Circuits with Voluntary Movements</a></h4>

              
                Existing models of human walking use low-level reflexes or neural oscillators to generate movement. While appropriate to generate the stable, rhythmic movement patterns of steady-state walking, these models lack the ability to change their movement patterns or spontaneously generate new movements in the specific, goal-directed way characteristic of voluntary movements. Here we present a neuromuscular model of human locomotion that bridges this gap and combines the ability to execute goal directed movements with the generation of stable, rhythmic movement patterns that are required for robust locomotion. The model represents goals for voluntary movements of the swing leg on the task level of swing leg joint kinematics. Smooth movements plans towards the goal configuration are generated on the task level and transformed into descending motor commands that execute the planned movements, using internal models. The movement goals and plans are updated in real time based on sensory feedback and task constraints. On the spinal level, the descending commands during the swing phase are integrated with a generic stretch reflex for each muscle. Stance leg control solely relies on dedicated spinal reflex pathways. Spinal reflexes stimulate Hill-type muscles that actuate a biomechanical model with eight internal joints and six free-body degrees of freedom. The model is able to generate voluntary, goal-directed reaching movements with the swing leg and combine multiple movements in a rhythmic sequence. During walking, the swing leg is moved in a goal-directed manner to a target that is updated in real-time based on sensory feedback to maintain upright balance, while the stance leg is stabilized by low-level reflexes and a behavioral organization switching between swing and stance control for each leg. With this combination of reflexive stance leg and voluntary, goal-directed control of the swing leg, the model controller generates rhythmic, stable walking patterns in which the swing leg movement can be flexibly updated in real-time to step over or around obstacles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flygenvectors: The spatial and temporal structure of neural activity across the fly brain</a></h4>

              
                What are the spatial and temporal scales of brain-wide neuronal activity, and how do activities at different scales interact? We used SCAPE microscopy to image a large fraction of the central brain of adult Drosophila melanogaster with high spatiotemporal resolution while flies engaged in a variety of behaviors, including running, grooming and flailing. This revealed neural representations of behavior on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The activity of most neurons across the brain correlated (or, in some cases, anticorrelated) with running and flailing over timescales that ranged from seconds to almost a minute. Grooming elicited a much weaker global response. Although these behaviors accounted for a large fraction of neural activity, residual activity not directly correlated with behavior was high dimensional. Many dimensions of the residual activity reflect the activity of small clusters of spatially organized neurons that may correspond to genetically defined cell types. These clusters participate in the global dynamics, indicating that neural activity reflects a combination of local and broadly distributed components. This suggests that microcircuits with highly specified functions are provided with knowledge of the larger context in which they operate, conferring a useful balance of specificity and flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Backward masking in mice requires visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual masking is used extensively to infer the timescale of conscious perception in humans; yet the underlying circuit mechanisms are not understood. We describe a robust backward masking paradigm in mice, in which the location of a briefly flashed grating is effectively masked within a 50 ms window after stimulus onset. Optogenetic silencing of visual cortex likewise reduces performance in this window, but response rates and accuracy do not match masking, demonstrating cortical silencing and masking are distinct phenomena. Spiking responses recorded in primary visual cortex (V1) are consistent with masked behavior when quantified over long, but not short, time windows, indicating masking involves further downstream processing. Accuracy and performance can be quantitatively recapitulated by a dual accumulator model constrained by V1 activity. The model and the animal's performance for the earliest decisions imply that the initial spike or two arriving from the periphery trigger a correct response, but subsequent V1 spikes, evoked by the mask, degrade performance for later decisions. To test the necessity of visual cortex for backward masking, we optogenetically silenced mask-evoked cortical activity which fully restored discrimination of target location. Together, these results demonstrate that mice, like humans, are susceptible to backward visual masking and that visual cortex causally contributes to this process.

                A novel self-supervised deep learning (DL) method is developed for computing bias-free, personalized brain functional networks (FNs) that provide unique opportunities to better understand brain function, behavior, and disease. Specifically, convolutional neural networks with an encoder-decoder architecture are employed to compute personalized FNs from resting-state fMRI data without utilizing any external supervision by optimizing functional homogeneity of personalized FNs in a self-supervised setting. We demonstrate that a DL model trained on fMRI scans from the Human Connectome Project can identify canonical FNs and generalizes well across four different datasets. We further demonstrate that the identified personalized FNs are informative for predicting individual differences in behavior, brain development, and schizophrenia status. Taken together, self-supervised DL allows for rapid, generalizable computation of personalized FNs.

	<p>Radiological activity in the post-partum period in MS patients is a well-known phenomenon, but there is no data concerning the influence of pregnancy on regional brain atrophy. The aim of this article was to investigate local brain atrophy in the peri-pregnancy period (PPP) in patients with MS. Thalamic volume (TV); corpus callosum volume (CCV) and classical MRI activity (new gadolinium enhancing lesions (Gd+), new T2 lesions, T1 lesions volume (T1LV) and T2 lesions volume (T2LV)) were analyzed in 12 clinically stable women with relapsing–remitting MS and with MRI performed in the PPP. We showed that there was a significant decrease in TV (p = 0.021) in the PPP. We also observed a significant increase in the T1 lesion volume (p = 0.028), new gadolinium-enhanced and new T2 lesions (in 46% and 77% of the scans, respectively) in the post-partum period. Our results suggest that the PPP in MS may be associated not only with classical MRI activity but, also, with regional brain atrophy.</p>

	<p>There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) at a higher rate than individuals in the general population. Nonetheless, little is known regarding the unique presentation of ASD symptoms in DS. The current study aims to explore the prevalence and profiles of ASD symptoms in a sample of individuals with DS (n = 83), aged between 6 and 23 years. Analysis of this sample (MAge = 15.13) revealed that approximately 37% of the sample met the classification cut-off for ASD using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) Calibrated Severity Score (CSS), an indicator of the participants’ severity of ASD-related symptoms. Item-level analyses revealed that multiple items on Module 2 and Module 3 of the ADOS-2, mostly in the Social Affect (SA) subdomain, differentiated the children with DS who did not meet ASD classification (DS-only) from those who did (DS + ASD). Lastly, comparisons of individuals with DS-only and those with DS + ASD differed significantly on the syntactic complexity of their expressive language. These findings shed light on the unique presentation of ASD symptoms in a sample of individuals with DS and suggest that expressive language abilities may play a pivotal role in the presentation of ASD symptoms in DS.</p>

	<p>Objectives: In this pilot study we investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on language recovery in the subacute stage of post-stroke aphasia using clinical parameters and diffusion imaging with constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography. Methods: The study included 21 patients with subacute post-stroke aphasia. Patients were randomly classified into two groups with a ratio of 2:1 to receive real tDCS or sham tDCS as placebo control. Patients received 10 sessions (5/week) bi-hemispheric tDCS treatments over the left affected Broca’s area (anodal electrode) and over the right unaffected Broca’s area (cathodal stimulation). Aphasia score was assessed clinically using the language section of the Hemispheric Stroke Scale (HSS) before and after treatment sessions. Diffusion imaging and tractography were performed for seven patients of the real group, both before and after the 10th session. Dissection of language-related white matter tracts was achieved, and diffusion measures were extracted. A paired Student’s t-test was used to compare the clinical recovery and diffusion measures of the dissected tracts both pre- and post- treatment. The partial correlation between changes in diffusion measures and the language improvements was calculated. Results: At baseline assessment, there were no significant differences between groups in demographic and clinical HSS language score. No significant clinical recovery in HSS was evident in the sham group. However, significant improvements in the different components of HSS were only observed in patients receiving real tDCS. Associated significant increase in the fractional anisotropy of the right uncinate fasciculus and a significant reduction in the mean diffusivity of the right frontal aslant tract were reported. A significant positive correlation was found between the changes in the right uncinate fasciculus and fluency improvement. Conclusions: Aphasia recovery after bi-hemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation was associated with contralesional right-sided white matter changes at the subacute stage. These changes probably reflect neuroplasticity that could contribute to the recovery. Both the right uncinate fasciculus and right frontal aslant tract seem to be involved in aphasia recovery.</p>

	<p>Acid-base homeostasis is crucial for numerous physiological processes. Na+/HCO3− cotransporters (NBCs) belong to the solute carrier 4 (SLC4) family, which regulates intracellular pH as well as HCO3− absorption and secretion. However, knowledge of the structural functions of these proteins remains limited. Electrogenic NBC (NBCe-1) is thought to be the primary factor promoting the precise acid–base equilibrium in distinct cell types for filtration and reabsorption, as well as the function of neurons and glia. NBC dysregulation is strongly linked to several diseases. As such, the need for special drugs that interfere with the transmission function of NBC is becoming increasingly urgent. In this review, we focus on the structural and functional characteristics of NBCe1, and discuss the roles of NBCe1 in the kidney, central nervous system (CNS), and related disorders, we also summarize the research on NBC inhibitors. NBCe1 and the related pathways should be further investigated, so that new medications may be developed to address the related conditions.</p>

	<p>Background: Cataracts are associated with progressive blindness, and despite the decline in prevalence in recent years, it remains a major global health problem. Cataract extraction is reported to influence not only perception, attention and memory but also daytime sleepiness, ability to experience pleasure and positive and negative affect. However, when it comes to the latter, the magnitude and prevalence of this effect still remains uncertain. The current study aims to evaluate the hemodynamic basis of daytime sleepiness, ability to experience pleasure and positive and negative affect in cataract patients after the intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Methods: Thirty-four cataract patients underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging evaluation before and after cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Both global and local graph metrics were calculated in order to investigate the hemodynamic basis of excessive sleepiness (ESS), experiencing pleasure (SHAPS) as well as positive and negative affect (PANAS) in cataract patients. Results: Eigenvector centrality and clustering coefficient alterations associated with cataract extraction are significantly correlated with excessive sleepiness, experiencing pleasure as well as positive and negative affect. Conclusions: The current study reveals the hemodynamic basis of sleepiness, pleasure and affect in patients after cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. The aforementioned mechanism constitutes a proof for changes in functional network activity associated with postoperative vision improvement.</p>

	<p>Multiple types of sleep arousal account for a large proportion of the causes of sleep disorders. The detection of sleep arousals is very important for diagnosing sleep disorders and reducing the risk of further complications including heart disease and cognitive impairment. Sleep arousal scoring is manually completed by sleep experts by checking the recordings of several periods of sleep polysomnography (PSG), which is a time-consuming and tedious work. Therefore, the development of efficient, fast, and reliable automatic sleep arousal detection system from PSG may provide powerful help for clinicians. This paper reviews the automatic arousal detection methods in recent years, which are based on statistical rules and deep learning methods. For statistical detection methods, three important processes are typically involved, including preprocessing, feature extraction and classifier selection. For deep learning methods, different models are discussed by now, including convolution neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long-term and short-term memory neural network (LSTM), residual neural network (ResNet), and the combinations of these neural networks. The prediction results of these neural network models are close to the judgments of human experts, and these methods have shown robust generalization capabilities on different data sets. Therefore, we conclude that the deep neural network will be the main research method of automatic arousal detection in the future.</p>

	<p>Decades of research have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but its clinical use remains somewhat restricted because of its cognitive side effects. The aim of this systematic review is to comprehensively summarize current evidence assessing potential biomarkers of ECT-related cognitive side effects. Based on our systematic search of human studies indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge, a total of 29 studies evaluating patients with MDD undergoing ECT were reviewed. Molecular biomarkers studies did not consistently identify concentration changes in plasma S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), or Aβ peptides significantly associated with cognitive performance after ECT. Importantly, these findings suggest that ECT-related cognitive side effects cannot be explained by mechanisms of neural cell damage. Notwithstanding, S-100b protein and Aβ40 peptide concentrations, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphisms, have been suggested as potential predictive biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction after ECT. In addition, recent advances in brain imaging have allowed us to identify ECT-induced volumetric and functional changes in several brain structures closely related to memory performance such as the hippocampus. We provide a preliminary framework to further evaluate neurobiological cognitive vulnerability profiles of patients with MDD treated with ECT.</p>

	<p>Based on Eysenck’s biopsychological trait theory, brain arousal has long been considered to explain individual differences in human personality. Yet, results from empirical studies remained inconclusive. However, most published results have been derived from small samples and, despite inherent limitations, EEG alpha power has usually served as an exclusive indicator for brain arousal. To overcome these problems, we here selected N = 468 individuals of the LIFE-Adult cohort and investigated the associations between the Big Five personality traits and brain arousal by using the validated EEG- and EOG-based analysis tool VIGALL. Our analyses revealed that participants who reported higher levels of extraversion and openness to experience, respectively, exhibited lower levels of brain arousal in the resting state. Bayesian and frequentist analysis results were especially convincing for openness to experience. Among the lower-order personality traits, we obtained the strongest evidence for neuroticism facet ‘impulsivity’ and reduced brain arousal. In line with this, both impulsivity and openness have previously been conceptualized as aspects of extraversion. We regard our findings as well in line with the postulations of Eysenck and consistent with the recently proposed ‘arousal regulation model’. Our results also agree with meta-analytically derived effect sizes in the field of individual differences research, highlighting the need for large (collaborative) studies.</p>

	<p>Extreme prematurity (EPT, &amp;amp;lt;28 weeks gestation) is associated with language problems. We previously reported hyperconnectivity in EPT children versus term children (TC) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Here, we aim to ascertain whether functional hyperconnectivity is a marker of language resiliency for EPT children, validating our earlier work with a distinct sample of contemporary well-performing EPT and preterm children with history of language delay (EPT-HLD). A total of 58 children (17 EPT, 9 EPT-HLD, and 32 TC) participated in stories listening during MEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 4–6 years. We compared connectivity in EPT and EPT-HLD, investigating relationships with language over time. We measured fMRI activation during stories listening and parcellated the activation map to obtain “nodes” for MEG connectivity analysis. There were no significant group differences in age, sex, race, ethnicity, parental education, income, language scores, or language representation on fMRI. MEG functional connectivity (weighted phase lag index) was significantly different between groups. Preterm children had increased connectivity, replicating our earlier work. EPT and EPT-HLD had hyperconnectivity versus TC at 24–26 Hz, with EPT-HLD exhibiting greatest connectivity. Network strength correlated with change in standardized scores from 2 years to 4–6 years of age, suggesting hyperconnectivity is a marker of advancing language development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuropathological variability within a spectrum of NMDAR‐encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe the neuropathological features of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-encephalitis in an archival autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined four autopsies from patients with NMDAR-encephalitis; two patients were untreated, three had comorbidities: small cell lung cancer (SCLC), brain post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), and overlapping demyelination.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two untreated patients had inflammatory infiltrates predominantly composed of perivascular and parenchymal CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>-</sup> T cells and CD79a<sup>+</sup> B cells/plasma cells in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus with surrounding white matter. The hippocampi showed a significant decrease of NMDAR-immunoreactivity that correlated with disease severity. The patient with NMDAR-encephalitis and immunosuppression for kidney transplantation developed a brain monomorphic PTLD. Inflammatory changes were compatible with NMDAR-encephalitis. Additionally, plasma cells accumulated in the vicinity of the necrotic tumor along with macrophages and activated microglia that strongly expressed pro-inflammatory activation markers HLA-DR, CD68, and IL18. The fourth patient developed demyelinating lesions in the setting of a relapse four years after NMDAR-encephalitis. These lesions exhibited the hallmarks of classic multiple sclerosis with radially expanding lesions and remyelinated shadow plaques without complement or immunoglobulin deposition, compatible with a pattern I demyelination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The topographic distribution of inflammation in patients with NMDAR-encephalitis reflects the clinical symptoms of movement disorders, abnormal behavior, and memory dysfunction with inflammation dominantly observed in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus, and loss of NMDAR-immunoreactivity correlates with disease severity. Co-occurring pathologies influence the spatial distribution, composition, and intensity of inflammation, which may modify patients' clinical presentation and outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cardiac troponin and recurrent major vascular events after minor stroke or TIA</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and whether this association differs after risk stratification based on the “Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, Diabetes” (ABCD<sup>2</sup>) score.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>INSPiRE-TMS was a randomized controlled trial allocating patients with minor stroke or TIA to an intensified support program or conventional care. In this post-hoc analysis, participants were categorized using hs-cTnT levels (5<sup>th</sup> Generation, Roche, 99<sup>th</sup> percentile upper reference limit [URL] 14ng/L). Vascular risk was stratified using the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score (lower-risk:0-5 vs. higher-risk:6-7). Cox proportional hazard regression was performed using covariate adjustment and propensity score matching (PSM) for the association between hs-cTnT and MACE (stroke/non-fatal coronary event/vascular death).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 889 patients (mean age 70 years, 37% female), MACE occurred in 153 patients (17.2%) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. Hs-cTnT was associated with MACE (9.3%/year&gt;URL vs. 4.4%/year≤URL, adjusted HR 1.63 [95%CI 1.13-2.35], adjusted HR (Q<sub>4</sub> vs.Q<sub>1</sub>) 2.57 [95%CI 1.35-4.97], adjusted HR (log-transformed) 2.31 [95%CI 1.37-3.89]). This association remained after PSM (adjusted HR 1.76 [95%CI 1.14-2.72]). There was a significant interaction between hs-cTnT and ABCD<sup>2</sup> category for MACE occurrence (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.04). In the lower-risk category, MACE rate was 9.5%/year in patients with hs-cTnT&gt;URL, which was higher than in those ≤URL (3.8%/year) and similar to the overall rate in the higher-risk category.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Hs-cTnT levels are associated with incident MACE within three years after minor stroke or TIA and may help to identify high-risk individuals otherwise deemed at lower-risk based on the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score. If confirmed in independent validation studies, this might warrant intensified secondary prevention measures and cardiac diagnostics in stroke patients with elevated hs-cTnT.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endotaxis: A Universal Algorithm for Mapping, Goal-Learning, and Navigation</a></h4>

              
                An animal entering a new environment typically faces three challenges: explore the space for resources, memorize their locations, and navigate towards those targets as needed. Experimental work on exploration, mapping, and navigation has mostly focused on simple environments - such as an open arena, a pond [1], or a desert [2] - and much has been learned about neural signals in diverse brain areas under these conditions [3,4]. However, many natural environments are highly constrained, such as a system of burrows, or of paths through the underbrush. More generally, many cognitive tasks are equally constrained, allowing only a small set of actions at any given stage in the process. Here we propose an algorithm that learns the structure of an arbitrary environment, discovers useful targets during exploration, and navigates back to those targets by the shortest path. It makes use of a behavioral module common to all motile animals, namely the ability to follow an odor to its source [5]. We show how the brain can learn to generate internal "virtual odors'" that guide the animal to any location of interest. This endotaxis algorithm can be implemented with a simple 3-layer neural circuit using only biologically realistic structures and learning rules. Several neural components of this scheme are found in brains from insects to humans. Nature may have evolved a general mechanism for search and navigation on the ancient backbone of chemotaxis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normative and mechanistic model of an adaptive circuit for efficient encoding and feature extraction</a></h4>

              
                One major question in neuroscience is how to relate connectomes to neural activity, circuit function, and learning. We offer an answer in the peripheral olfactory circuit of the Drosophila larva, composed of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) connected through feedback loops with interconnected inhibitory local neurons (LNs). We combine structural and activity data and, using a holistic normative framework based on similarity-matching, we propose a biologically plausible mechanistic model of the circuit. Our model predicts the ORN [-&gt;] LN synaptic weights found in the connectome and demonstrate that they reflect correlations in ORN activity patterns. Additionally, our model explains the relation between ORN [-&gt;] LN and LN - LN synaptic weight and the arising of different LN types. This global synaptic organization can autonomously arise through Hebbian plasticity, and thus allows the circuit to adapt to different environments in an unsupervised manner. Functionally, we propose LNs extract redundant input correlations and dampen them in ORNs, thus partially whitening and normalizing the stimulus representations in ORNs. Our work proposes a comprehensive framework to combine structure, activity, function, and learning, and uncovers a general and potent circuit motif that can learn and extract significant input features and render stimulus representations more efficient.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Hypersensitivity and Processing Deficits in a Rat Model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X (FX) syndrome is one of the leading inherited causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A majority of FX and ASD patients exhibit sensory hypersensitivity, including auditory hypersensitivity or hyperacusis, a condition in which everyday sounds are perceived as much louder than normal. Auditory processing deficits also afford the opportunity to develop objective and quantifiable outcome measures in FX and ASD that are likely to translate between humans and animal models due to the well-conserved nature of the auditory system and well-characterized behavioral read-outs of sound perception. Therefore, in this study we characterized auditory hypersensitivity in a Fmr1 knockout (KO) transgenic rat model of FX using an operant conditioning task to assess sound detection thresholds and suprathreshold auditory reaction time-intensity (RT-I) functions, a reliable psychoacoustic measure of loudness growth, at a variety of stimulus frequencies, bandwidths and durations. Male Fmr1 KO and littermate WT rats both learned the task at the same rate and exhibited normal hearing thresholds. However, Fmr1 KO rats had faster auditory RTs over a broad range of intensities and steeper RT-I slopes than WT controls, perceptual evidence of excessive loudness growth in Fmr1 KO rats. Furthermore, we found that Fmr1 KO animals exhibited abnormal integration of sound duration and bandwidth, with diminished temporal but enhanced spectral integration of sound intensity. These results are indicative of fundamental changes to low-level auditory processing in Fmr1 KO animals. Moreover, because temporal and spectral integration of sound stimuli were altered in opposite directions in Fmr1 KO rats, this suggests that abnormal RTs in these animals are evidence of aberrant auditory processing rather than generalized hyperactivity or altered motor responses. Finally, we demonstrated that antagonism of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) selectively and dose-dependently restored normal loudness growth in Fmr1 KO rats, suggesting a pharmacologic approach for alleviating sensory hypersensitivity associated with ASD. This study leverages the tractable nature of the auditory system and the unique behavioral advantages of rats to provide important insight into the nature of a centrally important yet understudied aspect of FX and ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tuning in scene-preferring cortex for mid-level visual features gives rise to selectivity across multiple levels of stimulus complexity</a></h4>

              
                The scene-preferring portion of the human ventral visual stream, known as the parahippocampal place area (PPA), responds to scenes and landmark objects, which tend to be large in real-world size, fixed in location, and inanimate. However, the PPA also exhibits preferences for low-level contour statistics, including rectilinearity and cardinal orientations, that are not directly predicted by theories of scene- and landmark-selectivity. It is unknown whether these divergent findings of both low- and high-level selectivity in the PPA can be explained by a unified computational theory. To address this issue, we fit hierarchical computational models of mid-level tuning to the image-evoked fMRI responses of the PPA, and we performed a series of high-throughput experiments on these models. Our findings show that hierarchical encoding models of the PPA exhibit emergent selectivity across multiple levels of complexity, giving rise to high-level preferences along dimensions of real-world size, fixedness, and naturalness/animacy as well as low-level preferences for rectilinear shapes and cardinal orientations. These results reconcile disparate theories of PPA function in a unified model of mid-level visual representation, and they demonstrate how multifaceted selectivity profiles naturally emerge from the hierarchical computations of visual cortex and the natural statistics of images.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVisual neuroscientists characterize cortical selectivity by identifying stimuli that drive regional responses. A perplexing finding is that many higher-order visual regions exhibit selectivity spanning multiple levels of complexity: they respond to highly complex categories, such as scenes and landmarks, but also to surprisingly simplistic features, such as specific contour orientations. Using large-scale computational analyses and human brain imaging, we show how multifaceted selectivity in scene-preferring cortex can emerge from the coding of mid-level visual features, whose complexity is neither as simple as local contours nor as complex as scenes or objects. Our work reconciles seemingly divergent findings of selectivity in scene-preferring cortex and suggests that mid-level features may be central to understanding the category-selective organization of the human visual system.

                Current treatments for trauma-related disorders remain ineffective for many patients. Here, we modeled interindividual differences in post-therapy fear relapse with a novel ethologically relevant trauma recovery paradigm. After traumatic fear conditioning, rats underwent fear extinction while foraging in a large enriched arena, permitting the expression of a wide spectrum of behaviors, assessed by an automated pipeline. This multidimensional behavioral assessment revealed that post-conditioning fear response profiles clustered into two groups, respectively characterized by active vs. passive fear responses. After trauma, some animals expressed fear by freezing, while others darted, as if fleeing from danger. Remarkably, belonging to the darters or freezers group predicted differential vulnerability to fear relapse after extinction. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptional profiling revealed that these groups differentially regulated specific sets of genes, some of which have previously been implicated in anxiety and trauma-related disorders. Our results suggest that post-trauma behavioral phenotypes and the associated epigenetic landscapes can serve as markers of fear relapse susceptibility, and thus may be instrumental for future development of more effective treatments for psychiatric patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kinetic and thermodynamic modeling of a voltage-gated sodium channel</a></h4>

              
                Like all biological and chemical reactions, ion channel kinetics are highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Therefore, it is prudent to investigate channel dynamics at physiological temperatures. However, most ion channel investigations are performed at room temperature due to practical considerations, such as recording stability and technical limitations. This problem is especially severe for the fast voltage-gated sodium channel, whose activation kinetics are faster than the time constant of the standard patch-clamp amplifier at physiological temperatures. Thus, biologically detailed simulations of the action potential generation evenly scale the kinetic models of voltage-gated channels acquired at room temperature. To quantitatively study voltage-gated sodium channels temperature sensitivity, we recorded sodium currents from nucleated patches extracted from the rats layer five neocortical pyramidal neurons at several temperatures from 13.5 to 30oC. We use these recordings to model the kinetics of the voltage-gated sodium channel as a function of temperature. We show that the temperature dependence of activation differs from that of inactivation. Furthermore, we show that the sustained current has a different temperature dependence than the fast current. Our kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the current provided a numerical model spanning the entire temperature range. This model reproduced vital features of channel activation and inactivation. Furthermore, the model also reproduced action potential dependence on temperature. Thus, we provide an essential building block for the generation of biologically detailed models of cortical neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Region-specific KCC2 rescue by rhIGF-1 and oxytocin in a mouse model of Rett syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome (RTT) is characterized by dysfunction in neuronal excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, potentially impacting seizure susceptibility via deficits in K+/Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2) function. Mice lacking the Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) recapitulate many symptoms of RTT, and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) restores KCC2 expression and E/I balance in MeCP2 KO mice. However, clinical trial outcomes of rhIGF-1 in RTT have been variable, and increasing its therapeutic efficacy is highly desirable. To this end, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is promising, as it also critically modulates KCC2 function during early postnatal development. We measured basal KCC2 expression levels in MeCP2 KO mice and identified three key frontal brain regions showing KCC2 alterations in young adult mice but not in postnatal P10 animals. We thus hypothesized that deficits in an IGF-1/OXT signaling crosstalk modulating KCC2 may occur in RTT during postnatal development. Consistently, we detected alterations of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and OXT receptor (OXTR) levels in those brain areas. rhIGF-1 and OXT treatments in KO mice rescued KCC2 expression in a region-specific and complementary manner. These results suggest that region-selective combinatorial pharmacotherapeutic strategies could be the most effective at normalizing E/I balance in key brain regions subtending the RTT pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Express arm Responses Appear Bilaterally on Upper-limb Muscles in Arm Choice Reaching Task</a></h4>

              
                When required, humans can generate very short latency reaches towards a visual target, like catching a phone falling off a desk. During such rapid reaches, express arm responses are the first wave of upper limb muscle recruitment, occurring within ~80-100 ms of target appearance. There is accumulating evidence that express arm responses arise from signaling along the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract, but the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract has not been well-studied. Since the reticulospinal tract projects bilaterally, we studied whether express arm responses would be expressed bilaterally. Human participants (n = 14; 7 female) performed visually guided reaches in a modified emerging target paradigm where either arm could be used to intercept a target once it emerged below a barrier. We recorded electromyographic activity bilaterally from the pectoralis major muscle. Our analysis focused on target locations where participants reached with the right arm on some trials, and the left arm on others. In support of the involvement of the reticulospinal tract, the express arm response persisted bilaterally regardless of which arm reached to the target. While the latency of the express arm response was the same on the reaching vs non-reaching arm, the response magnitude was slightly larger on the reaching arm, in part due to anticipatory muscle recruitment related to arm choice. Our results support the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract in mediating the express arm response, and we surmise that the increased magnitude on the arm chosen to move arises from convergence of cortically derived signals with the largely independent express arm response.

New and NoteworthyExpress arm responses have been proposed to arise from the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract. These responses have been linked to the superior colliculus, but the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract has not been well studied. Here we show these responses appear bilaterally regardless of arm choice when either arm can be used to intercept a newly appearing stimulus, supporting involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract. We propose this response is mediated largely independent of the volitional cortical related activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">'Wanting' versus 'Needing' related value: an fMRI meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Consumption and its excesses are sometimes explained by imbalance of need or lack of control over "wanting". "Wanting" assigns value to cues that predict rewards, whereas "needing" assigns value to biologically significant stimuli that one is deprived of. Here we aimed at studying how the brain activation patterns related to value of wanted stimuli differs from that of needed stimuli using ALE neuroimaging meta-analysis approaches. We used the perception of a cue predicting a reward for "wanting" related value and the perception of food stimuli in a hungry state as a model for "needing" related value. We carried out separate, contrasts, and conjunction meta- analyses to identify differences and similarities between "wanting" and "needing" values. Our overall results for "wanting" related value show consistent activation of the ventral tegmental area, striatum and pallidum, regions that both activate behaviour and direct choice; while for "needing" related value we found an overall consistent activation of the middle insula and to some extent the caudal-ventral putamen, regions that only direct choice. Our study suggests that "wanting" has more control on consumption, and a needed stimuli must become wanted in order to be pursued.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of membrane homeostasis by TMC1 mechanoelectrical transduction channelsis essential for hearing</a></h4>

              
                The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel complex of auditory hair cells converts sound into electrical signals, allowing us to hear. After decades of research, the transmembrane-like channel 1 and 2 (TMC1 and TMC2) have been recently identified as pore-forming subunits of the MET channels, but the molecular peculiarity that differentiates these two proteins and makes TMC1 essential for hearing remains elusive. Here, we show that TMC1, but not TMC2, is essential for membrane remodeling triggered by a decrease in intracellular calcium concentration. We demonstrate that inhibition of MET channels or buffering of intracellular calcium lead to pronounced phosphatidylserine externalization, membrane blebbing and ectosome release at the hair cell sensory organelle, culminating in the loss of TMC1 protein. Moreover, three TMC1 deafness-causing mutations cause constitutive phosphatidylserine externalization that correlates with the deafness phenotype, suggesting that the mechanisms of hearing loss involve alterations in membrane homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aging reduces calreticulin expression and alters spontaneous calcium signals in astrocytic endfeet of the mouse dorsolateral striatum</a></h4>

              
                Aging-related impairment of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and neurovascular unit (NVU) increases risk for neurodegeneration. Among the various cells participating in BBB and NVU function, spontaneous Ca2+ signals in astrocytic endfeet are crucial for maintaining BBB and NVU integrity. To assess if aging is associated with changes in spontaneous Ca2+ signals within astrocytic endfeet of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), we expressed a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator, Lck-GCaMP6f in DLS astrocytes of young (3-4 month) and aging (20-24 month) mice. Compared to young mice, endfeet in the DLS of aging mice demonstrated a decrease in calreticulin (CALR) expression, and dramatic alterations in the dynamics of endfoot membrane-associated and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals. While young mice required both extracellular and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sources for generating endfoot Ca2+ signals, aging mice showed exclusive dependence on ER Ca2+. These data suggest that aging is associated with significant changes in Ca2+ buffers and Ca2+ signals within astrocytic endfeet, which has important implications for understanding mechanisms involved in aging-related impairment of the BBB and NVU.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Topological insights into the neural basis of flexible behavior</a></h4>

              
                1It is widely accepted that there is an inextricable link between neural computations, biological mechanisms, and behavior, but there exists no framework that can simultaneously explain all three. Here, we show that topological data analysis (TDA) provides that necessary bridge. We demonstrate that cognitive processes change the topological description of the shared activity of populations of visual neurons. These topological changes provide uniquely strong constraints on a mechanistic model, explain behavior, and, via a link with network control theory, reveal a tradeoff between improving sensitivity to subtle visual stimulus changes and increasing the chance that the subject will stray off task. These discoveries provide a blueprint for using TDA to uncover the biological and computational mechanisms by which cognition affects behavior in health and disease.

	<p>Scientific research on neuro-cognitive mechanisms of autism often focuses on circuits that support social functioning. However, autism is a heterogeneous developmental variation in multiple domains, including social communication, but also language, cognition, and sensory-motor control. This suggests that the underlying mechanisms of autism share a domain-general foundation that impacts all of these processes. In this Perspective Review, we propose that autism is not a social deficit that results from an atypical “social brain”. Instead, typical social development relies on learning. In social animals, infants depend on their caregivers for survival, which makes social information vitally salient. The infant must learn to socially interact in order to survive and develop, and the most prominent learning in early life is crafted by social interactions. Therefore, the most prominent outcome of a learning variation is atypical social development. To support the hypothesis that autism results from a variation in learning, we first review evidence from neuroscience and developmental science, demonstrating that typical social development depends on two domain-general processes that determine learning: (a) motivation, guided by allostatic regulation of the internal milieu; and (b) multi-modal associations, determined by the statistical regularities of the external milieu. These two processes are basic ingredients of typical development because they determine allostasis-driven learning of the social environment. We then review evidence showing that allostasis and learning are affected among individuals with autism, both neurally and behaviorally. We conclude by proposing a novel domain-general framework that emphasizes allostasis-driven learning as a key process underlying autism. Guided by allostasis, humans learn to become social, therefore, the atypical social profile seen in autism can reflect a domain-general variation in allostasis-driven learning. This domain-general view raises novel research questions in both basic and clinical research and points to targets for clinical intervention that can lower the age of diagnosis and improve the well-being of individuals with autism.</p>

	<p>Background: Practice-based evidence can inform and support clinical decision making. Case-report series about the implementation of programs in real-world clinical settings may contribute to verifying the effectiveness of interventions for treating PPA in specific contexts, as well as illustrating challenges that need to be overcome. Objective: To describe and provide practice-based evidence on the effectiveness of four cognitive rehabilitation programs designed for individuals with PPA and directed to speech and language impairments, which were implemented in a specialized outpatient clinic. Methods: Multiple single-case study. Eighteen individuals with different subtypes of PPA were each assigned to one out of four training programs based on comprehensive speech and language assessments. The treatments targeted naming deficits, sentence production, speech apraxia, and phonological deficits. Pre- and post-treatment assessments were undertaken to compare trained and untrained items. Gains were generalized to a different task in the first two types of intervention (naming and sentence production). A follow-up assessment was conducted 1–8 months after treatment among 7 participants. Results: All individuals presented better performance in the trained items at the post-test for each rehabilitation program accomplished, demonstrating that learning of the trained strategies was achieved during the active phase of treatment. For 13 individuals, statistical significance was reached; while for five, the results were maintained. Results about untrained items, generalization to other tasks, and follow-up assessments are presented. Conclusion: The positive results found in our sample bring some practice-based evidence for the benefits of speech and language treatment strategies for clinical management of individuals with PPA.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, studies have highlighted the δ-opioid receptor (DOPr) as a promising therapeutic target for chronic pain management. While exhibiting milder undesired effects than most currently prescribed opioids, its specific agonists elicit effective analgesic responses in numerous animal models of chronic pain, including inflammatory, neuropathic, diabetic, and cancer-related pain. However, as compared with the extensively studied μ-opioid receptor, the molecular mechanisms governing its trafficking remain elusive. Recent advances have denoted several significant particularities in the regulation of DOPr intracellular routing, setting it apart from the other members of the opioid receptor family. Although they share high homology, each opioid receptor subtype displays specific amino acid patterns potentially involved in the regulation of its trafficking. These precise motifs or “barcodes” are selectively recognized by regulatory proteins and therefore dictate several aspects of the itinerary of a receptor, including its anterograde transport, internalization, recycling, and degradation. With a specific focus on the regulation of DOPr trafficking, this review will discuss previously reported, as well as potential novel trafficking barcodes within the opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ opioid peptide receptors, and their impact in determining distinct interactomes and physiological responses.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive markers in mice have been identified in two distinct peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and distributed in different laminae of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Recently, however, a study in humans showed a significant overlapping in these two populations. In this study, we investigated the distribution of various nociceptive markers in the lumbar DRG and spinal cord of the dromedary camel. Immunohistochemical data showed a remarkable percentage of total neurons in the DRG expressed IB4 binding (54.5%), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 49.5%), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1; 48.2%), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS; 30.6%). The co-localization data showed that 89.6% and 74.0% of CGRP- and TRPV1-labeled neurons, respectively, were IB4 positive. In addition, 61.6% and 84.2% of TRPV1- and NOS-immunoreactive neurons, respectively, were also co-localized with CGRP. The distribution of IB4, CGRP, TRPV1, substance P, and NOS immunoreactivities in the spinal cord were observed in lamina I and outer lamina II (IIo). Quantitative data showed that 82.4% of IB4-positive nerve terminals in laminae I and IIo were co-localized with CGRP, and 86.0% of CGRP-labeled terminals were co-localized with IB4. Similarly, 85.1% of NOS-labeled nerve terminals were co-localized with CGRP. No neuropeptide Y (NPY) or cholecystokinin (CCK) immunoreactivities were detected in the DRG, and no co-localization between IB4, NPY, and CCK were observed in the spinal cord. Our results demonstrate marked convergence of nociceptive markers in the primary afferent neurons in camels, which is similar to humans rather than the mouse. The data also emphasizes the importance of interspecies differences when selecting ideal animal models for studying nociception and treating chronic pain.</p>

     alt="Differential investment in visual and olfactory brain regions is linked to the sensory needs of a wasp social parasite and its host"/>
<p>Brain reconstructions reveal differential investment in sensory brain regions between the obligate social parasite <i>Polistes sulcifer</i> and its host, <i>P. dominula</i>. Social parasites have larger optic lobes (blue), which reflects their visual needs to navigate long distances and locate a host nest. Contrastingly, hosts show large antennal lobes (yellow) and calyces of the mushroom bodies (red), coinciding with the olfactory and sensory processing needs of maintaining colony cohesion, including recognizing conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Scale = 1 mm.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obligate insect social parasites evolve traits to effectively locate and then exploit their hosts, whereas hosts have complex social behavioral repertoires, which include sensory recognition to reject potential conspecific intruders and heterospecific parasites. While social parasites and host behaviors have been studied extensively, less is known about how their sensory systems function to meet their specific selective pressures. Here, we compare investment in visual and olfactory brain regions in the paper wasp <i>Polistes dominula</i>, and its obligate social parasite <i>P. sulcifer</i>, to explore the links among sensory systems,brain and behavior. Our results show significant relative volumetric differences between these two closely related species, consistent with their very different life histories. Social parasites show proportionally larger optic lobes and central complex to likely navigate long-distance migrations and unfamiliar landscapes to locate the specific species of hosts they usurp. Contrastingly, hosts have larger antennal lobes and calyces of the mushroom bodies compared with social parasites, as predicted by their sensory means to maintain social cohesion via olfactory signals, allocate colony tasks, forage, and recognize conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Our work suggests how this tradeoff between visual and olfactory brain regions may facilitate different sensory adaptations needed to perform social and foraging tasks by the host, including recognition of parasites, or to fly long distances and successful host localizing by the social parasite.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">{mu}-Opioid Receptor Stimulation in the Nucleus Accumbens Increases Vocal-Social Interactions in Flocking European Starlings, Sturnus Vulgaris</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social connections in gregarious species are vital for safety and survival. For these reasons, many bird species form large flocks outside the breeding season. It has been proposed that such large social groups may be maintained via reward induced by positive interactions with conspecifics and via the reduction of a negative affective state caused by social separation. Moreover, within a flock optimal social spacing between conspecifics is important, indicating that individuals may optimize spacing to be close but not too close to conspecifics. The &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are well known for their role in both reward and the reduction of negative affective states, suggesting that MOR stimulation in NAc may play a critical role in flock cohesion. To begin to test this hypothesis, social and nonsocial behaviors were examined in male and female European starlings (<I>Sturnus vulgaris</I>) in nonbreeding flocks after intra-NAc infusion of saline and three doses of the selective MOR agonist <scp>d</scp>-Ala<sup>2</sup>-<I>N</I>-Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>-Glycol<sup>5</sup>-enkephalin (DAMGO). DAMGO in NAc dose-dependently increased singing behavior and facilitated social approaches while at the same time promoting displacements potentially used to maintain social spacing. These findings support the hypothesis that MORs in NAc promote social interactions important for group cohesion in nonsexual contexts and suggest the possibility that MORs in the NAc play a role in optimizing the pull of joining a flock with the push of potential agonistic encounters.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Information theoretic metrics have proven useful in quantifying the relationship between behaviorally relevant parameters and neuronal activity with relatively few assumptions. However, these metrics are typically applied to action potential (AP) recordings and were not designed for the slow timescales and variable amplitudes typical of functional fluorescence recordings (e.g., calcium imaging). The lack of research guidelines on how to apply and interpret these metrics with fluorescence traces means the neuroscience community has yet to realize the power of information theoretic metrics. Here, we used computational methods to create mock AP traces with known amounts of information. From these, we generated fluorescence traces and examined the ability of different information metrics to recover the known information values. We provide guidelines for how to use information metrics when applying them to functional fluorescence and demonstrate their appropriate application to GCaMP6f population recordings from mouse hippocampal neurons imaged during virtual navigation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>While humans and other mammals exhibit adaptation to odorants, the neural mechanisms and brain locations involved in this process are incompletely understood. One possibility is that it primarily occurs as a result of the interactions between odorants and odorant receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. In this scenario, adaptation would arise as a peripheral phenomenon transmitted to the brain. An alternative possibility is that adaptation occurs because of processing in the brain. We made an initial test of these possibilities using a two-color imaging strategy to simultaneously measure the activity of the olfactory receptor nerve terminals (input to the bulb) and mitral/tufted cell apical dendrites (output from the bulb) in anesthetized and awake mice. Repeated odor stimulation at the same concentration resulted in a decline in the bulb output, while the input remained relatively stable. Thus, the mammalian olfactory bulb appears to participate in generating the perception of olfactory adaptation under this stimulus condition. Similar experiments conducted previously showed that the bulb may also participate in the perception of concentration invariance of odorant recognition (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B80">Storace and Cohen, 2017</cross-ref>); thus, the bulb is simultaneously carrying out more than one computation, as is true of other mammalian brain regions and perhaps is the case for all animals with sophisticated nervous systems. However, in contrast with other sensory systems (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B85">Van Essen et al., 1992</cross-ref>), the very first processing stage in the olfactory system has an output that may directly represent perceptions.</p>

                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University MPH programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. We estimated the aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students reside, and subtracted the per capita emissions for the country of origin from the per capita emissions for the UK over the time that the student would have spent in Manchester as a full-time student, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

                Background: Screening for albuminuria is generally recommended among patients with hypertension. While the urine dipstick is commonly used for screening urine albumin, there is little evidence about its diagnostic accuracy among these patients in Thailand. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a dipstick in Thai hypertensive patients for detecting albuminuria. Methods: This study collected the data of 3,067 hypertensive patients, with the results of urine dipstick and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) from random single spot urine being examined in the same day at least once, at Lampang Hospital, Thailand, during 2018. For ACR, a reference standard of ≥ 30 mg/g was applied to indicate the presence of albuminuria. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value of the trace result from dipsticks were 53.6%, 94.5%, 86.5%, and 75.5%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the dipstick was 0.748.
