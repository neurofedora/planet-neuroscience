              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13748">ReBaCCA-ss: Relevance-Balanced Continuum Correlation Analysis with Smoothing and Surrogating for Quantifying Similarity Between Population Spiking Activities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying similarity between population spike patterns is essential for understanding how neural dynamics encode information. Traditional approaches, which combine kernel smoothing, PCA, and CCA, have limitations: smoothing kernel bandwidths are often empirically chosen, CCA maximizes alignment between patterns without considering the variance explained within patterns, and baseline correlations from stochastic spiking are rarely corrected. We introduce ReBaCCA-ss (Relevance-Balanced Continuum Correlation Analysis with smoothing and surrogating), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) balancing alignment and variance explanation via continuum canonical correlation; (2) correcting for noise using surrogate spike trains; and (3) selecting the optimal kernel bandwidth by maximizing the difference between true and surrogate correlations. ReBaCCA-ss is validated on both simulated data and hippocampal recordings from rats performing a Delayed Nonmatch-to-Sample task. It reliably identifies spatio-temporal similarities between spike patterns. Combined with Multidimensional Scaling, ReBaCCA-ss reveals structured neural representations across trials, events, sessions, and animals, offering a powerful tool for neural population analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13917">Investigation of the neural origin of non-Euclidean visual space and analysis of visual phenomena using information geometry</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper aims to develop a mathematical model concerning the visual perception of spatial information. It is a challenging problem in theoretical neuroscience to investigate how the spatial information of the objects in the physical space is encoded and decoded in the neural processes in the brain. In the past, researchers conjectured the existence of an abstract visual space where spatial information processing takes place. Based on several experimental data it was conjectured that the said psychological manifold is non-Euclidean. However, the consideration of the neural origin of the non-Euclidean character of the visual space was not explicit in the models. In the present paper, we showed that the neural mechanism and specifically the Fisher information contained in the neural population code plays the role of energy-momentum tensor to create the space-dependent metric tensor resulting in a curved space described by a curvature tensor. The theoretical prediction of information geometry regarding the emergence of curved manifolds in the presence of the Fisher information is verified in the present work in the domain of neural processing of spatial information at mid-level vision. Several well-known phenomena of visual optics are analyzed using the notion of non-Euclidean visual space, the geodesics of the space, and the Fisher-Rao metric as the suitable psychometric distance.

Abstract: The perceptron has served as a prototypical neuronal learning machine in the physics community interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence, which included G\'erard Toulouse as one of its prominent figures. It has also been used as a model of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, a brain structure involved in motor learning, in the early influential theories of David Marr and James Albus. We review these theories, more recent developments in the field, and highlight questions of current interest.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14503">The nature of quantum parallel processing and its implications for coding in brain neural networks: a novel computational mechanism</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally it is assumed that the nerve impulse is an electrical process based upon the observation that electrical stimuli produce an action potential as defined by Hodgkin Huxley (1952) (HH). Consequently, investigations into the computation of nerve impulses have almost universally been directed to electrically observed phenomenon. However, models of computation are fundamentally flawed and assume that an undiscovered timing system exists within the nervous system. In our view it is synchronisation of the action potential pulse (APPulse) that effects computation. The APPulse, a soliton pulse, is a novel purveyor of computation and is a quantum mechanical pulse: i.e. It is a non-Turing synchronised computational event. Furthermore, the APPulse computational interactions change frequencies measured in microseconds, rather than milliseconds, producing effective efficient computation. However, the HH action potential is a necessary component for entropy equilibrium, providing energy to open ion channels, but it is too slow to be functionally computational in a neural network. Here, we demonstrate that only quantum non-electrical soliton pulses converging to points of computation are the main computational structure with synaptic transmission occurring at slower millisecond speeds. Thus, the APPulse accompanying the action potential is the purveyor of computation; a novel computational mechanism, that is incompatible with Turing timed computation and artificial intelligence (AI).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14579">Inference with correlated priors using sisters cells</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common view of sensory processing is as probabilistic inference of latent causes from receptor activations. Standard approaches often assume these causes are a priori independent, yet real-world generative factors are typically correlated. Representing such structured priors in neural systems poses architectural challenges, particularly when direct interactions between units representing latent causes are biologically implausible or computationally expensive. Inspired by the architecture of the olfactory bulb, we propose a novel circuit motif that enables inference with correlated priors without requiring direct interactions among latent cause units. The key insight lies in using sister cells: neurons receiving shared receptor input but connected differently to local interneurons. The required interactions among latent units are implemented indirectly through their connections to the sister cells, such that correlated connectivity implies anti-correlation in the prior and vice versa. We use geometric arguments to construct connectivity that implements a given prior and to bound the number of causes for which such priors can be constructed. Using simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of such priors for inference in noisy environments and compare the inference dynamics to those experimentally observed. Finally, we show how, under certain assumptions on latent representations, the prior used can be inferred from sister cell activations. While biologically grounded in the olfactory system, our mechanism generalises to other natural and artificial sensory systems and may inform the design of architectures for efficient inference under correlated latent structure.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13567">Learning Dynamics of RNNs in Closed-Loop Environments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks offer powerful models of brain computation. However, typical training paradigms rely on open-loop, supervised settings, whereas real-world learning unfolds in closed-loop environments. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained in closed-loop contexts. We first demonstrate that two otherwise identical RNNs, trained in either closed- or open-loop modes, follow markedly different learning trajectories. To probe this divergence, we analytically characterize the closed-loop case, revealing distinct stages aligned with the evolution of the training loss. Specifically, we show that the learning dynamics of closed-loop RNNs, in contrast to open-loop ones, are governed by an interplay between two competing objectives: short-term policy improvement and long-term stability of the agent-environment interaction. Finally, we apply our framework to a realistic motor control task, highlighting its broader applicability. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop dynamics in a biologically plausible setting.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13763">Language Models Are Capable of Metacognitive Monitoring and Control of Their Internal Activations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they actually use to solve tasks, but they can also fail to do so. This suggests some degree of metacognition -- the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognitive abilities enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might obscure their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms designed to detect harmful behaviors. Given society's increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand the limits of their metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal activations. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm designed to quantify the ability of LLMs to explicitly report and control their activation patterns. By presenting models with sentence-label pairs where labels correspond to sentence-elicited internal activations along specific directions in the neural representation space, we demonstrate that LLMs can learn to report and control these activations. The performance varies with several factors: the number of example pairs provided, the semantic interpretability of the target neural direction, and the variance explained by that direction. These results reveal a "metacognitive space" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms. Our findings provide empirical evidence quantifying metacognitive capabilities in LLMs, with significant implications for AI safety.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14125">Contrastive Consolidation of Top-Down Modulations Achieves Sparsely Supervised Continual Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14204">Beginning with You: Perceptual-Initialization Improves Vision-Language Representation and Alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Perceptual-Initialization (PI), a paradigm shift in visual representation learning that incorporates human perceptual structure during the initialization phase rather than as a downstream fine-tuning step. By integrating human-derived triplet embeddings from the NIGHTS dataset to initialize a CLIP vision encoder, followed by self-supervised learning on YFCC15M, our approach demonstrates significant zero-shot performance improvements, without any task-specific fine-tuning, across 29 zero shot classification and 2 retrieval benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, zero-shot gains emerge after approximately 15 epochs of pretraining. Benefits are observed across datasets of various scales, with improvements manifesting at different stages of the pretraining process depending on dataset characteristics. Our approach consistently enhances zero-shot top-1 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, and retrieval recall (e.g., R@1, R@5) across these diverse evaluation tasks, without requiring any adaptation to target domains. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom of using human-perceptual data primarily for fine-tuning and demonstrate that embedding human perceptual structure during early representation learning yields more capable and vision-language aligned systems that generalize immediately to unseen tasks. Our work shows that "beginning with you", starting with human perception, provides a stronger foundation for general-purpose vision-language intelligence.

Abstract: In the dorsal horn, projection neurons play a crucial role in pain processing by transmitting sensory stimuli to supraspinal centers during nociception. Following exposure to intense noxious stimuli, a sensitization process occurs that alters the functional state of the dorsal horn. Notably, projection neurons can undergo a switch in firing pattern -- from tonic firing to plateau potentials with sustained afterdischarges. For afterdischarges to occur following this switch, the neuron must exhibit bistability, defined as the ability to exhibit resting and spiking states at the same input current depending on the prior context. In many cases, neuronal bistability arises through the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels. However, computational studies have shown a trade-off between bistability and the plausibility of resting states when calcium channels are counterbalanced by voltage-gated potassium channels. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of robust bistability, plateau potentials, and sustained afterdischarges through calcium channels remain poorly understood. In this study, we used a conductance-based model to investigate how L-type calcium (CaL) channels can give rise to bistability when combined with either M-type potassium (KM) channels or inward-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. Unlike KM channels, Kir channels enhance bistability. When combined with CaL channels, KM and Kir channels promote distinct forms of bistability, differing in both robustness and functional implications. An analysis of their inward and outward current properties revealed that these differences stem from their distinct steady-state current profiles. Altogether, the complementarity between CaL and Kir channels provides a robust mechanism for central sensitization in the dorsal horn.

Abstract: We report on an exact theory for ensembles of globally coupled, heterogeneous complex Riccati equations. A drastic dimensionality reduction to a few ordinary differential equations is achieved for Lorentzian heterogeneity.

                arXiv:2505.00856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying preictal states -- periods during which seizures are more likely to occur -- remains a central challenge in clinical computational neuroscience. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that embeds functional brain connectivity networks, derived from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This compact representation captures essential topological features of brain dynamics and facilitates the detection of subtle connectivity changes preceding seizures. Using standard machine learning techniques, we define a dimensionless biomarker, $\mathcal{B}$, that discriminates between interictal (seizure-free) and preictal (within 24 hours of seizure) network states. Our method focuses on connectivity patterns among a subset of informative iEEG electrodes, enabling robust classification of brain states across time. We validate our approach using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and a pseudo-prospective forecasting strategy, assessing performance with metrics such as F1-score and balanced accuracy. Results show that low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of iEEG connectivity yield interpretable and predictive markers of preictal activity, offering promising implications for real-time seizure forecasting and individualized therapeutic interventions.

                arXiv:2505.01545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vocal responses from caregivers are believed to promote more frequent and more advanced infant vocalizations. However, studies that examine this relationship typically do not account for the fact that infant and adult vocalizations are distributed in hierarchical clusters over the course of the day. These bursts and lulls create a challenge for accurately detecting the effects of adult input at immediate turn-by-turn timescales within real-world behavior, as adult responses tend to happen during already occurring bursts of infant vocalizations. Analyzing daylong audio recordings of real-world vocal communication between human infants (ages 3, 6, 9, and 18 months) and their adult caregivers, we first show that both infant and caregiver vocalization events are clustered in time, as evidenced by positive correlations between successive inter-event intervals (IEIs). We propose an approach informed by flight time analyses in foraging studies to assess whether the timing of a vocal agent's next vocalization is modified by inputs from another vocal agent, controlling for the first agent's previous IEI. For both infants and adults, receiving a social response predicts that the individual will vocalize again sooner than they would have in the absence of a response. Overall, our results are consistent with a view of infant-caregiver vocal interactions as an 'interpersonal foraging' process with inherent multi-scale dynamics wherein social responses are among the resources the individuals are foraging for. The analytic approaches introduced here have broad utility to study communication in other modalities, contexts, and species.

                arXiv:2505.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spiking neural network, known as the third generation neural network, is an important network paradigm. Due to its mode of information propagation that follows biological rationality, the spiking neural network has strong energy efficiency and has advantages in complex high-energy application scenarios. However, unlike the artificial neural network (ANN) which has a mature and unified framework, the SNN models and training methods have not yet been widely unified due to the discontinuous and non-differentiable property of the firing mechanism. Although several algorithms for training spiking neural networks have been proposed in the subsequent development process, some fundamental issues remain unsolved. Inspired by random network design, this work proposes a new architecture for spiking neural networks, RanSNN, where only part of the network weights need training and all the classic training methods can be adopted. Compared with traditional training methods for spiking neural networks, it greatly improves the training efficiency while ensuring the training performance, and also has good versatility and stability as validated by benchmark tests.

                arXiv:2505.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) addresses the challenge of simultaneously optimizing multiple, often conflicting, rewards, moving beyond the single-reward focus of conventional reinforcement learning (RL). This approach is essential for applications where agents must balance trade-offs between diverse goals, such as speed, energy efficiency, or stability, as a series of sequential decisions. This paper investigates the applicability and limitations of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in solving complex MORL problems. We assess whether these algorithms can effectively address the unique challenges posed by MORL and how MORL instances can serve as benchmarks to evaluate and improve MOEA performance. In particular, we propose a framework to characterize the features influencing MORL instance complexity, select representative MORL problems from the literature, and benchmark a suite of MOEAs alongside single-objective EAs using scalarized MORL formulations. Additionally, we evaluate the utility of existing multi-objective quality indicators in MORL scenarios, such as hypervolume conducting a comparison of the algorithms supported by statistical analysis. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between MORL problem characteristics and algorithmic effectiveness, highlighting opportunities for advancing both MORL research and the design of evolutionary algorithms.

                arXiv:2505.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex optimization problems, yet their effectiveness is often constrained by fixed structures and the need for extensive tuning. The Polymorphic Metaheuristic Framework (PMF) addresses this limitation by introducing a self-adaptive metaheuristic switching mechanism driven by real-time performance feedback and dynamic algorithmic selection. PMF leverages the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Agent (PMA) and the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Selection Agent (PMSA) to dynamically select and transition between metaheuristic algorithms based on key performance indicators, ensuring continuous adaptation. This approach enhances convergence speed, adaptability, and solution quality, outperforming traditional metaheuristics in high-dimensional, dynamic, and multimodal environments. Experimental results on benchmark functions demonstrate that PMF significantly improves optimization efficiency by mitigating stagnation and balancing exploration-exploitation strategies across various problem landscapes. By integrating AI-driven decision-making and self-correcting mechanisms, PMF paves the way for scalable, intelligent, and autonomous optimization frameworks, with promising applications in engineering, logistics, and complex decision-making systems.

                arXiv:2505.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak Pareto boundary ($WPB$) refers to a boundary in the objective space of a multi-objective optimization problem, characterized by weak Pareto optimality rather than Pareto optimality. The $WPB$ brings severe challenges to multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), as it may mislead the algorithms into finding dominance-resistant solutions (DRSs), i.e., solutions that excel on some objectives but severely underperform on the others, thereby missing Pareto-optimal solutions. Although the severe impact of the $WPB$ on MOEAs has been recognized, a systematic and detailed analysis remains lacking. To fill this gap, this paper studies the attributes of the $WPB$. In particular, the category of a $WPB$, as an attribute derived from its weakly Pareto-optimal property, is theoretically analyzed. The analysis reveals that the dominance resistance degrees of DRSs induced by different categories of $WPB$s exhibit distinct asymptotic growth rates as the DRSs in the objective space approach the $WPB$s, where a steeper asymptotic growth rate indicates a greater hindrance to MOEAs. Beyond that, experimental studies are conducted on various new test problems to investigate the impact of $WPB$'s attributes. The experimental results demonstrate consistency with our theoretical findings. Experiments on other attributes show that the performance of an MOEA is highly sensitive to some attributes. Overall, no existing MOEAs can comprehensively address challenges brought by these attributes.

                arXiv:2505.13525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.

                arXiv:2505.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance, meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition, human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under informational stress.

                arXiv:2505.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning in games is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with numerous applications~\citep{silver2016mastering,schrittwieser2020mastering}. This work investigates two-player zero-sum matrix games with an unknown payoff matrix and bandit feedback, where each player observes their actions and the corresponding noisy payoff. Prior studies have proposed algorithms for this setting~\citep{o2021matrix,maiti2023query,cai2024uncoupled}, with \citet{o2021matrix} demonstrating the effectiveness of deterministic optimism (e.g., \ucb) in achieving sublinear regret. However, the potential of randomised optimism in matrix games remains theoretically unexplored.
  We propose Competitive Co-evolutionary Bandit Learning (\coebl), a novel algorithm that integrates evolutionary algorithms (EAs) into the bandit framework to implement randomised optimism through EA variation operators. We prove that \coebl achieves sublinear regret, matching the performance of deterministic optimism-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical regret analysis of an evolutionary bandit learning algorithm in matrix games.
  Empirical evaluations on diverse matrix game benchmarks demonstrate that \coebl not only achieves sublinear regret but also consistently outperforms classical bandit algorithms, including \exptr~\citep{auer2002nonstochastic}, the variant \exptrni~\citep{cai2024uncoupled}, and \ucb~\citep{o2021matrix}. These results highlight the potential of evolutionary bandit learning, particularly the efficacy of randomised optimism via evolutionary algorithms in game-theoretic settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13741">Frozen Backpropagation: Relaxing Weight Symmetry in Temporally-Coded Deep Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware can greatly reduce energy costs compared to GPU-based training. However, implementing Backpropagation (BP) on such hardware is challenging because forward and backward passes are typically performed by separate networks with distinct weights. To compute correct gradients, forward and feedback weights must remain symmetric during training, necessitating weight transport between the two networks. This symmetry requirement imposes hardware overhead and increases energy costs. To address this issue, we introduce Frozen Backpropagation (fBP), a BP-based training algorithm relaxing weight symmetry in settings with separate networks. fBP updates forward weights by computing gradients with periodically frozen feedback weights, reducing weight transports during training and minimizing synchronization overhead. To further improve transport efficiency, we propose three partial weight transport schemes of varying computational complexity, where only a subset of weights is transported at a time. We evaluate our methods on image recognition tasks and compare them to existing approaches addressing the weight symmetry requirement. Our results show that fBP outperforms these methods and achieves accuracy comparable to BP. With partial weight transport, fBP can substantially lower transport costs by 1,000x with an accuracy drop of only 0.5pp on CIFAR-10 and 1.1pp on CIFAR-100, or by up to 10,000x at the expense of moderated accuracy loss. This work provides insights for guiding the design of neuromorphic hardware incorporating BP-based on-chip learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13898">Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14273">X-KAN: Optimizing Local Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks via Evolutionary Rule-Based Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Function approximation is a critical task in various fields. However, existing neural network approaches struggle with locally complex or discontinuous functions due to their reliance on a single global model covering the entire problem space. We propose X-KAN, a novel method that optimizes multiple local Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) through an evolutionary rule-based machine learning framework called XCSF. X-KAN combines KAN's high expressiveness with XCSF's adaptive partitioning capability by implementing local KAN models as rule consequents and defining local regions via rule antecedents. Our experimental results on artificial test functions and real-world datasets demonstrate that X-KAN significantly outperforms conventional methods, including XCSF, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and KAN, in terms of approximation accuracy. Notably, X-KAN effectively handles functions with locally complex or discontinuous structures that are challenging for conventional KAN, using a compact set of rules (average 7.2 $\pm$ 2.3 rules). These results validate the effectiveness of using KAN as a local model in XCSF, which evaluates the rule fitness based on both accuracy and generality. Our X-KAN implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/X-KAN.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14338">Better Neural Network Expressivity: Subdividing the Simplex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04177">A General Upper Bound for the Runtime of a Coevolutionary Algorithm on Impartial Combinatorial Games</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.04177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their complex dynamics, combinatorial games are a key test case and application for algorithms that train game playing agents. Among those algorithms that train using self-play are coevolutionary algorithms (CoEAs). However, the successful application of CoEAs for game playing is difficult due to pathological behaviours such as cycling, an issue especially critical for games with intransitive payoff landscapes.
  Insight into how to design CoEAs to avoid such behaviours can be provided by runtime analysis. In this paper, we push the scope of runtime analysis for CoEAs to combinatorial games, proving a general upper bound for the number of simulated games needed for UMDA to discover (with high probability) an optimal strategy. This result applies to any impartial combinatorial game, and for many games the implied bound is polynomial or quasipolynomial as a function of the number of game positions. After proving the main result, we provide several applications to simple well-known games: Nim, Chomp, Silver Dollar, and Turning Turtles. As the first runtime analysis for CoEAs on combinatorial games, this result is a critical step towards a comprehensive theoretical framework for coevolution.

                arXiv:2212.00228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data by introducing a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with a weighted time-delay feedback mechanism. Our proposed model, named $\tau$-GRU, is a discretized version of a continuous-time formulation of a recurrent unit, where the dynamics are governed by delay differential equations (DDEs). We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the continuous-time model and show that the proposed feedback mechanism can significantly improve the modeling of long-term dependencies. Our empirical results indicate that $\tau$-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art recurrent units and gated recurrent architectures on a range of tasks, achieving faster convergence and better generalization.

                arXiv:2411.19430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing application scope of spiking neural networks (SNN), the complexity of SNN models has surged, leading to an exponential growth in demand for AI computility. As the new generation computing architecture of the neural networks, the efficiency and power consumption of distributed storage and parallel computing in the many-core near-memory computing system have attracted much attention. Among them, the mapping problem from logical cores to physical cores is one of the research hotspots. In order to improve the computing parallelism and system throughput of the many-core near-memory computing system, and to reduce power consumption, we propose a SNN training many-core deployment optimization method based on Off-policy Deterministic Actor-Critic. We utilize deep reinforcement learning as a nonlinear optimizer, treating the many-core topology as network graph features and using graph convolution to input the many-core structure into the policy network. We update the parameters of the policy network through near-end policy optimization to achieve deployment optimization of SNN models in the many-core near-memory computing architecture to reduce chip power consumption. To handle large-dimensional action spaces, we use continuous values matching the number of cores as the output of the policy network and then discretize them again to obtain new deployment schemes. Furthermore, to further balance inter-core computation latency and improve system throughput, we propose a model partitioning method with a balanced storage and computation strategy. Our method overcomes the problems such as uneven computation and storage loads between cores, and the formation of local communication hotspots, significantly reducing model training time, communication costs, and average flow load between cores in the many-core near-memory computing architecture.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100747">Glutamine catabolism supports amino acid biosynthesis and suppresses the integrated stress response to promote photoreceptor survival</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptor loss results in vision loss in many blinding diseases, and metabolic dysfunction underlies photoreceptor degeneration. So, exploiting photoreceptor metabolism is an attractive strategy to prevent vision loss. Yet, the metabolic pathways that maintain photoreceptor health remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the dependence of photoreceptors on glutamine (Gln) catabolism. Gln is converted to glutamate via glutaminase (GLS), so mice lacking GLS in rod photoreceptors were generated to inhibit Gln catabolism. Loss of GLS produced rapid rod photoreceptor degeneration. In vivo metabolomic methodologies and metabolic supplementation identified Gln catabolism as critical for glutamate and aspartate biosynthesis. Concordant with this amino acid deprivation, the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated with protein synthesis attenuation, and inhibiting the ISR delayed photoreceptor loss. Furthermore, supplementing asparagine, which is synthesized from aspartate, delayed photoreceptor degeneration. Hence, Gln catabolism is integral to photoreceptor health, and these data reveal a novel metabolic axis in these metabolically demanding neurons.

                <p>Distinct frontal regions make dissociable contributions to rule-guided decision-making, including the ability to learn and exploit associations between abstract rules and reward value, maintain those rules in memory, and evaluate choice outcomes. Value-based learning can be quantified using reinforcement learning (RL) models predicting optimal trial-wise choices and estimating learning rates, which can then be related to the intact functioning of specific brain areas by combining a modeling approach with lesion-behavioral data. We applied a three-parameter feedback-dependent RL model to behavioral data obtained from macaques with circumscribed lesions to the principal sulcus (PS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (sdlPFC), and frontopolar cortex (FPC) performing a Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) analog. Our modeling-based approach identified distinct lesion effects on component cognitive mechanisms contributing to WCST performance. OFC lesions decreased the rate of rule value updating following both positive and negative feedback. In contrast, we found no deficit in rule value updating following PS lesions, which instead made monkeys less likely to repeat correct choices when rule values were well established, suggesting a crucial role of the PS in the working memory maintenance of rule representations. Finally, ACC lesions produced a specific deficit in learning from negative feedback, as well as impaired the ability to repeat choices following highly surprising reward, supporting a proposed role for ACC in flexibly switching between a trial-and-error mode and a working memory mode in response to increased error likelihood.</p>

                <p>In the mammalian primary visual cortex (V1), there are complex interactions between responses to stimuli present in the cell&rsquo;s classical receptive field (CRF) or "center" and in the surrounding region or "surround." The circuit mechanisms underlying these behaviors are likely to represent more general cortical mechanisms for integrating information. Here, we develop a circuit model that accounts for three important features of surround suppression (suppression of response to a center stimulus by addition of a surround stimulus): (1) The surround stimulus suppresses the inhibitory and excitatory currents that the cell receives; (2) The strongest suppression arises when the surround orientation matches that of the center stimulus, even when the center stimulus orientation differs from the cell&rsquo;s preferred orientation; and (3) A surround stimulus of a given orientation most strongly suppresses that orientation&rsquo;s component of the response to a plaid center stimulus ("feature-specific suppression"). We show that a stabilized supralinear network (SSN) with biologically plausible connectivity and synaptic efficacies that depend on cortical distance and orientation difference between units can consistently reproduce phenomena (1) and (3), and, qualitatively, phenomenon (2). We explain the mechanism behind each result. We argue that phenomena (2) and (3) are independent: the model with some aspects of connectivity removed still produces phenomenon (3) but not (2). The model reproduces the rapid time scale of activity decay observed in mouse V1 when thalamic input to V1 is silenced. Finally, we show that these results hold both in networks with rate-based and conductance-based spiking units. </p>

                Background Globally, stunting remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In Egypt, it affects approximately 33% of children under five and contributes to a 2–3% reduction in the country’s gross domestic product. Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children under five and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods This survey used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion A coordinated approach across health, WASH, education, and social protection is essential to address stunting in Egypt. Interventions should target high-risk groups, particularly those with low socioeconomic status, focusing on healthcare access, parental education, and infant feeding practices. While short maternal height increases risk, interventions must also tackle broader factors like food security and sanitation. A nutrition monitoring framework integrated into health systems will enable data collection, evidence-based actions, and progress tracking. Effective implementation requires cost-effective, scalable solutions, community involvement, and resource prioritisation to ensure sustainability and equity.

                Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) continue to affect the livelihood of individuals in countries in the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific region. These diseases have been long existing and have caused devastating health problems and economic decline to people in low- and middle-income (developing) countries. An estimated 1.7 billion of the world’s population suffer one or more NTDs annually, this puts approximately one in five individuals at risk for NTDs. In addition to health and social impact, NTDs inflict significant financial burden to patients, close relatives, and are responsible for billions of dollars lost in revenue from reduced labor productivity in developing countries alone. There is an urgent need to better improve the control and eradication or elimination efforts towards NTDs. This can be achieved by utilizing machine learning tools to better the surveillance, prediction and detection program, and combat NTDs through the discovery of new therapeutics against these pathogens. This review surveys the current application of machine learning tools for NTDs and the challenges to elevate the state-of-the-art of NTDs surveillance, management, and treatment.

                Background Malnutrition impairs immune function and vaccine responses, particularly in low-income settings. This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific. Objective This systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions—especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation—on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children. Results From 3,245 records, 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion Nutritional interventions improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations.

                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 5 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 94.26%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least five days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

                Background This study examines the role of multisensory design in shaping the spatial atmosphere of batik boutiques and its impact on consumer experience and purchasing behavior. Unlike conventional retail spaces, batik boutiques offer culture-based products for a specialized consumer segment, where shopping involves a highly immersive sensory experience. By analyzing sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste, this research explores how sensory stimuli influence emotional engagement, consumer perception, and decision-making within experiential boutique environments. Methods This research adopts a qualitative case study approach to analyze experiential retailing in batik boutiques as a brand differentiation strategy. Using an intersubjective paradigm, the study explores sociocultural consumer engagement through semi-structured interviews, direct observations, and photo-elicitation techniques. Data were collected over six months in a batik boutique in East Java, Indonesia, involving purposively selected participants to capture long-term consumer interactions with the store atmosphere and sensory elements influencing their shopping experiences. Result and Conclusions The findings indicate that batik boutiques serve beyond commercial spaces, offering culturally rich, multisensory experiences that enhance consumer attachment, emotional connection, and brand loyalty. Sensory engagement through lighting, music, scent, and tactile interactions significantly impacts consumer perception and purchase behavior. Additionally, nostalgia, identity projection, and social interaction reinforce prolonged engagement, with retail spaces functioning as cultural hubs for heritage appreciation. This study highlights the importance of sensory-driven retail design, demonstrating how store atmosphere influences consumer emotions, cognitive responses, and purchasing intentions within experiential fashion retailing.

The high energetic demands of the brain arise primarily from neuronal activity. Neurons consume substantial energy to transmit information as electrical signals and maintain their resting membrane potential. These energetic requirements are met by the neuro-glial-vascular (NGV) ensemble, which generates energy in a coupled metabolic process. In ageing, metabolic function becomes impaired, producing less energy and, consequently, the system is unable to sustain the neuronal energetic needs. We propose a multiscale model of electro-metabolic coupling in a reconstructed rat neocortex. This combines an electro-morphologically reconstructed electrophysiological model with a detailed NGV metabolic model. Our results demonstrate that the large-scale model effectively captures electro-metabolic processes at the circuit level, highlighting the importance of heterogeneity within the circuit, where energetic demands vary according to neuronal characteristics. Finally, in metabolic ageing, our model indicates that the middle cortical layers are particularly vulnerable to energy impairment.

                <p>by Shu-Ting Bao, Fang Rao, Cui Yin, Yong Niu, Jun-Li Cao, Cheng Xiao, Chunyi Zhou</p>

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in emotional processing, cognition, and pain sensation, moreover, its circuitry undergoes neuroplastic changes in chronic pain. Although the nucleus reuniens (RE) of the thalamus provides significant glutamatergic inputs to the mPFC, it remains unclear whether this projection contributes to plasticity changes in the mPFC and pain-related behaviors in chronic pain. Using fiber photometry, we demonstrated that RE neurons responded to pain stimulation and emotional changes. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons and their projections to the mPFC (RE-mPFC projection) elicits hyperalgesia and depression-like behaviors in naïve mice. In a neuropathic pain mouse model, RE neurons were hyperactive, and the RE-mPFC projection was enhanced with a marked preference for the part innervating GABAergic circuits in the mPFC to that controlling mPFC neurons projecting to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Expectedly, optogenetic inhibition of RE neurons and the RE-mPFC projection ameliorated pain-like and depression-like behaviors in neuropathic pain mice. Additionally, chemogenetic inhibition of RE-mPFC neurons conferred analgesia in neuropathic pain mice exposed to both acute and chronic morphine. Our findings highlight the significant role of the RE-mPFC pathway in neuropathic pain comorbid with depression, suggesting its potential as a target for treatment of neuropathic pain.

                <p>by Bo Liu, Xiaosha Wang, Xiaoying Wang, Yan Li, Yang Han, Jiahui Lu, Hui Zhang, Xiaochun Wang, Yanchao Bi</p>

How world knowledge is stored in the human brain is a central question in cognitive neuroscience. Object knowledge effects have been commonly observed in higher-order sensory association cortices, with the role of language being highly debated. Using object color as a test case, we investigated whether communication with the language system plays a necessary role in knowledge neural representation in the visual cortex and corresponding behaviors, combining diffusion imaging (measuring white-matter structural integrity), functional MRI (fMRI; measuring functional neural representation of knowledge), and neuropsychological assessments (measuring behavioral integrity) in a group of patients who suffered from stroke (<i>N</i> = 33; 18 with left-hemisphere lesions, 11 with right-hemisphere lesions, and 4 with bilateral lesions). The structural integrity loss of the white-matter connection between the anterior temporal language region and the ventral visual cortex had a significant effect on the neural representation strength of object color knowledge in the ventral visual cortex and on object color knowledge behavior across modalities. These contributions could not be explained by the potential effects of the early visual perception pathway or potential confounding brain or cognitive variables. Our experiments reveal the contribution of the vision-language connection in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) object knowledge neural representation and object knowledge behaviors, highlighting the significance of the language-sensory system interface.

                <p>by Olivia Goode, Urszula Łapińska, Juliano Morimoto, Georgina Glover, David S. Milner, Alyson E. Santoro, Stefano Pagliara, Thomas A. Richards</p>

Early in the evolution of life, a proto-metabolic network was encapsulated within a membrane compartment. The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilization of right-handed d-ribose and d-deoxyribose sugars and left-handed l-amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers); however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. Generally, archaea have l-phospholipid membrane chemistries and bacteria and eukaryotes have d-phospholipid membrane chemistries. We previously demonstrated that an l-archaeal and a d-intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a ‘hybrid’ membrane), displayed increased permeability for several key compounds compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars, and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for d-ribose and d-deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of l-amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first l-amino acid utilized. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection matching those used by the core metabolism of life.

                <p>by Yelin Dong, Gabor Lengyel, Sabyasachi Shivkumar, Akiyuki Anzai, Grace F. DiRisio, Ralf M. Haefner, Gregory C. DeAngelis</p>

Elucidating the neural basis of perceptual biases, such as those produced by visual illusions, can provide powerful insights into the neural mechanisms of perceptual inference. However, studying the subjective percepts of animals poses a fundamental challenge: unlike human participants, animals cannot be verbally instructed to report what they see, hear, or feel. Instead, they must be trained to perform a task for reward, and researchers must infer from their responses what the animal perceived. However, animals’ responses are shaped by reward feedback, thus raising the major concern that the reward regimen may alter the animal’s decision strategy or even their intrinsic perceptual biases. Using simulations of a reinforcement learning agent, we demonstrate that conventional reward strategies fail to allow accurate estimation of perceptual biases. We developed a method that estimates perceptual bias during task performance and then computes the reward for each trial based on the evolving estimate of the animal’s perceptual bias. Our approach makes use of multiple stimulus contexts to dissociate perceptual biases from decision-related biases. Starting with an informative prior, our Bayesian method updates a posterior over the perceptual bias after each trial. The prior can be specified based on data from past sessions, thus reducing the variability of the online estimate and allowing it to converge to a stable value over a small number of trials. After validating our method on synthetic data, we apply it to estimate perceptual biases of monkeys in a motion direction discrimination task in which varying background optic flow induces robust perceptual biases. This method overcomes an important challenge to understanding the neural basis of subjective percepts.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in respiratory infectious diseases. Examining the patterns of pathogens associated with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic would help to understand the impact of the pandemic on pathogen emergence or re-emergence. Methods We analyzed de-identified data from microbiology assays of nasopharyngeal and blood samples of children ≤15 years old with ARI who visited Vinmec Times City International Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam from 01/01/2019 to 31/12/2023. The data were aggregated by month, and time-series analysis and visualization were performed. Results A Bacterial Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) panel was performed on 4,125 samples (67% positive), Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) IgM was performed on 5,049 samples (39% positive), bacterial culture was performed on 10,280 samples (43% positive), and viral PCR or rapid test was performed on 42,300 samples (23% positive). After the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-2022, Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) have re-emerged as epidemic pathogens associated with lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Influenza type A and type B have re-established regular cycles of peaks in winter-spring months after an early rebound together with an unprecedented new emergence of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) soon after the relief of COVID-19 restriction in mid-2022. Late after the COVID-19 pandemic, from mid-2023, atypical pneumonia pathogen Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) has emerged remarkably and has become epidemic; there was also a small, brief emergence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP) infection. Conclusion Our data characterize the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the patterns of respiratory infection pathogens in children and is useful for disease surveillance and public health interventions.

                Purpose This report focuses on the efficacy of the Suhaim-Turayki Technique, a modified decompression procedure using dual drainage openings, in the treatment of odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs). Case Presentation We present five cases (four females, one male; age range: 25–31 years) of patients treated with our novel technique for OKCs. The cysts were located primarily in the left mandible, except for one case in the anterior mandible. Two patients underwent the procedure under general anesthesia, while three were treated with local anesthesia. The cyst dimensions ranged from 5.2 to 7.3 cm in width and 1.7 to 5.8 cm in height. The procedure involved inserting a perforated Foley catheter drain (size 15 or 16) into the cystic cavity, with dual openings connected to the oral cavity for continuous drainage. Patients received weekly irrigation of the cavity, with subsequent home irrigation instructions. Follow-up intervals ranged from 6 to 12 months. Complete resolution was achieved in all cases, either with decompression alone or with an additional enucleation procedure for cyst remnants in two cases. At discharge, radiographs confirmed full bony regeneration and the absence of recurrence. Conclusion The Suhaim-Turayki Technique proved to be a timely and effective method for managing OKCs, with complete cyst resolution and no recurrences observed during extended follow-up. This modified decompression technique is a promising alternative for patients where more invasive treatment options are not suitable or preferred.

                In a recent study, Heiser et al. showed that hippocampal place cell stability and spatial encoding were disrupted in mice after brain-wide microstrokes. These findings suggest that hippocampal neurons are particularly vulnerable to dysfunction after stroke, even in the absence of local lesions. They also highlight the potential to improve place cell stability and rescue post-stroke memory function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104913">Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor influences periarticular joint inflammation in Borrelia burgdorferi-infected mice</a></h4>

              
                Lyme disease, caused by <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States. Arthritis is a major clinical manifestation of infection, and synovial tissue damage has been attributed to the excessive pro-inflammatory responses. The secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) promotes tissue repair and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. The role of SLPI in the development of Lyme arthritis in C57BL/6 mice, which can be infected with <i>B. burgdorferi</i> but only develop mild joint inflammation, was therefore examined. <i>Slpi</i>-deficient C57BL/6 mice challenged with <i>B. burgdorferi</i> had a higher infection load in the tibiotarsal joints and marked periarticular swelling compared to infected wild-type control mice. The ankle joint tissues of <i>B. burgdorferi-</i>infected <i>Slpi</i>-deficient mice contained significantly higher percentages of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. <i>B. burgdorferi</i>-infected <i>Slpi</i>-deficient mice also exhibited elevated serum levels of IL-6, neutrophil elastase, and MMP-8. Moreover, using a recently developed BASEHIT (<b>BA</b>cterial <b>S</b>election to <b>E</b>lucidate <b>H</b>ost-microbe <b>I</b>nteractions in high <b>T</b>hroughput) library, we found that SLPI directly interacts with <i>B. burgdorferi</i>. These data demonstrate the importance of SLPI in suppressing periarticular joint inflammation in Lyme disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103870">Flower/FLWR-1 regulates neuronal activity via the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase to promote recycling of synaptic vesicles</a></h4>

              
                The Flower protein was suggested to couple the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to their recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigated the role of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> homologue FLWR-1 in neurotransmission. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of SVs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation revealed an accumulation of large endocytic structures in <i>flwr-1</i> mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown. Unexpectedly, the loss of FLWR-1 led to increased neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in axon terminals during stimulation, particularly in GABAergic motor neurons, causing excitation-inhibition imbalance. We found that this increased NMJ transmission might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode orthologue of the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA). <i>In vivo</i> molecular interactions indicated that FLWR-1 may be a positive regulator of the PMCA and might influence its recycling through modification of plasma membrane levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>).

                As a heterogenous disease with likely multiple pathogeneses and as-yet-undefined subtypes, progress in endometriosis treatment is currently limited by a lack of appropriate models and cohorts for research. Almost half of all publicly available datasets labelled as ‘endometriosis’ do not represent true disease as they are based on eutopic endometrium. Eutopic endometrial cells and tissues are frequently being used to represent endometriotic lesions, despite the unequivocal differences at both the tissue and cellular levels. As preclinical endometriosis research increases, it is important that the unique cellular and molecular profiles of endometrium and endometriosis are distinguished. Whilst each of these biospecimens can provide invaluable information to better understand disease aetiology and identify targets for diagnosis and treatment, it is imperative that the appropriate biospecimen and model are used to answer the relevant research question because endometriosis is not the endometrium.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104979">mTOR inhibition in Q175 Huntington’s disease model mice facilitates neuronal autophagy and mutant huntingtin clearance</a></h4>

              
                Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine stretch in huntingtin protein (HTT) resulting in hallmark aggresomes/inclusion bodies (IBs) composed of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) and its fragments. Stimulating autophagy to enhance mHTT clearance is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for HD. Our recent evaluation of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (ALP) in human HD brain reveals upregulated lysosomal biogenesis and relatively normal autophagy flux in early Vonsattel grade brains, but impaired autolysosome clearance in late grade brains, suggesting that autophagy stimulation could have therapeutic benefits as an early clinical intervention. Here, we tested this hypothesis by crossing the Q175 HD knock-in model with our autophagy reporter mouse TRGL (<b>T</b>hy-1-<b>R</b>FP-<b>G</b>FP-<b>L</b>C3) to investigate <i>in vivo</i> neuronal ALP dynamics. In the Q175 and/or TRGL/Q175 mice, mHTT was detected in autophagic vacuoles and also exhibited a high level of colocalization with autophagy receptors p62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitin in the IBs. Compared to the robust lysosomal pathology in late-stage human HD striatum, ALP alterations in Q175 models are also late-onset but milder, that included a lowered phospho-p70S6K level, lysosome depletion, and autolysosome elevation including more poorly acidified autolysosomes and larger-sized lipofuscin granules, reflecting impaired autophagic flux. Administration of a mTOR inhibitor to 6-mo-old TRGL/Q175 normalized lysosome number, ameliorated aggresome pathology while reducing mHTT-, p62-, and ubiquitin-immunoreactivities, suggesting the beneficial potential of autophagy modulation at early stages of disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106537">A novel SUN1-ALLAN complex coordinates segregation of the bipartite MTOC across the nuclear envelope during rapid closed mitosis in Plasmodium berghei</a></h4>

              
                Mitosis in eukaryotes involves reorganisation of the nuclear envelope (NE) and microtubule-organising centres (MTOCs). During male gametogenesis in <i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent of malaria, mitosis is exceptionally rapid and highly divergent. Within 8 min, the haploid male gametocyte genome undergoes three replication cycles (1N to 8N), while maintaining an intact NE. Axonemes assemble in the cytoplasm and connect to a bipartite MTOC-containing nuclear pole (NP) and cytoplasmic basal body, producing eight flagellated gametes. The mechanisms coordinating NE remodelling, MTOC dynamics, and flagellum assembly remain poorly understood. We identify the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> male gametogenesis. SUN1, a conserved NE protein, localises to dynamic loops and focal points at the nucleoplasmic face of the spindle poles. ALLAN, a divergent allantoicase, has a location like that of SUN1, and these proteins form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN genes disrupts nuclear MTOC organisation, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired spindle microtubule-kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. These defects block development in the mosquito and parasite transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98800">Perturbation-response analysis of in silico metabolic dynamics revealed hard-coded responsiveness in the cofactors and network sparsity</a></h4>

              
                Homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living systems. Unlike rigidity, homeostasis necessitates that systems respond flexibly to diverse environments. Understanding the dynamics of biochemical systems when subjected to perturbations is essential for the development of a quantitative theory of homeostasis. In this study, we analyze the response of bacterial metabolism to externally imposed perturbations using kinetic models of <i>Escherichia coli</i>’s central carbon metabolism in nonlinear regimes. We found that three distinct kinetic models consistently display strong responses to perturbations; in the strong responses, minor initial discrepancies in metabolite concentrations from steady-state values amplify over time, resulting in significant deviations. This pronounced responsiveness is a characteristic feature of metabolic dynamics, especially since such strong responses are seldom seen in toy models of the metabolic network. Subsequent numerical studies show that adenyl cofactors consistently influence the responsiveness of the metabolic systems across models. Additionally, we examine the impact of network structure on metabolic dynamics, demonstrating that as the metabolic network becomes denser, the perturbation response diminishes—a trend observed commonly in the models. To confirm the significance of cofactors and network structure, we constructed a simplified metabolic network model underscoring their importance. By identifying the structural determinants of responsiveness, our findings offer implications for bacterial physiology, the evolution of metabolic networks, and the design principles for robust artificial metabolism in synthetic biology and bioengineering.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101932">Unraveling the role of Ctla-4 in intestinal immune homeostasis through a novel Zebrafish model of inflammatory bowel disease</a></h4>

              
                Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (<i>ctla-4<sup>-/-</sup></i>) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibited reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94488">ME3BP-7 is a targeted cytotoxic agent that rapidly kills pancreatic cancer cells expressing high levels of monocarboxylate transporter MCT1</a></h4>

              
                Nearly 30% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) exhibit a marked overexpression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) offering a unique opportunity for therapy. However, biochemical inhibitors of MCT1 have proven unsuccessful in clinical trials. In this study, we present an alternative approach using 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) to target MCT1 overexpressing PDACs. 3BP is a cytotoxic agent that is known to be transported into cells via MCT1, but its clinical usefulness has been hampered by difficulties in delivering the drug systemically. We describe here a novel microencapsulated formulation of 3BP (ME3BP-7), which is effective against a variety of PDAC cells in vitro and remains stable in serum. Furthermore, systemically administered ME3BP-7 significantly reduces pancreatic cancer growth and metastatic spread in multiple orthotopic models of pancreatic cancer with manageable toxicity. ME3BP-7 is, therefore, a prototype of a promising new drug, in which the targeting moiety and the cytotoxic moiety are both contained within the same single small molecule.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103486">MagIC-Cryo-EM, structural determination on magnetic beads for scarce macromolecules in heterogeneous samples</a></h4>

              
                Cryo-EM single-particle analyses typically require target macromolecule concentration at 0.05~5.0 mg/ml, which is often difficult to achieve. Here, we devise <i>Ma</i><span class="underline">g</span>netic <i>I</i>solation and <i>C</i>oncentration (MagIC)-cryo-EM, a technique enabling direct structural analysis of targets captured on magnetic beads, thereby reducing the targets’ concentration requirement to &lt;0.0005 mg/mL. Adapting MagIC-cryo-EM to a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation protocol, we characterized structural variations of the linker histone H1.8-associated nucleosomes that were isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extract. Combining <i>Du</i>plicated <i>S</i>election <i>T</i>o <i>E</i>xclude <i>R</i>ubbish particles (DuSTER), a particle curation method that excludes low signal-to-noise ratio particles, we also resolved the 3D cryo-EM structures of nucleoplasmin NPM2 co-isolated with the linker histone H1.8 and revealed distinct open and closed structural variants. Our study demonstrates the utility of MagIC-cryo-EM for structural analysis of scarce macromolecules in heterogeneous samples and provides structural insights into the cell cycle-regulation of H1.8 association to nucleosomes.

">Autonomous Retrieval for Continuous Learning in Associative Memory Networks</a></h4>

              
                The brains faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically-inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in biological systems. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions, and takes a step forward towards a more biologically plausible mechanism for continuous learning.

">Dynamic Resting-State Network Markers of Disruptive Behavior Problems in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Background: Childhood disruptive behavior problems are linked to aberrant integrity within large-scale cognitive control networks. However, it is unclear if transitory or dynamic variation in the functional brain architecture is a marker of disruptive behavior problems. The current study tested whether functional connectivity across dynamic networks is distinctly associated with the transdiagnostic symptom domain of disruptive behavior problems in children. Methods: Participants were aged 9-10 years from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, who completed resting-state fMRI (N=877). We employed a dynamic connectivity approach leveraging a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) to identify transient properties of brain networks and states. Models estimated the time spent in each state (occupancy time) and the number of consecutive timepoints in a state (dwell time) for each participant. Linear regression models were utilized to identify distinct associations between dynamic properties (occupancy and sojourn times) and severity of disruptive behavior problems, accounting for other commonly co-occurring symptoms. Results: Dynamic network markers of disruptive behavior problems included increased time in network states characterized by globally aberrant connectivity patterns in circuitry involved in cognitive control including frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. Replication of findings was found in a held-out sample of resting-state fMRI runs in which greater severity of disruptive behavior problems was uniquely linked to greater occupancy time in similarly characterized brain states. Conclusion: Transdiagnostic, dynamic resting-state markers of disruptive behavior problems in youth may assist in the development of brain-based biomarkers for monitoring treatment outcomes, assessing circuit target engagement and informing clinical decisions.

">Can Pupillometry Reveal Perturbation Detection in Sensorimotor Adaptation during Grasping?</a></h4>

              
                Humans adjust their motor actions to correct for errors both with and without being aware of doing so. Little is known, however, about what makes errors detectable for the actor. Here, we replicate and extend prior work showing that motor adjustments may mask the very errors they correct for. We also investigated pupillometry as an unobtrusive no-report marker of perturbation detection. N=48 participants grasped objects while a visuo-haptic size mismatch was applied either sinusoidally or abruptly. When mismatches started abruptly and thereafter stayed the same, participants adapted well but also showed decreasing discrimination performance and decreasing confidence in their responses. This was not the case for sinusoidally introduced perturbations. We also show that parameters that characterize phasic and tonic pupil responses were predicted by stimulus parameters and differed depending on participants' grasping and behavioral responses. However, predicting response characteristics from pupil-dilation features using support-vector machine classifiers was not successful. This shows that while pupillometry may yet prove to be a useful no-report marker of perturbation and error detection, there are some challenges for trial-by-trial prediction.

">Age- and Sex-Related Differences in Sleep Patterns and Their Relations to Self-Reported Sleep and Mood</a></h4>

              
                Robust age- and sex-related differences in sleep were identified (n=38,546) and replicated (n=38,547) from week-long passive actigraphy data in UK Biobank participants ages 44-82. Sleep patterns reflected reliable non-linear interactions between age and sex. Younger women slept about 17 min more than their male counterparts, though this difference diminished with age, with both sexes reducing total sleep duration in later life. Middle-aged individuals exhibited shorter sleep durations during the week, with weekend sleep increasing by as much as 50 min. Participants in their seventh and eighth decades showed more consistent sleep patterns throughout the week. Sleep patterns also suggest maintenance of total sleep duration: individuals reporting waking too early maintain sleep duration by going to sleep earlier, while individuals reporting sleeping too much fall asleep later but also wake later, again maintaining sleep duration. Self-reported depression and anhedonia were associated with reduced total sleep duration across multiple age groups and both sexes. These collective results indicate that the timing, consistency, and overall amount of sleep differs by age and is affected by individual factors.

">Decoding the epistemic arc: Distinct physiological signatures for curiosity, insight, understanding and liking during interactions with visual art</a></h4>

              
                Recent work on insight and information processing suggested feelings of aha as a metacognitive feedback signal. A series of processes, from curiosity (drive state) to insight (uncertainty reduction) to pleasure (reward and reinforcement), might represent a fundamental epistemic arc for motivated learning. Here, we present a paradigm that combines measurement of curiosity, insight (aha), understanding and liking to outline the contours of this epistemic arc and study their neuronal mechanisms. In two preregistered experiments we employ the so called "title effect" - the fact that additional semantic information accompanying an artwork (such as titles) can change how an observer understands and enjoys a piece of visual art. Participants viewed paintings (5s trials) and rated their curiosity for seeing the title. This was followed either by the original title or a dummy title lacking additional information ("untitled"), and a second presentation of the painting, after which participants rated strength of aha, aesthetic liking, and feeling of understanding the artwork. In a behavioral online study (N=55 participants) we replicate a set of previous findings and established that visual art together with their titles can prompt strong feelings of aha. The association between the collected ratings is complex, partly nonlinear, and shaped by the type and amount of information provided by the stimulus material. In an EEG, ECG and eye tracking study with the same paradigm (N=49 participants) we aimed to characterize the temporal sequence of processing. Using a time-resolved decoding approach we were able to recover the categorical experimental conditions and the graded ratings: curiosity for the title could be decoded late in pretitle trials and early in the posttitle trials; aha could be decoded in posttitle trials; felt understanding had the most robust signature among the ratings and could be decoded from multiple signals in both pre and posttitle trials. Lastly, ratings of aesthetic liking were hard to decode from the data with only a short significant timewindow early during posttitle trials.

">Graphene Micro-transistor Arrays Reveal Perfusion-Dependent Electrophysiological and Haemodynamic Signatures of Cortical Spreading Depolarizations in Ischaemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) are large scale disruptions of neuronal homeostasis that contribute to secondary injury in ischaemic stroke. In healthy cortex, CSDs induce vasodilation to meet metabolic demand, whereas in ischaemic tissue, they can provoke vasoconstriction and sustained hypoperfusion, exacerbating damage. We present a multimodal neurotechnology platform integrating flexible, transparent graphene solution-gated field-effect transistor (gSGFET) arrays with laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), enabling simultaneous DC coupled electrophysiological recordings and cerebral blood flow imaging with high spatiotemporal fidelity. gSGFETs enable stable, distortion-free recording of infraslow potentials essential for resolving CSD waveforms in vivo. In two murine stroke models, we show that CSD waveform duration and morphology scale with local perfusion, delineating electrophysiological subtypes predictive of tissue viability and haemodynamic response. In metabolically compromised cortex, CSDs exhibit double peaks or negative ultraslow components that result in vasoconstriction, contrasting with narrow, monophasic waveforms eliciting vasodilation in healthy regions. Systemic ketamine shortens CSD duration and converts vasoconstriction to vasodilation in perfusion deficit tissue, revealing a mechanism for its neuroprotective action. This platform enables high-fidelity investigation of brain blood flow interactions in vivo.

">Breathing strategies to influence perception: Evidence for interoceptive and exteroceptive active sensing</a></h4>

              
                Recent research indicates that humans continuously and automatically modulate their breathing to temporally align exteroceptive stimuli with specific phases of the respiratory cycle. This process has been interpreted as a form of active sensing and is associated with faster responses and improved perceptual accuracy. While converging evidence suggests that respiration also shapes interoceptive processing at both neural and behavioural levels, it remains unclear whether individuals actively adjust their breathing to optimize interoceptive performance. In this study, we examined whether healthy participants modulated their respiration during an interoceptive (heartbeat discrimination) and an exteroceptive (tactile detection) task. We analysed respiration both in terms of time-locked activity and inter-trial phase coherence relative to stimulus onset and assessed their relationship with perceptual accuracy. Our results demonstrated that participants systematically adjust their breathing in both amplitude and phase, synchronizing respiration to the anticipated (i.e., cued) onset of stimuli in both tasks. Crucially, task performance was enhanced during exhalation compared to inhalation, suggesting that respiratory modulation supports the perception of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.

">The functional neurobiology of negative affective traits across regions, networks, signatures, and a machine learning multiverse</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis of negative affective traits like neuroticism remains a critical challenge across psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Here, we investigate which level of brain organization - regions, networks, or validated whole-brain machine-learning signatures - best explains negative affective traits in a community sample of 458 adults performing the two most widely used affective fMRI tasks, viewing emotional faces and scenes. Neuroticism could not be predicted from brain activity, with Bayesian evidence against all theory-guided neural measures. However, preregistered whole-brain models successfully decoded vulnerability to stress, a lower-level facet of neuroticism, with results replicating in a hold-out sample. The neural stress vulnerability pattern demonstrated good psychometric properties and indicated that negative affective traits are best represented by distributed whole-brain patterns related to domain-general stimulation rather than localized activity. Together with results from a comprehensive multiverse analysis across 14 traits and 1,176 models - available for exploration in an online app - the findings speak against simplistic neurobiological theories of negative affective traits, highlight a striking gap between predicting individual differences (r<.35) and within-person emotional states (r=.88), and underscore the importance of aligning psychological constructs with neural measures at the appropriate level of granularity.

">Evaluating the dependence of ADC-fMRI on haemodynamics inbreath-hold and resting-state conditions</a></h4>

              
                Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-fMRI offers a promising functional contrast, capable of mapping neuronal activity directly in both grey and white matter. However, previous studies have shown that diffusion-weighted fMRI (dfMRI), from which ADC-fMRI derives, is influenced by BOLD effects, leading to a concern that the dfMRI contrast is still rooted in neurovascular rather than neuromorphological coupling. Mitigation strategies have been proposed to remove vascular contributions while retaining neuromorphological coupling, by: i) analysing ADC timecourses calculated from two interleaved diffusion-weightings, known as ADC-fMRI; ii) using b-values of at least 200 s mm-2 ; and iii) using a sequence compensated for cross-terms with fluctuating background field gradients associated with blood oxygenation. Respiration-induced haemodynamic fluctuations, which are dissociated from neural activity, are an excellent test-bed for the robustness of ADC-fMRI to vascular contributions. In this study, we investigate the association between end-tidal CO2 and ADC-fMRI, in comparison with dfMRI and BOLD, in both breath-hold and resting-state paradigms in the human brain. We confirm a strong dependence of the BOLD signal on respiration, and find a pattern of delayed haemodynamic response to respiration in regions comprising the default mode network. While dfMRI mitigates much of the vascular contribution, it retains some association with respiration, as expected. Conversely, ADC-fMRI is mostly unaffected by vascular contribution, exhibiting minimal correlation between expired CO2 and ADC timeseries, as well as low inter- and intra-subject reproducibility in correlation maps. These findings validate ADC-fMRI as a predominantly non-vascular contrast sensitive to microstructural dynamics, enabling whole-brain functional imaging unconstrained by vascular confounds.

                Perceptual judgements and their subjective evaluation (i.e., metacognition) are considered tightly coupled aspects of decision-making. Yet, emerging evidence suggests that distinct neural mechanisms underlie these processes. In motion perception, studies have identified a neural network involving visual and associative parietal areas supporting these abilities. Whilst early (V1/V2) and specialized (V5/MT+) visual areas are associated with motion discrimination accuracy, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS/LIP) plays a critical role in the formation of subjective confidence for sensory decision, given its functionally coupling with the V5/MT+_V1/V2 network. Previous studies have consistently reported that increasing connectivity in the human V5/MT+ to V1/V2 pathway by means of cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), a neurostimulation protocol inducing Hebbian-like changes in neuronal pathways, improves our perceptual ability to discriminate motion. Notably, we recently demonstrated that strengthening V5/MT+ influence over V1/V2 also leads to overconfidence, altering metacognitive bias for motion discrimination, suggesting that the manipulation of V5/MT+_V1/V2 network might functionally affect IPS/LIP activity. Here, we directly investigated this possibility by first strengthening the V5/MT+_V1 pathway with ccPAS, and subsequently interfering with IPS/LIP activity by means of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS). In line with previous evidence, our results corroborate that enhancing V5/MT+_V1/V2 connectivity affects both motion discrimination and metacognitive bias. Crucially, IPS/LIP disruption through cTBS selectively affects metacognitive performance while leaving motion discrimination unaltered. These findings highlight distinct neural substrates for perceptual sensitivity and visual metacognition linked to V5/MT+ and IPS/LIP, respectively, opening to potential tailored applications of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to functionally improve sensory and metacognitive decision-making processes

">Aperiodic slope reflects glutamatergic tone in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Excitatory and inhibitory neural processes are essential for every aspect of brain function, but the current, non-invasive, neuroimaging methods to study these in the human brain are limited. Recent studies which separate oscillatory and aperiodic components of electrophysiological power spectra have highlighted a relationship between aperiodic activity and functional brain states. Studies in both animal models and humans suggest that the aperiodic slope of electrophysiological power spectra reflects the local balance of excitatory:inhibitory (E:I) synaptic transmission. Aperiodic slope varies across individuals, brain states, and clinical populations, which may reflect important differences in E:I balance. However, there is currently a lack of evidence linking aperiodic slope to other measures of excitation and inhibition in the human brain. Here, we show that flatter (less steep) aperiodic slopes from human electroencephalography (EEG) are associated with higher concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate measured with 7 tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the occipital lobe at rest. This suggests that individual differences in aperiodic neural activity reflect cortical glutamate concentrations, providing important insight for understanding changes in neural excitation across brain states and neuropsychiatric populations (e.g., schizophrenia) where glutamatergic function may differ. Our results support the use of aperiodic slope as a non-invasive marker for excitatory tone in the human brain.

                The dentate gyrus contains neurons generated during development and adulthood, yet their distinct roles remain unclear. Using a transgenic mouse model, we show that adult-born neurons contribute to pattern completion, essential for episodic memory. This has implications for aging, PTSD, and addiction, where excessive pattern completion leads to maladaptive memories. Targeting ABNs could offer new therapeutic strategies to regulate memory processes and improve mental health.

">An artefact-resilient wide bandwidth bidirectional graphene neural interface</a></h4>

              
                The ability to simultaneously record and modulate neural activity is critical for next-generation bidirectional neural interfaces aiming to enable adaptive neuromodulation therapies for neurological disorders. Active transistor technologies are particularly promising for neural recordings, as they extend the ability to monitor brain activity at very low frequencies and support multiplexed operation for high-density neural interfaces. However, their limited charge injection capacity makes them unsuitable for stimulation. In this work, we present a bidirectional neural interface that combines nanoporous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) microelectrodes for high charge injection focal stimulation and graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs) for brain activity monitoring, exploiting the advantages of both technologies in one single device. Using scalable cleanroom microfabrication techniques, we monolithically integrate these two graphene-based technologies into fully flexible probes. We evaluate the performance of the hybrid devices both in saline and in vivo, with a particular focus on transistor performance during stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the recording capability of this bidirectional neural interface, including the monitoring of infraslow and local field potential activity, is not compromised during stimulation. This work highlights the potential of this hybrid neural interface for both basic and translational research applications.

">Neurocomputational Mechanisms Linking Future Interaction Prospects to Reactive and Proactive Costly Punishment</a></h4>

              
                Costly punishment within social bonds manifests as both reactive penalties for transgressions and proactive sanctions against fair behaviors, yet a unified neurocomputational framework remains elusive. Combining neuroimaging and computational modeling, this study examined how future interaction prospects-a key element of social bonds-modulate reactive and proactive punishment. Participants acted as second- or third-party punishers, responding to allocation offers from individuals with or without future interactions. Results showed that participants imposed harsher punishment on both fair and unfair offers from individuals they did not expect to interact with, aligning with lower self-reported social closeness. Heightened provocation sensitivity, reflected in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity, drove the increased reactive punishment toward wrongdoers without future interactions, whereas punishment of future-interacting transgressors was associated with enhanced dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, dmPFC) activity. A stronger preference for relative advantage and reduced harm sensitivity, linked to dlPFC and temporoparietal junction activity, mediated greater proactive punishment towards non-future-interacting individuals. Moreover, proactive punishment and underlying neurocognitive processes followed a collective retaliation pattern, increasing after unfair (vs. fair) behavior from another non-future-interacting individual. These findings establish a unified neurocomputational framework for understanding how future interaction prospects regulate costly punishment, integrating reactive and proactive motives within social bonds.

">Identification of Sensory Fiber Types in Mouse Temporomandibular Joint Tissues</a></h4>

              
                Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders (TMJDs) are linked to heightened nerve sensitivity in TMJ tissues. To set the groundwork for investigating the mechanisms governing this increased responsiveness, this study aimed to identify the types of nerves in the retrodiscal tissue (retrodisc), anterior disc, and joint capsule of mouse TMJ using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reporter mice. The pan-sensory neuronal marker pgp9.5 revealed no nerves in the articular disc but identified approximately 70% unmyelinated and 30% myelinated fibers in other TMJ tissues. Nearly all sensory fibers in the joint capsule and anterior disc were CGRP+ peptidergic fibers, while the retrodisc contained about 80% peptidergic fibers. Notably, CGRP-/NFH+ myelinated non-peptidergic nerves were absent, indicating the absence of non-nociceptive fibers (A-LTMRs) in TMJ tissues. Almost all sensory fibers in the joint capsule and anterior disc were Htr3a+, with the retrodisc containing 60-70% Htr3a+ fibers. Additionally, TMJ tissues had minimal to no (<5%) MrgprD+, MrgprA3+, MrgprC11+, somatostatin+, or parvalbumin+ fibers, except for the retrodisc, which had about 20% Mrgpr+ fibers. Excluding articular discs, TMJ tissues were highly vascularized, with blood vessels surrounded by both sensory and sympathetic (TH+) nerves. Overall, TMJ tissues were predominantly innervated by peptidergic fibers, with a minor presence of other non-peptidergic nociceptors.

">Network-based Near-Scalp Personalized Brain Stimulation Targets</a></h4>

              
                Background: Functional connectivity (FC) is used to identify personalized targets for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, existing methods often overlook individual differences in whole-cortex network organization and were not explicitly designed to identify TMS targets near the scalp. Objective: We develop a novel framework to simultaneously optimize FC and scalp proximity for personalized target localization. Methods: We use the multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) to estimate high-quality individual-specific networks. A tree-based algorithm is then used to select the optimal target location. By essentially having no parameter to tune, our framework might improve generalizability across populations. We compare our approach to existing FC-based algorithms for TMS target selection in terms of scalp proximity, test-retest reliability, and FC to brain regions implicated in depression. Results: In two test-retest datasets of healthy individuals from the United States and Singapore, tree-based MS-HBM reliably identifies personalized TMS targets for depression in close proximity to the scalp. These targets are equivalent or superior to targets identified using prior algorithms in terms of reliability, scalp proximity, and FC to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. To demonstrate versatility, we apply the same algorithm, without having to tune any parameter, to identify personalized TMS targets for anxiety. Conclusion: The tree-based MS-HBM algorithm provides a robust, generalizable framework to estimate near-scalp personalized targets across different populations.

">Predictive inference alterations in psychosis proneness are context-dependent</a></h4>

              
                Background: Perception depends on the dynamic integration of sensory inputs and prior expectations, shaped by recent experience. While disruptions in this inferential process have been proposed as core features of psychosis, whether such alterations can be observed in subclinical psychosis-like experiences (PLEs), and how they manifest across different forms of perceptual inference remains unclear. Methods: Two independent samples of healthy adults participated in the study: 80 completed a visual detection task, and 62 performed a motion discrimination task. Data were analysed using mixed-effects models with a continuous PLE measure and supplemented by categorical comparisons between the lowest- and highest-PLEs terciles. Results: PLEs predicted reduced sensitivity to sensory evidence and increased reliance on probabilistic cues across both tasks. Critically, history biases diverged across contexts. In the detection task, a repulsive bias from the previous stimulus was observed in the overall sample, but this effect was attenuated in high-PLEs. In contrast, in the discrimination task, high-PLEs exhibited a repulsive bias away from their previous choice, reversing the typical repetition tendency seen in low-PLEs. Conclusions: Our results suggest that psychosis-like traits alter how prior expectations interact with sensory input and recent perceptual history. High-PLEs showed reduced influence of recent sensory input in detection task, consistent with altered low-level adaptation. In contrast, in the discrimination task, they showed a shift away from previous choices, suggesting disruption of decision-level integration of past choices. This points to a task-dependent instability in the use of past information, reflecting a broader inferential vulnerability linked to the psychosis spectrum.

">Distinct age- and pathology-dependent epitranscriptome and translational dysfunction in a tauopathy mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as tauopathies, cause major metabolic changes in the brain affecting gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Our understanding of how regulation of translation changes with disease has focused on mRNA and its translational regulatory factors, RNA binding proteins, and microRNAs, despite clear evidence for translational and post-translational dysfunction in ADRD and tauopathies. The neurobiology of tRNA has only recently begun to be studied, but the impact of chronic neurodegenerative diseases on tRNA biology and translational dysfunction is largely unknown. We have previously shown that the tRNA pool and tRNA modifications behave as a system to regulate the cellular stress response by undergoing stress-specific reprogramming and causing selective translation of mRNAs from codon-biased stress response genes. Here we tested this stress-induced tRNA reprogramming and codon-biased translation system in the response to mutant tau expression by performing mass spectrometric quantification of ~8500 proteins and 49 tRNA modifications, AQRNA-seq analysis of 222 cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs and other small RNAs, and informatic analysis of codon usage patterns in >23,000 protein-coding genes. Analysis of these datasets revealed that aging and tauopathy elicit major adaptation of the tRNA transcriptome and epitranscriptome as well as corresponding evidence of a program of translation of families of codon-biased genes for aging and disease responsive proteins. The mitochondrial tRNA transcriptome showed a strong response to aging and disease with 21 of the 22 mt-tRNAs showing age and disease-linked increases in expression, accompanied by mitochondria-specific modifications such as ms2i6A and f5C. Surprisingly, there were few significant changes in the 203 cytosolic tRNA isodecoders. However, a 10-fold increase tRNA isodecoder tRNA-Arg-TCT-5-1 was accompanied by increased translation of proteins encoded by genes highly enriched in its AGA cognate codon. These changes in tRNA biology are mirrored by strongly biased use of synonymous codons among the most highly upregulated and downregulated proteins in the P301S MAPT mice. Taken together these findings suggest the aging and disease brain produces an integrated response for translational control that is highly integrated with changes in tRNA biology.

">Repeated subconcussive head impacts compromise white matter integrity: A longitudinal DTI and NODDI study in collegiate football players</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive subconcussive impacts are a growing concern in contact sports due to their potential cumulative effects on brain structure, despite the absence of overt clinical symptoms. In this study, we investigated the effect of repeated subconcussive impact (RSCI) exposure on white matter (WM) microstructure in collegiate football players using advanced neuroimaging techniques. Twenty-two male athletes from the Queen's University Varsity Football Team were prospectively monitored over a single season. Participants were stratified into high-exposure (HE) and low-exposure (LE) groups based on impact frequency quantified with helmet-mounted accelerometers. MRI assessments, performed at pre-season, post-training camp, and post-season, included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) metrics, such as neurite density index (Vin), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and isotropic volume fraction (Viso). Between-group comparisons revealed that HE athletes exhibited significantly lower FA and higher MD in the corticospinal tracts at pre-season, along with increased Viso and reduced Vin and ODI in key association pathways compared to LE athletes. Longitudinal analyses demonstrated dynamic changes over the season, with significant alterations in diffusion metrics suggesting both acute injury responses and potential compensatory remodelling. These findings indicate that even in the absence of clinically diagnosed concussion, RSCIs are associated with quantifiable changes in WM integrity. Our results underscore the need for improved monitoring and intervention strategies in contact sports to mitigate the risk of cumulative neural injury and to safeguard long-term brain health in athletes.

">An autonomous AI agent for universal behavior analysis</a></h4>

              
                Behavior analysis across species represents a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, psychology, and ethology, typically requiring extensive expert knowledge and labor-intensive processes that limit research scalability and accessibility. We introduce BehaveAgent, an autonomous multimodal AI agent designed to automate behavior analysis from video input without retraining or manual intervention. Unlike conventional methods that require manual behavior annotation, video segmentation, task-specific model training, BehaveAgent leverages the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLM) to generalize across novel behavioral domains without need for additional training. It integrates LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and large-scale visual grounding modules, orchestrated through a multimodal context memory and goal-directed attention mechanism, to enable robust zero-shot visual reasoning across species and experimental paradigms, including plants, insects, rodents, primates, and humans. Upon receiving a video input, BehaveAgent autonomously identifies the correct analysis strategy and performs end-to-end behavior analysis and interpretation without human supervision. Leveraging vision-language representations, it performs general-purpose tracking, pose estimation and segmentation. We demonstrate BehaveAgent's universal applicability to autonomously (1) identify the behavioral paradigm and develop an action plan specialized for the identified paradigm, (2) identify relevant subjects and objects, (3) track those features, (4) identify behavioral sequences with explicit reasoning, (5) generate and execute code for targeted analysis and (6) generate comprehensive research reports that integrate behavioral findings with relevant scientific literature. Through interpretable agentic reasoning, BehaveAgent makes its internal decision-making process transparent, clarifying why particular features are tracked or behaviors inferred. By reducing the time and expertise required for behavior analysis, BehaveAgent introduces a scalable, generalizable, and explainable paradigm for advancing biological and behavioral research.

                <p>In the <I>Syngap<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> model of SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SRID), excessive neuronal protein synthesis is linked to deficits in synaptic plasticity. Here, we use Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification and RNA-seq (TRAP-seq) to identify mistranslating mRNAs in <I>Syngap<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> CA1 pyramidal neurons that exhibit occluded long-term potentiation (LTP). We find the translation environment is significantly altered in a manner that is distinct from the <I>Fmr1<sup>&ndash;/y</sup></I> model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), another monogenic model of autism and intellectual disability. The <I>Syngap<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> translatome is enriched for regulators of DNA repair and mimics changes induced with chemical LTP (cLTP) in WT. This includes a striking upregulation in the translation of mRNAs with a longer-length (&gt;2&nbsp;kb) coding sequence (CDS). In contrast, long CDS transcripts are downregulated with induction of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) in WT, and in the <I>Fmr1<sup>&ndash;/y</sup></I> model that exhibits occluded mGluR-LTD. Together, our results show the <I>Syngap<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> and <I>Fmr1<sup>&ndash;/y</sup></I> models mimic the translation environments of LTP and LTD, respectively, consistent with the saturation of plasticity states in each model. Moreover, we show that translation of &gt;2&nbsp;kb mRNAs is a defining feature of LTP that is oppositely regulated during LTD, revealing a novel mRNA signature of plasticity.</p>

Advancements in calcium indicators and optical techniques have made optical neural recording common in neuroscience. As data volumes grow, streamlining the analysis pipelines for image preprocessing, signal extraction, and subsequent neural activity analyses becomes essential. Challenges in analysis includes 1) ensuring data quality of original and processed data at each step. 2) Selecting optimal algorithms and their parameters from numerous options, each with its own pros and cons, by implementing or installing them manually. 3) systematically recording each analysis step for reproducibility 4) adopting standard data formats for data sharing and meta-analyses. To address these challenges, we developed Optical Neuroimage Studio (OptiNiSt), a scalable, extendable, and reproducible framework for creating calcium data analysis pipelines. OptiNiSt includes the following features. 1) Researchers can easily create analysis pipelines by selecting multiple processing modules, tuning their parameters, and visualizing the results at each step through a graphic user interface in a web browser. 2) In addition to pre-installed tools, new analysis algorithms can be easily added. 3) Once a processing pipeline is designed, the entire workflow with its modules and parameters are stored in a YAML file, which makes the pipeline reproducible and deployable on high-performance computing clusters. 4) OptiNiSt can read image data in a variety of file formats and store the analysis results in NWB (Neurodata Without Borders), a standard data format for data sharing. We expect that this framework will be helpful in standardizing optical neural data analysis protocols.

Representation bias in health data can lead to unfair decisions and compromise the generalisability of research findings. As a consequence, underrepresented subpopulations, such as those from specific ethnic backgrounds or genders, do not benefit equally from clinical discoveries. Several approaches have been developed to mitigate representation bias, ranging from simple resampling methods, such as SMOTE, to recent approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). However, generating high-dimensional time-series synthetic health data remains a significant challenge. In response, we devised a novel architecture (CA-GAN) that synthesises authentic, high-dimensional time series data. CA-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation while avoiding mode collapse, a serious GAN failure. We perform evaluation using 7535 patients with hypotension and sepsis from two diverse, real-world clinical datasets. We show that synthetic data generated by our CA-GAN improves model fairness in Black patients as well as female patients when evaluated separately for each subpopulation. Furthermore, CA-GAN generates authentic data of the minority class while faithfully maintaining the original distribution of data, resulting in improved performance in a downstream predictive task.

The unprecedented mpox outbreak in non-endemic regions during 2022–2023, which has seen a recent resurgence in late 2023–2024, poses a significant public health threat. Despite its global spread, the viral dynamics of mpox infection and the specific characteristics driving these outbreaks remain insufficiently explored. We develop mathematical models to examine the interactions between host immune responses and the virus across three distinct infection routes (intravenous, intradermal, and intrarectal). The models are calibrated using viral load data from macaques infected through each of these three infection routes. Subsequently, we calculate the infectiousness of each infected macaque, finding that the proportion of presymptomatic infectiousness is highest in those infected via sexual contact, followed by skin-to-skin contact. These observations demonstrate that close contact during sexual activity is a significant route of viral transmission, with presymptomatic spread playing a crucial role in the 2022–2023 multi-country outbreak and potentially also in the 2023–2024 multi-source outbreak. Leveraging model predictions and infectiousness data, we assess the impact of antiviral drugs on interventions against mpox infection. Model simulations suggest that early administration of antiviral drugs can reduce peak viral loads, even in individuals with compromised immunity, particularly in cases of infection through skin-to-skin and sexual contact. These results underscore the importance of initiating antiviral treatment as early as possible for mpox-infected patients with compromised immune systems, such as those who are HIV-positive.

Biochemical Reaction Networks (BCRNs) model species and their interactions via reactions. They have been extensively used in chemistry and extended to biological settings by generalizing the reactions’ kinetics. However, detailed models of biochemical processes tend to result in complex BCRN models. We present the Meta-species Oriented Biosystem Syntax (MobsPy), a language designed to simplify the modeling process using the concept of meta-species. Meta-species are constructed using a bottom-up approach from base species, which represent elementary, simple characteristics. These characteristics are then combined to create meta-species with all their complex behavior. The combined species have characteristics that are the Cartesian product of the base species’ characteristics and feature inheritance of reactions involving the base species. New reactions can involve all the states of a meta-species or only a subset that is selected via a query. In particular, reactions of meta-species can express a state change of one of the reactants. MobsPy is deployed as a Python package. We showcase its modeling capabilities by building concise models for biochemical systems from the literature.

     alt="Otolith Irregular Fiber Stimulation Elicits a Rostro-Caudal Activity Gradient in the Vestibular Nuclear Complex and Both Direct and Indirect Afferent Pathways of the Vestibulocerebellum"/>
<p>A rapid linear head jerk stimulus was used to elicit a vestibular short-latency evoked potential (VsEP), activating otolith irregular afferents. Otolith irregular afferents preferentially activated mid-rostro-caudal and caudal regions of the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC). A rostro-caudal activity gradient was observed across the vestibulocerebellum (VeCb) except for the uvula.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The vestibular system is important for posture, balance, motor control, and spatial orientation. Each of the vestibular end organs has specialized neuroepithelia with both regular and irregular afferents. In otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, afferents most responsive to linear jerk (jerk—derivative of acceleration) are located in the striola and project centrally to the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC) as well as the uvula and nodulus of the vestibulocerebellum (VeCb). The pattern of central neuronal activation attributed to otolith irregular afferents is relatively unknown. To address this gap, c-Fos was used as a marker of neuronal activity to map the distribution of active neurons throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the VNC and VeCb in rats. Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos was performed to assess activation of VNC and VeCb neurons in response to a linear jerk stimulus delivered in the naso-occipital plane. Activated neurons were distributed throughout the VNC, including the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVe), magnocellular medial vestibular nucleus (MVeMC), parvocellular medial vestibular nucleus (MVePC), spinal vestibular nucleus (SpVe), and superior vestibular nucleus (SuVe). Notably, after stimulation, the MVePC exhibited the greatest number of c-Fos-labeled nuclei. Significant increases in c-Fos labeling were found in mid-rostro-caudal and caudal regions of the VNC in the LVe, MVe, and SpVe. Additionally, c-Fos labeling was observed across all regions of the VeCb after jerk stimulation. Significant increases in the number of labeled nuclei were found throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the nodulus and uvula. The distribution of neuronal activity suggests that regions receiving the greatest direct otolith input exhibit the most substantial changes in response to otolith-derived, irregular fiber stimulation.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating form of dementia, with the number of affected individuals rising sharply. The main hallmarks of the disease include amyloid-beta plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, besides other pathological features that contribute to the disease's complexity. The causes of sporadic AD are multifactorial and mostly age-related and involve risk factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is another type of dementia characterized by a spectrum of behaviors, memory, and motor abnormalities and associated with abnormal depositions of protein aggregation, including tau protein. Currently approved medications are symptomatic, and no disease-modifying therapy is available to halt the disease progression. Therefore, the development of multi-targeted therapeutic approaches could hold promise for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including tauopathies. In this article, we will discuss the pathophysiology of AD and FTD, the proposed hypotheses, and current therapeutic approaches, highlighting the development of novel drug candidates and the progress of clinical trials in this field of research.</p>

                Background Variables such as dietary intake are measured with error yet frequently used in observational epidemiology. Although this limitation is sometimes noted, these variables are still often modeled as covariates without formal correction or sincere dialogue about measurement unreliability potentially weakening the validity of statistical conclusions. Further, larger sample sizes increase power (bias) to detect spurious correlations. Counterintuitively, recent work suggested a non-monotonic relationship between confounder unreliability and how much controlling for the confounder reduces (or induces) bias when testing for an exposure-outcome association. If true, such non-monotonicity would be especially concerning for applications such as nutrition, where measurement reliability varies substantially, and large sample sizes are common. Methods We offer a detailed derivations of the square partial correlation between the outcome and exposure, controlling for the confounder. In our derivation, the measurement reliabilities of exposures and confounders are not arbitrarily constrained to be equal. Further, our theoretical results are investigated using simulations. Results Reassuringly, these derivations and simulations show that the counterintuitive non-monotonicity relationship between confounder unreliability and how much controlling for the confounder reduces (or induces) bias when testing for an exposure-outcome association is an artifact of the arbitrary constraint which forces the measurement reliabilities of exposures and confounders to be equal, which that does not always hold. Conclusions The profound and manifold effects of measurement error on estimation and statistical conclusion validity in realistic scenarios indicate that merely mentioning measurement error as a limitation and then dispensing with it is not an adequate response. We also explore questions for optimal study design subject to resource constraints when considering reliability of exposures, covariates, and outcomes.

                Background Antiviral therapy is not routinely recommended for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients exhibiting persistently elevated serum HBV DNA levels (>2000 IU/mL), normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and without significant liver fibrosis – a clinical state termed the indeterminate phase. Recognizing the evolving treatment landscape, this study aimed to identify factors associated with liver fibrosis progression in chronic HBV patients within this indeterminate phase. Methods This retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in the Infectious Disease and Hepato-gastroenterology departments of Farhat Hached University Hospital in Sousse, Tunisia, between January 2008 and January 2022. We included HBsAg-positive patients initially untreated, presenting at evaluation with a viral load >2,000 IU/mL for at least six months, normal ALT (<40 IU/L), and a fibrosis score of F0 and/or F1 (determined by liver biopsy or FibroScan). Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with liver fibrosis progression. Results A total of 97 patients were included, with a median age of 32.9 ± 9.1 years, and a female predominance (M/F ratio = 0.64). Fibrosis progression was observed in 16 patients (16.5%), with a mean delay of 70.9 ± 41.1 months. Univariate analysis revealed associations between fibrosis progression and the presence of comorbidities (p=0.001), a high initial viral load (p=0.004), elevated liver enzymes (p=0.001), and an increase in viral load during follow-up (p=0.002). Multivariate analysis identified comorbidities (p<0.001) and changes in ALT levels (p<0.001) as independent predictors of fibrosis progression. The AUROC of the initial viral load was 0.664 (95%CI: 0.500-0.820). Conclusion The presence of comorbidities and changes in ALT levels during follow-up were associated with fibrosis progression in the indeterminate phase of chronic HBV infection. These findings suggest a potential rationale for extending therapeutic indications to include this patient population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-500/v1?src=rss">“It’s messy and it’s massive”: How has the open science debate developed in the post-COVID era? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the global adoption of open science (OS) practices. However, as the pandemic subsides, the debate around OS continues to evolve. This study investigates how the pandemic has shaped the OS discourse and identifies key issues and challenges. Interviews were conducted with influential stakeholders across the research and publishing communities. The findings show that while many areas of debate remained constant, the ways in which they were discussed exposed underlying systemic challenges, which must be addressed if OS is to progress. These issues included the scope and definition of OS; regional variations in its implementation; the relationship between OS and fundamental questions of the purpose and practice of science; and the need to reform incentives and reward structures within the research system. A more complex understanding of OS is required, which takes into account the importance of equity and diversity and the challenges of implementing OS in different cultural and geographical contexts. The study emphasises the importance of shifting scientific culture to prioritise values such as quality, integrity, and openness, and reforming rewards structures to incentivise open practices.

                Background Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) is a well-known diagnosis among physiotherapists specializing in pediatric care, especially when working with infants. However, knowledge of bilateral torticollis is limited. The purpose of this article was to describe how bilateral torticollis may present itself clinically. Case Case I describes an infant with CMT with a sternocleidomastoid tumor (SMT) on the right side, with some limitation in rotation towards the right side and in lateral flexion towards the left side, the muscle on the right side was shortened. While sitting with support, he tilted his head to the left and was stronger in the lateral flexors on the left side which fits well with postural left-sided torticollis. The other infant had bilateral muscular torticollis, the sternocleidomastoid muscle had thickened bilaterally, and both active and passive rotations were affected. The head was held in flexion, and active rotation was severely limited on both sides. For both cases the therapeutic interventions were to gain a normal range of motion (ROM) and a good head position. Conclusions CMT can appear in different ways and may be bilateral. Both infants gained good ROM and better head position, however case I still needs some training. To gain more knowledge about bilateral CMT, we should follow these cases over a longer period of time. It is important to communicate and discuss our experiences with each other to understand rare cases of CMT.

                Background The provision of meals by colleges of nursing is geared towards meeting the nutrient requirements of students, thereby, improving their nutritional status. However, several studies revealed that the calorie and nutrient content of meals consumed at school frequently fall short of meeting the needs of schoolchildren in terms of nutrition. Methods The study estimated nutritional status and nutrient intake adequacy in a cross-sectional study consisting of 230 student nurses of Bole Nursing and Midwifery Training College-Ghana. Anthropometric measurements were used to determine students’ nutritional status while food frequency questionnaires and weighed food methods were used to assess dietary diversity and nutrient intake. HemoCue1 Hb 201+ was used to determine the haemoglobin concentration of the students. Results About 68% had BMIs within the range of acceptable body weight, whereas 4% and 27.8%, respectively, were underweight or overweight. There was a significant difference in BMI between males and females (p < .001) and among the program of study (p < .001). The anaemia prevalence in the study was 21.5% with the risk greater among females than males (p < .005). The waist-to-hip ratio was larger in 22 per cent of females than in 7.3 per cent of males (χ2 (1)= 6.086, p < .05). Conclusion The study found evidence of the triple burden of malnutrition in the school with undernutrition, overnutrition, and anaemia prevalence. More so, the college’s meals are not diversified and hence contribute less than the needed micronutrient requirements of students.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95733">A memory model of rodent spatial navigation in which place cells are memories arranged in a grid and grid cells are non-spatial</a></h4>

              
                A theory and neurocomputational model are presented that explain grid cell responses as the byproduct of equally dissimilar hippocampal memories. On this account, place and grid cells are best understood as the natural consequence of memory encoding and retrieval; a precise hexagonal grid is the exception rather than the rule, emerging when the animal explores a large surface that is devoid of landmarks and objects. In the proposed memory model, place cells represent memories that are conjunctions of both spatial and non-spatial attributes, and grid cells primarily represent the non-spatial attributes (e.g. sounds, surface texture, etc.) found throughout the two-dimensional recording enclosure. Place cells support memories of the locations where non-spatial attributes can be found (e.g. positions with a particular sound), which are arranged in a hexagonal lattice owing to memory encoding and consolidation processes (pattern separation) as applied to situations in which the non-spatial attributes are found at all locations of a two-dimensional surface. Grid cells exhibit their spatial firing pattern owing to feedback from hippocampal place cells (i.e. a hexagonal pattern of remembered locations for the non-spatial attribute represented by a grid cell). Model simulations explain a wide variety of results in the rodent spatial navigation literature.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103205">Variation in albumin glycation rates in birds suggests resistance to relative hyperglycaemia rather than conformity to the pace of life syndrome hypothesis</a></h4>

              
                The pace of life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis suggests that organisms’ life history and physiological and behavioural traits should co-evolve. In this framework, how glycaemia (i.e. blood glucose levels) and its reaction with proteins and other compounds (i.e. glycation) covary with life history traits remain relatively under-investigated, despite the well-documented consequences of glucose and glycation on ageing, and therefore potentially on life history evolution. Birds are particularly relevant in this context given that they have the highest blood glucose levels within vertebrates and still higher mass-adjusted longevity compared to organisms with similar physiology as mammals. We thus performed a comparative analysis on glucose and albumin glycation rates of 88 bird species from 22 orders in relation to life history traits (body mass, clutch mass, maximum lifespan, and developmental time) and diet. Glucose levels correlated positively with albumin glycation rates in a non-linear fashion, suggesting resistance to glycation in species with higher glucose levels. Plasma glucose levels decreased with increasing body mass, but, contrary to what is predicted in the POLS hypothesis, glucose levels increased with maximum lifespan before reaching a plateau. Finally, terrestrial carnivores showed higher albumin glycation compared to omnivores despite not showing higher glucose, which we discuss may be related to additional factors as differential antioxidant levels or dietary composition in terms of fibres or polyunsaturated fatty acids. These results increase our knowledge about the diversity of glycaemia and glycation patterns across birds, pointing towards the existence of glycation resistance mechanisms within comparatively high glycaemic birds.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102422">Crystal structure and catalytic mechanism of PL35 family glycosaminoglycan lyases with an ultrabroad substrate spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Recently, a new class of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) lyases (GAGases) belonging to PL35 family has been discovered with an ultrabroad substrate spectrum that can degrade three types of uronic acid-containing GAGs (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) or even alginate. In this study, the structures of GAGase II from <i>Spirosoma fluviale</i> and GAGase VII from <i>Bacteroides intestinalis</i> DSM 17393 were determined at 1.9 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, and their catalytic mechanism was investigated by the site-directed mutant of their crucial residues and molecular docking assay. Structural analysis showed that GAGase II and GAGase VII consist of an N-terminal (α/α)<sub>6</sub> toroid multidomain and a C-terminal two-layered β-sheet domain with Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Notably, although GAGases share similar folds and catalytic mechanisms with some GAG lyases and alginate lyases, they exhibit higher structural similarity with alginate lyases than GAG lyases, which may present a crucial structural evidence for the speculation that GAG lyases with (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid and antiparallel β-sheet structures arrived by a divergent evolution from alginate lyases with the same folds. Overall, this study not only solved the structure of PL35 GAG lyases for the first time and investigated their catalytic mechanism, especially the reason why GAGase III can additionally degrade alginate, but also provided a key clue in the divergent evolution of GAG lyases that originated from alginate lyases.

                Retinal Müller glia in cold-blooded vertebrates can reprogram into neurogenic progenitors to replace neurons lost to injury, but mammals lack this ability. While recent studies have shown that transgenic overexpression of neurogenic bHLH factors and glial-specific disruption of NFI family transcription factors and Notch signaling induce neurogenic competence in mammalian Müller glia, induction of neurogenesis in wildtype glia has thus far proven elusive. Here, we report that viral-mediated overexpression of the pluripotency factor <i>Pou5f1 (Oct4)</i> induces transdifferentiation of mouse Müller glia into bipolar neurons, and synergistically stimulates glial-derived neurogenesis in parallel with Notch loss of function. Single-cell multiomic analysis shows that <i>Pou5f1</i> overexpression leads to widespread changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, inducing activity of both the neurogenic transcription factor Rfx4 and the Yamanaka factors Sox2 and Klf4. This study demonstrates that viral-mediated overexpression of <i>Pou5f1</i> induces neurogenic competence in adult mouse Müller glia, identifying mechanisms that could be used in cell-based therapies for treating retinal dystrophies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99275">Structural and dynamic impacts of single-atom disruptions to guide RNA interactions within the recognition lobe of Geobacillus stearothermophilus Cas9</a></h4>

              
                The intuitive manipulation of specific amino acids to alter the activity or specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 has been a topic of great interest. As a large multi-domain RNA-guided endonuclease, the intricate molecular crosstalk within the Cas9 protein hinges on its conformational dynamics, but a comprehensive understanding of the extent and timescale of the motions that drive its allosteric function and association with nucleic acids remains elusive. Here, we investigated the structure and multi-timescale molecular motions of the recognition (Rec) lobe of <i>Geo</i>Cas9, a thermophilic Cas9 from <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i>. Our results provide new atomic details about the <i>Geo</i>Rec subdomains (<i>Geo</i>Rec1, <i>Geo</i>Rec2) and the full-length domain in solution. Two rationally designed mutants, K267E and R332A, enhanced and redistributed micro-millisecond flexibility throughout <i>Geo</i>Rec, and NMR studies of the interaction between <i>Geo</i>Rec and its guide RNA showed that mutations reduced this affinity and the stability of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Despite measured biophysical differences due to the mutations, DNA cleavage assays reveal no functional differences in on-target activity, and similar specificity. These data suggest that guide RNA interactions can be tuned at the biophysical level in the absence of major functional losses but also raise questions about the underlying mechanism of <i>Geo</i>Cas9, since analogous single-point mutations have significantly impacted on- and off-target DNA editing in mesophilic <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9. A K267E/R332A double mutant did also did not enhance <i>Geo</i>Cas9 specificity, highlighting the robust tolerance of mutations to the Rec lobe of <i>Geo</i>Cas9 and species-dependent complexity of Rec across Cas9 paralogs. Ultimately, this work provides an avenue by which to modulate the structure, motion, and guide RNA interactions at the level of the Rec lobe of <i>Geo</i>Cas9, setting the stage for future studies of <i>Geo</i>Cas9 variants and their effect on its allosteric mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100337">Sensitivity to visual features in inattentional blindness</a></h4>

              
                The relation between attention, perception, and awareness is among the most fundamental problems in the science of the mind. One of the most striking and well-known phenomena bearing on this question is <i>inattentional blindness</i> (IB). In IB, naive observers fail to report clearly visible stimuli when their attention is otherwise engaged—famously missing a gorilla parading before their eyes. IB carries tremendous significance, both as evidence that awareness requires attention and as a tool in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness. However, such implications rest on a notoriously biased measure: asking participants whether they noticed anything unusual (and interpreting negative answers as reflecting a complete lack of perception). Here, in the largest ever set of IB studies, we show that, as a group, inattentionally blind participants can successfully report the location, color, and shape of stimuli they deny noticing, demonstrating that perceptual information remains accessible in IB. By introducing absent trials, we further show that observers are collectively biased to report not noticing in IB—essentially ‘playing it safe’ in reporting their sensitivity. These data provide the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB. They also challenge the use of inattentional blindness to argue that awareness requires attention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105112">Cortical dynamics in hand/forelimb S1 and M1 evoked by brief photostimulation of the mouse’s hand</a></h4>

              
                Spiking activity along synaptic circuits linking primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas is fundamental for sensorimotor integration in cortex. Circuits along the ascending somatosensory pathway through mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1 were recently described in detail (Yamawaki et al., 2021). Here, we characterize the peripherally evoked spiking dynamics in these two cortical areas. Brief (5 ms) optogenetic photostimulation of the hand generated short (~25 ms) barrages of activity first in S1 (onset latency 15 ms) then M1 (10 ms later). The estimated propagation speed was 20-fold faster from hand to S1 than from S1 to M1. Amplitudes in M1 were strongly attenuated. Responses were typically triphasic, with suppression and rebound following the initial peak. Evoked activity in S1 was biased to middle layers, consistent with thalamocortical connectivity, while that in M1 was biased to upper layers, consistent with corticocortical connectivity. Parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons were involved in each phase, accounting for three quarters of the initial spikes generated in S1, and their selective photostimulation sufficed to evoke suppression and rebound in both S1 and M1. Partial silencing of S1 by PV activation during hand stimulation reduced the M1 sensory responses. Overall, these results characterize how evoked spiking activity propagates along the hand/forelimb transcortical loop, and illuminate how in vivo cortical dynamics relate to the underlying synaptic circuit organization in this system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101630">MorphoCellSorter is an Andrews plot-based sorting approach to rank microglia according to their morphological features</a></h4>

              
                Microglia exhibit diverse morphologies reflecting environmental conditions, maturity, or functional states. Thus, morphological characterization provides important information to understand microglial roles and functions. Most recent morphological analysis relies on classifying cells based on morphological parameters. However, this classification may lack biological relevance, as microglial morphologies represent a continuum rather than distinct, separate groups, and do not correspond to mathematically defined clusters irrelevant of microglial cells function. Instead, we propose a new open-source tool, MorphoCellSorter, which assesses microglial morphology by automatically computing morphological criteria, using principal component analysis and Andrews plots to score cells. MorphoCellSorter properly ranked cells from various microglia datasets in mice and rats of different ages, from <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>ex vivo</i> models, that were acquired using diverse imaging techniques. This approach allowed for the discrimination of cell populations in various pathophysiological conditions. Finally, MorphoCellSorter offers a versatile, easy, and ready-to-use method to evaluate microglial morphological diversity that could easily be generalized to standardize practices across laboratories.

                Tendon injury occurs at high frequency and is difficult to repair. Identification of human stem cells being able to regenerate tendon will greatly facilitate the development of regenerative medicine for tendon injury. Genetic and functional analyses identify human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors with tenogenic differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse muscle stem cells is minimal and the higher TGFβ signaling level may be the key for the distinct feature of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. The discovery of bi-potential CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors highlights their potential as a novel adult stem cell source for tendon regeneration.

">Spatial Attention Weakly Modulates Visual Responses in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Visual responses in the cerebral cortex are strongly influenced by shifts in spatial attention. This modulation of visual processing includes changes in firing rate, decreased response variability, and decreased interneuronal correlations; all of which are thought to underlie enhanced visual perception near the center of attention at the cost of visual perception at other locations. Visual information from the retina is relayed to primary visual cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus. Although early studies describe an enhancement of LGN activity with spatial attention, more recent work has cast doubt on this view. Given its strategic position as the gateway to the cortex, an understanding of the effects of attention on visual processing in the LGN is important. We therefore performed experiments to reexamine the influence of covert spatial attention on the spiking activity of single units in the macaque LGN and applied a broad set of analyses and functional metrics to assess possible effects. Our results reveal a statistically significant effect of spatial attention in the LGN: firing rates were slightly higher and more reliable when monkeys directed attention towards the receptive fields of recorded neurons compared to when attention was directed to different retinotopic locations. However, effects were much smaller than previously reported (~1% vs ~4%) and further analyses suggest that effects are weak and inconsistent. Thus, while spatial attention does exert an influence in the LGN, its effects are weak and may have limited impact on downstream processing.

">Evidence-based guidelines for improving network detectability in rodent fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Mouse resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an increasingly popular tool for probing brain activity under experimental manipulations; however, there remains considerable variability in data quality throughout the field. There is a need for an accessible set of acquisition guidelines such that a baseline level of data quality can be attained regardless of domain expertise or specialized equipment (i.e. in anesthetized, free-breathing mice). In particular, there is a gap in the literature regarding the interpretation of physiological parameters as markers of anesthetic depth, and ultimately, data quality. To this end, we developed a set of acquisition guidelines after examining whether continuous physiological variables predict network detectability above and beyond categorical external variables (anesthetic dose, session, time) in C57Bl/7 and C3HeB/FeJ mice anesthetized with isoflurane-dexmedetomidine. Standard physiological metrics (respiration rate and heart rate) did not predict network detectability above and beyond anesthetic dose but instead depended strongly on strain and subject, thus we advise against tuning anesthesia based on respiration or heart rate when the goal is obtaining clear resting-state networks. The most important predictor of improved network detectability was a low isoflurane dose of 0.23%, hence we recommend that researchers prioritize piloting the minimal possible isoflurane dose for their mouse model. In summary, our work examines the contributions from sources of variability that impact rs-fMRI data quality and synthesizes the findings into practical guidelines to help experimenters adapt their acquisition protocols and improve data quality.

">Multiscale analysis of myelin alterations in skin biopsies from synucleinopathies.</a></h4>

              
                Loss of myelin and demyelination play a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the ultrastructure of the myelin-axon unit in the peripheral nervous system of subjects diseased with synucleinopathies. We here present an analysis of the myelin ultrastructure and the myelin protein abundance that characterize myelinated axons of nerve fiber bundles in cervical skin biopsies of 45 pathologically confirmed PD, DLB, MSA and non-neurological control donors. We calculated a myelin damage score and classified over 1100 myelin sheaths by looking at myelin fragmentation and swellings with correlative light and electron microscopy. We found a higher load of myelin damage in the PD compared to MSA and control groups. Quantification with ELISA did not reveal any differences in myelin protein zero (MPZ) concentrations in skin tissue homogenates between synucleinopathies. The observed structural abnormalities in the myelin sheaths may help to discriminate among subjects with synucleinopathies and control subjects and to understand the involvement of the peripheral innervation in the diseases. Our multiscale analysis of peripheral nerves highlights their potential as future biomarkers for the detection and differentiation of synuclein diseases.

">Dual cholinergic and serotonergic excitatory pathways mediate oxygen sensing in the zebrafish gill</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of oxygen sensing included a transition from a diffuse distribution of respiratory chemoreceptors in the gills of water-breathing vertebrates to chemoreceptor clusters confined to the pulmonary epithelium and carotid body in air-breathers. Since the excitatory neurotransmitters mediating oxygen sensing in anamniotes have never been confirmed, the origins of oxygen sensing in vertebrates have remained controversial. In gills isolated from Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) zebrafish expressing a genetically-encoded reporter of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), we demonstrate that acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in postsynaptic sensory neurons innervating oxygen-chemoreceptive neuroepithelial cells (NECs). Hypoxic stimulation of NECs evoked a similar rise in neuronal [Ca2+]i that was abolished by nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium. Using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR, we identified a novel population of ACh-containing NECs associated with sensory neurons expressing the a2 subunit of nicotinic ACh receptors. In vivo whole-larva Ca2+ imaging showed that cholinergic and hypoxic activation of the gills generated Ca2+ activity in neurons of vagal sensory ganglia with time-dependent characteristics of neurotransmission towards the hindbrain. We identified a second source of hypoxic activity in vagal sensory ganglia operating exclusively through 5-HT3 receptors and dependent upon vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT2) in the gill. We traced expression of 5-HT3 receptors to nerve terminals surrounding a separate population of serotonergic VMAT2-positive NECs. Our investigation reveals independent cholinergic and serotonergic autonomic pathways of oxygen sensing in zebrafish and provides the first physiological evidence that gill chemoreceptors may be homologues of both pulmonary and carotid body chemoreceptors in mammals.

">Dynamic fusion of structural and functional connectivity via joint connectivity matrix ICA</a></h4>

              
                The integration of multimodal MRI images, including functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), depicts a key advancement in neuroimaging, since it offers a more comprehensive and better understanding of brain function and connections. FMRI captures brain functional activity while dMRI reveals structural connectivity via white matter bundles, each of which provide unique yet complementary insights; however combing these two modalities, particularly at a dynamic level, is challenging due to their drastically different data characteristics. This study introduces a novel framework named "dynamic fusion," which extends joint component analysis (cmICA) to integrate static structural connectivity (SC) with dynamic functional connectivity (FC). Our approach gauges the relationship between these joint components across various temporal states, aiming to discover both static and dynamic features of brain connectivity. We applied this approach to fMRI and dMRI data from the same set of control subjects, which we had previously studied to estimate joint parcellation and their structural and functional connections using a static model only, and also included a comparable number of individuals with schizophrenia from the same study. Our results reveal that dynamic fusion not only highlights diverse temporal dynamics in FC but, more importantly, also shows how SC patterns differ across dynamic functional states at different time frames, providing new insights into brain organization. Furthermore, it successfully detects joint structural-functional connectivity differences between individuals with schizophrenia and controls, demonstrating its potential for detecting hidden group differences. Overall, this study establishes our dynamic fusion as a powerful tool for integrating structural and dynamic functional connectivity data, enhancing our understanding of brain connectivity and offering new perspectives for studying neurological disorders.

">Higher-level spatial prediction in natural vision across mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Theories of predictive processing propose that sensory systems constantly predict incoming signals, based on spatial and temporal context. However, evidence for prediction in sensory cortex largely comes from artificial experiments using simple, highly predictable stimuli, that arguably encourage prediction. Here, we test for sensory prediction during natural scene perception. Specifically, we use deep generative modelling to quantify the spatial predictability of receptive field (RF) patches in natural images, and compared those predictability estimates to brain responses in the mouse visual cortex - while rigorously accounting for established tuning to a rich set of low-level image features and their local statistical context - in a large scale survey of high-density recordings from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory. This revealed four insights. First, cortical responses across the mouse visual system are shaped by sensory predictability, with more predictable image patches evoking weaker responses. Secondly, visual cortical neurons are primarily sensitive to the predictability of higher-level image features, even in neurons in the primary visual areas that are preferentially tuned to low-level visual features. Third, unpredictability sensitivity is stronger in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex, in line with predictive coding models. Finally, these spatial prediction effects are independent of recent experience, suggesting that they rely on long-term priors about the structure of the visual world. Together, these results suggest visual cortex might predominantly predict sensory information at higher levels of abstraction - a pattern bearing striking similarities to recent, successful techniques from artificial intelligence for predictive self-supervised learning.

">Medial olivocochlear efferent modulation of cochlear micromechanics requires P2X4 expression in outer hair cells</a></h4>

              
                The role of P2X4, one of the most abundant ionotropic purinergic receptors in the central nervous system, is explored here in the context of auditory function. We observed, by using constitutive and conditional P2X4mCherryIN knock-in adult mouse models, a specific high expression of mCherry-tagged P2X4 in living cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), from immature postnatal stages to adulthood. This P2X4-mCherry expression, confirmed by immuno-confocal fluorescence microscopy in wild-type mice, was mainly concentrated in the intracellular apical region of the OHCs, in the area of the Hensen's body, a lysosomal rich region, specifically labeled with the fluorescent dye lysotracker. In addition, the basal cholinergic efferent synaptic region of the OHCs was found to express P2X4 at the cell membrane. Surprisingly, the assessment of the hearing function in constitutive P2X4 knock-out (P2X4KO) mice showed improved auditory brainstem responses with smaller latencies, larger amplitudes and smaller thresholds. These P2X4KO mice, as well as conditional P2X4KO-Myo15-Cre mice, displayed enhanced distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), suggesting an improved electromechanical amplification activity by OHCs. These mutant animals showed reduced inhibition of DPOAEs by contralateral noise, consistent with a weaker inhibitory effect of the medial cholinergic olivocochlear efferent circuit (MOC) on OHCs. We concluded that the MOC negative feedback modulation of cochlear micromechanics, in addition to involve Ca2+ permeable alpha9/alpha0 nicotinic receptors, also requires the activation of postsynaptic P2X4 receptors in OHCs.

">Amyloid-beta deposition and reduced drainage at the cribriform plate lymphatics in APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, leading to substantial personal, economic, and medical costs to patients and society; it is characterized by the build-up of toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau. It is crucial to the health of the brain that these proteins are processed or drained effectively, but mounting research has shown that in AD pathology there is dysfunction in the ability of the brain to effectively clear pathological A{beta} and tau. In this report, we detail the involvement of one important brain drainage pathway and potential site of A{beta} clearance, the cribriform plate lymphatics, in 24-month old APP/PS1 mice. We show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) efflux is decreased across the cribriform plate area utilizing multiple methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that A{beta} aggregates at the cribriform plate -- coating surface of olfactory bulbs (OB), olfactory nerve (ON) bundles, and cribriform plate lymphatic endothelial cells (cpLECs). At 24-months, APP/PS1 mice have increased CD45+ cell infiltration and decreased LYVE-1+ vessel area at the cribriform plate, suggesting local inflammation and lymphatic atrophy. Additionally, cpLECs have higher expression of caspase-3 suggesting the decreased LYVE-1 area is due to cellular toxicity resulting in apoptosis. This study demonstrates that the cribriform plate is an important area for further research elucidating its contribution to AD disease pathogenesis.

">Whole-brain chemosensory responses of both C. elegans sexes</a></h4>

              
                Sexually-dimorphic neural circuits play a critical role in shaping sex-specific animal behaviors. Maps of the structural dimorphisms in these circuits have been explored by analyzing synaptic connectomes, electron micrograph reconstructions of synaptic connectivity. Nevertheless, recent studies in the model organism C. elegans have shown little to no correlation between the synaptic connectome and dynamic neural activity. Therefore, the extent of sexual dimorphism in functional neural activity remains unknown. To determine the extent of functional sexual-dimorphisms in C. elegans we compared activity, neuron-by-neuron, across all neurons in the heads of both sexes. To sample a broad view of responses to different sensory modalities, we tested a diverse panel of ethologically-relevant olfactory, gustatory, and chemical stimuli, representing both attractive and aversive cues. We found that nearly every sensory neuron responded dimorphically to at least one cue and monomorphically to other cues, indicating that sexually-dimorphic circuits are pervasive and stimulus dependent. This dimorphic and monomorphic activity was present to a lesser extent in downstream interneurons and even less so in motoneurons, implicating sensory neurons as the primary source and location of sexually-dimorphic activity. Comparing the functional activity we measured to the published synaptic connectomes of both sexes revealed that sexual dimorphism in functional connectivity was distinct from and complementary to sexual dimorphism in synaptic connectivity. Our results provide a first-of-its-kind comparison of whole-brain dynamics between sexes at the level of single neurons, serving as an extensive resource for further investigations of functional sex differences.

">Personalized whole-brain models of seizure propagation</a></h4>

              
                Computational modeling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to better understand seizure dynamics and guide new treatment strategies. This work presents a method for personalizing whole-brain computational models in epilepsy, integrating SEEG, MRI, and diffusion MRI data to enhance therapeutic approaches. The objective of this method is to construct a mechanistic model replicating seizure propagation from the epileptogenic network to the entire brain, which can then be used to simulate and evaluate patient-specific therapeutic interventions. The pipeline uses neural mass models for each node in the network, simulating whole-brain dynamics. Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, highlighting the potential of whole-brain modeling to guide individualized treatment by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets.
