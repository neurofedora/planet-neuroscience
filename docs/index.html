">Population-level age effects on the white matter structure subserving cognitive flexibility in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility, a cognition crucial for adaptive behavior, involves multi-scale functioning across several neuronal organization levels. While the neural underpinnings of flexibility have been studied for decades, limited knowledge exist about the structure and differentiation of the white matter subserving brain regions implicated in cognitive flexibility. Neural changes that occur over the lifespan have an impact in the brain white matter organization and, thereby, may alter cognitive flexibility abilities. This study investigates the population-level relationship between cognitive flexibility and macromolecular properties of white matter across two periods of adulthood, aiming to discern how these associations vary over different life stages and brain tracts. A novel method to study age-effects in the brain structure-function associations is proposed. First, the white matter structure implicated in cognitive flexibility was delineated by tracing in the Human Connectome Project tractography template the pathways subserving neural regions derived via meta-analysis of set-shifting. Then, a cohort analysis was performed to characterize related brain features using a subset of the UKBiobank MRI data which has a companion functional/behavioral dataset.1 We found that (1) the wiring of cognitive flexibility is defined by specialized tracts, which present undifferentiated features early in adulthood, and significantly differentiated types in later life. (2) These MRI-derived properties are correlated with individual subprocesses of cognition which intimately relate to the latent construct of cognitive flexibility function (switch, inhibition, and updating).2 (3)In late life, myelin-related homogeneity of specific white matter tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility declines as a function of chronological age, a phenomenon not observed in early life. Our findings support the age-related differentiation of white matter tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility as a natural substrate of brain adaptive function.

">Switching on Behavioral and Neural Rhythmicity to Retrieve Memories When the Number of Retained Items Exceeds Four</a></h4>

              
                Even when we experience difficulty in recalling memories, we nevertheless manage to retrieve the target items. However, the neural mechanisms that enable such difficult memory retrieval are unknown. Here, we report an intriguing phenomenon where our nervous system "switches on" behavioral/neural rhythmicity to retrieve memory when the number of candidate items exceeds four. In our experiments, participants learned and retrieved 2-5 color/letter pairs. Analyses of hundreds of reaction times revealed a significant tendency for memory recall to occur at discrete times corresponding to theta-alpha (4-13 Hz) cycles, but only when the number of memorized pairs exceeded four. Electrophysiological data localized theta-alpha rhythmicity around parietal electrodes, a region associated with the long-term memory system. Our findings suggest that neural rhythmicity facilitates memory retrieval when the number of candidate items exceeds four, which is known as the "magical number" corresponding to the limit of human cognitive capacity.

">Noradrenaline causes a spread of association in the hippocampal cognitive map</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain stores relationships between items and events in the world as cognitive maps in the hippocampal system. However, the neural mechanisms that control cognitive map formation remain unclear. Here, using a double-blind study design with a pharmacological intervention in humans, we show that the neuromodulator noradrenaline elicits a significant 'spread of association' across the hippocampal cognitive map. This neural spread of association predicts overgeneralisation errors measured in behaviour, and is predicted by physiological markers for noradrenergic arousal, namely an increase in the pupil dilation response and reduced cortical GABAergic tone. Thus, noradrenaline sets the width of the 'smoothing kernel' for plasticity across the cognitive map. Elevated noradrenaline can allow disparate memories to become linked, introducing potential for distortions in the cognitive map that deviate from direct experience.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the <i>C9orf72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A large body of evidence implicates dipeptide repeats (DPRs) proteins as one of the main drivers of neuronal injury in cell and animal models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pure repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD was generated. Embryonic and adult transgenic zebrafish lysates were investigated for the presence of RAN-translated DPR species and adult-onset motor deficits. Using C9orf72 cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish, hypothermic-therapeutic temperature management (TTM) was explored as a potential therapeutic option for C9orf72-ALS/FTD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we describe a pure RAN translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD that exhibits significant RAN-translated DPR pathology and progressive motor decline. We further demonstrate that hypothermic-TTM results in a profound reduction in DPR species in C9orf72-ALS/FTD cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The transgenic model detailed in this paper provides a medium throughput in vivo research tool to further investigate the role of RAN-translation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD and further understand the mechanisms that underpin neuroprotective strategies. Hypothermic-TTM presents a viable therapeutic avenue to explore in the context of C9orf72-ALS/FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27072?af=R">Fetal Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage Imaging Patterns, Etiology, and Outcomes: A Single Center Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study examines associations among fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) injury patterns, etiologies, and outcomes in fetal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of IPH diagnosed on fetal MRI (1996–2022). IPH and associated abnormalities were categorized by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists; electronic medical records were reviewed by 2 pediatric neurologists to classify etiology and outcomes including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, developmental delay, and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-four fetuses with IPH were identified (34 singleton and 10 twin gestations) with MRI at median 24 weeks gestation (interquartile range [IQR] = 22–28 weeks). IPH was commonly supratentorial (84%) and focal (50%) or focal with diffuse injury (43%) and was often associated with germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH; 75%) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 52%). An etiology was identified in 75%, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS, n = 10), COL4A1/2 variants (n = 8), or other fetal/maternal conditions (n = 15). COL4A1/2 variants were associated with focal IPH and the presence of hemorrhagic porencephaly, and intrauterine transfusion was associated with infratentorial hemorrhage. Twenty-two fetuses were liveborn, and 18 pregnancies were terminated. Among those with follow-up ≥ 12 months (median = 7 years), 12 of 13 had cerebral palsy, 6 of 13 had developmental delay, and 5 of 13 had epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>An etiology for fetal IPH with or without GMH-IVH is identified in most cases in our cohort and is commonly TTTS, COL4A1/2 variants, or other maternal/fetal comorbidities. Pattern of fetal IPH on MRI is associated with etiology. Cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment were common in liveborn infants. Genetic studies should be considered in cases of fetal IPH without an otherwise apparent cause. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.

">Deficiency in transmitter release triggers homeostatic transcriptional changes that increase presynaptic excitability</a></h4>

              
                Weakening of synaptic transmission at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction triggers two forms of homeostatic compensation, one that increases the probability of glutamate release per action potential (Pr) and another that increases motoneuron (MN) activity. We investigated the molecular changes in MNs that underlie the increase in MN activity. RNA-seq analysis on MNs whose glutamate release is weakened by knockdown of components of the MN transmitter release machinery reveals a reduction in expression of a group of genes that encode potassium channels and their positive modulators. These results identify a mechanism of compensation for weakened synaptic transmission by MNs, which engages a transcriptional program in those cells to increase firing and, thereby, ensure sufficient locomotory drive.

">MorphoCellSorter: An Andrews plot-based sorting approach to rank microglia according to their morphological features</a></h4>

              
                Microglia exhibit diverse morphologies reflecting environmental conditions, maturity or functional states. Thus, morphological characterization provides important information to understand microglial roles and functions. Most recent morphological analysis relies on classifying cells based on morphological parameters. However, this classification is not always biologically relevant, as microglial morphologies constitute a continuum rather than segregated groups. Instead, we propose a new open-source tool, MorphoCellSorter, which assesses microglial morphology by automatically computing morphological criteria, using principal component analysis and Andrews plots to rank cells. MorphoCellSorter accurately ranked cells from various microglia datasets in mice and rats of different age, from in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models, that were acquired using diverse imaging techniques. This approach allowed for the discrimination of cell populations in various pathophysiological conditions. Finally, MorphoCellSorter offers a versatile, easy and ready-to-use method to evaluate microglial morphological diversity that could easily be generalized to standardize practices across laboratories.

	<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer simulations, and virtual reality (VR) are increasingly becoming accessible tools that can be leveraged to implement training protocols and educational resources. Typical assessment tools related to sensory and neural processing associated with task performance in virtual environments often rely on self-reported surveys, unlike electroencephalography (EEG), which is often used to compare the effects of different types of sensory feedback (e.g., auditory, visual, and haptic) in simulation environments in an objective manner. However, it can be challenging to know which aspects of the EEG signal represent the impact of different types of sensory feedback on neural processing. Machine learning approaches offer a promising direction for identifying EEG signal features that differentiate the impact of different types of sensory feedback during simulation training. For the current study, machine learning techniques were applied to differentiate neural circuitry associated with haptic and non-haptic feedback in a simulated drilling task. Nine EEG channels were selected and analyzed, extracting different time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features, where 360 features were tested (40 features per channel). A feature selection stage identified the most relevant features, including the Hurst exponent of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz, kurtosis of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, power spectral density of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, variance of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, and spectral entropy of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz. Using those five features, trials with haptic feedback were correctly identified from those without haptic feedback with an accuracy exceeding 90%, increasing to 99% when using 10 features. These results show promise for the future application of machine learning approaches to predict the impact of haptic feedback on neural processing during VR protocols involving drilling tasks, which can inform future applications of VR and simulation for occupational skill acquisition.</p>

	<p>During the period in which children learn to read and write, a gradual shift from right to left hemisphere dominance for language is typically seen. However, in children with dyslexia, a deviant pattern is described in the literature. As part of a larger longitudinal study (The Bergen Longitudinal Dyslexia Study), the present study aimed to assess this development from an early age before children learn to read and write. Dichotic listening (DL), which is a non-invasive test, was used to assess the development of brain laterality in a Typical group and a Dyslexia group. The participants received yearly sessions of evidence-based literacy training at ages 5 to 7. The Typical group showed increasing ear scores and a shift from no ear advantage in the Pre-literacy stage (age 6), indicative of no hemisphere dominance, to a right ear advantage, indicative of a left hemisphere dominance, in the Emergent literacy stage (age 8) and the Literacy stage (age 11). The Dyslexia group showed a different pattern, with a significant right ear advantage at age 6, indicative of a right hemisphere dominance, and increasing ear scores at ages 8 and 11; however, no ear dominance was observed in the Literacy stage. The results point to an effect of relevant, evidence-based training affecting both right and left hemispheres in dyslexia, which should form a basis for further research.</p>

	<p>Background: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is associated with seizures. We examined the impact of repeated seizures on the behavioral and molecular changes in male Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Methods: Seizures were induced by administering three flurothyl seizures per day across postnatal days (PD) 7&amp;amp;ndash;11, for a total of 15 seizures. In adulthood, mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tasks to assess long-term behavioral deficits. Results: The two-hit impact of a Fmr1 knockout and seizures resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test and a longer latency to their first nose poke (repetitive behavior). Seizures resulted in decreased activity, decreased repetitive behavior (grooming and rearings), and decreased social behavior, while they also increased habituation to auditory stimuli and increased freezing in delayed fear conditioning in both KO and control mice. KO mice displayed increased repetitive behavior in the open field task (clockwise revolutions) and repeated nose pokes, and decreased anxiety in the open field test. No differences in mTOR signaling were found. Conclusions: These findings further illuminate the long-term effects of synergistic impact of two hits on the developing brain.</p>

	<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been suggested as a possible treatment method for cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (pwAD), similar to multidomain cognitive training (CT). The effectiveness, however, of combining these techniques for pwAD remains controversial due to the variability in rTMS parameters, differences in CT protocol designs&amp;amp;mdash;many of which neglect the language domain&amp;amp;mdash;and the inclusion of patients at various stages of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) and with different types of dementia. The current review aims to evaluate the cognitive benefits of combining rTMS with CT, including language training, for individuals with mild to moderate AD. An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library with relevant terms, resulting in nine studies with a total of 290 participants [190 in the Active Group (AG) and 100 in the Control Group (CG)]. The comprehensive review of the articles revealed that the combined treatment improved global cognitive function, as well as neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, and quality of life in the AG. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously, given the relatively small number of existing studies on this specific combination.</p>

	<p>Anhedonia constitutes a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) mediating the ultimate goal of MDD treatment: functional remission. Anhedonia is also present in other clinical populations, including patients with chronic pain. Recent data links anhedonia to insulin resistance (IR). Some researchers have underlined a different dimension of anhedonia as a temperament/personality trait. The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to explore the links between anhedonia (main outcome) and (1) IR, (2) temperamental, personality, and schizotypy traits (exposures). The study population included patients with MDD, fibromyalgia, and healthy controls. Participants were split into groups: (1) insulin resistant (IR[+] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;ge; 2.1) and (2) insulin sensitive (IR[&amp;amp;minus;] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;lt; 2.1). Anhedonia was significantly higher in the IR[+] group than the IR[&amp;amp;minus;] group. IR was a predictor of higher anhedonia levels. IR[+] vs. IR[&amp;amp;minus;] participants showed higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of hyperthymic affective temperaments, as well as conscientiousness and emotional stability personality traits. Depressive, irritable, and anxious temperaments, cognitive disorganization, and introvertive anhedonia positively predicted anhedonia, while hyperthymic temperament, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability traits negatively predicted anhedonia. IR partially mediated the relationship between depressive temperament and anhedonia. In sum, IR, affective temperaments, and personality traits are predictors of anhedonia.</p>

                <p>Episodic memory, the ability to recall specific events and experiences, is a cornerstone of human cognition with profound clinical implications. While animal studies have provided valuable insights into the neuronal underpinnings of episodic memory, research has largely relied on a limited subset of tasks that model only some aspects of episodic memory. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of rodent episodic-like memory tasks that expand the methodological repertoire and diversify the approaches used in episodic-like memory research. These tasks assess various aspects of human episodic memory, such as integrated <I>what&ndash;where&ndash;when</I> or <I>what&ndash;where memory</I>, source memory, free recall, temporal binding, and threshold retrieval dynamics. We review each task&rsquo;s general principle and consider whether alternative non-episodic mechanisms can account for the observed behavior. While our list of tasks is not exhaustive, we hope it will guide researchers in selecting models that align with their specific research objectives, leading to novel advancements and a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying specific aspects of episodic memory.</p>

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The main purpose of this study was to explore experiences of women who survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital, 2021. Design: An institution-based exploratory qualitative study with a descriptive phenomenological study design Setting: The present study was conducted in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital from March 03 to May 18, 2021. Participants: A total of 17 individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with women who experienced and survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis using Atlas-ti software. Result: The present study revealed that women’s level of awareness on raised blood pressure and or convulsion occurring during pregnancy was poor. Barriers that limit pregnant women from getting treatment at the earliest point included misconception, lack of insight, failure to accept counseling from health care providers, low income, and influence from husbands. Discussions with the women in this study showed that these mothers were not counseled on danger signs during antenatal care check-ups. Almost all of the women were very concerned and frustrated due to their diagnosis. Conclusions: Women’s awareness of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia was poor and antenatal care was not offered as per expected quality. Improving awareness of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and enhancing the quality of antenatal care is essential.

                Background This study delved into the experiences and approaches employed by junior teachers in facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences during the teaching and learning process. In South Africa, Grade 7 marks the final year of primary school education, with learners typically aged between 11 to 13. The researchers noted significant challenges faced by junior Grade 7 teachers in preparing, organizing, and carrying out practical work within the context of teaching and learning in Natural Sciences. Methods In the present study, a qualitative multiple-case study design was employed. Three grade 7 Natural Sciences junior-level teachers were purposefully selected as participants. Data was gathered through classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis. Results The study findings revealed that certain grade 7 junior Natural Sciences teachers found it challenging to manage practical work during teaching and learning. Some teachers also faced difficulties in maintaining discipline during practical work and demonstrations, both inside and outside the classroom. To cope with the demands of facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences teaching and learning, teachers employed various approaches, such as group work, observations, demonstrations, illustrations, projects, and inquiry-based scientific investigations. Conclusion It is recommended that teachers should receive professional training on effectively facilitating practical work to support the new teaching and learning methods outlined in the Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement. They should also be equipped with pedagogical content knowledge to help them achieve the goals of practical work in teaching and learning Natural Sciences.

                Background Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) encompass a heterogenous group of auto-immune diseases. The identification of myositis specific antibodies (MSA) and their associations with distinct phenotypes has improved the categorization of these conditions. Objective The aim of this study was to describe and report the clinical and immunological characteristics of IIM among Tunisian patients. Method A retrospective study conducted in the internal medicine department at the Rabta University Hospital Center over 22 years, including adult patients with IIM according to the American college of rheumatology/European league against rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria and Connors’ criteria for anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS). Inclusion body myositis and myositis associated with other conditions were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and immunological characteristics were analyzed and compared. Results Ninety-seven patients were included (Male/female ratio= 0.36, mean age = 48.4 +- 13.8 years). Muscular involvement was present in 88% of patients, affecting locomotor muscles (88%), gastrointestinal (43%), laryngeal (10%), cardiac (8%), and respiratory (1%) systems. Muscle weakness was primarily noted in the pelvic girdle (81%), scapular region (74%), axial muscles (20%), and distal muscles (5%). Myolysis was observed in 77% of patients, and histological evidence of myositis in 73%. Diffuse interstitial pneumonia (DIP) was present in 45% of patients, cutaneous involvement in 85%, and articular involvement in 48%. MSAs were detected in 52% of patients. Analysis revealed significantly higher frequencies of amyopathic forms, DIP, palmar hyperkeratosis, and articular involvement in the ASS group. The DM group exhibited higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash, photosensitive rashes, ulcerations, and skin necrosis. The NAM group had higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, myolysis, and lower frequencies of DIP and cutaneous involvement. Conclusion Our findings corroborate previously established clinico-immunological associations reported in the literature underscoring the need for a combined clinico-serological approach in classifying IIM.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O’Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.

                <p>by Tao Wang, Linlin Zhuo, Yifan Chen, Xiangzheng Fu, Xiangxiang Zeng, Quan Zou</p>

The identification of cancer driver genes (CDGs) poses challenges due to the intricate interdependencies among genes and the influence of measurement errors and noise. We propose a novel energy-constrained diffusion (ECD)-based model for identifying CDGs, termed ECD-CDGI. This model is the first to design an ECD-Attention encoder by combining the ECD technique with an attention mechanism. ECD-Attention encoder excels at generating robust gene representations that reveal the complex interdependencies among genes while reducing the impact of data noise. We concatenate topological embedding extracted from gene-gene networks through graph transformers to these gene representations. We conduct extensive experiments across three testing scenarios. Extensive experiments show that the ECD-CDGI model possesses the ability to not only be proficient in identifying known CDGs but also efficiently uncover unknown potential CDGs. Furthermore, compared to the GNN-based approach, the ECD-CDGI model exhibits fewer constraints by existing gene-gene networks, thereby enhancing its capability to identify CDGs. Additionally, ECD-CDGI is open-source and freely available. We have also launched the model as a complimentary online tool specifically crafted to expedite research efforts focused on CDGs identification.

                <p>by Daniel Seeler, Nastasja Grdseloff, Claudia Jasmin Rödel, Charlotte Kloft, Salim Abdelilah-Seyfried, Wilhelm Huisinga</p>

Endothelial cells, which line the lumen of blood vessels, locally sense and respond to blood flow. In response to altered blood flow dynamics during early embryonic development, these cells undergo shape changes that directly affect vessel geometry: In the dorsal aorta of zebrafish embryos, elongation of endothelial cells in the direction of flow between 48 and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) reduces the vessel’s diameter. This remodeling process requires Endoglin; excessive endothelial cell growth in the protein’s absence results in vessel diameter increases. To understand how these changes in vessel geometry emerge from morphological changes of individual endothelial cells, we developed a novel mathematical approach that allows 3D reconstruction and quantification of both dorsal aorta geometry and endothelial cell surface morphology. Based on fluorescently marked endothelial cell contours, we inferred cross-sections of the dorsal aorta that accounted for dorsal flattening of the vessel. By projection of endothelial cell contours onto the estimated cross-sections and subsequent triangulation, we finally reconstructed 3D surfaces of the individual cells. By simultaneously reconstructing vessel cross-sections and cell surfaces, we found in an exploratory analysis that morphology varied between endothelial cells located in different sectors of the dorsal aorta in both wild-type and Endoglin-deficient zebrafish embryos: In wild-types, ventral endothelial cells were smaller and more elongated in flow direction than dorsal endothelial cells at both 48 hpf and 72 hpf. Although dorsal and ventral endothelial cells in Endoglin-deficient embryos had similar sizes at 48 hpf, dorsal endothelial cells were much larger at 72 hpf. In Endoglin-deficient embryos, elongation in flow direction increased between 48 hpf and 72 hpf in ventral endothelial cells but hardly changed in dorsal endothelial cells. Hereby, we provide evidence that dorsal endothelial cells contribute most to the disparate changes in dorsal aorta diameter in wild-type and Endoglin-deficient embryos between 48 hpf and 72 hpf.

Methods To evaluate genetic studies of the chosen materials, the use of a net house assay upon sap inoculation made it easier to determine the trend of the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) in a controlled environment. Younger leaves from these plants were gathered and used for molecular analysis. Results Six genotypes were identified with semi-resistant disease reactions. Yellow mosaic virus-resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes were distinguished using a soybean “Rsv1-h” gene-based primer pair. To discover the existence of the Rsv-1-h gene responsible for YMV resistance, a genetic diversity panel of 15 soybean genotypes was investigated with two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The BARCSOYSSR_13_1115 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1173 primer sets were employed to validate the desired genes in these genotypes. Conclusion The genotypes HIHS-WIHS, MINA-HAI, Shohag, G-2120, BRAGG, and BS-3 presented the major gene Rsv1-h, which is said to be essential for yellow mosaic virus resistance and can provide better yield also than other genotypes. The six soybean genotypes with the Rsv1-h gene may be resistant to mosaic virus and could be exploited as a source of improved breeding material in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-981/v1?src=rss">Deep learning neural network development for the classification of bacteriocin sequences produced by lactic acid bacteria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a pressing need for exploring new natural compounds with innovative mechanisms to replace existing antibiotics. Bacteriocins offer promising alternatives for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies in livestock, aquaculture, and human health. Specifically, those produced by LAB are recognized as GRAS and QPS. Methods In this study was used a deep learning neural network for binary classification of bacteriocin amino acid sequences, distinguishing those produced by LAB. The features were extracted using the k-mer method and vector embedding. Ten different groups were tested, combining embedding vectors and k-mers: EV, ‘EV+3-mers’, ‘EV+5-mers’, ‘EV+7-mers’, ‘EV+15-mers’, ‘EV+20-mers’, ‘EV+3-mers+5-mers’, ‘EV+3-mers+7-mers’, ‘EV+5-mers+7-mers’, and ‘EV+15-mers+20-mers’. Results Five sets of 100 characteristic k-mers unique to bacteriocins produced by LAB were obtained for values of k = 3, 5, 7, 15, and 20. Significant difference was observed between using only and concatenation. Specially, ‘5-mers+7-mers+EV ’ group showed superior accuracy and loss results. Employing k-fold cross-validation with k=30, the average results for loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were 9.90%, 90.14%, 90.30%, 90.10%, and 90.10% respectively. Folder 22 stood out with 8.50% loss, 91.47% accuracy, and 91.00% precision, recall, and F1 score. Conclusions The model developed in this study achieved consistent results with those seen in the reviewed literature. It outperformed some studies by 3-10%. The lists of characteristic k-mers pave the way to identify new bacteriocins that could be valuable for therapeutic and preventive strategies within the livestock, aquaculture industries, and potentially in human health.

                Qiao et al. investigate the rescue of mito-dysfunction from fibroblasts to adenoid cystic carcinoma by tunneling-nanotube-mediated mitochondrial transfer and permanent cell fusion. Besides rescue, cell fusion promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and exacerbates cancer cell malignancy. Both rescue processes are “selectively” driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and TMEM16F-mediated phosphatidylserine externalization, unveiling potential therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97908">Adverse impact of female reproductive signaling on age-dependent neurodegeneration after mild head trauma in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Environmental insults, including mild head trauma, significantly increase the risk of neurodegeneration. However, it remains challenging to establish a causative connection between early-life exposure to mild head trauma and late-life emergence of neurodegenerative deficits, nor do we know how sex and age compound the outcome. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> model, we demonstrate that exposure to mild head trauma causes neurodegenerative conditions that emerge late in life and disproportionately affect females. Increasing age-at-injury further exacerbates this effect in a sexually dimorphic manner. We further identify sex peptide signaling as a key factor in female susceptibility to post-injury brain deficits. RNA sequencing highlights a reduction in innate immune defense transcripts specifically in mated females during late life. Our findings establish a causal relationship between early head trauma and late-life neurodegeneration, emphasizing sex differences in injury response and the impact of age-at-injury. Finally, our findings reveal that reproductive signaling adversely impacts female response to mild head insults and elevates vulnerability to late-life neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94698">Defining cell type-specific immune responses in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis by single-cell transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a prevalent inflammatory skin disease, is elicited upon repeated skin contact with protein-reactive chemicals through a complex and poorly characterized cellular network between immune cells and skin resident cells. Here, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the murine hapten-elicited model of ACD reveals that upon elicitation of ACD, infiltrated CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were primarily the IFNγ-producing type 1 central memory phenotype. In contrast, type 2 cytokines (IL4 and IL13) were dominantly expressed by basophils, IL17A was primarily expressed by δγ T cells, and IL1β was identified as the primary cytokine expressed by activated neutrophils/monocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, analysis of skin resident cells identified a sub-cluster of dermal fibroblasts with preadipocyte signature as a prominent target for IFNγ<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and dermal source for key T cell chemokines CXCL9/10. IFNγ treatment shifted dermal fibroblasts from collagen-producing to CXCL9/10-producing, which promoted T cell polarization toward the type-1 phenotype through a CXCR3-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, targeted deletion of <i>Ifngr1</i> in dermal fibroblasts in mice reduced <i>Cxcl9/10</i> expression, dermal infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell, and alleviated ACD inflammation in mice. Finally, we showed that IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CXCL10-producing dermal fibroblasts co-enriched in the dermis of human ACD skin. Together, our results define the cell type-specific immune responses in ACD, and recognize an indispensable role of dermal fibroblasts in shaping the development of type-1 skin inflammation through the IFNGR-CXCR3 signaling circuit during ACD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85742">Quantitative modeling of the emergence of macroscopic grid-like representations</a></h4>

              
                When subjects navigate through spatial environments, grid cells exhibit firing fields that are arranged in a triangular grid pattern. Direct recordings of grid cells from the human brain are rare. Hence, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies proposed an indirect measure of entorhinal grid-cell activity, quantified as hexadirectional modulation of fMRI activity as a function of the subject’s movement direction. However, it remains unclear how the activity of a population of grid cells may exhibit hexadirectional modulation. Here, we use numerical simulations and analytical calculations to suggest that this hexadirectional modulation is best explained by head-direction tuning aligned to the grid axes, whereas it is not clearly supported by a bias of grid cells toward a particular phase offset. Firing-rate adaptation can result in hexadirectional modulation, but the available cellular data is insufficient to clearly support or refute this option. The magnitude of hexadirectional modulation furthermore depends considerably on the subject’s navigation pattern, indicating that future fMRI studies could be designed to test which hypothesis most likely accounts for the fMRI measure of grid cells. Our findings also underline the importance of quantifying the properties of human grid cells to further elucidate how hexadirectional modulations of fMRI activity may emerge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96992">Inhibition of ULK1/2 and KRASG12C controls tumor growth in preclinical models of lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                Mutational activation of <i>KRAS</i> occurs commonly in lung carcinogenesis and, with the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of covalent inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> such as sotorasib or adagrasib, KRAS oncoproteins are important pharmacological targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLCs respond to these inhibitors, and the emergence of drug resistance in those patients who do respond can be rapid and pleiotropic. Hence, based on a backbone of covalent inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, efforts are underway to develop effective combination therapies. Here, we report that the inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> signaling increases autophagy in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-expressing lung cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of DCC-3116, a selective ULK1/2 inhibitor, plus sotorasib displays cooperative/synergistic suppression of human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and superior tumor control in vivo. Additionally, in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLC, inhibition of either KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> or ULK1/2 decreases tumor burden and increases mouse survival. Consequently, these data suggest that ULK1/2-mediated autophagy is a pharmacologically actionable cytoprotective stress response to inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> in lung cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061">MDverse, shedding light on the dark matter of molecular dynamics simulations</a></h4>

              
                The rise of open science and the absence of a global dedicated data repository for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has led to the accumulation of MD files in generalist data repositories, constituting the <i>dark matter of MD</i> — data that is technically accessible, but neither indexed, curated, or easily searchable. Leveraging an original search strategy, we found and indexed about 250,000 files and 2000 datasets from Zenodo, Figshare and Open Science Framework. With a focus on files produced by the Gromacs MD software, we illustrate the potential offered by the mining of publicly available MD data. We identified systems with specific molecular composition and were able to characterize essential parameters of MD simulation such as temperature and simulation length, and could identify model resolution, such as all-atom and coarse-grain. Based on this analysis, we inferred metadata to propose a search engine prototype to explore the MD data. To continue in this direction, we call on the community to pursue the effort of sharing MD data, and to report and standardize metadata to reuse this valuable matter.

">Creating anatomically-derived, standardized, customizable, and three-dimensional printable head caps for functional neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Consistent and accurate probe placement is a crucial step towards enhancing the reproducibility of longitudinal and group-based functional neuroimaging studies. While the selection of head gear is central to these efforts, there does not currently exist a standardized design that can accommodate diverse probe configurations and experimental procedures. Aim: We aim to provide the community with an open-source software pipeline for conveniently creating low-cost, 3-D printable neuroimaging head caps with anatomically significant landmarks integrated into the structure of the cap. Approach: We utilize our advanced 3-D head mesh generation toolbox and 10-20 head landmark calculations to quickly convert a subject's anatomical scan or an atlas into a 3-D printable head cap model. The 3-D modeling environment of the open-source Blender platform permits advanced mesh processing features to customize the cap. The design process is streamlined into a Blender add-on named "NeuroCaptain". Results: Using the intuitive user interface, we create various head cap models using brain atlases, and share those with the community. The resulting mesh-based head cap designs are readily 3-D printable using off-the-shelf printers and filaments while accurately preserving the head topology and landmarks. Conclusions: The methods developed in this work result in a widely accessible tool for community members to design, customize and fabricate caps that incorporate anatomically derived landmarks. This not only permits personalized head cap designs to achieve improved accuracy, but also offers an open platform for the community to propose standardizable head caps to facilitate multi-centered data collection and sharing.

">Anatomical Abnormalities Suggest a Compensatory Role of the Cerebellum in Early Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Brain atrophy is detected in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and accelerates over the first few years post-diagnosis. This was captured by multiple cross-sectional studies and a few longitudinal studies in early PD. Yet only a longitudinal study with a control group can capture accelerated atrophy in early PD and differentiate it from healthy ageing. Accordingly, we performed a multicohort longitudinal analysis between PD and healthy ageing, examining subcortical regions implicated in PD pathology, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum (CC), and cerebellum. Longitudinal volumetric analysis was performed on 56 early PD patients and 53 matched controls, with scans collected 2-3 years apart. At baseline, the PD group showed a greater volume in the pallidum, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter (WM), suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in prodromal and early PD. After 2-3 years, accelerated atrophy in PD was observed in the putamen and cerebellar WM. Interestingly, healthy controls - but not PD patients - demonstrated a significant decline in Total Intracranial Volume (TIV), and atrophy in the thalamus and mid-CC. Between-group analysis revealed more severe atrophy in the right striatum and cerebellar WM in PD, and in the mid-posterior CC in controls. Using CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES) for lobule segmentation on the longitudinal PD cohort, we found a significant decline in the WM of non-motor regions in the cerebellum, specifically Crus I and lobule IX. Our results highlight an initial increase in cerebellar WM volume during prodromal PD, followed by significant degeneration over the first few years post-diagnosis.

">Is it me or the train moving? Humans resolve sensory conflicts with a nonlinear feedback mechanism in balance control</a></h4>

              
                Humans use multiple sensory systems to estimate body orientation in space. A predominant concept for the underlying multisensory integration (MSI) is the linear summation of weighted inputs from individual sensory systems. The sensory contributions change depending on context and environmental conditions. These changes are typically attributed to 'reweighting' by some higher order mechanism. We provide evidence for a conceptually different mechanism that combines 1) sensory inputs with fixed weights and 2) multisensory corrections, if the reference of the sensory inputs move in space and are therefore unreliable. This reconstruction of the sensory reference frame motion (RFM) allows humans to use vision and automatically counteract erroneous inputs, e.g. when looking at a moving train. The proposed RFM estimator contains a nonlinear dead-zone that blocks corrections at slow velocities. We first demonstrate that this mechanism accounts for changes in sensory contributions. Secondly, we hypothesized that such a nonlinearity would distort balance responses to perturbations in a very specific way. We predicted such distortions in body sway using a balance control model. Experiments using visual scene movements as a specific implementation of RFMs confirmed the predictions. The findings indicate that the central nervous system resolves sensory conflicts by an internal reconstruction of the cause of the conflict. Thus, the mechanism links the concept of causal inference to shifts in sensory contributions, providing a cohesive picture of MSI for the estimation of body orientation in space.

">Novel iGluSnFR3 variants with improved kinetics and dynamic range for tracking high frequency firing at glutamatergic synapses</a></h4>

              
                The first genetically encoded single fluorescent protein-based glutamate sensor, iGluSnFR opened a new era of imaging neuronal activity at the level of circuits as well as at synapses. With slow off-kinetics, iGluSnFR could only resolve low frequency glutamate release. A binding site variant of iGluSnFR, iGluu with significantly faster off-kinetics, enabled the resolution of high (100 Hz) frequency glutamate release in hippocampal slices at individual CA3-CA1 synapses. Moreover, iGluu revealed impairment of glutamate retrieval in HD mice models pointing to defective glutamate transport. Recently, the iGluSnFR3 generation (SF-Venus-iGluSnFR. v857) has been developed with increased dynamic range and rapid on-kinetics, making it attractive for in vivo imaging. However, similarly to iGluSnFR, glutamate off-kinetics of iGluSnFR3 were predicted to limit it to resolving low frequency release only. We undertook to improve the kinetic properties of iGluSnFR3 for resolving high (100 Hz) frequency glutamate release. We generated and characterized iGlu3fast, an ultrafast decay variant of iGluSnFR3. For iGlu3Fast we obtained a decay rate constant of 340 s-1, ~5-fold faster than iGluSnFR3 at 71 s-1, at 20oC. Furthermore, iGlu3Fast superseded iGluSnFR3 with a 42-fold glutamate-induced fluorescence increase compared to 26 for iGluSnFR3. Thus, with rapid off-kinetics comparable to that of iGluu as well as significantly increased fluorescence dynamic range and preserved rapid on-kinetics, iGlu3fast represents an excellent novel sensor for imaging high frequency glutamate release at all levels of organisation. Two novel variants with superslow off-kinetics are also reported, expanding the range of applications in neurobiology.

">Computational Modeling shows Confirmation Bias during Formation and Revision of Self-Beliefs</a></h4>

              
                Self-belief formation and revision strongly depend on social feedback. Accordingly, self-beliefs are subject to (re)evaluation and updating when facing new information. However, it has been shown that self-related learning is rarely purely information-driven. Instead, self-related learning is susceptible to a wide variety of biases. Among them is the confirmation bias, which can render updating insufficient, leading to inaccurate self-beliefs. To better understand these biases, it is important to delineate the effects of initial expectations towards the self and the confidence associated with the self-belief. In a novel behavioral approach, we introduced two learning phases during which participants completed an estimation task and received feedback allegedly related to their performance. In the first session (T1), participants established beliefs about their abilities in this task based on trial-by-trial feedback. In the second session (T2), participants received feedback that differed substantially from the feedback they had received at T1, thus creating the possibility for belief revision. Computational modeling was used to describe initial belief formation and later revision. The results showed confirmatory belief updating behavior on different levels: Participants did not, on average, revise their beliefs at T2, although they were constantly confronted with conflicting evidence. Instead, we observed that initial expectations were linked to biased learning from the received feedback, even at the beginning of the initial belief formation phase. Further, higher confidence in the beliefs was associated with attenuated revision. Together, the results underline the importance of individual priors when delineating learning biases.

">Heart Rate Variability During REM Sleep is Associated with Reduced Negative Memory Bias</a></h4>

              
                Emotional memories change over time, but the mechanisms supporting this change are not well understood. Memory consolidation during sleep has been shown to selectively prioritize negative experiences while forgetting neutral memories. Whereas studies examining the role of vagal heart rate variability (HRV) during waking in memory consolidation have shown that vagal HRV is associated with enhanced memory of positive experiences at the expense of negative ones. However, no studies have explored how HRV during sleep contributes to emotional memory processing. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the neural and vagal contributions during sleep to the processing of neutral and negative memories. To do so, we examined the impact of pharmacological vagal suppression, using zolpidem, on overnight emotional memory consolidation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design. Thirty-two participants encoded neutral and negative pictures in the morning, then were tested on picture recognition before and after a night of sleep. Zolpidem or a placebo drug were administered in the evening before overnight sleep, monitored with electroencephalography and electrocardiography. Results showed that higher vagal HRV in Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep slow wave sleep (NREM SWS) and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REM) was associated with greater overnight improvement for neutral pictures in the placebo condition. Additionally, higher vagal HRV during REM was associated with an emotional memory tradeoff (i.e., greater memory for neutral at the expense of negative images), indicating a potential role for REM vagal HRV in forming a positive memory bias overnight. As previously reported, zolpidem reduced vagal HRV during SWS and increased NREM sigma power, and this vagal suppression eliminated the positive memory bias. Lastly, we used a stepwise linear mixed effects regression framework to investigate how NREM sigma power and vagal HRV during REM independently explained the variance in the emotional memory tradeoff effect and found that including vagal HRV significantly improved the model's fit. Overall, these results suggest that neural and vagal signals synergistically interact in the processing of emotional memories, with REM vagal HRV playing a specific role in contributing to the positive memory bias.

">Human deep sleep facilitates faster cerebrospinal fluid dynamics linked to brain oscillations for sleep homeostasis and memory</a></h4>

              
                While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics during sleep have been implicated in metabolic waste reduction in animals, how CSF dynamics are driven in the human brain remains elusive. Here, by leveraging a simultaneous sparse-fMRI and polysomnography method designed specifically for acquiring deep stable sleep data, we present the first evidence of deep sleep-specific faster CSF dynamics in healthy young human participants. Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep induce frequent low-amplitude CSF fluctuations, contributing to faster CSF dynamics during deep sleep. In contrast, arousal-related brain activities during light sleep produced infrequent large CSF changes. Furthermore, these brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruited essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep emphasizing memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of enabling faster CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.

">Predicting the irrelevant: Neural effects of distractor predictability depend on load</a></h4>

              
                Distraction is ubiquitous in human environments. Distracting input is often predictable, but we do not understand whether and under which circumstances humans form and employ predictions about the identity of an expected distractor. Here we ask whether predictable distractors are able to reduce uncertainty in updating the internal predictive model. We show that utilising a predictable distractor identity is not fully automatic but in part dependent on available resources. In an auditory spatial n-back task, listeners (n = 33) attended to spoken numbers presented to one ear and detected repeating items. Distracting numbers presented to the other ear either followed a predictable (i.e., repetitive) sequence or were unpredictable. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to uncover neural responses to predictable versus unpredictable auditory distractors, as well as their dependence on perceptual and cognitive load. Neurally, unpredictable distractors induced a sign-reversed lateralization of pre-stimulus alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) and larger amplitude of the stimulus-evoked P2 event-related potential component. Under low versus high memory load, distractor predictability increased the magnitude of the frontal negativity component. Behaviourally, predictable distractors under low task demands (i.e., good signal-to-noise ratio and low memory load) made participants adopt a less conservative (i.e., more optimal) response strategy. We conclude that predictable distractors decrease uncertainty and reduce the need for updating the internal predictive model. In turn, unpredictable distractors mislead proactive spatial attention orientation, elicit larger neural responses and put higher demand on memory.

">Gaze biases can reflect task-specific spatial memorization strategies</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has suggested that small directional eye movements not only reveal the focus of external spatial attention towards visible stimuli, but also accompany shifts of internal attention to stimuli in visual working memory (VWM) (van Ede et al., 2019). When the orientations of two bars are memorized and a subsequent retro-cue indicates which orientation needs to be reported, participants' gaze is systematically biased towards the former location of the cued item (Figure 1AB). This finding was interpreted as evidence that the oculomotor system indexes internal attention; that is, attention directed at the location of stimuli that are no longer presented but are maintained in VWM. Importantly, as the location of the bars is presumably not relevant to the memory report, the authors concluded that orientation features in VWM are automatically associated with locations, suggesting that VWM is inherently spatially organized. This conclusion depends on the key assumption that participants indeed memorize and subsequently attend orientation features. Here we reanalyse Experiment 1 by van Ede et al. (2019) and demonstrate that this assumption does not hold. Instead of memorizing orientation features, participants deployed an alternative spatial strategy by memorizing bar endpoints. Although we do not call into question the conclusion that internal attention is inherently spatially organized, our results do imply that directional gaze biases might also reflect attention directed at task-relevant stimulus endpoints, rather than internal attention directed at memorized orientations.

">Implicit Neural Representation of Multi-shell Constrained Spherical Deconvolution for Continuous Modeling of Diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides insight into the micro and macro-structure of the brain. Multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (MSMT-CSD) models the underlying local fiber orientation distributions (FODs) using the dMRI signal. While generally producing high-quality FODs, MSMT-CSD is a voxel-wise method that can be impacted by noise and produce erroneous FODs. Local models also do not make use of the spatial correlation that is present between neighboring voxels to increase inference power. In the case of MSMT-CSD, costly interpolation computations are necessary to obtain FODs outside of the voxel center points. Expanding upon previous work, we apply the implicit neural representation (INR) methodology to the MSMT-CSD model. This results in an unsupervised machine learning framework that generates a continuous representation of a given dMRI dataset. The input of the INR consists of coordinates in the volume, which produce the spherical harmonics coefficients parameterizing an FOD at any desired location. A key characteristic of our model is its ability to leverage spatial correlations in the volume, which acts as a form of regularization. We evaluate the output FODs quantitatively and qualitatively in synthetic and real dMRI datasets and compare them to existing methods.

">Neural contrast sensitivity is not affected by myopic blur</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The prevalence of myopia is increasing worldwide, accompanied by an increase of potentially under-corrected myopes. Because the neural pathways processing the retinal image are prone to adaptation in relation to the retinal image quality, we wondered to what extent neural contrast sensitivity (NCS) is altered in the presence of myopic blur. Additionally, the impact of retinal abnormalities like foveal hypoplasia with albinism on NCS was tested. Methods: NCS was psychophysically determined for 11 emmetropic, 23 myopic well-corrected and 15 myopic under-corrected otherwise healthy young (27 {+/-} 6 years) participants and 1 albinism patient. Aberration-free stimulation, independent of the eye's refractive state, was achieved by using a unique spatial light modulator-based interferometric system to bypass the eye's optics. Results: No significant differences in NCS were observed between the three groups (Median area-under-curve: 61.9, 62.1, and 62.9 for emmetropes, well-corrected, and under-corrected myopes, respectively; all p > 0.1) but were significantly equivalent between emmetropes and myopes (all p < 0.001). However, the NCS function of the albinism patient differed significantly from the here defined 'normal' NCS function. Conclusions: NCS is unaffected by myopic blur and remains stable even for under-correction of up to 1.5 D. This means, that long-term under-corrected myopes still can achieve normal visual acuity as soon as their refractive errors are sufficiently corrected. Furthermore, NCS testing can relate visual deficits to an underlying neurological disorder.

                Aim: The present study aims to verify the information processing in athletes through electroencephalography, analyze cortical areas responsible for cognitive functions related to attentional processing of visual stimuli, and investigate motor activity's influence on cognitive aspects. Material and Methods: The sample consisted of 29 subjects, divided into an experimental group (n = 13 modern pentathlon athletes) and a control group (n = 16 non-athletes). We collected the electrocortical activity before and after the Wingate Anaerobic Test. During the electrophysiological measures, the volunteers performed a saccadic eye movement paradigm. They also performed cognitive tasks, resting heart rate, and anthropometric measurements. Results: A mixed ANOVA was applied to analyze the statistical differences between groups (athletes and control) and moments (before and after exercise) for F3, F4, P3, and P4 electrodes during rest one and task (pre-stimulus GO). There was an interaction for the group vs. moment factors in F3 [F = 17,129; p = 0,000; eta2 = 0.512], F4 [F = 22,774; p = 0,000; eta2 = 0.510], P3 [F = 11,429; p = 0,001; eta2 = 0.405], and P4 electrodes [F = 18,651; p = 0,000; eta2 = 0.379]. We found the main effect for group factors in the frontal and parietal electrodes of the right hemisphere (F4 and P4) and a main effect of the moment factor on the frontal (F3 and F4) and parietal (P3 and P4) electrodes. There was an interaction between the group vs. moment factors for the reaction time. The groups were different in Peak Power (Watts/kg), Average Power (Watts/kg), Fatigue Index (%), and Maximum Power (ms). Conclusions: We identified chronic effects of exercise training on the cortical activity of modern pentathlon athletes, read-through differences in absolute alpha power, and acute effects of a high-intensity exercise session for athletes and non-athletes for electrocortical and behavioral responses.

">Head And Shoulders - The Impact Of An Extended Head Model On The Simulation And Optimization Of Transcranial Electric Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Electric field calculations are increasingly used for dose characterization of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), but existing open-source head models are inaccurate for extracephalic montages that include electrodes placed on the neck or shoulder. We introduce the 'Ernie Extended' model, an MRI- and CT-derived open-source head model extending to the upper shoulder region. Simulations of extracephalic tES targeting the cerebellum and supplementary motor area show significant differences in electric fields when using Ernie Extended compared to the non-extended Ernie model. Additionally, we propose an electrode layout that complements the electroencephalography 10-20 system with extracephalic electrode positions. We demonstrate the use of this layout for optimizing multi-electrode tES montages for cerebellar stimulation, enhancing focality and reducing off-target stimulation, particularly of the spinal cord. Our results highlight the practical value of the Ernie Extended model for accurately characterizing doses produced by extracephalic tES montages and when targeting more caudal brain regions.

">A microendovascular system can record precise neural signals from cortical and deep vessels with minimal invasiveness</a></h4>

              
                Minimally invasive intravascular electroencephalography (ivEEG) signals are a promising tool for developing clinically feasible brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that restore communication and motor functions in paralyzed patients. However, current ivEEG techniques can only record signals from the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), making it challenging to record motor responses related to hand and mouth movements from brain regions distant from the SSS, despite their critical role in BCIs. Here, using micro intravascular electrodes, ivEEGs recorded from the cortical or deep veins of eight pigs could measure cortical activities with greater signal power and better spatial resolution than those recording in the SSS, thus allowing mapping of the sensorimotor and visual functional areas. Additionally, electrical stimulation in the cortical vein between the micro intravascular electrodes induced muscle contractions contralateral to the stimulated area in five anesthetized pigs. These results demonstrate that ivEEG using micro intravascular electrodes is a promising tool for developing BCIs.

">Functional characterisation of neuropeptides that act as ligands for both calcitonin-type and pigment-dispersing factor-type receptors in a deuterostome</a></h4>

              
                The calcitonin (CT) family of related peptides exert their diverse physiological effects in mammals via two G-protein coupled receptors, CTR and the CTR-like receptor CLR. Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type signaling has revealed the occurrence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have revealed that in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster the CT-like peptide DH31 can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (phylum Echinodermata). In A. japonicus, a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), both of which act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gq/Ca2+/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Analysis of the expression of the gene encoding AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed transcripts in a variety of organ systems, but with highest expression in the circumoral nervous system. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal body wall muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments and loss-of-function tests revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in A. japonicus. This is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome. Furthermore, because of the economic importance of A. japonicus as a foodstuff, discovery of the potential role for CT-type peptides as regulators of feeding and growth in this species may provide a basis for practical applications in aquaculture.

">Numerosity adaptation suppresses early visual responses</a></h4>

              
                Humans and many animals rapidly and accurately perceive numerosity, the number of objects, in a visual image. The numerosity of recently viewed images influences our perception of the current image's numerosity: numerosity adaptation. How does numerosity adaptation affect responses to numerosity in the brain? Recent studies show both early visual responses that monotonically increase with numerosity, and later numerosity-tuned responses that peak at different (preferred) numerosities in different neural populations. We have recently shown that numerosity adaptation affects the preferred numerosity of numerosity-tuned neural populations. We have also shown that early visual monotonic responses reflect image contrast, which follows numerosity closely. Here we ask how monotonic responses in the early visual cortex are affected by adaptation to different numerosities, using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI and neural model-based analyses. FMRI response amplitudes increased monotonically with numerosity throughout the early visual field maps (V1-V3, hV4, LO1-LO2 & V3A/B). This increase in response amplitudes becomes less steep after adaptation to higher numerosities, with this effect becoming stronger through the early visual hierarchy. This suppression of responses to numerosity is consistent with perceptual effects where adaptation to high numerosities reduces the perceived numerosity. These results imply that numerosity adaptation effects in later numerosity-tuned neural populations may originate in early visual areas that respond to image contrast in the adapting image.

">The dual interpretation of edge time series: Time-varying connectivity versus statistical interaction</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) is frequently operationalized as a correlation. Many studies have examined changes in correlation networks across time, claiming to link time-varying fluctuations to ongoing mental operations and physiological processes. Other studies, however, have called these results into question, noting that statistically indistinguishable patterns of time-varying fluctuations can be obtained by windowing synthetic time series generated from ground-truth stationary correlation structure. Recently, we developed a technique for tracking rapid (framewise) fluctuations in network connectivity over time. Here, we show that these "edge time series" are mathematically equivalent to interaction terms in a specific family of general linear models. We exploit this fact to further demonstrate that time-varying connectivity carries explanatory power above and beyond brain activations. This observation suggests that time-varying connectivity is likely more than a statistical artifact.

">The relationship between confidence and gaze-at-nothing oculomotor dynamics during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                How does confidence relate to oculomotor dynamics during decision-making? Do oculomotor dynamics reflect deliberation and the buildup of confidence in the absence of visual stimuli? Here we examine the hypothesis that working memory, deliberation, and confidence warp oculomotor dynamics, both in the presence and absence of visual stimuli. We analyzed oculomotor dynamics in a decision-making task in which participants were provided with an abstract context in which to make the decision, and two similar option images which became eventually invisible. We show that fixations between the empty locations in which the images were formerly shown continued after the options disappeared, consistently with a sustained deliberative process facilitated by oculomotor dynamics. Both, oculomotor dynamics and decision patterns remained unchanged regardless of whether the stimuli were visible. Furthermore, our analyses show that the number of alternative fixations between stimuli correlated negatively with the confidence reported after each decision, while the observation time of the selected target correlated positively. Given that decisions in our experimental paradigm are reported in the absence of the stimuli, this suggests a relationship between evidence retrieval from working memory, confidence gathering and oculomotor dynamics. Finally, we performed a model comparison based on predictions from drift-diffusion models to assess the relationship between sequential fixations between images, deliberation and confidence gathering, and the ensuing choice. These analyses supported confidence as a contributing cognitive process encompassing serial evidence-gathering and parallel option consideration during decision-making.

">Neural representation of direct-to-reverberant energy ratio in recorded and simulated binaural room auralizations</a></h4>

              
                In a complex acoustic environment, sound localization involves the extraction and integration of numerous interrelated auditory cues. To understand how these cues are processed in the brain, studies typically isolate a single cue in an artificial experimental framework, to evaluate what brain regions process individual auditory cues. However, multivariate analyses facilitate more complex manipulations with greater ecological validity by providing a method for comparing between brain activity to a quantitative breakdown of the experimental stimuli. Concurrent advancements in virtual acoustics enable a systematic examination of spatial acoustics in complex realistic environments. Although these simulations have a high perceptual plausibility, they still alter auditory reverberation cues in a perceptible way. The impact of these subtle differences on neural processing is unclear. Auditory distance perception is a particularly challenging perceptual process to study, due to the relative nature of the sensory cues. Therefore, we conducted an imaging study to investigate the representation of auditory cues in recorded and simulated acoustic environments, while performing a distance discrimination task. We recorded the actual MRI environment to reduce room divergence, and the auditory simulations modeled reverberation with different degrees of accuracy. We used an acoustic analysis to determine the differences between the acoustic environments and used these quantitative measures to compare to the pattern of brain activity. We found that although the room auralizations were highly similar, it was possible to decode them from brain activity. The ratio of direct-to-reverberant energy level (DRR) was the only acoustic parameter that made a relevant contribution to brain activity. The locus of this activity was in the posterior auditory cortex.

">Effect of sleep deprivation on fractal and oscillatory spectral measures of the sleep EEG: a window on basic regulatory processes</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is vital for sustaining life; therefore, reliable measurement of its regulatory processes is of significant importance in research and medicine. Here we examine the effect of extended wakefulness on the putative indicators of fundamental sleep regulatory processes (spectral slope and spindle frequency) proposed by the Fractal and Oscillatory Adjustment model of sleep regulation by involving a healthy young adult sample in a 35-hour long sleep deprivation protocol. Wearable headband EEG-derived results revealed that NREM sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral slope estimated in the 2-48 Hz range is an accurate indicator of the predicted changes in sleep depth induced by sleep deprivation (steepened slopes in recovery sleep) or by the overnight dissipation of sleep pressure (flattening slopes during successive sleep cycles). While the baseline overnight dynamics of the center frequency of the sleep spindle oscillations followed a U-shaped curve, and the timing of its minimum (the presumed phase indicator) correlated with questionnaire-based chronotype metrics as predicted, a different picture emerged during recovery sleep. Advanced recovery sleep advanced the timing of the minima of the oscillatory spindle frequency, reduced considerably its relationship with chronotype, but retained partially its U-shaped overnight evolution. Overall, our study supports the use of the spectral slope of the sleep EEG as a homeostatic marker of wake-sleep regulation, in addition, encourages further research on the EEG-derived measure of the circadian rhythm, primarily focusing on its interaction with the homeostatic process.

                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow is crucial for clearing metabolic waste from the brain, a process whose dysregulation is linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Traditional approaches like particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) are limited by their reliance on single-plane two-dimensional measurements, which fail to capture the complex dynamics of CSF flow fully. To overcome these limitations, we employ Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry (AIV) to reconstruct three-dimensional velocities, infer pressure and wall shear stress, and quantify flow rates. Given the experimental nature of the data and inherent variability in biological systems, robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential. Towards this end, we have modified the baseline AIV architecture to address aleatoric uncertainty caused by noisy experimental data, enhancing our measurement refinement capabilities. We also implement UQ for the model and epistemic uncertainties arising from the governing equations and network representation. Toward this end, we test multiple governing laws, representation models, and initializations. Our approach not only advances the accuracy of CSF flow quantification but also can be adapted to other applications that use physics-informed machine learning to reconstruct fields from experimental data, providing a versatile tool for inverse problems.

                Importance: The effects of prenatal alcohol (PAE) and tobacco exposure (PTE) on adolescent neuroanatomical development are typically evaluated cross-sectionally. It is unclear if observed effects persist throughout life or reflect different developmental trajectories. Objective: To determine how PAE and PTE are associated with cortical structure and development across two timepoints in early adolescence. Design: Observational, longitudinal analyses of data within the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study Setting: 21 study sites in the United States Participants: 5,417 youth participants, aged ~9-12 years old Exposures: PAE and PTE based on caregiver (self) reports of alcohol/tobacco use during pregnancy, before and after pregnancy recognition. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cortical thickness (mm) and cortical surface area (mm2) measured approximately 2 years apart in early adolescence, across 68 bilateral cortical regions. Results: At baseline data collection, youth participants were ~9.9 years old (SD=0.6). At the second neuroimaging appointment, youth participants were ~11.9 years old (SD=0.6). When modelling cortical thickness, we controlled for individuals' whole-brain volume; when modelling cortical surface area, individuals' total surface area. Cortical thickness generally declined with age. Cortical surface area either expanded or contracted with age, depending on region. PAE had minimal effects on cortical structure (main effects) and development (PAE*Age interactions). PTE had robust effects on cortical thickness and was associated with faster rates of cortical thinning in several regions within the frontal lobe. Post hoc analyses on (1) the effects of PTE for those who continued tobacco use after pregnancy recognition and (2) the effects of PTE in those who did not also use alcohol revealed weaker effects. Conclusions and Relevance: PTE had robust effects on neuroanatomical structure and longitudinal development, particularly cortical thickness. Analyzing developmental cortical trajectories informs how PTE and/or PAE not only affects cortical structure but how it develops long after those prenatal exposures occurred. Future analyses involving cotinine biomarkers of PTE would enhance the temporal resolution of the ABCD Study's PTE-related queries of tobacco use before and after learning of the pregnancy.

">Rapid visual engagement in neural processing of detailed touch interactions</a></h4>

              
                Touch perception is an inherently multisensory process in which vision plays an essential role. However, our understanding of how vision encodes sensory and emotional-affective aspects of observed touch, and the timing of these processes, is still limited. Here we address this gap by investigating the neural dynamics of visual touch observation by analysing electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants viewing detailed hand interactions from the Validated Touch-Video Database. We examined how the brain encodes basic body cues such as hand orientation and viewing perspective, in addition to sensory aspects, including the type of touch (e.g., stroking vs. pressing; hand vs. object touch) and the object involved (e.g., knife, brush), as well as emotional-affective dimensions. Using multivariate decoding, information about body cues was present within 60 ms, with sensory and emotional details, including valence, arousal, and pain present around 130 ms, demonstrating efficient early visual processing. Threat was most clearly identified by approximately 265 ms, similarly involving visual regions, suggesting that such evaluations require slightly extended neural engagement. Our findings reveal that bottom-up, automatic visual processing is integral to complex tactile assessments, important for rapidly extracting both the personal relevance and the sensory and emotional dimensions of touch.

">Distinct functional domains of Dystroglycan regulate inhibitory synapse formation and maintenance in cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Dystroglycan is a cell adhesion molecule that localizes to synapses throughout the nervous system. While Dystroglycan is required to maintain inhibitory synapses from cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs) whether initial synaptogenesis during development is dependent on Dystroglycan has not been examined. We show that conditional deletion of Dystroglycan from Purkinje cells prior to synaptogenesis results in impaired MLI:PC synapse formation and function due to reduced presynaptic inputs and abnormal postsynaptic GABAA receptor clustering. Using genetic manipulations that disrupt glycosylation of Dystroglycan or truncate its cytoplasmic domain, we show that Dystroglycan's role in synapse function requires both extracellular and intracellular interactions, whereas synapse formation requires only extracellular interactions. Together, these findings provide molecular insight into the mechanism of inhibitory synapse formation and maintenance in cerebellar cortex.

	<p>It is challenging to differentiate between central nervous system (CNS) virus infections and neurological autoimmune diseases in the emergency department. Considering their different pathogenesis, we assume they differ in neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory results. A total of 80 patients were included in this study, 50 with CNS virus infections and 30 with CNS autoimmune diseases, confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A binary logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were employed to examine the discrimination between the two types of diseases based on neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory results. Compared to patients with neurological autoimmune diseases, patients with CNS virus infections had a higher incidence of abnormal behavior (p = 0.026) and abnormal sensation/thought (p = 0.029); higher total (p = 0.005), direct (p = 0.004), and indirect bilirubin (p = 0.004); and increased CSF cell (p = 0.01) and CSF white cell counts (p = 0.01). Patients with disturbance of consciousness and abnormal sensation/thought were 7.79-fold and 5.07-fold more likely to be diagnosed with CNS virus infections (OR = 7.79, p = 0.008; OR = 5.07, p = 0.032). Each unit increase in blood indirect bilirubin concentration and CSF white cell counts increased the risk of developing CNS virus infections by 1.25-fold and 1.01-fold (OR = 1.25, p = 0.016; OR = 1.01, p = 0.011). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve was 88.0% (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Our study found that patients with CNS viral infections tend to have higher blood indirect bilirubin concentration, CSF leukocyte count, frequency of disorders of consciousness, and abnormal sensation and thought, which may help differentiate them from those with neurological autoimmune diseases.</p>

	<p>Background. Incidentally discovered low-grade gliomas (iLGGs) are very rare and little is still known about their associated functional imaging activation patterns, white-matter status, and plasticity potential. Recent studies shed light on several clinical factors responsible for the good clinical status observed in these patients versus those with their symptomatic counterpart (sLGGs), including small volume. Comparisons were typically carried out by comparing iLGGs with the wider and more heterogeneous sLGG group. In this study, we investigated whether iLGGs affect the brain differently from comparably small sLGGs. Method. Starting from a sample of 13 patients with iLGG, in the current comparative cross-sectional study, we identified a group of patients with sLGGs, primarily matched by lesion volume. We looked for potential differences between the two groups in language-related functional and structural parameters (the fMRI network associated with naming and white-matter fascicles). Results. The t-test did not show significant differences in the fMRI network, but these emerged when performing masking. No significant differences were observed at the white-matter level. Conclusions. Given that small volumes characterized both groups and that demographic variables were comparable, too, we hypothesized that differences between the two groups could be attributed to alternative lesion-related parameters. We discussed these findings from clinical and neurosurgical perspectives.</p>

	<p>Subinsular stroke (subIS) can occur between the penetrating middle cerebral artery (MCA) branches, which clinical and radiological findings sometimes encounter in patients after the recanalization of left proximal MCA occlusion. However, no supportive data are available to clarify this relationship. This study investigated whether the involvement of subIS can impact outcomes after successful reperfusion therapy. Data from 152 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy between 2019 and 2023 were collected. A 3-month functional independence defined as a modified Rankin Scale 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 (primary outcome) and influencing factors were analyzed retrospectively. Recanalization was achieved in 35 patients, of whom 11 (31%) developed subIS. Patients with subIS were older in age (81 vs. 75; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), had lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on admission (0.52 vs. 0.62; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (4 vs. 2; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than those without subIS. In a multivariate analysis, subIS was independently associated with a worse functional outcome (odds ratio: 10.5, p = 0.02). The cut-off value of the ADCs was 0.52 with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 64%, respectively. Subinsular ischemic lesions contribute to poor functional independence in patients after the successful recanalization of left MCA occlusion. The attenuation of the ADC value in these territories could be a valuable predictor of the outcome.</p>

	<p>Background: Road safety improvement is a governmental priority due to driver-caused accidents. Driving style variation affects safety, with emotional regulation being pivotal. However, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies show inconsistent prefrontal cortex activity during emotion processing. This study examines prefrontal cortex response to negative emotional stimuli, particularly traffic accident images, across drivers diverse in age and gender. Method: The study involved 118 healthy males (44.38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.98 years) and 84 females (38.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.60 years). The Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI) was used to assess driving behavior alongside fNIRS recordings. Participants viewed traffic accident and neutral images while prefrontal oxygenation was monitored. Results: Women rated traffic accidents (t-test = 2.43; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.016) and neutral images (t-test = 2.19; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.030) lower in valence than men. Arousal differences were significant for traffic accident images (t-test = &amp;amp;minus;3.06; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002). correlational analysis found an inverse relationship between Dissociative scale scores and oxygenation (all p-values &amp;amp;le; 0.013). Greater prefrontal oxygenation occurred with neutral images compared to traffic accidents. Left hemisphere differences (t-test = 3.23; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) exceeded right hemisphere differences (t-test = 2.46; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.015). Subgroup analysis showed male participants to be driving these disparities. Among adaptive drivers, significant oxygenation differences between neutral and accident images were evident in both hemispheres (left: t-test = 2.72, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.009; right: t-test = 2.22, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.030). Conclusions: Male drivers with maladaptive driving styles, particularly dissociative ones, exhibit reduced prefrontal oxygenation when exposed to neutral and traffic accident images. This response was absent in female drivers, with no notable age-related differences.</p>

	<p>Hypnotic phenomena exhibit significant inter-individual variability, with some individuals consistently demonstrating efficient responses to hypnotic suggestions, while others show limited susceptibility. Recent neurophysiological studies have added to a growing body of research that shows variability in hypnotic susceptibility is linked to distinct neural characteristics. Building on this foundation, our previous work identified that individuals with high and low hypnotic susceptibility can be differentiated based on the arrhythmic activity observed in resting-state electrophysiology (rs-EEG) outside of hypnosis. However, because previous work has largely focused on mean spectral characteristics, our understanding of the variability over time of these features, and how they relate to hypnotic susceptibility, is still limited. Here we address this gap using a time-resolved assessment of rhythmic alpha peaks and arrhythmic components of the EEG spectrum both prior to and following hypnotic induction. Using multivariate pattern classification, we investigated whether these neural features differ between individuals with high and low susceptibility to hypnosis. Specifically, we used multivariate pattern classification to investigate whether these non-stationary neural features could distinguish between individuals with high and low susceptibility to hypnosis before and after a hypnotic induction. Our analytical approach focused on time-resolved spectral decomposition to capture the intricate dynamics of neural oscillations and their non-oscillatory counterpart, as well as Lempel&amp;amp;ndash;Ziv complexity. Our results show that variations in the alpha center frequency are indicative of hypnotic susceptibility, but this discrimination is only evident during hypnosis. Highly hypnotic-susceptible individuals exhibit higher variability in alpha peak center frequency. These findings underscore how dynamic changes in neural states related to alpha peak frequency represent a central neurophysiological feature of hypnosis and hypnotic susceptibility.</p>

	<p>Rapid identification of the type and origin of a stroke is crucial for prompt and appropriate treatment, which can significantly influences patient outcomes. We report a multidisciplinary management case involving a 76-year-old man who presented with left-sided weakness and mild dysarthria. Imaging revealed a completely occluded right internal carotid artery. Despite multiple endovascular recanalization attempts, adequate flow could not be achieved, leading to the decision to perform an open thrombo-endarterectomy. The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy with microsurgical techniques under general anesthesia. The atheroma plaque and central thrombus were removed, which reestablished flow. Continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring was utilized to ensure patient safety. The patient woke up without new deficits and was discharged for rehabilitation. Follow-up imaging confirmed arterial patency, and the patient eventually made an excellent recovery, including being independent over one and a half years. Emergent recanalization with carotid endarterectomy following a failed endovascular recanalization is both safe and feasible, emphasizing the need for collaboration between different treatment providers to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Our report highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the advantages of a hybrid operating room in the treatment of acute complete carotid artery occlusion.</p>

	<p>Sigma-1R (S1R) is a ubiquitously distributed protein highly expressed in the brain and liver. It acts as a ligand-inducible chaperone protein localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. S1R participates in several signaling pathways that oversee diverse cellular and neurological functions, such as calcium and proteome homeostasis, neuronal activity, memory, and emotional regulation. Despite its crucial functions, S1R expression profile in the brain with respect to age and sex remains elusive. To shed light on this matter, we assessed S1R distribution in the mouse brain across different developmental stages, including juvenile, early adult, and middle-aged mice. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that S1R is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus in juvenile mice, particularly in CA1 and CA3 regions. Notably, S1R is not expressed in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus of juvenile mice. We observed dynamic changes in S1R levels during development, with most brain regions showing either an abrupt or gradual decline as mice transition from juveniles to adults. Sexual dimorphism is observed before puberty in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and during adulthood in the hippocampus and cortex.</p>

	<p>Accurate and generalizable classification of brain states is essential for understanding their neural underpinnings and improving clinical diagnostics. Traditionally, functional connectivity patterns and graph-theoretic metrics have been utilized. However, cortical gradient features, which reflect global brain organization, offer a complementary approach. We hypothesized that a machine learning model integrating these three feature sets would effectively discriminate between baseline and atypical brain states across a wide spectrum of conditions, even though the underlying neural mechanisms vary. To test this, we extracted features from brain states associated with three meta-conditions including unconsciousness (NREM2 sleep, propofol deep sedation, and propofol general anesthesia), psychedelic states induced by hallucinogens (subanesthetic ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide, and nitrous oxide), and neuropsychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia). We used support vector machine with nested cross-validation to construct our models. The soft voting ensemble model marked the average balanced accuracy (average of specificity and sensitivity) of 79% (62&amp;amp;ndash;98% across all conditions), outperforming individual base models (70&amp;amp;ndash;76%). Notably, our models exhibited varying degrees of transferability across different datasets, with performance being dependent on the specific brain states and feature sets used. Feature importance analysis across meta-conditions suggests that the underlying neural mechanisms vary significantly, necessitating tailored approaches for accurate classification of specific brain states. This finding underscores the value of our feature-integrated ensemble models, which leverage the strengths of multiple feature types to achieve robust performance across a broader range of brain states. While our approach offers valuable insights into the neural signatures of different brain states, future work is needed to develop and validate even more generalizable models that can accurately classify brain states across a wider array of conditions.</p>

	<p>This retrospective study assesses the efficacy and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP) therapy in adolescents and young adults (ages 12&amp;amp;ndash;21) with migraine and chronic daily headaches unresponsive to standard treatments. Migraines in this demographic significantly impair school performance, self-esteem, psychological well-being, and cognitive health. These young patients are also particularly sensitive to the side effects of conventional medications, which are often prescribed off-label and come with high insurance denial rates. Medication overuse, including analgesics, triptans, and NSAIDs, is prevalent due to treatment failures. Elevated plasma CGRP levels observed during migraines suggest that anti-CGRP therapies, successful in adult populations, may also benefit this younger age group. Over a three-year period, patients at a specialized pediatric headache center were evaluated for the impact of anti-CGRP treatments, including monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab) and small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (ubrogepant, rimegepant, and atogepant), administered either alone or in combination with OnabotulinumtoxinA. Data were extracted from the hospital&amp;amp;rsquo;s electronic medical records, and patient progress was consistently documented using a structured template for each clinic visit. Additional patient satisfaction data were collected via telephone follow-ups and patient message reviews. The study included 23 patients, primarily treated for chronic migraine (CM) (78.3%), with a smaller subset addressing episodic migraine (EM), new daily persistent headaches (NDPHs), and post-traumatic headaches (PTHs). Comprehensive demographic and clinical data, including age, treatment duration, history of preventive treatment failures, and comorbidities like psychiatric conditions and sleep disorders, were collected. Anti-CGRP therapies, particularly when combined with traditional treatments or OnabotulinumtoxinA, resulted in significant improvements: 91.3% of patients experienced reduced migraine duration and intensity, 82.6% reported improvements in other bothersome symptoms, and 73.9% saw an improved response to rescue medications. Additionally, 78.3% of patients reported a reduction in their use of rescue medications per week by more than 50%, and emergency room visits were reduced for 56.5% of patients. Significant reductions in headache days were observed in 82.6% of patients after one month and 87% after three months, with nearly 40% experiencing more than a 50% reduction in both periods. The greatest benefits were observed in patients treated for more than six months. Adverse effects were minimal, with 95.7% of patients reporting no side effects, and patient satisfaction was high, with 69.6% opting to continue treatment. Overall, this study highlights the substantial potential of anti-CGRP therapy in improving outcomes for adolescents and young adults with CM and EM, offering a promising approach for a demographic that faces considerable challenges with conventional treatment options. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and expand clinical applications in this age group.</p>

                <p>Peak-alpha frequency varies across individuals and mental states, but it also forms a negative gradient from posterior to anterior regions in association with increases in cortical thickness and connectivity, reflecting a cortical hierarchy in temporal integration. Tracking the spatial standard deviation of peak-alpha frequency in scalp EEG, we observed that a posterior-to-anterior gradient dynamically formed and dissolved. Periods of high spatial standard deviation yielded robustly negative posterior-to-anterior gradients&mdash;the "gradient state"&mdash;while periods of low spatial standard deviation yielded globally converged peak-alpha frequency&mdash;the "uniform state." The state variations were characterized by a combination of slow (0.3&ndash;0.5&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and random-walk-like fluctuations. They were relatively independently correlated with peak-alpha frequency variations in anterior regions and peak-alpha power variations in central regions driven by posterior regions (together accounting for ~50% of the state variations), suggesting that two distinct mechanisms modulate the state variations: an anterior mechanism that directly adjusts peak-alpha frequencies and a posterior&ndash;central mechanism that indirectly adjusts them by influencing synchronization. The state variations likely reflect general operations as their spatiotemporal characteristics remained unchanged while participants engaged in a variety of tasks (breath focus, vigilance, working memory, mental arithmetic, and generative thinking) with their eyes closed or watched a silent nature video. The ongoing state variations may dynamically balance two global processing modes, one that facilitates greater temporal integration (and potentially also information influx) toward anterior regions in the gradient state and the other that facilitates flexible global communication (via phase locking) in the uniform state.</p>

                <p>Adolescent inhibition of thalamocortical projections from postnatal days P20 to 50 leads to long-lasting deficits in prefrontal cortex function and cognition in the adult mouse. While this suggests a role of thalamic activity in prefrontal cortex maturation, it is unclear how inhibition of these projections affects prefrontal circuitry during adolescence. Here, we used chemogenetic tools to inhibit thalamoprefrontal projections in male/female mice from P20 to P35 and measured synaptic inputs to prefrontal pyramidal neurons by layer (either II/III or V/VI) and projection target (mediodorsal thalamus (MD), nucleus accumbens (NAc), or callosal prefrontal projections) 24&nbsp;h later using slice physiology. We found a decrease in the frequency of excitatory and inhibitory currents in layer II/III NAc and layer V/VI MD-projecting neurons while layer V/VI NAc-projecting neurons showed an increase in the amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory currents. Regarding cortical projections, the frequency of inhibitory but not excitatory currents was enhanced in contralateral mPFC-projecting neurons. Notably, despite these complex changes in individual levels of excitation and inhibition, the overall balance between excitation and inhibition in each cell was only altered in the contralateral mPFC projections. This finding suggests homeostatic regulation occurs within subcortically but not intracortical callosal-projecting neurons. Increased inhibition of intraprefrontal connectivity may therefore be particularly important for prefrontal cortex circuit maturation. Finally, we observed cognitive deficits in the adult mouse using this narrowed window of thalamocortical inhibition.</p>

                <p>Volatile anesthetics are currently believed to cause unconsciousness by acting on one or more molecular targets including neural ion channels, receptors, mitochondria, synaptic proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. Anesthetic gases including isoflurane bind to cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) and dampen their quantum optical effects, potentially contributing to causing unconsciousness. This possibility is supported by the finding that taxane chemotherapy consisting of MT-stabilizing drugs reduces the effectiveness of anesthesia during surgery in human cancer patients. In order to experimentally assess the contribution of MTs as functionally relevant targets of volatile anesthetics, we measured latencies to loss of righting reflex (LORR) under 4% isoflurane in male rats injected subcutaneously with vehicle or 0.75&nbsp;mg/kg of the brain-penetrant MT&ndash;stabilizing drug epothilone B (epoB). EpoB-treated rats took an average of 69&nbsp;s longer to become unconscious as measured by latency to LORR. This was a statistically significant difference corresponding to a standardized mean difference (Cohen's <I>d</I>) of 1.9, indicating a "large" normalized effect size. The effect could not be accounted for by tolerance from repeated exposure to isoflurane. Our results suggest that binding of the anesthetic gas isoflurane to MTs causes unconsciousness and loss of purposeful behavior in rats (and presumably humans and other animals). This finding is predicted by models that posit consciousness as a property of a quantum physical state of neural MTs.</p>

                <p>Uncovering the relationships between neural circuits, behavior, and neural dysfunction may require rodent pose tracking. While open-source toolkits such as DeepLabCut have revolutionized markerless pose estimation using deep neural networks, the training process still requires human intervention for annotating key points of interest in video data. To further reduce human labor for neural network training, we developed a method that automatically generates annotated image datasets of rodent paw placement in a laboratory setting. It uses invisible but fluorescent markers that become temporarily visible under UV light. Through stroboscopic alternating illumination, adjacent video frames taken at 720&nbsp;Hz are either UV or white light illuminated. After color filtering the UV-exposed video frames, the UV markings are identified and the paw locations are deterministically mapped. This paw information is then transferred to automatically annotate paw positions in the next white light-exposed frame that is later used for training the neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a KineWheel&ndash;DeepLabCut setup for the markerless tracking of the four paws of a harness-fixed mouse running on top of the transparent wheel with mirror. Our automated approach, made available open-source, achieves high-quality position annotations and significantly reduces the need for human involvement in the neural network training process, paving the way for more efficient and streamlined rodent pose tracking in neuroscience research.</p>

                Background Most stroke survivors consider community ambulation an essential but unmet goal of their recovery. Historically, interventions to enhance community ambulation have focused on improving biomechanical impairments of gait; however, recent evidence suggests that biopsychosocial and environmental factors may impact community ambulation, even beyond more obvious physical impairments. The identification of factors that pose as significant facilitators or barriers to community ambulation may serve to guide stakeholders in designing relevant and evidence-based interventions for improving community ambulation post-stroke. Objective This review aims to map the type and extent of existing evidence on the physical, biopsychosocial, and environmental factors affecting community ambulation post-stroke. Additionally, this review will describe the various methods used to examine the extent to which stroke survivors are restricted to community ambulation. Methods Nine databases will be searched including CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science. We will include studies published in English during or after 2001. Studies that examine physical, biopsychosocial, and/or environmental factors affecting community ambulation in ambulatory adults at least six months post-stroke will be considered for inclusion. Studies that assess general physical activity or community mobility through transportation modes other than walking will be excluded. All identified records will be collated in citation management software, followed by steps of deduplication, title/abstract screening, and full-text reviews by at least two independent reviewers. The bibliographies of the extracted studies will also be reviewed for relevant articles. The extracted studies will be analyzed, critically appraised, and presented in tabular, narrative, and evidence map formats. Discussion The evidence gained will be used to build a framework for community ambulation, informing stakeholders to develop meaningful interventions to improve community ambulation. The mapped evidence will motivate future studies to develop holistic approaches that specifically focus on the most vital factors that influence post-stroke community ambulation.

                Background Activation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, ECOG at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from hypercoagulable states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance and anticoagulant treatment for these patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-979/v1?src=rss">A systematic literature review of interpersonal communication strategies for optimizing government employee performance in the digital era [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This research shows that ongoing digital changes have a significant impact, particularly in the government sector. In addition to ease and benefits, such as operational efficiency and faster public services, new challenges, such as problems related to system integration, human resources (HR) limitations in the use of technology, and public access to digital technology, are also present. Therefore, this study aims to explore the role of interpersonal communication in enhancing employee performance in the context of HR development in the digital era by employing the systematic literature review (SLR) method and using data from electronic databases, specifically Google Scholar using the Harsing’s Publish or Perish (Windows GUI Edition) 8.2.3944.8118, the application can be accessed by downloading (https://publish-or-perish.en.softonic.com/), and Scopus (www.scopus.com) with a focus on journals published between 2017 and 2024. By identifying research gaps, research questions were developed to understand the influence of interpersonal communication on improving employee performance in the context of public services, necessary adaptations, and interpersonal communication strategies. This research provides comprehensive insights and practical solutions for the government sector to address the dynamics of the current and future digital era, based on data analysis from reliable database sources. The risk of bias in this study was addressed through the selection criteria and data extraction method. Thematic analysis and quantitative summarization were used for data presentation and synthesis. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that interpersonal communication has a significant positive influence on employee performance. The effect size estimates for each intervention and the corresponding confidence intervals are presented. To ensure honesty and accuracy in the interpretation of the results, potential evidence limitations and biases should be acknowledged transparently.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-526/v2?src=rss">Exploring the Potential for Tuition-Free Higher Education in South Africa: A Scoping Review [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The debate on tuition-free higher education has raged in South Africa since the #FeesMustFall protests at South African universities in 2015 and 2016. The government responded with a tuition-free education policy targeting students from households earning less than R350 000. However, the question remains can South Africa sustain a tuition-free education policy given its developing nation status and the levels of its GDP? This article sought to assess the feasibility of tuition-free higher education for all in South Africa. A scoping review was used, and fifteen articles about tuition-free higher education feasibility in South Africa were reviewed. The choice of the scoping review was due to the need for an understanding of the current state of play in research on the feasibility of tuition-free higher education in South Africa. The results suggest that tuition-free higher education for all is not feasible in South Africa. There seems to be a consensus that South Africa lacks the resources to finance tuition-free higher education for all. Tuition-free higher education is also viewed as a regressive tax on the poor given that the majority of students in higher education institutions come from middle and upper-income households. However, it is important to note that a distinction is drawn between tuition-free higher education for all and tuition-free higher education for the poor and academically deserving. The latter seems to receive support with some viewing it as a moral imperative in an unequal society such as South Africa’s. It is recommended that future studies approach the issue from an empirical standpoint whereby the GDP levels are assessed against higher education funding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-780/v2?src=rss">Evaluating the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa: a causal loop diagram approach  [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, aiming to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. By employing a causal loop diagram approach, the study examined the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors influencing the provision of fee-free higher education. Method A participatory approach to developing the CLD was used. Through an extensive literature review, the research contextualised fee-free higher education enabling a preliminary CLD to be developed. Discussions were held to improve the preliminary model based on stakeholder and expert opinion. The model was then validated by stakeholders and experts. Results The CLD has explicitly mapped out the causal relationships which play a fundamental role in fee-free higher education in South Africa. Key findings revealed that fee-free higher education initiatives, such as managing funding constraints and administrative complexities, hold promise for fostering inclusivity and socioeconomic development but are hindered by bureaucratic policy establishments and inefficiencies. These challenges underscore the gap between policy formulation and implementation, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms to streamline administrative processes and enhance financial sustainability within the higher education sector. Conclusion This research thoroughly examined the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities in its implementation. The study emphasized the need for systemic reforms to improve accessibility and effectiveness, while also underscoring the potential of such initiatives to promote social mobility and economic empowerment, aligning with global goals like the SDGs and the African Agenda 2063.

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

Background <p>The grim (<10% 5-year) survival rates for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are attributed to its complex intrinsic biology and most often late-stage detection. The overlap of symptoms with benign gastrointestinal conditions in early stage further complicates timely detection. The suboptimal diagnostic performance of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 and elevation in benign hyperbilirubinaemia undermine its reliability, leaving a notable absence of accurate diagnostic biomarkers. Using a selected patient cohort with benign pancreatic and biliary tract conditions we aimed to develop a data analysis protocol leading to a biomarker signature capable of distinguishing patients with non-specific yet concerning clinical presentations, from those with PDAC.</p> Methods <p>539 patient serum samples collected under the Accelerated Diagnosis of neuro Endocrine and Pancreatic TumourS (ADEPTS) study (benign disease controls and PDACs) and the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS, healthy controls) were screened using the Olink Oncology II panel, supplemented with five in-house markers. 16 specialized base-learner classifiers were stacked to select and enhance biomarker performances and robustness in blinded samples. Each base-learner was constructed through cross-validation and recursive feature elimination in a discovery set comprising approximately two thirds of the ADEPTS and UKCTOCS samples and contrasted specific diagnosis with PDAC.</p> Results <p>The signature which was developed using diagnosis-specific ensemble learning demonstrated predictive capabilities outperforming CA19-9, the only biomarker currently accepted by the FDA and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for pancreatic cancer, and other individual biomarkers and combinations in both discovery and held-out validation sets. An AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98–0.99) and sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1) at 90% specificity was achieved with the ensemble method, which was significantly larger than the AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66–0.91) and sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI 0.50–0.83), also at 90% specificity, for CA19-9, in the discovery set (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.00050, respectively). During ensemble signature validation in the held-out set, an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–0.99), sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI 0.68–1), was attained compared to an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66–0.93), sensitivity 0.65 (95% CI 0.48–0.56) at 90% specificity for CA19-9 alone (p = 0.0082 and p = 0.024, respectively). When validated only on the benign disease controls and PDACs collected from ADEPTS, the diagnostic-specific signature achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–0.99), sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.64–0.95) at 90% specificity, which was still significantly higher than the performance for CA19-9 taken as a single predictor, AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.64–0.93) and sensitivity of 0.18 (95% CI 0.03–0.69) (p = 0.013 and p = 0.0055, respectively).</p> Conclusion <p>Our ensemble modelling technique outperformed CA19-9, individual biomarkers and indices developed with prevailing algorithms in distinguishing patients with non-specific but concerning symptoms from those with PDAC, with implications for improving its early detection in individuals at risk.</p>

Mobile genetic elements shape microbial gene repertoires and populations. Recent results reveal that many, possibly most, microbial mobile genetic elements require helpers to transfer between genomes, which we refer to as Hitcher Genetic Elements (hitchers or HGEs). They may be a large fraction of pathogenicity and resistance genomic islands, whose mechanisms of transfer have remained enigmatic for decades. Together with their helper elements and their bacterial hosts, hitchers form tripartite networks of interactions that evolve rapidly within a parasitism–mutualism continuum. In this emerging view of microbial genomes as communities of mobile genetic elements many questions arise. Which elements are being moved, by whom, and how? How often are hitchers costly hyper-parasites or beneficial mutualists? What is the evolutionary origin of hitchers? Are there key advantages associated with hitchers’ lifestyle that justify their unexpected abundance? And why are hitchers systematically smaller than their helpers? In this essay, we start answering these questions and point ways ahead for understanding the principles, origin, mechanisms, and impact of hitchers in bacterial ecology and evolution.

The widespread sharing of information on the Internet has given rise to ecological studies that use data from digital sources including digitized museum records and social media posts. Most of these studies have focused on understanding species occurrences and distributions. In this essay, we argue that data from digital sources also offer many opportunities to study animal behavior including long-term and large-scale comparisons within and between species. Following Nikko Tinbergen’s classical roadmap for behavioral investigation, we show how using videos, photos, text, and audio posted on social media and other digital platforms can shed new light on known behaviors, particularly in a changing world, and lead to the discovery of new ones.

                <p>by Nicolas Loiseau, David Mouillot, Laure Velez, Raphaël Seguin, Nicolas Casajus, Camille Coux, Camille Albouy, Thomas Claverie, Agnès Duhamet, Valentine Fleure, Juliette Langlois, Sébastien Villéger, Nicolas Mouquet</p>

While extinction risk categorization is fundamental for building robust conservation planning for marine fishes, empirical data on occurrence and vulnerability to disturbances are still lacking for most marine teleost fish species, preventing the assessment of their International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status. In this article, we predicted the IUCN status of marine fishes based on two machine learning algorithms, trained with available species occurrences, biological traits, taxonomy, and human uses. We found that extinction risk for marine fish species is higher than initially estimated by the IUCN, increasing from 2.5% to 12.7%. Species predicted as Threatened were mainly characterized by a small geographic range, a relatively large body size, and a low growth rate. Hotspots of predicted Threatened species peaked mainly in the South China Sea, the Philippine Sea, the Celebes Sea, the west coast Australia and North America. We also explored the consequences of including these predicted species’ IUCN status in the prioritization of marine protected areas through conservation planning. We found a marked increase in prioritization ranks for subpolar and polar regions despite their low species richness. We suggest to integrate multifactorial ensemble learning to assess species extinction risk and offer a more complete view of endangered taxonomic groups to ultimately reach global conservation targets like the extending coverage of protected areas where species are the most vulnerable.

The chelicerate body plan is distinguished from other arthropod groups by its division of segments into 2 tagmata: the anterior prosoma (“cephalothorax”) and the posterior opisthosoma (“abdomen”). Little is understood about the genetic mechanisms that establish the prosomal-opisthosomal (PO) boundary. To discover these mechanisms, we created high-quality genomic resources for the large-bodied spider <i>Aphonopelma hentzi</i>. We sequenced specific territories along the antero-posterior axis of developing embryos and applied differential gene expression analyses to identify putative regulators of regional identity. After bioinformatic screening for candidate genes that were consistently highly expressed in only 1 tagma (either the prosoma or the opisthosoma), we validated the function of highly ranked candidates in the tractable spider model <i>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</i>. Here, we show that an arthropod homolog of the Iroquois complex of homeobox genes is required for proper formation of the boundary between arachnid tagmata. The function of this homolog had not been previously characterized, because it was lost in the common ancestor of Pancrustacea, precluding its investigation in well-studied insect model organisms. Knockdown of the spider copy of this gene, which we designate as <i>waist-less</i>, in <i>P</i>. <i>tepidariorum</i> resulted in embryos with defects in the PO boundary, incurring discontinuous spider germ bands. We show that <i>waist-less</i> is required for proper specification of the segments that span the prosoma-opisthosoma boundary, which in adult spiders corresponds to the narrowed pedicel. Our results demonstrate the requirement of an ancient, taxon-restricted paralog for the establishment of the tagmatic boundary that defines Chelicerata.

Abdominopelvic forms are relatively rare and may involve the colon as a solid mass, mimicking a malignant tumor. Case presentation A 68-year-old Tunisian man, with a history of diabetes, hypertension, penicillin allergy, and renal failure, presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction. CT scan showed an acute intestinal obstruction upstream with obstructive tissular mass at the sigmoid colon. Emergency surgery revealed a sigmoid mass and a pre-perforative cecum. Total colectomy was performed, with ileostomy and distal end closure. Histological examination confirmed Actinomyces infection. The patient was then placed on long-term doxycycline and Bactrim, with no recurrence over a 9-month follow-up period. Conclusion Abdominal actinomycosis, though rare, presents diagnostic challenges. It can be mistaken for malignancy, leading to unnecessary surgery in non-complicated cases, since it is effectively treated by antibiotics. In complicated cases, a combined approach involving both surgery and antibiotic therapy is necessary until the infection is completely eradicated.

                Background Bacterial infections continue to pose a global health challenge, driven by antibiotic resistance and septicemia. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in bacterial infections versus non-infectious causes of inflammation. Methods A prospective study included 164 adult patients who were divided into two groups: a group of patients with confirmed bacterial infections and a second group of patients with other diagnoses (inflammatory pathologies, neoplasms, venous thromboembolic diseases, etc.). NLR and PLR values were compared between the bacterial infection group and the non-infectious causes group and the diagnostic performances of NLR and PLR for detecting bacterial infections were evaluated in comparison with other infection markers. Results NLR and PLR were significantly higher in bacterial infections (p < 10^-6), and NLR was correlated positively with inflammation markers. NLR and PLR demonstrated significant potential in diagnosing bacterial infections, with an AUC of 0.72 and 0.60, respectively, using the following cutoff values: 4.3 for NLR and 183 for PLR. Conclusion These findings underscore the importance of NLR and PLR as adjunctive tools for bacterial infection diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23635?af=R">Time cells in the retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a key component of the brain's memory systems, with anatomical connections to the hippocampus, anterior thalamus, and entorhinal cortex. This circuit has been implicated in episodic memory and many of these structures have been shown to encode temporal information, which is critical for episodic memory. For example, hippocampal time cells reliably fire during specific segments of time during a delay period. Although RSC lesions are known to disrupt temporal memory, time cells have not been observed there. In this study, we reanalyzed archival RSC neuronal firing data during the intertrial delay period from two previous experiments involving different behavioral tasks, a blocked alternation task and a cued T-maze task. For the blocked alternation task, rats were required to approach the east or west arm of a plus maze for reward during different blocks of trials. Because the reward locations were not cued, the rat had to remember the goal location for each trial. In the cued T-maze task, the reward location was explicitly cued with a light and the rats simply had to approach the light for reward, so there was no requirement to hold a memory during the intertrial delay. Time cells were prevalent in the blocked alternation task, and most time cells clearly differentiated the east and west trials. We also found that RSC neurons could exhibit off-response time fields, periods of reliably inhibited firing. Time cells were also observed in the cued T-maze, but they were less prevalent and they did not differentiate left and right trials as well as in the blocked alternation task, suggesting that RSC time cells are sensitive to the memory demands of the task. These results suggest that temporal coding is a prominent feature of RSC firing patterns, consistent with an RSC role in episodic memory.</p>

                The human voice is a potent social signal and a distinctive marker of individual identity. As individuals go through puberty, their voices undergo acoustic changes, setting them apart from others. In this article, we propose that hormonal fluctuations in conjunction with morphological vocal tract changes during puberty establish a sensitive developmental phase that affects the monitoring of the adolescent voice and, specifically, self–other distinction. Furthermore, the protracted maturation of brain regions responsible for voice processing, coupled with the dynamically evolving social environment of adolescents, likely disrupts a clear differentiation of the self-voice from others’ voices. This socioneuroendocrine framework offers a holistic understanding of voice monitoring during adolescence.

                HIV disease remains prevalent in the USA and chronic kidney disease remains a major cause of morbidity in HIV-1-positive patients. Host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) is a sensor for viral dsRNA, including HIV-1. We show that PKR inhibition by compound C16 ameliorates the HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) kidney phenotype in the Tg26 transgenic mouse model, with reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction. Combined analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was one of the most downregulated pathways and identified signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) as a potential mediating factor. We identified in Tg26 mice a novel proximal tubular cell cluster enriched in mitochondrial transcripts. Podocytes showed high levels of HIV-1 gene expression and dysregulation of cytoskeleton-related genes, and these cells dedifferentiated. In injured proximal tubules, cell-cell interaction analysis indicated activation of the pro-fibrogenic PKR-STAT3-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-D pathway. These findings suggest that PKR inhibition and mitochondrial rescue are potential novel therapeutic approaches for HIVAN.

                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>’s (<i>Mtb</i>) autarkic lifestyle within the host involves rewiring its transcriptional networks to combat host-induced stresses. With the help of RNA sequencing performed under various stress conditions, we identified that genes belonging to <i>Mtb</i> sulfur metabolism pathways are significantly upregulated during oxidative stress. Using an integrated approach of microbial genetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, animal experiments, chemical inhibition, and rescue studies, we investigated the biological role of non-canonical <span class="small-caps">L</span>-cysteine synthases, CysM and CysK2. While transcriptome signatures of <i>RvΔcysM</i> and <i>RvΔcysK2</i> appear similar under regular growth conditions, we observed unique transcriptional signatures when subjected to oxidative stress. We followed pool size and labelling (<sup>34</sup>S) of key downstream metabolites, viz. mycothiol and ergothioneine, to monitor L-cysteine biosynthesis and utilization. This revealed the significant role of distinct L-cysteine biosynthetic routes on redox stress and homeostasis. CysM and CysK2 independently facilitate <i>Mtb</i> survival by alleviating host-induced redox stress, suggesting they are not fully redundant during infection. With the help of genetic mutants and chemical inhibitors, we show that CysM and CysK2 serve as unique, attractive targets for adjunct therapy to combat mycobacterial infection.

                Epithelial damage leads to early reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, which regulates sensory neuron regeneration and tissue repair. How the initial type of tissue injury influences early damage signaling and regenerative growth of sensory axons remains unclear. Previously we reported that thermal injury triggers distinct early tissue responses in larval zebrafish. Here, we found that thermal but not mechanical injury impairs sensory axon regeneration and function. Real-time imaging revealed an immediate tissue response to thermal injury characterized by the rapid Arp2/3-dependent migration of keratinocytes, which was associated with tissue scale ROS production and sustained sensory axon damage. Isotonic treatment was sufficient to limit keratinocyte movement, spatially restrict ROS production, and rescue sensory neuron function. These results suggest that early keratinocyte dynamics regulate the spatial and temporal pattern of long-term signaling in the wound microenvironment during tissue repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92195">TRIP13 localizes to synapsed chromosomes and functions as a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic progression requires coordinated assembly and disassembly of protein complexes involved in chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination. Mouse TRIP13 and its ortholog Pch2 are instrumental in remodeling HORMA domain proteins. HORMAD proteins are associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes but depleted from the synaptonemal complex (SC) of synapsed homologs. Here we report that TRIP13 localizes to the synapsed SC in early pachytene spermatocytes and to telomeres throughout meiotic prophase I. Loss of TRIP13 leads to meiotic arrest and thus sterility in both sexes. <i>Trip13</i>-null meiocytes exhibit abnormal persistence of HORMAD1 and HOMRAD2 on synapsed SC and chromosome asynapsis that preferentially affects XY and centromeric ends. These major phenotypes are consistent with reported phenotypes of <i>Trip13</i> hypomorph alleles. <i>Trip13</i> heterozygous mice exhibit meiotic defects that are less severe than the <i>Trip13</i>-null mice, showing that TRIP13 is a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis. Localization of TRIP13 to the synapsed SC is independent of SC axial element proteins such as REC8 and SYCP2/SYCP3. Terminal FLAG-tagged TRIP13 proteins are functional and recapitulate the localization of native TRIP13 to SC and telomeres. Therefore, the evolutionarily conserved localization of TRIP13/Pch2 to the synapsed chromosomes provides an explanation for dissociation of HORMA domain proteins upon synapsis in diverse organisms.

                Neurotensin (Nts) is a neuropeptide acting as a neuromodulator in the brain. Pharmacological studies have identified Nts as a potent hypothermic agent. The medial preoptic area, a region that plays an important role in the control of thermoregulation, contains a high density of neurotensinergic neurons and Nts receptors. The conditions in which neurotensinergic neurons play a role in thermoregulation are not known. In this study, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons induced a small hyperthermia. In vitro, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons resulted in synaptic release of GABA and net inhibition of the preoptic pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (Adcyap1) neurons firing activity. GABA-A receptor antagonist or genetic deletion of Slc32a1 (VGAT) in Nts neurons unmasked also an excitatory effect that was blocked by a Nts receptor 1 antagonist. Stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons lacking <i>Slc32a1</i> resulted in excitation of <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons and hypothermia. Mice lacking <i>Slc32a1</i> expression in Nts neurons presented changes in the fever response and in the responses to heat or cold exposure as well as an altered circadian rhythm of body temperature. Chemogenetic activation of all Nts neurons in the brain induced a 4–5°C hypothermia, which could be blocked by Nts receptor antagonists in the preoptic area. Chemogenetic activation of preoptic neurotensinergic projections resulted in robust excitation of preoptic <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endogenously released Nts can induce potent hypothermia and that excitation of preoptic <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons is the cellular mechanism that triggers this response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95028">Detection of TurboID fusion proteins by fluorescent streptavidin outcompetes antibody signals and visualises targets not accessible to antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Immunofluorescence localises proteins via fluorophore-labelled antibodies. However, some proteins evade detection due to antibody-accessibility issues or because they are naturally low abundant or antigen density is reduced by the imaging method. Here, we show that the fusion of the target protein to the biotin ligase TurboID and subsequent detection of biotinylation by fluorescent streptavidin offers an ‘all in one’ solution to these restrictions. For all proteins tested, the streptavidin signal was significantly stronger than an antibody signal, markedly improving the sensitivity of expansion microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy. Importantly, proteins within phase-separated regions, such as the central channel of the nuclear pores, the nucleolus, or RNA granules, were readily detected with streptavidin, while most antibodies failed. When TurboID is used in tandem with an HA epitope tag, co-probing with streptavidin and anti-HA can map antibody-accessibility and we created such a map for the trypanosome nuclear pore. Lastly, we show that streptavidin imaging resolves dynamic, temporally, and spatially distinct sub-complexes and, in specific cases, reveals a history of dynamic protein interaction. In conclusion, streptavidin imaging has major advantages for the detection of lowly abundant or inaccessible proteins and in addition, provides information on protein interactions and biophysical environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91097">Long-distance electron transport in multicellular freshwater cable bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Filamentous multicellular cable bacteria perform centimeter-scale electron transport in a process that couples oxidation of an electron donor (sulfide) in deeper sediment to the reduction of an electron acceptor (oxygen or nitrate) near the surface. While this electric metabolism is prevalent in both marine and freshwater sediments, detailed electronic measurements of the conductivity previously focused on the marine cable bacteria (<i>Candidatus</i> Electrothrix), rather than freshwater cable bacteria, which form a separate genus (<i>Candidatus</i> Electronema) and contribute essential geochemical roles in freshwater sediments. Here, we characterize the electron transport characteristics of <i>Ca</i>. Electronema cable bacteria from Southern California freshwater sediments. Current–voltage measurements of intact cable filaments bridging interdigitated electrodes confirmed their persistent conductivity under a controlled atmosphere and the variable sensitivity of this conduction to air exposure. Electrostatic and conductive atomic force microscopies mapped out the characteristics of the cell envelope’s nanofiber network, implicating it as the conductive pathway in a manner consistent with previous findings in marine cable bacteria. Four-probe measurements of microelectrodes addressing intact cables demonstrated nanoampere currents up to 200 μm lengths at modest driving voltages, allowing us to quantify the nanofiber conductivity at 0.1 S/cm for freshwater cable bacteria filaments under our measurement conditions. Such a high conductivity can support the remarkable sulfide-to-oxygen electrical currents mediated by cable bacteria in sediments. These measurements expand the knowledgebase of long-distance electron transport to the freshwater niche while shedding light on the underlying conductive network of cable bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92345">Polysaccharides induce deep-sea Lentisphaerae strains to release chronic bacteriophages</a></h4>

              
                Viruses are ubiquitous in nature and play key roles in various ecosystems. Notably, some viruses (e.g. bacteriophage) exhibit alternative life cycles, such as chronic infections without cell lysis. However, the impact of chronic infections and their interactions with the host organisms remains largely unknown. Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induced the production of multiple temperate phages infecting two deep-sea <i>Lentisphaerae</i> strains (WC36 and zth2). Through physiological assays, genomic analysis, and transcriptomics assays, we found these bacteriophages were released via a chronic style without host cell lysis, which might reprogram host polysaccharide metabolism through the potential auxiliary metabolic genes. The findings presented here, together with recent discoveries made on the reprogramming of host energy-generating metabolisms by chronic bacteriophages, shed light on the poorly explored marine virus–host interaction and bring us closer to understanding the potential role of chronic viruses in marine ecosystems.

	<p>Background: Psychotic disorders are major psychiatric disorders that can impact multiple domains including physical, social, and psychological functioning within individuals with these conditions. Being able to better predict the outcomes of psychotic disorders will allow clinicians to identify illness subgroups and optimize treatment strategies in a timely manner. Objective: In this scoping review, we aimed to examine the accuracy of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in predicting the clinical outcomes of patients with psychotic disorders as well as determine the relevant predictors of these outcomes. Methods: This review was guided by the PRISMA Guidelines for Scoping Reviews. Seven electronic databases were searched for relevant published articles in English until 1 February 2024. Results: Thirty articles were included in this review. These studies were mainly conducted in the West (63%) and Asia (37%) and published within the last 5 years (83.3%). The clinical outcomes included symptomatic improvements, illness course, and social functioning. The machine learning models utilized data from various sources including clinical, cognitive, and biological variables such as genetic, neuroimaging measures. In terms of main machine learning models used, the most common approaches were support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression, and linear regression models. No specific machine learning approach outperformed the other approaches consistently across the studies, and an overall range of predictive accuracy was observed with an AUC from 0.58 to 0.95. Specific predictors of clinical outcomes included demographic characteristics (gender, socioeconomic status, accommodation, education, and employment); social factors (activity level and interpersonal relationships); illness features (number of relapses, duration of relapses, hospitalization rates, cognitive impairments, and negative and disorganization symptoms); treatment (prescription of first-generation antipsychotics, high antipsychotic doses, clozapine, use of electroconvulsive therapy, and presence of metabolic syndrome); and structural and functional neuroimaging abnormalities, especially involving the temporal and frontal brain regions. Conclusions: The current review highlights the potential and need to further refine AI and machine learning models in parsing out the complex interplay of specific variables that contribute to the clinical outcome prediction of psychotic disorders.</p>

	<p>Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is typically characterized by headaches and vision loss. However, neurocognitive deficits are also described. Our study aimed to test the influence of therapeutic lumbar puncture on the latter. Methods: A total of 15 patients with IIH were tested with a battery of neurocognitive tests at baseline and after therapeutic lumbar drainage. Hereby, Logical Memory of the Wechsler Memory Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised Edition (WMS-R), the California Verbal Learning Test Short Version (CVLT), alertness, selective attention, and word fluency were used. Changes in cognitive functioning in the course of CSF pressure lowering were analysed and compared with age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls. Results: Before intervention, scores of Logical Memory, the RWT, and the HADS-D were significantly lower in IIH patients compared to matched controls. After short-term normalization of CSF pressure, the RWT improved significantly. Additionally, significant positive correlations were found between headache intensity and subjective impairment, as well as between BMI and CSF opening pressure. Conclusions: Our findings confirm lower performance in terms of long-term verbal memory and word fluency compared to controls, as well as depressive symptoms in IIH patients. Significant improvement after short-term normalization of intracranial pressure by means of CSF drainage was seen only for word fluency. This indicates that short-term normalization of CSF pressure is not sufficient to normalize observed neurocognitive deficits.</p>

	<p>Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists, such as betahistine (BHTE), have shown significant potential in treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders due to their neuroprotective properties. This study investigated BHTE&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurotoxicity, which is associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Rats were divided into groups and pre-treated with BHTE (5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) for 30 days, followed by LPS administration (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days to induce neurotoxicity. LPS exposure resulted in cognitive impairment, as evidenced by performance deficits in maze tests, and a significant reduction in brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. Additionally, LPS led to increased neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Pre-treatment with BHTE effectively counteracted these effects, improving cognitive performance and restoring ACh levels. BHTE significantly reduced LPS-induced increases in pro-inflammatory markers (COX-2, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, and IL-6) while enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-&amp;amp;beta;1). Furthermore, BHTE improved mitochondrial function by increasing enzyme levels (MRCC-I, II, and IV) and boosted anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and antioxidant defenses (GSH and catalase). BHTE also reduced apoptosis markers, including pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3, and oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA). Molecular modeling studies revealed that BHTE effectively binds to key enzymes involved in neuroinflammation and apoptosis (AChE, COX-2, and caspase-3), with binding free energies between 4 and 5 kcal/mol, interacting with critical residues. These findings underscore BHTE&amp;amp;rsquo;s multifaceted neuroprotective effects against LPS-induced neurotoxicity, offering potential therapeutic avenues for managing neuroinflammation and related neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

	<p>Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modulates the noradrenergic activity of the locus coeruleus (LC). Yet, there is still uncertainty about the most effective stimulation and reliable outcome parameters. In a double blind, sham-controlled study including a sample of healthy young individuals (N = 29), we compared a shorter (3.4 s) and a longer (30 s) stimulation duration and investigated the effects of taVNS (real vs. sham) on saliva samples (alpha amylase and cortisol concentration), pupil (pupillary light reflex and pupil size at rest) and EEG data (alpha and theta activity at rest, ERPs for No-Go signals), and cognitive tasks (Go/No-Go and Stop Signal Tasks). Salivary alpha amylase concentration was significantly increased in the real as compared to sham stimulation for the 30 s stimulation condition. In the 3.4 s stimulation condition, we found prolonged reaction times and increased error rates in the Go/No-Go task and increased maximum acceleration in the pupillary light reflex. For the other outcomes, no significant differences were found. Our results show that prolonged stimulation increases salivary alpha-amylase, which was expected from the functional properties of the LC. The finding of longer response times to short taVNS stimulation was not expected and cannot be explained by an increase in LC activity. We also discuss the difficulties in assessing pupil size as an expression of taVNS-mediated LC functional changes.</p>

	<p>Selection history is widely accepted as a vital source in attention control. Reward history indicates that a learned association captures attention even when the reward is no longer presented, while statistical learning indicates that a learned probability exerts its influence on attentional control (facilitation or inhibition). Existing research has shown that the effects of the reward history and statistical learning are additive, suggesting that these two components influence attention priority through different pathways. In the current study, leveraging the temporal resolution advantages of EEG, we explored whether these two components represent independent sources of attentional bias. The results revealed faster responses to the target at the high-probability location compared to low-probability locations. Both the target and distractor at high-probability locations elicited larger early Pd (50&amp;amp;ndash;150 ms) and Pd (150&amp;amp;ndash;250 ms) components. The reward distractor slowed the target search and elicited a larger N2pc (180&amp;amp;ndash;350 ms). Further, no interaction between statistical learning and the reward history was observed in RTs or N2pc. The different types of temporal progression in attention control indicate that statistical learning and the reward history independently modulate the attention priority map.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Our team has previously introduced the Single-Step Pedicle Screw System (SSPSS), which eliminates the need for K-wires, as a safe and effective method for percutaneous minimally invasive spine (MIS) pedicle screw placement. Despite this, there are ongoing concerns about the reliability and accuracy of screw placement in MIS procedures without traditional tools like K-wires and Jamshidi needles. To address these concerns, we evaluated the accuracy of the SSPSS workflow by comparing the planned intraoperative screw trajectories with the final screw positions. Traditionally, screw placement accuracy has been assessed by grading the final screw position using postoperative CT scans. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent lumbar interbody fusion, using intraoperative 3D navigation for screw placement. The planned screw trajectories were saved in the navigation system during each procedure, and postoperative CT scans were used to evaluate the implanted screws. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the Gertzbein and Robbins classification scores of the planned trajectories and the final screw positions. Accuracy was defined as a final screw position matching the classification of the planned trajectory. (3) Results: Out of 206 screws, 196 (95%) were accurately placed, with no recorded complications. (4) Conclusions: The SSPSS workflow, even without K-wires and other traditional instruments, facilitates accurate and reliable pedicle screw placement.</p>

	<p>A two-factor account has been proposed as an explanatory model for the formation and maintenance of delusions. The first factor refers to a neurocognitive process leading to a significant change in subjective experience; the second factor has been regarded as a failure in hypothesis evaluation characterized by an impairment in metacognitive ability. This study was focused on the assessment of metacognition in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the study were to measure the overconfidence in metacognitive judgments through the prediction of word list recall and to analyze the correlation between basic neurocognition (memory and executive function) and metacognition through a metamemory test and the severity of psychotic symptoms. Method: Fifty-one participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were evaluated. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to assess the severity of psychiatric symptoms, and the subtest of metamemory included in the Executive Functions and Frontal Lobe-2 battery (BANFE-2) was used to evaluate overconfidence and underestimation errors, intrusion and perseverative response, total volume of recall, and Brief Functioning Assessment Scale (FAST) for social functioning. Results: The strongest correlation is observed between overconfidence errors and the positive factor of the PANSS (r = 0.774, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). For the enter model in the multiple linear regression (r = 0.78, r2 = 0.61; F = 24.57, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), the only significant predictor was overconfidence errors. Conclusion: Our results highlight the relevance of a metacognitive bias of overconfidence, strongly correlated with psychotic symptoms, and support the hypothesis that metacognitive defects contribute to the failure to reject contradictory evidence. From our perspective, these findings align with current mechanistic models of schizophrenia that focus on the role of the prefrontal cortex.</p>

                Background In recent years, the incidence of early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) has increased. Several studies comparing the survival of patients with EOPC to those with average-onset pancreatic cancer (AOPC) have reported mixed results. We aimed, therefore, to perform a meta-analysis summarizing the current evidence. Methods We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for relevant articles published through March 2024. Articles comparing the survival of patients with EOPC – defined as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed at ≤ 50 years of age – and AOPC were included in the present meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the pooled adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), and the risk of bias analysis was performed using the Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies tool. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Results A total of 17 studies were eligible for the primary analysis, the results of which indicated that patients with EOPC had a longer overall survival than those with AOPC (aHR = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74–0.86; P < 0.001). The rate of distant metastasis was higher in EOPC than AOPC; however, patients with EOPC also received more treatments than those with AOPC. Conclusions Patients with EOPC had a better prognosis than those with AOPC. Clinicians must ensure that patients with PDAC receive early and appropriate treatment to improve their survival.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-975/v1?src=rss">Validating instructional practice scale for university instructors in Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Measurement is essential for methods of instruction to be successful. Having an instrument that is reliable and validated in the given setting is vital. The primary goal of this research project is to validate the instructional practice scale (IPS) for university instructors in the Ethiopian context. Methods By implementing a cross-sectional descriptive survey research design, 1,254 participants across four public universities – Arbaminch, Dilla, Wachamo, and Jinka representing the first, second, third, and fourth generations, respectively were randomly selected and participated. The data was split in half and underwent an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results The three components of the EFA were alternately filled with seventeen items that satisfied certain standards, had a loading value of > .5, and a Cronbach alpha of ≥ .874. The factors identified in the EFA have been confirmed to be the thirteen items with loading, Cronbach alpha, Raykov’s rho coefficient (rho_A), composite reliability (CR) value of >.7, and Average Variance Explained (AVE) value of > .5. Tests of measurement and structural models showed a good fit. The Fornell-Larcker criterion, which is employed in discriminant validity analysis, demonstrates that the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the correlation it exhibits with other constructs. The correlations’ heterotrait–monotrait (HTMT) ratio is getting close to zero, and there isn’t one in the confidence interval at the.05 significance level. Both guaranteed strong discriminant validity. Conclusion For university instructors, the 13 items generally have powerful psychometric properties. The three subsections of the instruction practice scale—planning (4 indicators), delivering (4 indicators), and assessment (5 indicators) — are meant to measure the instructional practice effectively. Implications of the findings were further discussed.

                <p>Sensory axons projecting to the central nervous system are organized into topographic maps that represent the locations of sensory stimuli. In some sensory systems, even adjacent sensory axons are arranged topographically, forming "fine-scale" topographic maps. Although several broad molecular gradients are known to instruct coarse topography, we know little about the molecular signaling that regulates fine-scale topography at the level of two adjacent axons. Here, we provide evidence that transsynaptic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling mediates local interneuronal communication to regulate fine-scale topography in the nociceptive system of <I>Drosophila</I> larvae. We first show that the topographic separation of the axon terminals of adjacent nociceptors requires their common postsynaptic target, the A08n neurons. This phenotype is recapitulated by knockdown of the BMP ligand, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), in these neurons. In addition, removing the Type 2 BMP receptors or their effector (Mad transcription factor) in single nociceptors impairs the fine-scale topography, suggesting the contribution of BMP signaling originated from A08n. This signaling is likely mediated by phospho-Mad in the presynaptic terminals of nociceptors to ensure local interneuronal communication. Finally, reducing Dpp levels in A08n reduces the nociceptor-A08n synaptic contacts. Our data support that transsynaptic BMP signaling establishes the fine-scale topography by facilitating the formation of topographically correct synapses. Local BMP signaling for synapse formation may be a developmental strategy that independently regulates neighboring axon terminals for fine-scale topography.</p>

                <p>Animal studies consistently demonstrate that testosterone is protective against pain in multiple models, including an animal model of activity-induced muscle pain. In this model, females develop widespread muscle hyperalgesia, and reducing testosterone levels in males results in widespread muscle hyperalgesia. Widespread pain is believed to be mediated by changes in the central nervous system, including the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). The enzyme that converts testosterone to estradiol, aromatase, is highly expressed in the RVM. Therefore, we hypothesized that testosterone is converted by aromatase to estradiol locally in the RVM to prevent development of widespread muscle hyperalgesia in male mice. This was tested through pharmacological inhibition of estrogen receptors (ERs), aromatase, or ER-&alpha; in the RVM which resulted in contralateral hyperalgesia in male mice (C57BL/6J). ER inhibition in the RVM had no effect on hyperalgesia in female mice. As prior studies show modulation of estradiol signaling alters GABA receptor and transporter expression, we examined if removal of testosterone in males would decrease mRNA expression of GABA receptor subunits and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). However, there were no differences in mRNA expression of GABA receptor subunits of VGAT between gonadectomized and sham control males. Lastly, we used RNAscope to determine expression of ER-&alpha; in the RVM and show expression in inhibitory (VGAT+), serotonergic (tryptophan hydroxylase 2+), and &mu;-opioid receptor expressing (MOR+) cells. In conclusion, testosterone protects males from development of widespread hyperalgesia through aromatization to estradiol and activation of ER-&alpha; which is widely expressed in multiple cell types in the RVM.</p>

                <p>Comorbid chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety is a common disease that represents a major clinical challenge. The underlying mechanisms of chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety are not entirely understood, which limits the exploration of effective treatment methods. Glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) have been implicated in regulating pain, but the potential roles of the vlPAG in neuropathic pain-induced anxiety have not been investigated. Herein, whole-cell recording and immunofluorescence showed that the excitability of CamkII&alpha; neurons in the vlPAG (vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons) was decreased in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI), while electroacupuncture (EA) activated these neurons. We also showed that chemogenetic inhibition of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons resulted in allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors in naive mice. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons reduced anxiety-like behaviors and allodynia in mice with SNI, and EA had a similar effect in alleviating these symptoms. Nevertheless, EA combined with chemogenetic activation failed to further relieve allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors. Artificial inhibition of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons abolished the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of EA. Overall, our study reveals a novel mechanism of neuropathic pain-induced anxiety and shows that EA may relieve comorbid chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety by activating vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons.</p>

                <p>Hunger and thirst drive animals&rsquo; consumption behavior and regulate their decision-making concerning rewards. We previously assessed the thirst states of monkeys by measuring blood osmolality under controlled water access and examined how these thirst states influenced their risk-taking behavior in decisions involving fluid rewards. However, hunger assessment in monkeys remains poorly performed. Moreover, the lack of precise measures for hunger states leads to another issue regarding how hunger and thirst states interact with each other in each individual. Thus, when controlling food access to motivate performance, it remains unclear how these two physiological needs are satisfied in captive monkeys. Here, we measured blood ghrelin and osmolality levels to respectively assess hunger and thirst in four captive macaques. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we identified that the levels of blood ghrelin, a widely measured hunger-related peptide hormone in humans, were high after 20&nbsp;h of no food access (with <I>ad libitum</I> water). This reflects a typical controlled food access condition. One hour after consuming a regular dry meal, the blood ghrelin levels in three out of four monkeys decreased to within their baseline range. Additionally, blood osmolality measured from the same blood sample, the standard hematological index of hydration status, increased after consuming the regular dry meal with no water access. Thus, ghrelin and osmolality may reflect the physiological states of individual monkeys regarding hunger and thirst, suggesting that these indices can be used as tools for monitoring hunger and thirst levels that mediate an animal's decision to consume rewards.</p>

                <p>Recent advances in extracellular electrophysiology now facilitate the recording of spikes from hundreds or thousands of neurons simultaneously. This has necessitated both the development of new computational methods for spike sorting and better methods to determine spike-sorting accuracy. One long-standing method of assessing the false discovery rate (FDR) of spike sorting&mdash;the rate at which spikes are assigned to the wrong cluster&mdash;has been the rate of interspike interval (ISI) violations. Despite their near ubiquitous usage in spike sorting, our understanding of how exactly ISI violations relate to FDR, as well as best practices for using ISI violations as a quality metric, remains limited. Here, we describe an analytical solution that can be used to predict FDR from the ISI violation rate (ISI<SUB>v</SUB>). We test this model in silico through Monte Carlo simulation and apply it to publicly available spike-sorted electrophysiology datasets. We find that the relationship between ISI<SUB>v</SUB> and FDR is highly nonlinear, with additional dependencies on firing frequency, the correlation in activity between neurons, and contaminant neuron count. Predicted median FDRs in public datasets recorded in mice were found to range from 3.1 to 50.0%. We found that stochasticity in the occurrence of ISI violations as well as uncertainty in cluster-specific parameters make it difficult to predict FDR for single clusters with high confidence but that FDR can be estimated accurately across a population of clusters. Our findings will help the growing community of researchers using extracellular electrophysiology assess spike-sorting accuracy in a principled manner.</p>

                <p><I>ATP1A3</I> is a Na,K-ATPase gene expressed specifically in neurons in the brain. Human mutations are dominant and produce an unusually wide spectrum of neurological phenotypes, most notably rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). Here we compared heterozygotes of two mouse lines, a line with little or no expression (<I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup>) and a knock-in expressing p.Asp801Tyr (D801Y, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup>). Both mouse lines had normal lifespans, but <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> had mild perinatal mortality contrasting with D801N mice (<I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801N</sup>), which had high mortality. The phenotypes of <I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> and <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> were different, and testing of each strain was tailored to its symptom range. <I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> mice displayed little at baseline, but repeated ethanol intoxication produced hyperkinetic motor abnormalities not seen in littermate controls. <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice displayed robust phenotypes: hyperactivity, diminished posture consistent with hypotonia, and deficiencies in beam walk and wire hang tests. Symptoms also included qualitative motor abnormalities that are not well quantified by conventional tests. Paradoxically, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> showed sustained better performance than wild type on the accelerating rotarod. <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were overactive in forced swimming and afterward had intense shivering, transient dystonic postures, and delayed recovery. Remarkably, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were refractory to ketamine anesthesia, which elicited hyperactivity and dyskinesia even at higher dose. Neither mouse line exhibited fixed dystonia (typical of RDP patients), spontaneous paroxysmal weakness (typical of AHC patients), or seizures but had consistent, measurable neurological abnormalities. A gradient of variation supports the importance of studying multiple <I>Atp1a3</I> mutations in animal models to understand the roles of this gene in human disease.</p>

                <p>Long-term aluminum (Al) exposure increases the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of the present study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of Al-induced MCI. In our study, a total of 52 individuals with occupational Al exposure &gt;10&nbsp;years were enrolled and divided into two groups: MCI (Al-MCI) and healthy controls (Al-HC). Plasma Al concentrations and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were collected for all participants. And diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to examine changes of white matter (WM) and functional connectivity (FC). There was a negative correlation between MoCA score and plasma Al concentration. Compared with the Al-HC, fractional anisotropy value for the right fornix (cres)/stria terminalis (FX/ST) was higher in the Al-MCI. Furthermore, there was a difference in FC between participants with and without MCI under Al exposure. We defined the regions with differing FC as a "pathway," specifically the connectivity from the right temporal pole to the right FX/ST, then to the right sagittal stratum, and further to the right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri and right inferior frontal gyrus, orbital part. In summary, we believe that the observed differences in WM integrity and FC in the right FX/ST between participants with and without MCI under long-term Al exposure may represent the neural mechanisms underlying MCI induced by Al exposure.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key cortical region for pain perception and emotion. Different forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), have been reported in the ACC. Synaptic tagging of LTP plays an important role in hippocampus-related associative memory. In this study, we demonstrate that synaptic tagging of LTD is detected in the ACC of adult male and female mice. This form of tagged LTD requires the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1). The induction of tagged LTD is time-related with the strongest tagged LTD appearing when the interval between two independent stimuli is 30&nbsp;min. Inhibitors of mGluR1 blocked the induction of tagged LTD; however, blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors did not affect the induction of tagged LTD. Nimodipine, an inhibitor of L-type voltage&ndash;gated calcium channels, also blocked tagged LTD. In an animal model of amputation, we found that tagged LTD was either reduced or completely blocked. Together with our previous report of tagged LTP in the ACC, this study strongly suggests that excitatory synapses in the adult ACC are highly plastic. The biphasic tagging of synaptic transmission provides a new form of heterosynaptic plasticity in the ACC which has functional and pathophysiological significance in phantom pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/35/e0120242024?rss=1">Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens Core Encodes the General Excitatory Components of Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) is generally considered to be a proxy for phasic firing of the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA<SUB>DA</SUB>) neurons. Thus, dopamine release in NAcC is hypothesized to reflect a unitary role in reward prediction error signaling. However, recent studies reveal more diverse roles of dopamine neurons, which support an emerging idea that dopamine regulates learning differently in distinct circuits. To understand whether the NAcC might regulate a unique component of learning, we recorded dopamine release in NAcC while male rats performed a backward conditioning task where a reward is followed by a neutral cue. We used this task because we can delineate different components of learning, which include sensory-specific inhibitory and general excitatory components. Furthermore, we have shown that VTA<SUB>DA</SUB> neurons are necessary for both the specific and general components of backward associations. Here, we found that dopamine release in NAcC increased to the reward across learning while reducing to the cue that followed as it became more expected. This mirrors the dopamine prediction error signal seen during forward conditioning and cannot be accounted for temporal-difference reinforcement learning. Subsequent tests allowed us to dissociate these learning components and revealed that dopamine release in NAcC reflects the general excitatory component of backward associations, but not their sensory-specific component. These results emphasize the importance of examining distinct functions of different dopamine projections in reinforcement learning.</p>
