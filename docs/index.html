<p>by Stewart Heitmann, G. Bard Ermentrout</p>

The majority of neurons in primary visual cortex respond selectively to bars of light that have a specific orientation and move in a specific direction. The spatial and temporal responses of such neurons are non-separable. How neurons accomplish that computational feat without resort to explicit time delays is unknown. We propose a novel neural mechanism whereby visual cortex computes non-separable responses by generating endogenous traveling waves of neural activity that resonate with the space-time signature of the visual stimulus. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the response are defined by the local topology of excitatory and inhibitory lateral connections in the cortex. We simulated the interaction between endogenous traveling waves and the visual stimulus using spatially distributed populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Wilson-Cowan dynamics and inhibitory-surround coupling. Our model reliably detected visual gratings that moved with a given speed and direction provided that we incorporated neural competition to suppress false motion signals in the opposite direction. The findings suggest that endogenous traveling waves in visual cortex can impart direction-selectivity on neural responses without resort to explicit time delays. They also suggest a functional role for motion opponency in eliminating false motion signals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rHG78oa3r3g" width="1" />

<p>by Maxim Igaev, Helmut Grubmüller</p>

Tubulin dimers associate longitudinally and laterally to form metastable microtubules (MTs). MT disassembly is preceded by subtle structural changes in tubulin fueled by GTP hydrolysis. These changes render the MT lattice unstable, but it is unclear exactly how they affect lattice energetics and strain. We performed long-time atomistic simulations to interrogate the impacts of GTP hydrolysis on tubulin lattice conformation, lateral inter-dimer interactions, and (non-)local lateral coordination of dimer motions. The simulations suggest that most of the hydrolysis energy is stored in the lattice in the form of longitudinal strain. While not significantly affecting lateral bond stability, the stored elastic energy results in more strongly confined and correlated dynamics of GDP-tubulins, thereby entropically destabilizing the MT lattice.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aDbDvM1xyZA" width="1" />

<p>The brain is known to be a highly complex, asynchronous dynamical system that
is highly tailored to encode temporal information. However, recent deep
learning approaches to not take advantage of this temporal coding. Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) can be trained using biologically-realistic learning
mechanisms, and can have neuronal activation rules that are biologically
relevant. This type of network is also structured fundamentally around
accepting temporal information through a time-decaying voltage update, a kind
of input that current rate-encoding networks have difficulty with. Here we show
that a large, deep layered SNN with dynamical, chaotic activity mimicking the
mammalian cortex with biologically-inspired learning rules, such as STDP, is
capable of encoding information from temporal data. We argue that the
randomness inherent in the network weights allow the neurons to form groups
that encode the temporal data being inputted after self-organizing with STDP.
We aim to show that precise timing of input stimulus is critical in forming
synchronous neural groups in a layered network. We analyze the network in terms
of network entropy as a metric of information transfer. We hope to tackle two
problems at once: the creation of artificial temporal neural systems for
artificial intelligence, as well as solving coding mechanisms in the brain.

<p>Extracting behavioral measurements non-invasively from video is stymied by
the fact that it is a hard computational problem. Recent advances in deep
learning have tremendously advanced predicting posture from videos directly,
which quickly impacted neuroscience and biology more broadly. In this primer we
review the budding field of motion capture with deep learning. In particular,
we will discuss the principles of those novel algorithms, highlight their

<p>Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs) use time as a resource to represent and
process information, mimicking the behavior of the mammalian neocortex. This
work focuses on implementing TNNs using off-the-shelf digital CMOS technology.
A microarchitecture framework is introduced with a hierarchy of building blocks
including: multi-neuron columns, multi-column layers, and multi-layer TNNs. We
present the direct CMOS gate-level implementation of the multi-neuron column
model as the key building block for TNNs. Post-synthesis results are obtained
using Synopsys tools and the 45 nm CMOS standard cell library. The TNN
microarchitecture framework is embodied in a set of characteristic equations
for assessing the total gate count, die area, compute time, and power
consumption for any TNN design. We develop a multi-layer TNN prototype of 32M
gates. In 7 nm CMOS process, it consumes only 1.54 mm^2 die area and 7.26 mW
power and can process 28x28 images at 107M FPS (9.34 ns per image). We evaluate
the prototype's performance and complexity relative to a recent
state-of-the-art TNN model.

<p>Reservoir computing is a machine learning paradigm in which a
high-dimensional dynamical system, or \emph{reservoir}, is used to approximate
and perform predictions on time series data. Its simple training procedure
allows for very large reservoirs that can provide powerful computational
capabilities. The scale, speed and power-usage characteristics of reservoir
computing could be enhanced by constructing reservoirs out of electronic
circuits, but this requires a precise understanding of how such circuits
process and store information. We analyze the feasibility and optimal design of
such reservoirs by considering the equations of motion of circuits that include
both linear elements (resistors, inductors, and capacitors) and nonlinear
memory elements (called memristors). This complements previous studies, which
have examined such systems through simulation and experiment. We provide
analytic results regarding the fundamental feasibility of such reservoirs, and
give a systematic characterization of their computational properties, examining
the types of input-output relationships that may be approximated. This allows
us to design reservoirs with optimal properties in terms of their ability to
reconstruct a certain signal (or functions thereof). In particular, by
introducing measures of the total linear and nonlinear computational capacities
of the reservoir, we are able to design electronic circuits whose total
computation capacity scales linearly with the system size. Comparison with
conventional echo state reservoirs show that these electronic reservoirs can
match or exceed their performance in a form that may be directly implemented in
hardware.

<p>Complex systems are difficult to model and analyse with traditional
mathematics, e.g. analytically solving differential equations. To better
understand such systems, we recently presented a system metamodel to provide an
algorithmic alternative to analytical methods and were able to create
simulations of complex systems modelled as cellular automata and artificial
neural networks. In this study we extend our system metamodel with the concept
of adaption in order to integrate evolutionary computation in our so-called
allagmatic method. Adaption is described in the context of our system metamodel
and the allagmatic method, defined and implemented, and computational
experiments with cellular automata and artificial neural networks performed. We
find that the system metamodel of the allagmatic method integrates adaptation
with an additional operation called adaptation function that operates on the
update function, which encodes the system's dynamics. It allows the creation of
evolutionary computations by providing an abstract template for adaptation and
guidance for implementation with the system metamodel. The creation of the
system metamodel was first inspired by abstract concepts of the philosophy of
individuation of Gilbert Simondon. The theoretical background for the concept
of adaptation in this study is taken from the philosophy of organism of Alfred
North Whitehead.

<p>Semantic segmentation of neuronal structures in 3D high-resolution
fluorescence microscopy imaging of the human brain cortexcan take advantage of
bidimensional CNNs, which yield good resultsin neuron localization but lead to
inaccurate surface reconstruction. 3DCNNs on the other hand would require
manually annotated volumet-ric data on a large scale, and hence considerable
human effort. Semi-supervised alternative strategies which make use only of
sparse anno-tations suffer from longer training times and achieved models tend
tohave increased capacity compared to 2D CNNs, needing more groundtruth data to
attain similar results. To overcome these issues we proposea two-phase strategy
for training native 3D CNN models on sparse 2Dannotations where missing labels
are inferred by a 2D CNN model andcombined with manual annotations in a
weighted manner during losscalculation.

<p>Differential equations have been widely and successfully used to describe the
macroscopic or global behaviour of systems in general. With inhomogeneous,
time-varying, specific, and often non-linear interactions, the dynamics of
complex systems is in contrast more efficiently described by local rules and
thus in an algorithmic and local or microscopic manner. In order to create
computer models of systems, particularly complex systems, we recently presented
a so-called allagmatic method including a system metamodel with two concrete
implementations of cellular automata and artificial neural networks. Guidance
from philosophy and its general concepts were helpful in these first studies
focusing on computer modelling and simulation as well as feasibility. A
rigorous mathematical formalism of the system metamodel, however, is still
missing. This would not only more precisely describe and define the system
metamodel, it would also further generalise it and with that extend its reach
to formal treatment in applied mathematics and computational mathematics as
well as extend its applicability to other mathematical models such as
agent-based models. In this study, a mathematical definition of the system

<p>Understanding the decision process underlying gaze control is an important
question in cognitive neuroscience with applications in diverse fields ranging
from psychology to computer vision. The decision for choosing an upcoming
saccade target can be framed as a selection process between two states: Should
the observer further inspect the information near the current gaze position
(local attention) or continue with exploration of other patches of the given
scene (global attention)? Here we propose and investigate a mathematical model
motivated by switching between these two attentional states during scene
viewing. The model is derived from a minimal set of assumptions that generates
realistic eye movement behavior. We implemented a Bayesian approach for model
parameter inference based on the model's likelihood function. In order to
simplify the inference, we applied data augmentation methods that allowed the
use of conjugate priors and the construction of an efficient Gibbs sampler.
This approach turned out to be numerically efficient and permitted fitting
interindividual differences in saccade statistics. Thus, the main contribution
of our modeling approach is two--fold; first, we propose a new model for
saccade generation in scene viewing. Second, we demonstrate the use of novel
methods from Bayesian inference in the field of scan path modeling.

<p>As a discipline cybernetics has a long and rich history. In its first
generation it not only had a worldwide span, in the area of computer modelling,
for example, its proponents such as John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Warren
McCulloch and Walter Pitts, also came up with models and methods such as
cellular automata and artificial neural networks, which are still the
foundation of most modern modelling approaches. At the same time, cybernetics
also got the attention of philosophers, such as the Frenchman Gilbert Simondon,
who made use of cybernetical concepts in order to establish a metaphysics and a
natural philosophy of individuation, giving cybernetics thereby a philosophical
interpretation, which he baptised allagmatic. In this paper, we emphasise this
allagmatic theory by showing how Simondon's philosophical concepts can be used
to formulate a generic computer model or metamodel for complex systems
modelling and its implementation in program code, according to generic
programming. We also present how the developed allagmatic metamodel is capable
of building simple cellular automata and artificial neural networks.

<p>We propose IR2Vec, a Concise and Scalable encoding infrastructure to
represent programs as a distributed embedding in continuous space. This
distributed embedding is obtained by combining representation learning methods
with flow information to capture the syntax as well as the semantics of the
input programs. As our infrastructure is based on the Intermediate
Representation (IR) of the source code, obtained embeddings are both language
and machine independent. The entities of the IR are modeled as relationships,
and their representations are learned to form a seed embedding vocabulary.
Using this infrastructure, we propose two incremental encodings:Symbolic and
Flow-Aware. Symbolic encodings are obtained from the seed embedding vocabulary,
and Flow-Aware encodings are obtained by augmenting the Symbolic encodings with
the flow information.
</p>
<p>We show the effectiveness of our methodology on two optimization tasks
(Heterogeneous device mapping and Thread coarsening). Our way of representing
the programs enables us to use non-sequential models resulting in orders of
magnitude of faster training time. Both the encodings generated by IR2Vec
outperform the existing methods in both the tasks, even while using simple
machine learning models. In particular, our results improve or match the
state-of-the-art speedup in 11/14 benchmark-suites in the device mapping task
across two platforms and 53/68 benchmarks in the Thread coarsening task across
four different platforms. When compared to the other methods, our embeddings
are more scalable, is non-data-hungry, and has betterOut-Of-Vocabulary (OOV)
characteristics.

<p>Many computer models such as cellular automata and artificial neural networks
have been developed and successfully applied. However, in some cases, these
models might be restrictive on the possible solutions or their solutions might
be difficult to interpret. To overcome this problem, we outline a new approach,
the so-called allagmatic method, that automatically programs and executes
models with as little limitations as possible while maintaining human
interpretability. Earlier we described a metamodel and its building blocks
according to the philosophical concepts of structure (spatial dimension) and
operation (temporal dimension). They are entity, milieu, and update function
that together abstractly describe cellular automata, artificial neural
networks, and possibly any kind of computer model. By automatically combining
these building blocks in an evolutionary computation, interpretability might be
increased by the relationship to the metamodel, and models might be translated
into more interpretable models via the metamodel. We propose generic and
object-oriented programming to implement the entities and their milieus as
dynamic and generic arrays and the update function as a method. We show two
experiments where a simple cellular automaton and an artificial neural network
are automatically programmed, compiled, and executed. A target state is
successfully evolved and learned in the cellular automaton and artificial
neural network, respectively. We conclude that the allagmatic method can create
and execute cellular automaton and artificial neural network models in an
automated manner with the guidance of philosophy.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00063">Beta Rebound as an Index of Temporal Integration of Somatosensory and Motor Signals</a></h4>

<p>Modulation of cortical beta rhythm (15–30 Hz) is present during preparation for and execution of voluntary movements as well as during somatosensory stimulation. A rebound in beta synchronization is observed after the end of voluntary movements as well as after somatosensory stimulation and is believed to describe the return to baseline of sensorimotor networks. However, the contribution of efferent and afferent signals to the beta rebound remains poorly understood. Here, we applied electrical median nerve stimulation (MNS) to the right side followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the left primary motor cortex after either 15 or 25 ms. Because the afferent volley reaches the somatosensory cortex after about 20 ms, TMS on the motor cortex was either anticipating or following the cortical arrival of the peripheral stimulus. We show modulations in different beta sub-bands and in both hemispheres, following a pattern of greater resynchronization when motor signals are paired with a peripheral one. The beta rebound in the left hemisphere (stimulated) is modulated in its lower frequency range when TMS precedes the cortical arrival of the afferent volley. In the right hemisphere (unstimulated), instead, the increase is limited to higher beta frequencies when TMS is delivered after the arrival of the afferent signal. In general, we demonstrate that the temporal integration of afferent and efferent signals plays a key role in the genesis of the beta rebound and that these signals may be carried in parallel by different beta sub-bands.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00043">EEG-Based Emotion Classification Using a Deep Neural Network and Sparse Autoencoder</a></h4>

<p>Emotion classification based on brain–computer interface (BCI) systems is an appealing research topic. Recently, deep learning has been employed for the emotion classifications of BCI systems and compared to traditional classification methods improved results have been obtained. In this paper, a novel deep neural network is proposed for emotion classification using EEG systems, which combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) together. In the proposed network, the features extracted by the CNN are first sent to SAE for encoding and decoding. Then the data with reduced redundancy are used as the input features of a DNN for classification task. The public datasets of DEAP and SEED are used for testing. Experimental results show that the proposed network is more effective than conventional CNN methods on the emotion recognitions. For the DEAP dataset, the highest recognition accuracies of 89.49% and 92.86% are achieved for valence and arousal, respectively. For the SEED dataset, however, the best recognition accuracy reaches 96.77%. By combining the CNN, SAE, and DNN and training them separately, the proposed network is shown as an efficient method with a faster convergence than the conventional CNN.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in life-long sensorimotor impairment. Spontaneous recovery from SCI is limited, as supraspinal fibers cannot spontaneously regenerate to form functional networks below the level of injury. Despite this, animal models and humans exhibit many motor behaviors indicative of recovery when electrical stimulation is applied epidurally to the dorsal aspect of the lumbar spinal cord. In 1976, epidural stimulation was introduced to alleviate spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis. Since then, epidural electrical stimulation (EES) has been demonstrated to improve voluntary mobility across the knee and/or ankle in several SCI patients, highlighting its utility in enhancing motor activation. The mechanisms that EES induces to drive these improvements in sensorimotor function remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss several sensorimotor plasticity mechanisms that we hypothesize may enable epidural stimulation to promote recovery, including changes in local lumbar circuitry, propriospinal interneurons, and the internal model. Finally, we discuss genetic tools for afferent modulation as an emerging method to facilitate the search for the mechanisms of action.</p>

<p>Muscle Specific Kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) is an autoimmune disease that impairs neuromuscular transmission leading to generalized muscle weakness. Compared to the more common myasthenia gravis with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), MuSK-MG affects mainly the bulbar and respiratory muscles, with more frequent and severe myasthenic crises. Treatments are usually less effective with the need for prolonged, high doses of steroids and other immunosuppressants to control symptoms. Under physiological condition, MuSK regulates a phosphorylation cascade which is fundamental for the development and maintenance of postsynaptic AChR clusters at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Agrin, secreted by the motor nerve terminal into the synaptic cleft, binds to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) which activates MuSK. In MuSK-MG, monovalent MuSK-IgG4 autoantibodies block MuSK-LRP4 interaction preventing MuSK activation and leading to the dispersal of AChR clusters. Lower levels of divalent MuSK IgG1, 2, and 3 antibody subclasses are also present but their contribution to the pathogenesis of the disease remains controversial. This review aims to provide a detailed update on the epidemiological and clinical features of MuSK-MG, focusing on the pathophysiological mechanisms and the latest indications regarding the efficacy and safety of different treatment options.</p>

<p>Ultra-endurance (UE) race has been associated with brain metabolic changes, but it is still unknown which regions are vulnerable. This study investigated whether high-volume training in rodents, even under moderate intensity, can induce cerebellar oxidative and inflammatory status. Forty-five adult rats were divided into six groups according to a training period, followed or not by an exhaustion test (ET) that simulated UE: control (C), control + ET (C-ET), moderate-volume (MV) training and MV-ET, high-volume training (HV) and HV-ET. The training period was 30 (MV) and 90 (HV) min/day, 5 times/week for 3 months as a continuous running on a treadmill at a maximum velocity of 12 m/min. After 24 h, the ET was performed at 50% maximum velocities up to the animals refused to run, and then serum lactate levels were evaluated. Serum and cerebellar homogenates were obtained 24 h after ET. Serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and corticosterone levels were assessed. Lipid peroxidation (LP), nitric oxide (NO), Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and GFAP proteins, reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were quantified in the cerebellum. Serum lactate concentrations were lower in MV-ET (∼20%) and HV-ET (∼40%) compared to the C-ET group. CK and corticosterone levels were increased more than ∼ twofold by HV training compared to control. ET increased CK levels in MV-ET vs. MV group (P = 0.026). HV induced higher LP levels (∼40%), but an additive effect of ET was only seen in the MV-ET group (P = 0.02). SOD activity was higher in all trained groups vs. C and C-ET (P &lt; 0.05). CAT activity, however, was intensified only in the MV group (P &lt; 0.02). The 50 kDa GFAP levels were enhanced in C-ET and MV-ET vs. respective controls, while 42 kDa (∼40%) and 39 kDa (∼26%) isoform levels were reduced. In the HV-ET group, the 50 KDa isoform amount was reduced ∼40–60% compared to the other groups and the 39 KDa isoform, increased sevenfold. LDH levels, GSH/GSSG ratio, and NO production were not modified. ET elevated IL-1β levels in the CT and MV groups. Data shows that cerebellar resilience to oxidative damage may be maintained under moderate-volume training, but it is reduced by UE running. High-volume training per se provoked systemic metabolic changes, cerebellar lipid peroxidation, and unbalanced enzymatic antioxidant resource. UE after high-volume training modified the GFAP isoform profile suggesting impaired astrocyte reactivity in the cerebellum.</p>

<p>Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease based on four-repeat tauopathy pathology. Currently, this entity is not fully recognized in the context of pathogenesis or clinical examination. This review evaluates the association between neuroinflammation and microglial activation with the induction of pathological cascades that result in tauopathy pathology and the clinical manifestation of PSP. Multidimensional analysis was performed by evaluating genetic, biochemical, and neuroimaging biomarkers to determine whether neurodegeneration as an effect of neuroinflammation or neuroinflammation is a consequence of neurodegeneration in PSP. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to investigate PSP in this context.</p>

<p>Although scalp EEG functional networks have been applied to the study of motor tasks using electroencephalography (EEG), the selection of a suitable reference electrode has not been sufficiently researched. To investigate the effects of the original reference (REF-CZ), the common average reference (CAR), and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) on scalp EEG functional network analysis during hand movement tasks, EEGs of 17 right-handed subjects performing self-paced hand movements were collected, and scalp functional networks [coherence (COH), phase-locking value (PLV), phase lag index (PLI)] with different references were constructed. Compared with the REF-CZ reference, the networks with CAR and REST references exhibited more significant increases in connectivity during the left-/right-hand movement preparation (MP) and movement execution (ME) stages. The node degree of the channel near the reference electrode was significantly reduced by the REF-CZ reference. CAR and REST both decreased this reference effect, REST more so than CAR. We confirmed that the choice of reference would affect the analysis of the functional network during hand movement tasks, and the REST reference can greatly reduce the effects of the online recording reference on the analysis of EEG connectivity.</p>

<p>Many recent studies found signatures of motor learning in neural beta oscillations (13–30 Hz), and specifically in the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). All these studies were in controlled laboratory-tasks in which the task designed to induce the studied learning mechanism. Interestingly, these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based and reward-based tasks (increase vs. decrease, respectively). Here, we explored the PMBR dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging. Our EEG recordings highlight the opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes (increase vs. decrease) between different subjects performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural dynamics, also showed behavioral differences expected for different learning mechanisms. Our results suggest that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.</p>

<p>To investigate the relation between attention and awareness, we manipulated visibility/awareness and stimulus-driven attention capture among metacontrast-masked visual stimuli. By varying the time interval between target and mask, we manipulated target visibility measured as target discrimination accuracies (ACCs; Experiments 1 and 2) and as subjective awareness ratings (Experiment 3). To modulate stimulus-driven attention capture, we presented the masked target either as a color-singleton (the target stands out by its unique color among homogeneously colored non-singletons), as a non-singleton together with a distractor singleton elsewhere (an irrelevant distractor has a unique color, whereas the target is colored like the other stimuli) or without a singleton (no stimulus stands out; only in Experiment 1). As color singletons capture attention in a stimulus-driven way, we expected target visibility/discrimination performance to be best for target singletons and worst with distractor singletons. In Experiments 1 and 2, we confirmed that the masking interval and the singleton manipulation influenced ACCs in an independent way and that attention capture by the singletons, with facilitated performance in target-singleton compared to distractor-singleton conditions, was found regardless of the interval-induced (in-)visibility of the targets. In Experiment 1, we also confirmed that attention capture was the same among participants with worse and better visibility/discrimination performance. In Experiment 2, we confirmed attention capture by color singletons with better discrimination performance for probes presented at singleton position, compared to other positions. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that attention capture by target singletons also increased target awareness and that this capture effect on subjective awareness was independent of the effect of the masking interval, too. Together, results provide new evidence that stimulus-driven attention and awareness operate independently from one another and that stimulus-driven attention capture can precede awareness.</p>

<p>As a sensitive cold-shock protein, RNA binding protein motif 3 (RBM3) exhibits a neuroprotective function in the condition of brain injury. However, how RBM3 is involved in acute ischemic stroke by affecting stress granules (SGs) remains unclear. Here, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to explore the potential mechanism between RBM3 and SG formation in acute ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) condition. The immunofluorescence results showed that the SG formation significantly decreased in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. The western blot results, flow cytometry analysis, and cell viability assessment showed that the RBM3 expression and ratio of cell viability significantly decreased, while the rate of apoptosis increased in PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunofluorescence indicated that RBM3 and GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) colocalized cytoplasm of PC12 cells after 6 h of OGD stimulation when the SGs formation reached the highest level. Besides, overexpression and knockdown of the RBM3 were achieved via plasmid transfection and CRISPR-Cas9 technology, respectively. The results of overexpression and knockdown of RBM3 gene illustrated the pivotal role of RBM3 in affecting SG formation and apoptosis level in OGD-treated PC12 cells. In conclusion, RBM3 could combine with G3BP1 resulted in increasing stress granules generation in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells after 6 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury, which ultimately reduced the apoptosis in OGD-induced cells. Our study may enable a new promising target for alleviating ischemia-reperfusion injury in cells.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a destructive neurological disorder that is characterized by impaired sensory and motor function. Inhibition of bromodomain protein 4 (Brd4) has been shown to promote the maintenance of cell homeostasis by activating autophagy. However, the role of Brd4 inhibition in SCI and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Thus, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sustained Brd4 inhibition using the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1 on the regulation of apoptosis, oxidative stress and autophagy in a mouse model of SCI. First, we observed that Brd4 expression at the lesion sites of mouse spinal cords increased after SCI. Treatment with JQ1 significantly decreased the expression of Brd4 and improved functional recovery for up to 28 day after SCI. In addition, JQ1-mediated inhibition of Brd4 reduced oxidative stress and inhibited the expression of apoptotic proteins to promote neural survival. Our results also revealed that JQ1 treatment activated autophagy and restored autophagic flux, while the positive effects of JQ1 were abrogated by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA intervention, indicating that autophagy plays a crucial role in therapeutic effects Brd4 induced by inhibition of the functional recovery SCI. In the mechanistic analysis, we observed that modulation of the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway is involved in the activation of autophagy mediated by Brd4 inhibition. Taken together, the results of our investigation provides compelling evidence that Brd4 inhibition by JQ1 promotes functional recovery after SCI and that Brd4 may serve as a potential target for SCI treatment.</p>

<p>In the majority of schizophrenia patients, chronic atypical antipsychotic administration produces a significant reduction in or even complete remission of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. However, these drugs are not effective in improving cognitive and emotional deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have a high affinity for the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor, and a modest affinity for the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. The cognitive and emotional deficits in schizophrenia are thought to involve neural networks beyond the classical dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, however, including serotonergic systems. For example, mutations in the RELN gene, which encodes Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein involved in neural development and synaptic plasticity, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, hippocampal Reelin levels are down-regulated in the brains of both schizophrenic patients and in rodent models of schizophrenia. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Reelin microinjection into the mouse hippocampus on behavioral phenotypes to evaluate the role of Reelin in neurodevelopmental disorders and to test a therapeutic approach that extends beyond classical monoamine targets. To model the cognitive and emotional deficits, as well as histological decreases in Reelin-positive cell numbers and hippocampal synaptoporin distribution, a synaptic vesicle protein, offspring that were prenatally exposed to maternal immune activation were used. Microinjections of recombinant Reelin protein into the hippocampus rescued impairments in object memory and anxiety-like behavior and recruited synaptoporin in the hippocampus in offspring exposed to antenatal inflammation. These results suggest that Reelin supplementation has the potential to treat cognitive and emotional impairments, as well as synaptic disturbances, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00281">Synaptic Organizers in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Classification Based on Amyloid-β Sensitivity</a></h4>

<p>Synaptic pathology is one of the major hallmarks observed from the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), leading to cognitive and memory impairment characteristic of AD patients. Synaptic connectivity and specificity are regulated by multiple trans-bindings between pre- and post-synaptic organizers, the complex of which exerts synaptogenic activity. Neurexins (NRXs) and Leukocyte common antigen-related receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are the major presynaptic organizers promoting synaptogenesis through their distinct binding to a wide array of postsynaptic organizers. Recent studies have shown that amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), a major detrimental molecule in AD, interact with NRXs and neuroligin-1, an NRX-binding postsynaptic organizer, to cause synaptic impairment. On the other hand, LAR-RPTPs and their postsynaptic binding partners have no interaction with AβOs, and their synaptogenic activity is maintained even in the presence of AβOs. Here, we review the current evidence regarding the involvement of synaptic organizers in AD, with a focus on Aβ synaptic pathology, to propose a new classification where NRX-based and LAR-RPTP-based synaptic organizing complexes are classified into Aβ-sensitive and Aβ-insensitive synaptic organizers, respectively. We further discuss how their different Aβ sensitivity is involved in Aβ vulnerability and tolerance of synapses for exploring potential therapeutic approaches for AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00266">Protective Effects of Hydrogen Sulfide Against the ATP-Induced Meningeal Nociception</a></h4>

<p>We previously showed that extracellular ATP and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a recently discovered gasotransmitter, are both triggering the nociceptive firing in trigeminal nociceptors implicated in migraine pain. ATP contributes to meningeal nociception by activating the P2X3 subunit-containing receptors whereas H<sub>2</sub>S operates mainly via TRP receptors. However, H<sub>2</sub>S was also proposed as a neuroprotective and anti-nociceptive agent. This study aimed to test the effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on ATP-mediated nociceptive responses in rat meningeal afferents and trigeminal neurons and on ATP-induced degranulation of dural mast cells. Electrophysiological recording of trigeminal nerve activity in meninges was supplemented by patch-clamp and calcium imaging studies of isolated trigeminal neurons. The H<sub>2</sub>S donor NaHS induced a mild activation of afferents and fully suppressed the subsequent ATP-induced firing of meningeal trigeminal nerve fibers. This anti-nociceptive effect of H<sub>2</sub>S was specific as an even stronger effect of capsaicin did not abolish the action of ATP. In isolated trigeminal neurons, NaHS decreased the inward currents and calcium transients evoked by activation of ATP-gated P2X3 receptors. Moreover, NaHS prevented ATP-induced P2X7 receptor-mediated degranulation of meningeal mast cells which emerged as triggers of migraine pain. Finally, NaHS decreased the concentration of extracellular ATP in the meningeal preparation. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>S exerted the multiple protective actions against the nociceptive effects of ATP. These data highlight the novel pathways to reduce purinergic mechanisms of migraine with pharmacological donors or by stimulation production of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>

<p>Secretagogin (SCGN) which acts as a calcium signaling sensor, has previously been shown to be expressed by a substantial population of cortical GABAergic neurons at mid-gestation in humans but not in mice. The present study traced SCGN expression in cortical GABAergic neurons in human fetal forebrain from earlier stages than previously studied. Multiple potential origins of SCGN-expressing neurons were identified in the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) septum and preoptic area; these cells largely co-expressed SP8 but not the medial ganglionic eminence marker LHX6. They followed various migration routes to reach their target regions in the neocortex, insular and olfactory cortex (OC) and olfactory bulbs. A robust increase in the number of SCGN-expressing GABAergic cortical neurons was observed in the midgestational period; 58% of DLX2+ neurons expressed SCGN in the cortical wall at 19 post-conceptional weeks (PCW), a higher proportion than expressed calretinin, a marker for GABAergic neurons of LGE/CGE origin. Furthermore, although most SCGN+ neurons co-expressed calretinin in the cortical plate (CP) and deeper layers, in the marginal zone (MZ) SCGN+ and calretinin+ cells formed separate populations. In the adult mouse, it has previously been shown that in the rostral migratory stream (RMS), SCGN, annexin V (ANXA5), and matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) are co-expressed forming a functioning complex that exocytoses MMP2 in response to calcium. In the present study, ANXA5 showed widespread expression throughout the cortical wall, although MMP2 expression was very largely limited to the CP. We found co-expression of these proteins in some SCGN+ neurons in the subventricular zones (SVZ) suggesting a limited role for these cells in remodeling the extracellular matrix, perhaps during cell migration.</p>

<p>Speed of processing is a cognitive domain that encompasses the speed at which an individual can perceive a given stimulus, interpret the information, and produce a correct response. Speed of processing has been shown to decline more rapidly than other cognitive domains in an aging population, suggesting that this domain is particularly vulnerable to cognitive aging (Chee et al., 2009). However, given the heterogeneity of neuropsychological measures used to assess the domains underpinning speed of processing, a diffuse pattern of brain regions has been implicated. The current study aims to investigate the structural neural correlates of speed of processing by assessing cortical volume and speed of processing scores on the POSIT Double Decision task within a healthy older adult population (N = 186; mean age = 71.70 ± 5.32 years). T1-weighted structural images were collected via a 3T Siemens scanner. The current study shows that less cortical thickness in right temporal, posterior frontal, parietal and occipital lobe structures were significantly associated with poorer Double Decision scores. Notably, these include the lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, superior, transverse, and inferior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, superior and inferior parietal gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus. Such findings suggest that speed of processing performance is associated with a wide array of cortical regions that provide unique contributions to performance on the Double Decision task.</p>

<p>Introduction: Dual-task walking is common in daily life but becomes more difficult with aging. Little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms affecting competing cognitive demands. Translational studies with human and animal models are needed to address this gap. This pilot study investigated the feasibility of implementing a novel cross-species dual-task model in humans and rats and aimed to establish preliminary evidence that the model induces a dual-task cost.</p><p>Methods: Young and older humans and rats performed an object discrimination task (OD), a baseline task of typical walking (baseline), an alternation turning task on a Figure 8 walking course (Alt), and a dual-task combining object discrimination with the alternation task (AltOD). Primary behavioral assessments including walking speed and correct selections for object discrimination and turning direction. In humans, left prefrontal cortex activity was measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).</p><p>Results: Human subjects generally performed well on all tasks, but the older adults exhibited a trend for a slowing of walking speed immediately before the turning decision for Alt and AltOD compared to baseline. Older adults also had heightened prefrontal activity relative to young adults for the Alt and AltOD tasks. Older rodents required more training than young rodents to learn the alternation task. When tested on AltOD with and without a 15-s delay between trials, older rodents exhibited a substantial performance deficit for the delayed version on the initial day of testing. Old rats, however, did not show a significant slowing in walking speed with increasing task demand, as was evident in the young rats.</p><p>Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and challenges associated with implementing a cross-species dual-task model. While there was preliminary evidence of dual-task cost in both humans and rats, the magnitude of effects was small and not consistent across species. This is likely due to the relative ease of each task in humans and the walking component in rats not being sufficiently challenging. Future versions of this test should make the cognitive tasks more challenging and the motor task in rats more complex.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of two proteins in fibrillar form: amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau. Despite decades of intensive research, we cannot yet pinpoint the exact cause of the disease or unequivocally determine the exact mechanism(s) underlying its progression. This confounds early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, which can reveal ongoing biochemical changes in the brain, can help monitor developing AD pathology prior to clinical diagnosis. Here we review preclinical and clinical investigations of commonly used biomarkers in animals and patients with AD, which can bridge translation from model systems into the clinic. The core AD biomarkers have been found to translate well across species, whereas biomarkers of neuroinflammation translate to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, there is no absolute equivalence between biomarkers in human AD patients and those examined in preclinical models in terms of revealing key pathological hallmarks of the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of current but also novel AD biomarkers and how they relate to key constituents of the pathological cascade, highlighting confounding factors and pitfalls in interpretation, and also provide recommendations for standardized procedures during sample collection to enhance the translational validity of preclinical AD models.</p>

Human plasma contains &gt;40,000 different coding and non-coding RNAs that are potential biomarkers for human diseases. Here, we used thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) combined with peak calling to simultaneously profile all RNA biotypes in apheresis-prepared human plasma pooled from healthy individuals. Extending previous TGIRT-seq analysis, we found that human plasma contains largely fragmented mRNAs from &gt;19,000 protein-coding genes, abundant full-length, mature tRNAs and other structured small non-coding RNAs, and less abundant tRNA fragments and mature and pre-miRNAs. Many of the mRNA fragments identified by peak calling correspond to annotated protein-binding sites and/or have stable predicted secondary structures that could afford protection from plasma nucleases. Peak calling also identified novel repeat RNAs, miRNA-sized RNAs, and putatively structured intron RNAs of potential biological, evolutionary, and biomarker significance, including a family of full-length excised introns RNAs, subsets of which correspond to mirtron pre-miRNAs or agotrons.

Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a defect in midline patterning of the forebrain and midface, arises ~1 in 250 conceptions. It is associated with predisposing mutations in the Nodal and Hedgehog (HH) pathways, with penetrance and expressivity graded by genetic and environmental modifiers, via poorly understood mechanisms. CDON is a multifunctional co-receptor, including for the HH pathway. In mice, <i>Cdon</i> mutation synergizes with fetal alcohol exposure, producing HPE phenotypes closely resembling those seen in humans. We report here that, unexpectedly, Nodal signaling is a major point of synergistic interaction between <i>Cdon</i> mutation and fetal alcohol. Window-of-sensitivity, genetic, and in vitro findings are consistent with a model whereby brief exposure of <i>Cdon</i> mutant embryos to ethanol during gastrulation transiently and partially inhibits Nodal pathway activity, with consequent effects on midline patterning. These results illuminate mechanisms of gene-environment interaction in a multifactorial model of a common birth defect.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60067">Integrating genotypes and phenotypes improves long-term forecasts of seasonal influenza A/H3N2 evolution</a></h4>

Seasonal influenza virus A/H3N2 is a major cause of death globally. Vaccination remains the most effective preventative. Rapid mutation of hemagglutinin allows viruses to escape adaptive immunity. This antigenic drift necessitates regular vaccine updates. Effective vaccine strains need to represent H3N2 populations circulating one year after strain selection. Experts select strains based on experimental measurements of antigenic drift and predictions made by models from hemagglutinin sequences. We developed a novel influenza forecasting framework that integrates phenotypic measures of antigenic drift and functional constraint with previously published sequence-only fitness estimates. Forecasts informed by phenotypic measures of antigenic drift consistently outperformed previous sequence- only estimates, while sequence-only estimates of functional constraint surpassed more comprehensive experimentally-informed estimates. Importantly, the best models integrated estimates of both functional constraint and either antigenic drift phenotypes or recent population growth.

<i>Legionella pneumophila </i>is an opportunistic pathogen that causes the potentially fatal pneumonia Legionnaires' Disease. This infection and subsequent pathology require the Dot/Icm Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector proteins into host cells. Compared to prototypical T4SSs, the Dot/Icm assembly is much larger, containing ~27 different components including a core complex reported to be composed of five proteins: DotC, DotD, DotF, DotG, and DotH. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we report reconstructions of the core complex of the Dot/Icm T4SS that includes a symmetry mismatch between distinct structural features of the outer membrane cap (OMC) and periplasmic ring (PR). We present models of known core complex proteins, DotC, DotD, and DotH, and two structurally similar proteins within the core complex, DotK and Lpg0657. This analysis reveals the stoichiometry and contact interfaces between the key proteins of the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex and provides a framework for understanding a complex molecular machine.

The pathogenesis of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-associated gastric cancer is dependent on delivery of CagA into host cells through a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The <i>H. pylori</i> Cag T4SS includes a large membrane-spanning core complex containing 5 proteins, organized into an outer membrane cap (OMC), a periplasmic ring (PR) and a stalk. Here, we report cryo-EM reconstructions of a core complex lacking Cag3 and an improved map of the wild-type complex. We define the structures of two unique species-specific components (Cag3 and CagM) and show that Cag3 is structurally similar to CagT. Unexpectedly, components of the OMC are organized in a 1:1:2:2:5 molar ratio (CagY:CagX:CagT:CagM:Cag3). CagX and CagY are components of both the OMC and the PR and bridge the symmetry mismatch between these regions. These results reveal that assembly of the <i>H. pylori</i> T4SS core complex is dependent on incorporation of interwoven species-specific components.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59035">Cadherin clusters stabilized by a combination of specific and nonspecific cis-interactions</a></h4>

We demonstrate a combined experimental and computational approach for the quantitative characterization of lateral interactions between membrane-associated proteins. In particular, weak, lateral (cis) interactions between E-cadherin extracellular domains tethered to supported lipid bilayers, were studied using a combination of dynamic single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Cadherins are intercellular adhesion proteins that assemble into clusters at cell-cell contacts through cis- and trans- (adhesive) interactions. A detailed and quantitative understanding of cis-clustering has been hindered by a lack of experimental approaches capable of detecting and quantifying lateral interactions between proteins on membranes. Here single-molecule intermolecular FRET measurements of wild-type E-cadherin and cis-interaction mutants combined with simulations demonstrate that both nonspecific and specific cis-interactions contribute to lateral clustering on lipid bilayers. Moreover, the intermolecular binding and dissociation rate constants are quantitatively and independently determined, demonstrating an approach that is generalizable for other interacting proteins.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58737">mTOR signaling regulates the morphology and migration of outer radial glia in developing human cortex</a></h4>

Outer radial glial (oRG) cells are a population of neural stem cells prevalent in the developing human cortex that contribute to its cellular diversity and evolutionary expansion. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is active in human oRG cells. Mutations in mTOR pathway genes are linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of cortical development. We find that dysregulation of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but do not affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold. Our study provides insight into how mTOR dysregulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57869">Complement opsonization of HIV affects primary infection of human colorectal mucosa and subsequent activation of T cells</a></h4>

HIV transmission via genital and colorectal mucosa are the most common routes of dissemination. Here, we explored the effects of free and complement-opsonized HIV on colorectal tissue. Initially, there was higher antiviral responses in the free HIV compared to complement-opsonized virus. The mucosal transcriptional response at 24h revealed the involvement of activated T cells, which was mirrored in cellular responses observed at 96h in isolated mucosal T cells. Further, HIV exposure led to skewing of T cell phenotypes predominantly to inflammatory CD4+ T cells, i.e. Th17 and Th1Th17 subsets. Of note, HIV exposure created an environment that altered the CD8+ T cell phenotype, e.g. expression of regulatory factors, especially when the virions were opsonized with complement factors. Our findings suggest that HIV-opsonization alters the activation and signaling pathways in the colorectal mucosa, which promotes viral establishment by creating an environment that stimulates mucosal T cell activation and inflammatory Th cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57609">Resource plasticity-driven carbon-nitrogen budgeting enables specialization and division of labor in a clonal community</a></h4>

Previously, we found that in glucose-limited <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> colonies, metabolic constraints drive cells into groups exhibiting gluconeogenic or glycolytic states. In that study, threshold amounts of trehalose - a limiting, produced carbon-resource, controls the emergence and self-organization of cells exhibiting the glycolytic state, serving as a carbon source that fuels glycolysis (Varahan et al., 2019). We now discover that the plasticity of use of a non-limiting resource, aspartate, controls both resource production and the emergence of heterogeneous cell states, based on differential metabolic budgeting. In gluconeogenic cells, aspartate is a carbon source for trehalose production, while in glycolytic cells using trehalose for carbon, aspartate is predominantly a nitrogen source for nucleotide synthesis. This metabolic plasticity of aspartate enables carbon-nitrogen budgeting, thereby driving the biochemical self-organization of distinct cell states. Through this organization, cells in each state exhibit true division of labor, providing growth/survival advantages for the whole community.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57341">Mesoscopic-scale functional networks in the primate amygdala</a></h4>

The primate amygdala performs multiple functions that may be related to the anatomical heterogeneity of its nuclei. Individual neurons with stimulus- and task-specific responses are not clustered in any of the nuclei, suggesting that single-units may be too-fine grained to shed light on the mesoscale organization of the amygdala. We have extracted from local field potentials recorded simultaneously from multiple locations within the primate (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) amygdala spatially defined and statistically separable responses to visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli. A generalized eigendecomposition-based method of source separation isolated coactivity patterns, or components, that in neurophysiological terms correspond to putative subnetworks. Some component spatial patterns mapped onto the anatomical organization of the amygdala, while other components reflected integration across nuclei. These components differentiated between visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli suggesting the presence of functionally distinct parallel subnetworks.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are two highly infectious and lethal viruses causing major economic losses to pig production. Here, we report generation of double-gene-knockout (DKO) pigs harboring edited knockout alleles for known receptor proteins CD163 and pAPN and show that DKO pigs are completely resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV and TGEV. We found no differences in meat-production or reproductive-performance traits between wild-type and DKO pigs, but detected increased iron in DKO muscle. Additional infection challenge experiments showed that DKO pigs exhibited decreased susceptibility to porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), thus offering unprecedented in vivo evidence of pAPN as one of PDCoV receptors. Beyond showing that multiple gene edits can be combined in a livestock animal to achieve simultaneous resistance to two major viruses, our study introduces a valuable model for investigating infection mechanisms of porcine pathogenic viruses that exploit pAPN or CD163 for entry.

Larval tracheae of Drosophila harbor progenitors of the adult tracheal system (tracheoblasts). We showed previously that thoracic tracheoblasts arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle in an ATR-Checkpoint Kinase1(Chk1)-dependent manner prior to division and morphogenesis (Kizhedathu et al., 2018). Here we investigate developmental regulation of Chk1 activation. We report that Wnt signaling is high in tracheoblasts and is necessary for high levels of activated (phosphorylated) Chk1. We find that canonical Wnt signaling facilitates this by transcriptional upregulation of Chk1 in cells that have ATR kinase activity. Wnt signalling is dependent on four Wnts (Wg, Wnt5, 6,10) that are expressed at high levels in arrested tracheoblasts and downregulated at mitotic re-entry. Interestingly, none of the Wnts are dispensable and act synergistically to induce Chk1. Finally, we show that downregulation of Wnt signalling and Chk1 expression leads to mitotic re-entry and the concomitant upregulation of Dpp signalling, driving tracheoblast proliferation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55978">What do adversarial images tell us about human vision?</a></h4>

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are frequently described as the best current models of human and primate vision. An obvious challenge to this claim is the existence of <i>adversarial images</i> that fool DCNNs but are uninterpretable to humans. However, recent research has suggested that there may be similarities in how humans and DCNNs interpret these seemingly nonsense images. We reanalysed data from a high-profile paper and conducted five experiments controlling for different ways in which these images can be generated and selected. We show human-DCNN agreement is much weaker and more variable than previously reported, and that the weak agreement is contingent on the choice of adversarial images and the design of the experiment. Indeed, we find there are well-known methods of generating images for which humans show no agreement with DCNNs. We conclude that adversarial images still pose a challenge to theorists using DCNNs as models of human vision.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55028">Ultra-high field imaging reveals increased whole brain connectivity underpins cognitive strategies that attenuate pain</a></h4>

We investigated how the attenuation of pain with cognitive interventions affects brain connectivity using neuroimaging and a whole brain novel analysis approach. While receiving tonic cold pain, 20 healthy participants performed three different pain attenuation strategies during simultaneous collection of functional imaging data at 7 tesla. Participants were asked to rate their pain after each trial. We related the trial-by-trial variability of the attenuation performance to the trial-by-trial functional connectivity strength change of brain data. Across all conditions, we found that a higher performance of pain attenuation was predominantly associated with higher functional connectivity. Of note, we observed an association between low pain and high connectivity for regions that belong to brain regions long associated with pain processing, i.e. the insular and cingulate cortices. For one of the cognitive strategies (safe place), the performance of pain attenuation was explained by diffusion tensor imaging metrics of increased white matter integrity.

Recent advances in the field of cellular reprogramming have opened a route to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying common neurological disorders. High-density microelectrode-arrays (HD-MEAs) provide unprecedented means to study neuronal physiology at different scales, ranging from network through single-neuron to subcellular features. In this work, we used HD-MEAs in vitro to characterize and compare human induced-pluripotent-stem-cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic and motor neurons, including isogenic neuronal lines modeling Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We established reproducible electrophysiological network, single-cell and subcellular metrics, which were used for phenotype characterization and drug testing. Metrics such as burst shapes and axonal velocity enabled the distinction of healthy and diseased neurons. The HD-MEA metrics could also be used to detect the effects of dosing the drug retigabine to human motor neurons. Finally, we showed that the ability to detect drug effects and the observed culture-to-culture variability critically depend on the number of available recording electrodes.

The challenge of defining and cataloging the building blocks of the brain requires a standardized approach to naming neurons and organizing knowledge about their properties. The US Brain Initiative Cell Census Network, Human Cell Atlas, Blue Brain Project, and others are generating vast amounts of data and characterizing large numbers of neurons throughout the nervous system. The neuroscientific literature contains many neuron names (e.g. parvalbumin-positive interneuron or layer 5 pyramidal cell) that are commonly used and generally accepted. However, it is often unclear how such common usage types relate to the many proposed evidence-based types that are based on the results of new techniques. Further, comparing different models across labs remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose an interoperable knowledge representation, the Neuron Phenotype Ontology (NPO) that provides a standardized and machine computable approach for naming and normalizing phenotypes in cell types by using community ontology identifiers as a common language. The NPO provides a framework for systematically organizing knowledge about cellular properties and enables interoperability with existing neuron naming schemes. We evaluate the NPO by populating a knowledge base with three independent cortical neuron classifications derived from published data sets that describe neurons according to molecular, morphological, electrophysiological and synaptic properties. Competency queries to this knowledge base demonstrate that this knowledge model enables interoperability between the three test cases and common usage neuron names from the literature.

Dysfunctions in memory recall lead to pathological fear; a hallmark of trauma-related disorders, like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Heightened recall of an association between a cue and trauma, as well as impoverished recall that a previously trauma-related cue is no longer a threat both result in a debilitating fear toward the cue. Glucocorticoid-mediated action via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) influences memory recall. This literature has primarily focused on GRs expressed in neurons or ignored cell-type specific contributions. To ask how GR action in non-neuronal cells influences memory recall, we combined auditory fear conditioning in mice and the knockout of GRs in astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region implicated in memory recall. We found that GRs in astrocytes in the PFC calibrate recall in female but not male mice. Specifically, we found that knocking out GRs in astrocytes in the PFC of female mice (AstroGRKO) after fear conditioning resulted in higher recall of fear to the CS+ tone when compared to controls (AstroGRintact). While we did not find any differences in extinction of fear toward the CS+ between these groups, AstroGRKO female mice showed impaired recall of extinction training. We did not observe any significant results in male mice. These results suggest a sex-specific calibration of memory recall by GRs in astrocytes in the PFC. These data demonstrate the need to examine GR action in cortical astrocytes to elucidate the basic neurobiology underlying memory recall and potential mechanisms that underlie female-specific biases in the incidence of PTSD.

Purpose: We examined how consonant perception is affected by a preceding speech carrier simulated in the same or a different room, for a broad range of consonants. Carrier room, carrier length, and carrier length/target room uncertainty were manipulated. A phonetic feature analysis tested which phonetic categories are most influenced by the acoustic context of the carrier. Method: Two experiments were performed, each with 9 participants. Targets consisted of vowel-consonant (VC) syllables presented in one of 2 strongly reverberant rooms, preceded by a VC carrier presented either in the same room, a different reverberant room, or an anechoic room. In Experiment 1 the carrier length and the target room randomly varied from trial to trial while in Experiment 2 they were fixed within blocks of trials. Results: Compared to the no-carrier condition, a consistent carrier provided only a small advantage for consonant perception, whereas inconsistent carriers disrupted performance significantly. For a different-room carrier, carrier length had an effect; performance dropped significantly in the 2-VC compared to the 4-VC carrier length. The only effect of carrier uncertainty was an overall drop in performance. Phonetic analysis showed that an inconsistent carrier significantly degraded identification of the manner of articulation, especially for stop consonants, and, in one of the rooms, also of voicing. Conclusions: Calibration of consonant perception to strong reverberation is exhibited through disruptions in perception when the room is switched. The strength of calibration varies across different consonants and phonetic features, as well as across rooms and durations of exposure to a given room.

Point process generalized linear models (GLMs) provide a powerful tool for characterizing the coding properties of neural populations. Spline basis functions are often used in point process GLMs, when the relationship between the spiking and driving signals are nonlinear, but common choices for the structure of these spline bases often lead to loss of statistical power and numerical instability when the signals that influence spiking are bounded above or below. In particular, history dependent spike train models often suffer these issues at times immediately following a previous spike. This can make inferences related to refractoriness and bursting activity more challenging. Here, we propose a modified set of spline basis functions that assumes a flat derivative at the endpoints and show that this limits the uncertainty and numerical issues associated with cardinal splines. We illustrate the application of this modified basis to the problem of simultaneously estimating the place field and history dependent properties of a set of neurons from the CA1 region of rat hippocampus, and compare it with the other commonly used basis functions. We have made code available in MATLAB to implement spike train regression using these modified basis functions.

We normally regard sleep and wake as two distinct opposing brain states, where sleep requires silence of wake-promoting structures, such as the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system. We set out to investigate how cortical NE dynamics and NE-related astrocytic activity relates to LC population activity during sleep states. We show that LC displays regular phasic activity bouts during NREM leading to a slow oscillatory pattern of prefrontal NE levels of which the majority of NE increases does not lead to awakening. NE troughs link to sleep spindles and continued NE decline transitions into REM. Last, we show that prefrontal astrocytes have reduced sensitivity towards NE during sleep. Our results suggest that dynamic changes in the activity of wake-promoting systems during sleep might allow alternating between crucial sleep processes and broadening of sensitivity towards incoming sensory input.

Balancing the speed and accuracy of decisions is crucial for survival, but how organisms manage this trade-off during learning is largely unknown. Here, we track this trade-off during perceptual learning in rats and simulated agents. At the start of learning, rats chose long reaction times that did not optimize instantaneous reward rate, but by the end of learning chose near-optimal reaction times. To understand this behavior, we analyzed learning dynamics in a recurrent neural network model of the task. The model reveals a fundamental trade-off between instantaneous reward rate and perceptual learning speed, putting the goals of learning quickly and accruing immediate reward in tension. We find that the rats' strategy of long initial responses can dramatically expedite learning, yielding higher total reward over task engagement. Our results demonstrate that prioritizing learning can be advantageous from a total reward perspective, and suggest that rats engage in cognitive control of learning.

Humans often face sequential decision-making problems, in which information about the environmental reward structure is detached from rewards for a subset of actions. For example, a medicated patient may consider partaking in a clinical trial on the effectiveness of a new drug. Taking part in the trial can provide the patient with information about the personal effectiveness of the new drug and the potential reward of a better treatment. Not taking part in the trial does not provide the patient with this information, but is associated with the reward of a (potentially less) effective treatment. In the current study, we introduce a novel information-selective reversal bandit task to model such situations and obtained choice data on this task from 24 participants. To arbitrate between different decision-making strategies that participants may use on this task, we developed a set of probabilistic agent-based behavioural models, including exploitative and explorative Bayesian agents, as well as heuristic control agents. Upon validating the model and parameter recovery properties of our model set and summarizing the participants' choice data in a descriptive way, we used a maximum likelihood approach to evaluate the participants' choice data from the perspective of our model set. In brief, we provide evidence that participants employ a belief state-based hybrid explorative-exploitative strategy on the information-selective reversal bandit task, lending further support to the finding that humans are guided by their subjective uncertainty when solving exploration-exploitation dilemmas.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits due to spinal cord injury (SCI) have been elucidated in both animals and humans with SCI. Such disorders may cause concomitant oscillatory changes in regions of the brain involving in cognition; a subject that has not been directed mechanistically. One of the crucial oscillations, having a prominent role in cognition, particularly spatial memory, is hippocampal theta rhythm. Our research revealed that SCI could induce changes not only in the neurogenesis and apoptosis rate of the hippocampus but also in theta power as well as receptors involving in the generation of this rhythm. Herein we used 24 male Wistar rats (Sham/SCI = 12) and examined the effect of spinal cord contusion on hippocampal theta rhythm, spatial memory, and neurodegeneration. We proved that SCI eliminates hippocampus‐dependent theta power through spatial working memory, and correlates significantly with neurodegeneration and expression of receptors (NMDA, GABAA, Muscarinic1/M1), which are in turn essential in generation of theta rhythm. The immunohistochemistry analysis also demonstrated a significant decrease in DCX+ and BrdU+ cells; however, according to TUNEL assay, apoptosis is significantly higher in SCI‐induced animals. The western blotting analysis further showed a significant reduction of the abovementioned receptors in the hippocampus. We also verified that SCI impairs the spatial memory, proved by poor performance in the Y‐maze task. As well as, based on the local field potential recordings analysis, SCI decreases the power of theta rhythm. Eventually, this study demonstrated that chronic brain neurodegeneration occurs after SCI accompanied by theta rhythm and cognitive deficiency.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Locus coeruleus (LC) is the main noradrenergic (NA) nucleus of the central nervous system. LC degenerates early during Alzheimer's disease (AD) and NA loss might concur to AD pathogenesis. Aside from neurons, LC terminals provide dense innervation of brain intraparenchymal arterioles/capillaries, and NA modulates astrocyte functions. The term neurovascular unit (NVU) defines the strict anatomical/functional interaction occurring between neurons, glial cells, and brain vessels. NVU plays a fundamental role in coupling the energy demand of activated brain regions with regional cerebral blood flow, it includes the blood–brain barrier (BBB), plays an active role in neuroinflammation, and participates also to the glymphatic system. NVU alteration is involved in AD pathophysiology through several mechanisms, mainly related to a relative oligoemia in activated brain regions and impairment of structural and functional BBB integrity, which contributes also to the intracerebral accumulation of insoluble amyloid. We review the existing data on the morphological features of LC‐NA innervation of the NVU, as well as its contribution to neurovascular coupling and BBB proper functioning. After introducing the main experimental data linking LC with AD, which have repeatedly shown a key role of neuroinflammation and increased amyloid plaque formation, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which the loss of NVU modulation by LC might contribute to AD pathogenesis. Surprisingly, thus far not so many studies have tested directly these mechanisms in models of AD in which LC has been lesioned experimentally. Clarifying the interaction of LC with NVU in AD pathogenesis may disclose potential therapeutic targets for AD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To make optimal use of previous experiences, important neural activity sequences must be prioritized during hippocampal replay. Integrating insights about the interplay between CA3 and CA2, we propose a conceptual framework that allows the two regions to control which sequences are reactivated. We suggest that neuromodulatory‐gated plasticity and mutual inhibition enable discrete assembly sequences in both regions to support each other while suppressing competing sequences. This perspective provides a coherent interpretation for a variety of seemingly disconnected functional properties of CA2 and paves the way for a more general understanding of CA2.</p>

<p>Striatal interneurons of cholinergic (ChAT+) striatal interneurons in WT and heterozygous Q175 mice at 18 months of age. The images show that striatal cholinergic interneuron abundance is comparable, but dendrites in Q175 mice are significantly fewer and shorter. These abnormalities and diverse striatal projection neuron abnormalities develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation on the striatum in these mice that in many regards resemble those in human HD. Nonetheless, the pathologies do not yet involve overt striatal neuron loss even by 18 months, indicating they are less severe than even in premanifest HD.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We used behavioral testing and morphological methods to detail the progression of basal ganglia neuron type‐specific pathology and the deficits stemming from them in male heterozygous Q175 mice, compared to age‐matched WT males. A rotarod deficit was not present in Q175 mice until 18 months, but increased open field turn rate (reflecting hyperkinesia) and open field anxiety were evident at 6 months. No loss of striatal neurons was seen out to 18 months, but ENK+ and DARPP32+ striatal perikarya were fewer by 6 months, due to diminished expression, with further decline by 18 months. No reduction in SP+ striatal perikarya or striatal interneurons was seen in Q175 mice at 18‐months, but cholinergic interneurons showed dendrite attenuation by 6 months. Despite reduced ENK expression in indirect pathway striatal perikarya, ENK‐immunostained terminals in globus pallidus externus (GPe) were more abundant at 6 months, and remained so out to 18 months. Similarly, SP‐immunostained terminals from striatal direct pathway neurons were more abundant in globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra at 6 months, and remained so at 18 months. FoxP2+ arkypallidal GPe neurons and subthalamic nucleus neurons were lost by 18 months but not prototypical PARV+ GPe neurons or dopaminergic nigral neurons. Our results show that striatal projection neuron abnormalities and behavioral abnormalities reflecting them develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 male heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation. The striatal pathologies resemble those in human HD, but are less severe at 18 months than even in premanifest HD.</p>

<p>In this study, we provide an overview of rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neuron (OEN) development in the zebrafish. OENs are born in two groups: the rostral (REN) group is born in r4 with the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), while the caudal (CEN) group is born in r5. From there, the OENs migrate alongside the FBMNs to r6 and r7, where they cluster into bilateral nuclei. However, we identify several key differences between the mechanisms OENs and FBMNs use to migrate.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In vertebrate animals, motor and sensory efferent neurons carry information from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral targets. These two types of efferent systems sometimes bear a close resemblance, sharing common segmental organization, axon pathways, and chemical messengers. Here, we focus on the development of the octavolateral efferent neurons (OENs) and their interactions with the closely‐related facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in zebrafish. Using live‐imaging approaches, we investigate the birth, migration, and projection patterns of OENs. We find that OENs are born in two distinct groups: a group of rostral efferent neurons (RENs) that arises in the fourth segment, or rhombomere (r4), of the hindbrain and a group of caudal efferent neurons (CENs) that arises in r5. Both RENs and CENs then migrate posteriorly through the hindbrain between 18 and 48 hours post‐fertilization, alongside the r4‐derived FBMNs. Like the FBMNs, migration of the r4‐derived RENs depends on function of the segmental identity gene <i>hoxb1a</i>; unlike the FBMNs, however, both OEN populations move independently of <i>prickle1b</i>. Further, we investigate whether the previously described ‘pioneer’ neuron that leads FBMN migration through the hindbrain is an r4‐derived FBMN/REN or an r5‐derived CEN. Our experiments verify that the pioneer is an r4‐derived neuron and reaffirm its role in leading FBMN migration across the r4/5 border. In contrast, the r5‐derived CENs migrate independently of the pioneer. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms OENs use to navigate the hindbrain differ significantly from those employed by FBMNs.</p>

<p>Macroscopic gray matter changes have been well documented in in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The present study examined microscopic gray matter changes in CTE by comparing the dendritic arbors of supragranular pyramidal neurons from prefrontal and occipital cortices in both control and CTE cases. CTE neurons exhibited significantly lower mean dendritic measure values than did control neurons, while also displaying considerably greater variability across measures. These changes may be a newly‐described pathological marker of CTE, and could supplement current mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with repetitive head impacts. Neuropathologically, it is defined by the presence of perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in cortical tissue (McKee et al<i>.</i>, 2016). Although many pathological and assumed clinical correlates of CTE have been well‐characterized, its effects on cortical dendritic arbors are still unknown. Here, we quantified dendrites and dendritic spines of supragranular pyramidal neurons in tissue from human frontal and occipital lobes, in 11 cases with (<i>M</i>
<sub>age</sub> = 79 ± 7 years) and five cases without (<i>M</i>
<sub>age</sub> = 76 ± 11 years) CTE. Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Dendritic systems of 20 neurons per region in each brain (N = 640 neurons) were quantified using computer‐assisted morphometry. One key finding was that CTE neurons exhibited increased variability and distributional changes across six of the eight dendritic system measures, presumably due to ongoing degeneration and compensatory reorganization of dendritic systems. However, despite heightened variation among CTE neurons, CTE cases exhibited lower mean values than control cases in seven of the eight dendritic system measures. These dendritic alterations may represent a new pathological marker of CTE, and further examination of dendritic changes could contribute to both mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Co‐transmission of glutamate by brain dopaminergic neurons was recently proposed as a potential factor influencing cell survival in models of Parkinson’s disease. Intriguingly, brain dopaminergic nuclei are differentially affected in Parkinson’s disease. Whether this is associated with different patterns of co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype along the rostro‐caudal brain axis is unknown in mammals. We hypothesized that, as in zebrafish, the glutamatergic phenotype is present preferentially in the caudal meso‐diencephalic dopaminergic nuclei. Here, we used in mice a cell fate mapping strategy based on reporter protein expression (ZsGreen) consecutive to previous expression of the <i>vesicular glutamate transporter 2</i> (<i>Vglut2</i>) gene, coupled with immunofluorescence experiments against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT). We found three expression patterns in DA cells, organized along the rostro‐caudal brain axis. The first pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐positive, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A8‐A10. The second pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A11. The third pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐negative) was found in A12‐A13. These patterns should help to refine the establishment of the homology of dopaminergic nuclei between vertebrate species. Our results also uncover that <i>Vglut2</i> is expressed at some point during cell lifetime in dopaminergic nuclei known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease and largely absent from those that are preserved, suggesting that co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype in dopaminergic cells influences their survival in Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>The mechanisms of infant development are far from understood. Learning about
one's own body is likely a foundation for subsequent development. Here we look
specifically at the problem of how spontaneous touches to the body in early
infancy may give rise to first body models and bootstrap further development
such as reaching competence. Unlike visually elicited reaching, reaching to own
body requires connections of the tactile and motor space only, bypassing
vision. Still, the problems of high dimensionality and redundancy of the motor
system persist. In this work, we present an embodied computational model on a
simulated humanoid robot with artificial sensitive skin on large areas of its
body. The robot should autonomously develop the capacity to reach for every
tactile sensor on its body. To do this efficiently, we employ the computational
framework of intrinsic motivations and variants of goal babbling, as opposed to
motor babbling, that prove to make the exploration process faster and alleviate
the ill-posedness of learning inverse kinematics. Based on our results, we
discuss the next steps in relation to infant studies: what information will be
necessary to further ground this computational model in behavioral data.

<p>Quaternion space has brought several benefits over the traditional Euclidean
space: Quaternions (i) consist of a real and three imaginary components,
encouraging richer representations; (ii) utilize Hamilton product which better
encodes the inter-latent interactions across multiple Quaternion components;
and (iii) result in a model with smaller degrees of freedom and less prone to
overfitting. Unfortunately, most of the current recommender systems rely on
real-valued representations in Euclidean space to model either user's long-term
or short-term interests. In this paper, we fully utilize Quaternion space to
model both user's long-term and short-term preferences. We first propose a
QUaternion-based self-Attentive Long term user Encoding (QUALE) to study the
user's long-term intents. Then, we propose a QUaternion-based self-Attentive
Short term user Encoding (QUASE) to learn the user's short-term interests. To
enhance our models' capability, we propose to fuse QUALE and QUASE into one
model, namely QUALSE, by using a Quaternion-based gating mechanism. We further
develop Quaternion-based Adversarial learning along with the Bayesian
Personalized Ranking (QABPR) to improve our model's robustness. Extensive
experiments on six real-world datasets show that our fused QUALSE model
outperformed 11 state-of-the-art baselines, improving 8.43% at HIT@1 and 10.27%
at NDCG@1 on average compared with the best baseline.

<p>The human brain is the most complex object of study we encounter today.
Mapping the neuronal-level connections between the more than 80 billion neurons
in the brain is a hopeless task for science. By the recent advancement of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we are able to map the macroscopic
connections between about 1000 brain areas. The MRI data acquisition and the
subsequent algorithmic workflow contain several complex steps, where errors can
occur. In the present contribution, we describe and publish 1064 human
connectomes, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project.
Each connectome is available in 5 resolutions, with 83, 129, 234, 463, and 1015
anatomically labeled nodes. For error correction, we follow an averaging and
extreme value deleting strategy for each edge and for each connectome. The
resulting 5320 braingraphs can be downloaded from the
\url{https://braingraph.org} site. This dataset makes possible the access to
these graphs for scientists unfamiliar with neuroimaging- and
connectome-related tools: mathematicians, physicists, and engineers can use
their expertize and ideas in the analysis of the connections of the human
brain. Brain scientists also have a robust and large, multi-resolution set for
connectomical studies.

<p>Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been proposed over recent
years to create controllers to play multiple video games of different nature
and complexity without revealing the specific mechanics of each of these games
to the AI methods. In recent years, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) employing
rolling horizon mechanisms have achieved extraordinary results in these type of
problems. However, some limitations are present in Rolling Horizon EAs making
it a grand challenge of AI. These limitations include the wasteful mechanism of
creating a population and evolving it over a fraction of a second to propose an
action to be executed by the game agent. Another limitation is to use a scalar
value (fitness value) to direct evolutionary search instead of accounting for a
mechanism that informs us how a particular agent behaves during the rolling
horizon simulation. In this work, we address both of these issues. We introduce
the use of a statistical tree that tackles the latter limitation. Furthermore,
we tackle the former limitation by employing a mechanism that allows us to seed
part of the population using Monte Carlo Tree Search, a method that has
dominated multiple General Video Game AI competitions. We show how the proposed
novel mechanism, called Statistical Tree-based Population Seeding, achieves
better results compared to vanilla Rolling Horizon EAs in a set of 20 games,
including 10 stochastic and 10 deterministic games.

<p>Neuromorphic computing describes the use of VLSI systems to mimic
neuro-biological architectures and is also looked at as a promising alternative
to the traditional von Neumann architecture. Any new computing architecture
would need a system that can perform floating-point arithmetic. In this paper,
we describe a neuromorphic system that performs IEEE 754-compliant
floating-point multiplication. The complex process of multiplication is divided
into smaller sub-tasks performed by components Exponent Adder, Bias Subtractor,
Mantissa Multiplier and Sign OF/UF. We study the effect of the number of
neurons per bit on accuracy and bit error rate, and estimate the optimal number
of neurons needed for each component.

<p>A substantial amount of time and energy has been invested to develop machine
vision using connectionist (neural network) principles. Most of that work has
been inspired by theories advanced by neuroscientists and behaviorists for how
cortical systems store stimulus information. Those theories call for
information flow through connections among several neuron populations, with the
initial connections being random (or at least non-functional). Then the
strength or location of connections are modified through training trials to
achieve an effective output, such as the ability to identify an object. Those
theories ignored the fact that animals that have no cortex, e.g., fish, can
demonstrate visual skills that outpace the best neural network models. Neural
circuits that allow for immediate effective vision and quick learning have been
preprogrammed by hundreds of millions of years of evolution and the visual
skills are available shortly after hatching. Cortical systems may be providing
advanced image processing, but most likely are using design principles that had
been proven effective in simpler systems. The present article provides a brief
overview of retinal and cortical mechanisms for registering shape information,
with the hope that it might contribute to the design of shape-encoding circuits
that more closely match the mechanisms of biological vision.

<p>To avoid disease, humans show far greater contamination sensitivity and
hygienic behaviour compared to our closest living relatives, likely due to our
increased propensity to experience disgust. While contemporary theories argue
disgust is a genetic adaptation, there is surprisingly little evidence to
support this claim. Here, we simulated 100 000 years of evolution in human
hunter-gatherers to test a wide variety of theoretical models. Our results
indicate that natural selection for monogenic or polygenic pathogen-avoidance
traits is plausible. However, the cultural inter-generational transmission of
such traits operated more quickly in realistic scenarios, and continued to work
even when artificially constrained. In the absence of reliable empirical data,
our computational work supports the hypothesis that cultural evolution outpaced
its biological counterpart to select health-improving behaviours that benefited
survival. This study serves not only as evidence of cultural evolution of the
behavioural immune system, but is also an illustration of emerging theories
that paint cognitive mechanisms as socially transmitted rather than
biologically hardwired functions.

<p>Neural codes, represented as collections of binary strings called codewords,
are used to encode neural activity. A code is called convex if its codewords
are represented as an arrangement of convex open sets in Euclidean space.
Previous work has focused on addressing the question: how can we tell when a
neural code is convex? Giusti and Itskov identified a local obstruction and
proved that convex neural codes have no local obstructions. The converse is
true for codes on up to four neurons, but false in general. Nevertheless, we
prove this converse holds for codes with up to three maximal codewords, and
moreover the minimal embedding dimension of such codes is at most two.

<p>Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) can automatically design the
architectures of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using evolutionary computation
algorithms. It has been greatly witnessed by DNN researchers owing to the
promising performance of automatically designing the satisfied DNN
architectures. However, most ENAS algorithms require intensive computational
resource which is not necessarily available to each of the users interested.
Performance predictors are a type of regression models, can assist to
accomplish the search without much computational resource. Despite various
performance predictors have been designed, they employ the same training
protocol to build the regression models: 1) sampling a set of DNNs with
performance as the training dataset, 2) training the model with the mean square
error criterion, and 3) predicting the performance of DNNs newly generated
during the ENAS. In this paper, we point out that the three steps constituting
the training protocol are not reasonable through intuitive and illustrative
examples. Further, we propose a new training protocol to address the issues,
consisting of designing a pair-wise ranking indicator to construct the training
target, proposing to use the logistic regression to fit the training samples,
and developing a differential method to building the training instances. To
verify the effectiveness of the proposed training protocol, four widely used
regression models in the field of machine learning have been chosen to perform
the comparisons on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results of all the
comparisons demonstrate that the proposed protocol can significantly improve
the performance prediction accuracy against the traditional training protocol.

<p>-Background. Network neuroscience examines the brain as a complex system
represented by a network (or connectome), providing deeper insights into the
brain morphology and function, allowing the identification of atypical brain
connectivity alterations, which can be used as diagnostic markers of
neurological disorders. -Existing Methods. Graph embedding methods which map
data samples (e.g., brain networks) into a low dimensional space have been
widely used to explore the relationship between samples for classification or
prediction tasks. However, the majority of these works are based on modeling
the pair-wise relationships between samples, failing to capture their
higher-order relationships. -New Method. In this paper, inspired by the nascent
field of geometric deep learning, we propose Hypergraph U-Net (HUNet), a novel
data embedding framework leveraging the hypergraph structure to learn
low-dimensional embeddings of data samples while capturing their high-order
relationships. Specifically, we generalize the U-Net architecture, naturally
operating on graphs, to hypergraphs by improving local feature aggregation and
preserving the high-order relationships present in the data. -Results. We
tested our method on small-scale and large-scale heterogeneous brain
connectomic datasets including morphological and functional brain networks of
autistic and demented patients, respectively. -Conclusion. Our HUNet
outperformed state-of-the-art geometric graph and hypergraph data embedding
techniques with a gain of 4-14% in classification accuracy, demonstrating both
scalability and generalizability. HUNet code is available at
https://github.com/basiralab/HUNet.

<p>Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in
predictive analysis. A still open gap in that literature is that statistical
and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive
performance than deep learning methods as they generally disregard the data
sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one
time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture
for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with
deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method
Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer
multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by
assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and
intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer
variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from
other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN
with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound
improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we
present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing
that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously,
time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple
multivariate data synchronously evolve.

<p>Statistical mechanics determines the abundance of different arrangements of
matter depending on cost-benefit balances. Its formalism and phenomenology
percolate throughout biological processes and set limits to effective
computation. Under specific conditions, self-replicating and computationally
complex patterns become favored, yielding life, cognition, and Darwinian
evolution. Neurons and neural circuits sit at a crossroads between statistical
mechanics, computation, and (through their role in cognition) natural
selection. Can we establish a {\em statistical physics} of neural circuits?
Such theory would tell what kinds of brains to expect under set energetic,
evolutionary, and computational conditions. With this big picture in mind, we
focus on the fate of duplicated neural circuits. We look at examples from
central nervous systems, with a stress on computational thresholds that might
prompt this redundancy. We also study a naive cost-benefit balance for
duplicated circuits implementing complex phenotypes. From this we derive {\em
phase diagrams} and (phase-like) transitions between single and duplicated
circuits, which constrain evolutionary paths to complex cognition. Back to the
big picture, similar phase diagrams and transitions might constrain I/O and
internal connectivity patterns of neural circuits at large. The formalism of
statistical mechanics seems a natural framework for thsi worthy line of
research.

<p>RNNs are popular dynamical models, used for processing sequential data. Prior
theoretical work in understanding the properties of RNNs has focused on models
with additive interactions, where the input to a unit is a weighted sum of the
output of the remaining units in network. However, there is ample evidence that
neurons can have gating - i.e. multiplicative - interactions. Such gating
interactions have significant effects on the collective dynamics of the
network. Furthermore, the best performing RNNs in machine learning have gating
interactions. Thus, gating interactions are beneficial for information
processing and learning tasks. We develop a dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
of gating to understand the dynamical regimes produced by gating. Our gated RNN
reduces to the classical RNNs in certain limits and is closely related to
popular gated models in machine learning. We use random matrix theory (RMT) to
analytically characterize the spectrum of the Jacobian and show how gating
produces slow modes and marginal stability. Thus, gating is a potential
mechanism to implement computations involving line attractor dynamics. The
long-time behavior of the gated network is studied using its Lyapunov spectrum,
and the DMFT is used to provide an analytical prediction for the maximum
Lyapunov exponent. We also show that gating gives rise to a novel,
discontinuous transition to chaos, where the proliferation of critical points
is decoupled with the appearance of chaotic dynamics; the nature of this
chaotic state is characterized in detail. Using the DMFT and RMT, we produce
phase diagrams for gated RNN. Finally, we address the gradients by leveraging
the adjoint sensitivity framework to develop a DMFT for the gradients. The
theory developed here sheds light on the rich dynamical behaviour produced by
gating interactions and has implications for architectural choices and learning
dynamics.

<p>In this paper we demonstrate how the Nengo neural modeling and simulation
libraries enable users to quickly develop robotic perception and action neural
networks for simulation on neuromorphic hardware using familiar tools, such as
Keras and Python. We identify four primary challenges in building robust,
embedded neurorobotic systems: 1) developing infrastructure for interfacing
with the environment and sensors; 2) processing task specific sensory signals;
3) generating robust, explainable control signals; and 4) compiling neural
networks to run on target hardware. Nengo helps to address these challenges by:
1) providing the NengoInterfaces library, which defines a simple but powerful
API for users to interact with simulations and hardware; 2) providing the
NengoDL library, which lets users use the Keras and TensorFlow API to develop
Nengo models; 3) implementing the Neural Engineering Framework, which provides
white-box methods for implementing known functions and circuits; and 4)
providing multiple backend libraries, such as NengoLoihi, that enable users to
compile the same model to different hardware. We present two examples using
Nengo to develop neural networks that run on CPUs, GPUs, and Intel's
neuromorphic chip, Loihi, to demonstrate this workflow. The first example is an
end-to-end spiking neural network that controls a rover simulated in Mujoco.
The network integrates a deep convolutional network that processes visual input
from mounted cameras to track a target, and a control system implementing
steering and drive functions to guide the rover to the target. The second
example augments a force-based operational space controller with neural
adaptive control to improve performance during a reaching task using a
real-world Kinova Jaco2 robotic arm. Code and details are provided with the
intent of enabling other researchers to build their own neurorobotic systems.

<p>An active area of investigation in the search for quantum advantage is
Quantum Machine Learning. Quantum Machine Learning, and Parameterized Quantum
Circuits in a hybrid quantum-classical setup in particular, could bring
advancements in accuracy by utilizing the high dimensionality of the Hilbert
space as feature space. But is the ability of a quantum circuit to uniformly
address the Hilbert space a good indicator of classification accuracy? In our
work, we use methods and quantifications from prior art to perform a numerical
study in order to evaluate the level of correlation. We find a strong
correlation between the ability of the circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert
space and the achieved classification accuracy for circuits that entail a
single embedding layer followed by 1 or 2 circuit designs. This is based on our
study encompassing 19 circuits in both 1 and 2 layer configuration, evaluated
on 9 datasets of increasing difficulty. Future work will evaluate if this holds
for different circuit designs.

<p>It is always a hot and difficult point to improve the accuracy of
convolutional neural network model and speed up its convergence. Based on the
idea of small world network, a random edge adding algorithm is proposed to
improve the performance of convolutional neural network model. This algorithm
takes the convolutional neural network model as a benchmark, and randomizes
backwards and cross-layer connections with probability p to form a new
convolutional neural network model. The proposed idea can optimize the cross
layer connectivity by changing the topological structure of convolutional
neural network, and provide a new idea for the improvement of the model. The
simulation results based on Fashion-MINST and cifar10 data set show that the
model recognition accuracy and training convergence speed are greatly improved
by random edge adding reconstructed models with aprobability p = 0.1.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05393">Geodesic distance on optimally regularized functional connectomes uncovers individual fingerprints. (arXiv:2003.05393v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Functional connectomes (FCs), have been shown to provide a reproducible
individual fingerprint, which has opened the possibility of personalized
medicine for neuro/psychiatric disorders. Thus, developing accurate ways to
compare FCs is essential to establish associations with behavior and/or
cognition at the individual-level. Canonically, FCs are compared using
Pearson\'s correlation coefficient of the entire functional connectivity
profiles. Recently, it has been proposed that the use of geodesic distance is a
more accurate way of comparing functional connectomes, one which reflects the
underlying non-Euclidean geometry of the data. Computing geodesic distance
requires FCs to be positive-definite and hence invertible matrices. As this
requirement depends on the fMRI scanning length and the parcellation used, it
is not always attainable and sometimes a regularization procedure is required.
In the present work, we show that regularization is not only an algebraic
operation for making FCs invertible, but also that an optimal magnitude of
regularization leads to systematically higher fingerprints. We also show
evidence that optimal regularization is dataset-dependent, and varies as a
function of condition, parcellation, scanning length, and the number of frames
used to compute the FCs. We demonstrate that a universally fixed regularization
does not fully uncover the potential of geodesic distance on individual
fingerprinting, and indeed could severely diminish it. Thus, an optimal
regularization must be estimated on each dataset to uncover the most
differentiable across-subject and reproducible within-subject geodesic
distances between FCs. The resulting pairwise geodesic distances at the optimal
regularization level constitute a very reliable quantification of differences
between subjects.

<p>Understanding proteomic changes in the ischemic penumbra are crucial to rescue those salvageable cells and reduce the damage of an ischemic stroke. Since the penumbra region is dynamic with heterogeneous cells/tissues, tissue sampling from animal models of stroke for the molecular study is a challenge. In this study, cultured hippocampal HT22 cells under hypoxia treatment for 17.5 h with 0.69 mM low glucose (H+LG) could mimic ischemic penumbral cells since they had much higher cell viability and viable cell number compared to hypoxia without glucose (H−G) treatment. To validate established cell-based ischemic penumbral model and understand the beneficial effects of low glucose (LG), quantitative proteomics analysis was performed on H+LG, H−G, and normoxia with normal 22 mM glucose (N+G) treated cells. We identified 427 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between H−G and N+G and further identified 105 DAPs between H+LG and H−G. Analysis of 105 DAPs revealed that LG promotes cell survival by activating HIF1α to enhance glycolysis; preventing the dysregulations of extracellular matrix remodeling, cell cycle and division, and antioxidant and detoxification; as well as attenuating inflammatory reaction response, protein synthesis and neurotransmission activity. Our results demonstrated that this established cell-based system could mimic penumbral conditions and can be used for molecular studies.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61350">Structural basis for the reaction cycle of DASS dicarboxylate transporters</a></h4>

Citrate, α-ketoglutarate and succinate are TCA cycle intermediates that also play essential roles in metabolic signaling and cellular regulation. These di- and tricarboxylates are imported into the cell by the divalent anion sodium symporter (DASS) family of plasma membrane transporters, which contains both cotransporters and exchangers. While DASS proteins transport substrates via an elevator mechanism, to date structures are only available for a single DASS cotransporter protein in a substrate-bound, inward-facing state. We report multiple cryo-EM and X-ray structures in four different states, including three hitherto unseen states, along with molecular dynamics simulations, of both a cotransporter and an exchanger. Comparison of these outward- and inward-facing structures reveal how the transport domain translates and rotates within the framework of the scaffold domain through the transport cycle. Additionally, we propose that DASS transporters ensure substrate coupling by a charge-compensation mechanism, and by structural changes upon substrate release.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59885">Ordered dephosphorylation initiated by the selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives mitotic exit</a></h4>

APC/C-mediated proteolysis of cyclin B and securin promotes anaphase entry, inactivating CDK1 and permitting chromosome segregation, respectively. Reduction of CDK1 activity relieves inhibition of the CDK1-counteracting phosphatases PP1 and PP2A-B55, allowing wide-spread dephosphorylation of substrates. Meanwhile, continued APC/C activity promotes proteolysis of other mitotic regulators. Together, these activities orchestrate a complex series of events during mitotic exit. However, the relative importance of regulated proteolysis and dephosphorylation in dictating the order and timing of these events remains unclear. Using high temporal-resolution proteomics, we compare the relative extent of proteolysis and protein dephosphorylation. This reveals highly-selective rapid proteolysis of cyclin B, securin and geminin at the metaphase-anaphase transition, followed by slow proteolysis of other substrates. Dephosphorylation requires APC/C-dependent destruction of cyclin B and was resolved into PP1-dependent categories with unique sequence motifs. We conclude that dephosphorylation initiated by selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives the bulk of changes observed during mitotic exit.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59191">Behavioural diversity of bonobo prey preference as a potential cultural trait</a></h4>

The importance of cultural processes to behavioural diversity in our closest living relatives is central to revealing the evolutionary origins of human culture. However, the bonobo is often overlooked as a candidate model. Further, a prominent critique to many examples of proposed animal cultures is premature exclusion of environmental confounds known to shape behavioural phenotypes. We addressed these gaps by investigating variation in prey preference between neighbouring bonobo groups that associate and overlap space use. We find group preference for duiker or anomalure hunting otherwise unexplained by variation in spatial usage, seasonality, or hunting party size, composition, and cohesion. Our findings demonstrate that group-specific behaviours emerge independently of the local ecology, indicating that hunting techniques in bonobos may be culturally transmitted. The tolerant intergroup relations of bonobos offer an ideal context to explore drivers of behavioural phenotypes, the essential investigations for phylogenetic constructs of the evolutionary origins of culture.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59003">Extensive and spatially variable within-cell-type heterogeneity across the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

The basolateral amygdala complex (BLA), extensively connected with both local amygdalar nuclei as well as long-range circuits, is involved in a diverse array of functional roles. Understanding the mechanisms of such functional diversity will be greatly informed by understanding the cell-type-specific landscape of the BLA. Here, beginning with single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified both discrete and graded continuous gene-expression differences within the mouse BLA. Via <i>in situ </i>hybridization, we next mapped this discrete transcriptomic heterogeneity onto a sharp spatial border between the basal and lateral amygdala nuclei, and identified continuous spatial gene-expression gradients within each of these regions. These discrete and continuous spatial transformations of transcriptomic cell-type identity were recapitulated by local morphology as well as long-range connectivity. Thus, BLA excitatory neurons are a highly heterogenous collection of neurons that spatially covary in molecular, cellular, and circuit properties. This heterogeneity likely drives pronounced spatial variation in BLA computation and function.

The PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) complex is a multi-component histone H3K27 methyltransferase, best known for silencing <i>Hox</i> genes during embryonic development. The Polycomb-like proteins PHF1, MTF2 and PHF19 are critical components of PRC2 by stimulating its catalytic activity in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Tudor domains of PHF1/19 have been previously shown to be readers of H3K36me3 <i>in vitro</i>. However, some other studies suggest that PHF1 and PHF19 co-localize with the H3K27me3 mark, but not H3K36me3 in cells. Here, we provide further evidence that PHF1 co-localizes with H3t in testis, and its Tudor domain preferentially binds to H3tK27me3 over canonical H3K27me3 <i>in vitro</i>. Our complex structures of the Tudor domains of PHF1 and PHF19 with H3tK27me3 shed light on the molecular basis for preferential recognition of H3tK27me3 by PHF1 and PHF19 over canonical H3K27me3, implicating that H3tK27me3 might be a physiological ligand of PHF1/19.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58026">Multiplexed measurement of variant abundance and activity reveals VKOR topology, active site and human variant impact</a></h4>

Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) drives the vitamin K cycle, activating vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors. VKOR is also the target of the widely used anticoagulant drug, warfarin. Despite VKOR’s pivotal role in coagulation, its structure and active site remain poorly understood. In addition, VKOR variants can cause vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency or alter warfarin response. Here, we used multiplexed, sequencing-based assays to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR missense variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity in cultured human cells. The large-scale functional data, along with an evolutionary coupling analysis, supports a four transmembrane domain topology, with variants in transmembrane domains exhibiting strongly deleterious effects on abundance and activity. Functionally constrained regions of the protein define the active site, and we find that, of four conserved cysteines putatively critical for function, only three are absolutely required. Finally, 25% of human VKOR missense variants show reduced abundance or activity, possibly conferring warfarin sensitivity or causing disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57282">KATANIN-dependent mechanical properties of the stigmatic cell wall mediate the pollen tube path in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

Successful fertilization in angiosperms depends on the proper trajectory of pollen tubes through the pistil tissues to reach the ovules. Pollen tubes first grow within the cell wall of the papilla cells, applying pressure to the cell. Mechanical forces are known to play a major role in plant cell shape by controlling the orientation of cortical microtubules (CMTs), which in turn mediate deposition of cellulose microfibrils (CMFs). Here, by combining imaging, genetic and chemical approaches, we show that isotropic reorientation of CMTs and CMFs in aged Col-0 and <i>katanin1-5</i> (<i>ktn1-5</i>) papilla cells is accompanied by a tendency of pollen tubes to coil around the papillae. We show that this coiled phenotype is associated with specific mechanical properties of the cell walls that provide less resistance to pollen tube growth. Our results reveal an unexpected role for KTN1 in pollen tube guidance on the stigma by ensuring mechanical anisotropy of the papilla cell wall.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57155">Activation of astrocytes in hippocampus decreases fear memory through adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors</a></h4>

Astrocytes respond to and regulate neuronal activity, yet their role in mammalian behavior remains incompletely understood. Especially unclear is whether, and if so how, astrocyte activity regulates contextual fear memory, the dysregulation of which leads to pathological fear-related disorders. We generated <i>GFAP-ChR2-EYFP</i> rats to allow the specific activation of astrocytes in vivo by optogenetics. We found that after memory acquisition within a temporal window, astrocyte activation disrupted memory consolidation and persistently decreased contextual but not cued fear memory accompanied by reduced fear-related anxiety behavior. In vivo microdialysis experiments showed astrocyte photoactivation increased extracellular ATP and adenosine concentrations. Intracerebral blockade of adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors (A<sub>1</sub>Rs) reversed the attenuation of fear memory. Furthermore, intracerebral or intraperitoneal injection of A<sub>1</sub>R agonist mimicked the effects of astrocyte activation. Therefore, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the astrocyte-mediated regulation of fear memory, and suggest a new and important therapeutic strategy against pathological fear-related disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56603">Recurrent processes support a cascade of hierarchical decisions</a></h4>

Perception depends on a complex interplay between feedforward and recurrent processing. Yet, while the former has been extensively characterized, the computational organization of the latter remains largely unknown. Here, we use magneto-encephalography to localize, track and decode the feedforward and recurrent processes of reading, as elicited by letters and digits whose level of ambiguity was parametrically manipulated. We first confirm that a feedforward response propagates through the ventral and dorsal pathways within the first 200 ms. The subsequent activity is distributed across temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices, which sequentially generate five levels of representations culminating in action-specific motor signals. Our decoding analyses reveal that both the content and the timing of these brain responses are best explained by a hierarchy of recurrent neural assemblies, which both maintain and broadcast increasingly rich representations. Together, these results show how recurrent processes generate, over extended time periods, a cascade of decisions that ultimately accounts for subjects' perceptual reports and reaction times.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55794">Intra-species differences in population size shape life history and genome evolution</a></h4>

The evolutionary forces shaping life history divergence within species are largely unknown. Turquoise killifish display differences in lifespan among wild populations, representing an ideal natural experiment in evolution and diversification of life history. By combining genome sequencing and population genetics, we investigate the evolutionary forces shaping lifespan among wild turquoise killifish populations. We generate an improved reference genome assembly and identify genes under positive and purifying selection, as well as those evolving neutrally. Short-lived populations from the outer margin of the species range have small population size and accumulate deleterious mutations in genes significantly enriched in the WNT signaling pathway, neurodegeneration, cancer and the mTOR pathway. We propose that limited population size due to habitat fragmentation and repeated population bottlenecks, by increasing the genome-wide mutation load, exacerbates the effects of mutation accumulation and cumulatively contribute to the short adult lifespan.

Axons of dopaminergic neurons innervate the striatum where they contribute to movement and reinforcement learning. Past work has shown that striatal GABA tonically inhibits dopamine release, but whether GABA-A receptors directly modulate transmission or act indirectly through circuit elements is unresolved. Here, we use whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings to test for GABA-A receptors on the main dopaminergic neuron axons and branching processes within the striatum of adult mice. Application of GABA depolarized axons, but also decreased the amplitude of axonal spikes, limited propagation and reduced striatal dopamine release. The mechanism of inhibition involved sodium channel inactivation and shunting. Lastly, we show the positive allosteric modulator diazepam enhanced GABA-A currents on dopaminergic axons and directly inhibited release, but also likely acts by reducing excitation from cholinergic interneurons. Thus, we reveal the mechanisms of GABA-A receptor modulation of dopamine release and provide new insights into the actions of benzodiazepines within the striatum.

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is the point of connection between motor neurons and skeletal muscle. Although developmental studies have established the importance of cell–cell communication at the NMJ for the integrity and full functionality of this synapse, the contribution of this structure as a primary driver in motor neuron disease pathogenesis remains uncertain. Here, we consider the biology of the NMJ and review emerging lines of investigation that are highlighting the importance of cell–cell interaction at the NMJ in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

In contrast, reducing dentate CCK induced reactive astrocytes, decreased neurogenic proliferation of rNSCs, and upregulated genes involved in neuroinflammation.

Mota Vieira et al. identify CaMKII phosphorylation of the GluN2A subunit on S1459 as a mechanism regulating NMDAR trafficking. An epilepsy-associated rare variant at this same residue, GluN2A-S1459G, results in altered protein interactions, decreased NMDAR surface expression, and reduced synaptic function, providing potential insight into an epilepsy phenotype.

Ramirez et al. use the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia to find genetic pathways driving initiation of Wnt signaling during whole-body regeneration. They identify a wound-induced Wnt ligand and show that it is regulated by inputs from the general wound response and pre-existing patterning information for proper posterior regeneration.

By manipulating surface AMPARs in vivo, Campelo et al. study the function of synaptic potentiation in the whisker-to-cortex system of mice upon whisker trimming. They reveal that the remapping of somatosensory regions and the recovery of altered skills depend on the potentiation of glutamatergic synapses onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons.

DNA replication origin firing requires CDC7 kinase. Rainey et al. show that CDC7 inhibitors cause replication stress, which is primarily mediated by ETAA1/ATR signaling. ETAA1 reinforces the antiproliferative effects of CDC7 inhibitors, with ATR kinase restricting DNA synthesis and mitosis, thus increasing understanding of the origin firing checkpoint.

Multidonor influenza-neutralizing antibodies targeting hemagglutinin-head regions may have vaccine utility. Cheung et al. report a HV2-70-derived multidonor class, the “LPAF-a” antibody class, which targets the hemagglutinin head and can be commonly observed in humans after a single vaccination. Recurrent elicitation is attributed to tight binding between hemagglutinin and germline LPAF-a class antibodies.

Bromley et al. demonstrate that IL-12 or TGF-β can induce CD49a expression by CD8+ T cells. Following herpes simplex virus infection, CD49a is not required for CD8+ T cell entry into or localization within the epidermis. Rather, CD49a promotes skin TRM persistence, dendritic morphology, and optimal response to antigen challenge.

Intercellular variation (cell-to-cell variability) is often regarded as noise, but Wada et al. revealed that it can improve the information transmission of a tissue by information analysis. Intercellular variation can increase the gradualness of dose response of a tissue, resulting in an increase of information transmission.

Economic choice necessarily involves the transformation of abstract, object-based representations to concrete, action-based ones. This transformation is both determined and delimited by the neuroanatomical organization of the regions that implement it. In choice, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in both abstract valuation and cognitive mapping. However, determining the neural processes underlying this transformation has proven difficult. We hypothesized that difficulty stems from in part from the fact that the OFC consists of multiple functionally distinct zones that are distinguished by their differing contributions to the abstract-concrete transformation, and that these functions reflect their differing long-range projections. Here we identify two such subregions, defined by stronger or weaker bidirectional anatomical connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We call these regions OFCin and OFCout, respectively. We find that OFCin, relative to OFCout, shows enhanced functional connectivity with PCC, as indicated by both spike-field coherence and mutual information. We find converging evidence that the OFCin-PCC circuit, but not the OFCout-PCC circuit, relays choice signals from an abstract value space to a concrete action space. Moreover, the OFCin-PCC circuit shows a putative bidirectional mutually excitatory pattern. Together, these results support the hypothesis that OFC-PCC subareal organization is critical for understanding the implementation of offer-action transformation in economic choice.

In order to become proficient native speakers, children have to learn the grammatical rules of their language. These grammatical rules can define morpho-syntactic relations between neighboring as well as distant elements of a sentence, so-called non-adjacent dependencies (NADs). Previous neurophysiological research suggests that NAD learning comprises different developmental stages during early childhood. Children up to 2 years of age show evidence of associative NAD learning under passive listening conditions, while children starting around the age of 3 to 4 years fail to show learning under passive listening, similarly to the pattern observed in adults. To test whether the transition between these developmental stages occurs in a gradual manner, we tested young children's NAD learning in a foreign language using event-related potentials (ERPs). We found ERP evidence of NAD learning across the age of 1 to 3 years. However, the amplitude of the ERP effect indexing NAD learning decreased linearly with increasing age. These findings indicate a gradual transition in children's ability to learn NADs associatively under passive listening during early childhood. Cognitively, this transition might be driven by children's increasing morpho-syntactic knowledge in their native language, hindering NAD learning in novel linguistic contexts during passive listening. Neuroanatomically, changes in brain structure might play a crucial role, especially the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, which promotes top-down learning, as opposed to bottom-up, associative learning. In sum, our study provides evidence that NAD learning under passive listening conditions undergoes a gradual transition between different developmental stages during early childhood.

Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that intense learning can be associated with grey matter volume increases in the adult brain. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we used monocular deprivation in rats to analyze the mechanisms underlying use-dependent grey matter increases. Optometry for quantification of visual acuity was combined with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic techniques in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. We found an increased spatial vision of the open eye which was associated with a transient increase in the volumes of the contralateral visual and lateral entorhinal cortex. In these brain areas dendrites of neurons elongated, and there was a strong increase in the number of spines, the targets of synapses, which was followed by spine maturation and partial pruning. Astrocytes displayed a transient pronounced swelling and underwent a reorganization of their processes. The use-dependent increase in grey matter corresponded predominantly to the swelling of the astrocytes. Experience-dependent increase in brain grey matter volume indicates a gain of structure plasticity with both synaptic and astrocyte remodeling.

Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor is one of the most important trophic proteins in the brain. The role of this growth factor in neuronal plasticity, in health and disease, has been extensively studied. However, mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of Bdnf gene expression in epilepsy are still elusive. In our previous work, using a rat model of neuronal activation upon kainate-induced seizures, we observed a repositioning of Bdnf alleles from nuclear periphery towards the nuclear center. This change of Bdnf intranuclear position was associated with transcriptional gene activity.   In the present study, using the same neuronal activation model, we analyzed the relation between percentage of the Bdnf allele at the nuclear periphery and clinical and morphological traits of epilepsy. We observed that, the decrease of percentage of the Bdnf allele at the nuclear periphery correlates with stronger mossy fiber sprouting - an aberrant form of excitatory circuits formation. Moreover, using in vitro hippocampal cultures we showed that Bdnf repositioning is a consequence of transcriptional activity. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity in primary cultured neurons with Actinomycin D completely blocked Bdnf gene transcription and repositioning observed after neuronal excitation. Interestingly, we observed that histone deacetylases inhibition with Trichostatin A induced slight increase of Bdnf gene transcription and its repositioning even in the absence of neuronal excitation. Presented results provide novel insight into a role of BDNF in epileptogenesis. Moreover, they strengthen the statement that this particular gene is a good candidate to search for new generation of antiepileptic therapies.

Retinal inflammation accelerates photoreceptor cell death (PCD) caused by retinal degeneration. Minocycline, a semisynthetic broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic, has previously been reported to show PCD rescue effect in retinal degeneration. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of minocycline on Cx3cr1 and Ccr2 expression in retinal degeneration. Mertk -/- Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice, which enabled observation of Cx3cr1 - and Ccr2 - expression pattern in inherited retinal degeneration, were used to test the effect of minocycline. Minocycline was systemically administered to Mertk -/- Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice. For observing the effect of minocycline on Cx3cr1 and Ccr2 expression, administration was started on 4-week-old mice and continued for 2 weeks. To assess the PCD rescue effect, minocycline was administered to 6-week-old mice for 2 weeks. The expression pattern of Cx3cr1-GFP and Ccr2-RFP were observed on retinal and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) flat-mounts. The severity of retinal degeneration was assessed on retinal sections. Minocycline administration suppressed Ccr2 expression in Mertk -/- Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice as observed in retinal and RPE flat-mounts. On the contrary, Cx3cr1 expression was not affected by minocycline administration. Retinal degeneration is ameliorated in minocycline administered Mertk -/- Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice. In conclusions, Minocycline suppression of Ccr2 expression correlates to amelioration of retinal degeneration.

A new promising account of human brain function suggests that sensory cortices try to optimise information processing via predictions that are based on prior experiences. The brain is thus likened to a probabilistic prediction machine. There has been a growing - though inconsistent - literature to suggest that features of autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) are associated with a deficit in modelling the world through such prediction-based inference. However empirical evidence for differences in low-level sensorimotor predictions in autism is still lacking. One approach to examining predictive processing in the sensorimotor domain is in the context of self-generated (predictable) as opposed to externally-generated (less predictable) effects. We employed two complementary tasks - forcematching and intentional binding - which examine self- versus externally-generated action effects in terms of sensory attenuation and attentional binding respectively in adults with and without autism. The results show that autism was associated with normal levels of sensory attenuation of internally-generated force and with unaltered temporal attraction of voluntary actions and their outcomes. Thus, our results do not support a general deficit in predictive processing in autism.

The immediate early gene transcription factor early growth response 3 (EGR3) has been identified as a master regulator of genes differentially expressed in the brains of patients with neuropsychiatric illnesses ranging from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to Alzheimers Disease. These studies used bioinformatics approaches that identify networks of gene and proteins. However, few gene targets of EGR3 have actually been identified and validated in the mammalian brain. Our studies in mice have shown that Egr3 is required for stress-responsive behavior, memory, and the form of hippocampal plasticity long-term depression. To identify genes regulated by Egr3 that may play a role in these processes, we conducted an expression microarray on hippocampi from (WT) and Egr3-/- mice following electroconvulsive seizure (ECS), as stimulus that induces maximal expression of immediate early genes including Egr3. We identifies 71 genes that were differentially expressed between the WT and Egr3-/- mice one hour following ECS, a time when we would expect to identify direct targets of EGR3. Bioinformatic analyses showed that many of these are altered in schizophrenia. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that the leading category of differentially expressed are members of the GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible) family (Gadd45b, Gadd45g, and Cdkn1a). Together with members of the AP-1 transcription factor family (Fos, Fosb), and the centromere organization protein Cenpa, that were also identified, these results revealed that Egr3 is required for activity-dependent expression of genes involved in the response to DNA damage. Using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) we validated key genes in the original RNA samples from male mice as well as in an independent cohort of female mice. Promoter analyses indicate that a number of these genes may be direct targets of EGR3 regulation. Our findings indicated that EGR3 as a critical regulator of genes that are disrupted in schizophrenia and reveal a novel role for EGR3 in regulating genes involved in activity-induced DNA damage response.

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is the largest single-cohort prospective longitudinal study of neurodevelopment and children's health in the United States. A cohort of n = 11,880 children aged 9-10 years (and their parents/guardians) were recruited across 22 sites and are being followed with in-person visits on an annual basis for at least 10 years. The study approximates the US population on several key sociodemographic variables, including sex, race, ethnicity, household income, and parental education. Data collected include assessments of health, mental health, substance use, culture and environment and neurocognition, as well as geocoded exposures, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and whole-genome genotyping. Here, we describe the ABCD Study aims and design, as well as issues surrounding estimation and interpretation of meaningful effect sizes using its data, including population inferences, hypothesis testing, power and precision, control of covariates, reproducibility, and interpretation of effects.

After optic nerve crush (ONC), the cell bodies and distal axons of most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) degenerate. RGC somal and distal axon degeneration were previously thought to be controlled by two distinct pathways, involving activation of the kinase DLK and loss of the axon survival factor NMNAT2, respectively. However, we found that mutual palmitoylation by the palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC17 couples the DLK and NMNAT2 signals, which together form a 'trust, but verify system'. In healthy optic nerves, ZDHHC17-dependent palmitoylation ensures NMNAT-dependent distal axon integrity, while following ONC, ZDHHC17-dependent palmitoylation is critical for DLK-dependent somal degeneration. We found that ZDHHC17 also controls survival-versus-degeneration decisions in sensory neurons and identified motifs in NMNAT2 and DLK that govern their ZDHHC17-dependent regulation. These findings suggest that the control of somal and distal axon integrity should be considered as a single, holistic process, involving two palmitoylation-dependent pathways acting in concert.

A concert is a common event at which people gather to share a musical experience. While techniques are increasingly offering insights into naturalistic stimuli perception, this study extended methods to a more ecological context in order to explore real-world music listening within a concert setting. Cardiorespiratory, skin conductance, and facial muscle responses were measured from participants attending one of three concerts with live chamber music performances of works of varying Western Classical styles (Viennese Classical, Contemporary, and Romantic). Collective physiological synchronisation of audience members was operationalised via inter-subject correlation (ISC). By assessing which musical features (obtained via Music Information Retrieval and music-theoretical analyses) evoked moments of high synchrony, logistic regressions revealed that tempo consistently predicted physiological synchrony across all concerts in Classical and Romantic styles, but not the Contemporary style. Highly synchronised responses across all three concert audiences seemed to occur during structural transitional passages, boundaries, and at phrase repetitions. The results support the idea that group synchronisation is linked to musical arousal, structural coherence, and familiarity. By employing physiological ISC and an inter-disciplinary musical analysis, the current study demonstrates a novel approach to gain valuable insight into experiences of naturalistic stimuli in an ecological context.

Objective: Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe, early-onset epilepsy with an increased incidence of sudden death. Evidence of interictal breathing deficits in DS suggest that alterations in subcortical projections to brainstem nuclei may exist, which might be driving comorbidities in DS. The aim of this study was to determine if a subcortical structure, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the extended amygdala, is activated by seizures, exhibits changes in excitability, and expresses any alterations in neurons projecting to a brainstem nucleus associated with respiration, stress response and homeostasis. Methods: Experiments were conducted using F1 mice generated by breeding 129.Scn1a+/- mice with wildtype C57BL/6J mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify neuronal c-fos activation in DS mice after observed spontaneous seizures. Whole cell patch clamp and current clamp electrophysiology recordings were conducted to evaluate changes in intrinsic and synaptic excitability in the BNST. Results: Spontaneous seizures in DS mice significantly enhanced neuronal c-fos expression in the BNST. Further, the BNST had altered AMPA/NMDA postsynaptic receptor composition and showed changes in spontaneous neurotransmission, with greater excitation and decreased inhibition. BNST to parabrachial nucleus (PBN) projection neurons exhibited intrinsic excitability in wildtype mice, while these projection neurons were hypoexcitable in DS mice. Significance: The findings suggest that there is altered excitability in neurons of the BNST, including BNST to PBN projection neurons, in DS mice. These alterations could potentially be driving comorbid aspects of DS outside of seizures, including respiratory dysfunction and sudden death.

We have previously discovered the implication of membrane-type 5-matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP) in AD pathogenesis. Here we shed new light on pathogenic mechanisms by which MT5-MMP controls APP processing and the fate of amyloid beta peptide (A{beta}) and its precursor C99. We found that MT5-MMP in HEK carrying the APP Swedish familial mutation (HEKswe) processed APP to release a soluble form of 95 kDa (sAPP95). This process was hampered by the removal of the C-terminal non-catalytic domains of MT5-MMP. Catalytically inactive MT5-MMP variants increased the levels of A{beta} and promoted APP/C99 sorting in the endolysosomal system. We found interaction of C99 with the C-terminal portion of MT5-MMP, de deletion of which caused a strong degradation of C99 by the proteasome, preventing A{beta} accumulation. These findings reveal novel mechanisms for MT5-MMP control of APP metabolism and C99 fate involving proteolytic and non-proteolytic actions mainly mediated by the C-terminal part of the proteinase.

In addition to encoding sound stimulus features, activity in primary auditory cortex (A1) is modulated by non-sensory behavioral state variables, including arousal. Here, we investigated how arousal, measured by pupil size, influences stimulus discriminability in A1. To do this, we recorded from populations of A1 neurons in awake animals while presenting a diverse set of natural sound stimuli. In contrast to previous work, the large stimulus set allowed us to investigate effects of arousal across a wide range of sensory response space. Arousal consistently increased evoked response magnitude and reduced pairwise noise correlations. On average, these changes improved the accuracy of the neural code. However, effects varied across stimuli; neural coding was most improved for areas of the sensory space where noise correlations interfered with the sensory discrimination axis. We also found that first-order modulation of evoked responses and second-order modulation of correlated variability acted on distinct neural populations and timescales, suggesting that arousal interacts with multiple circuits underlying activity in A1.

Clinical and preclinical studies report that chronic stress induces behavioral deficits as well as volumetric changes and synaptic alterations in corticolimbic brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMY), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and hippocampus (HPC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the structural changes associated with chronic restraint stress (CRS) exposure and determine the relation between these volumetric changes with behavioral and synaptic alterations. Mice exposed to 2 and 5 weeks of CRS exhibited a significant increase in behavioral emotionality. Macrostructural changes assessed via MRI identified a negative CRS effect on total brain volume, proportional to behavioral emotionality. Region-specific changes within corticolimbic brain structures identified that only the ACC showed significant decrease in volume following CRS exposure (p&lt;0.05). Reduced ACC correlated with increased behavioral emotionality (r=-0.50; p=0.002). Although not significantly altered by CRS, AMY and NAc (but not the HPC) volumes were negatively correlated with behavioral emotionality. Structural covariance network analysis revealed progressive decreased ACC degree following CRS exposure. Finally, reduced ACC volume correlated with decreased PSD95 (but not VGLUT1) puncta density (r=0.35, p&lt;0.05), which also correlated with increased behavioral emotionality (r=-0.36, p&lt;0.05), together suggesting that altered synaptic strength is an underlying substrate of the volumetric and behavioral effects of CRS Our results demonstrate that chronic stress effects on ACC volume and synaptic density are linked to the expression of depressive-like deficits. Our findings highlight key structural and morphological alterations in the ACC relevant to stress-related illness including mood and anxiety disorders.

Feature-based attention is the ability to selectively attend to a particular feature (e.g., attend to red but not green items while looking for the ketchup bottle in your refrigerator), and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) measured from the human electroencephalogram (EEG) signal have been used to track the neural deployment of feature-based attention. Although many published studies suggest that we can use trial-by-trial cues to enhance relevant feature information (i.e., greater SSVEP response to the cued color), there is ongoing debate about whether participants may likewise use trial-by-trial cues to ignore a particular feature. Here, we report the results of a pre-registered study in which participants either were cued to attend or to ignore a color. Counter to prior work, we found no attention-related modulation of the SSVEP response in either cue condition. However, positive control analyses revealed that participants paid some degree of attention to the cued color (i.e., we observed a greater P300 component to targets in the attended versus the unattended color). In light of these unexpected null results, we conducted a focused review of methodological considerations for studies of feature-based attention using SSVEPs. In the review, we quantify potentially important stimulus parameters that have been used in the past (e.g., stimulation frequency; trial counts) and we discuss the potential importance of these and other task factors (e.g., feature-based priming) for SSVEP studies.

Theoretical proposals have previously been put forward regarding the computational basis of interoception. Following on this, we recently reported using an active inference approach to 1) quantitatively simulate interoceptive computation, and 2) fit the model to behavior on a cardiac awareness task. In the present work, we attempted to replicate our previous results in an independent group of healthy participants. We provide evidence confirming our previous finding that healthy individuals adaptively adjust prior expectations and interoceptive sensory precision estimates based on task context. This offers further support for the utility of computational approaches to characterizing the dynamics of interoceptive processing.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a brain imaging technique which provides detailed insights into brain function and its disruption in various brain disorders. fMRI data can be analyzed using data-driven or region-of-interest based methods. The data-driven analysis of brain activity maps involves several steps, the first of which is identifying whether the maps capture what might be interpreted as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) or artifacts. This is followed by linking the ICNs to known anatomical and/or functional parcellations. Optionally, as in the study of functional network connectivity (FNC), rearranging the connectivity graph is also necessary for systematic interpretation. Here we present a toolbox that automates all these processes under minimal or no supervision with high accuracy. We provide a pretrained cross-validated elastic-net regularized general linear model for the noisecloud toolbox to separate the ICNs from artifacts. We include several well-known anatomical and functional parcellations from which researchers can choose to label the activity maps. Finally, we integrate a method for maximizing the within-domain modularity to generate a more systematically structured FNC matrix. We improve upon and integrate existing techniques and new methods to design this toolbox which can take care of all the above needs. Specifically, we show that our pretrained model achieves 89% accuracy and 100% precision at classifying ICNs from artifacts in a validation dataset. Researchers are generating brain imaging data and analyzing brain activity at an ever-increasing rate. The Autolabeller toolbox can help automate such analyses for faster and reproducible research.

Since sensory information is always present in the environment, animals need to internally regulate their responsiveness to fit the context. During sleep, the threshold for sensory arousal is increased so that only stimuli of sufficient magnitude can cross it. The mechanisms that make arousability flexible are largely mysterious, but they must integrate sensory information with information about physiology. We discovered a gut-to-brain signaling pathway that uses information about ingested nutrients to control arousability from sleep, without affecting sleep duration. Protein ingestion causes endocrine cells in the Drosophila gut to increase production of CCHa1, a peptide that decreases sensory responsiveness. CCHa1 is received by a small group of brain dopaminergic neurons whose activity gates behavioral responsiveness to mechanical stimulation. These dopaminergic neurons innervate the mushroom body, a brain structure involved in determining sleep duration. This work describes how the gut tunes arousability according to nutrient availability, allowing deeper sleep when dietary proteins are abundant. It also suggests that behavioral flexibility is increased through independent tuning of sleep depth and duration.

Local field potentials (LFPs) in visual cortex are reliably modulated when the subject's focus of attention is cued into versus out of the receptive field of the recorded sites, similar to modulation of spiking activity. However, human psychophysics studies have used an additional attention condition, neutral cueing, for decades. The effect of neutral cueing on spiking responses was examined recently and found to be intermediate between cued and uncued conditions. However, whether LFPs are also precise enough to represent graded states of attention is unknown. We found that LFPs during neutral cueing were intermediate between cued and uncued conditions, and, for a single electrode, attention was more discriminable using high frequency (&gt;30 Hz) LFP power than spikes. Surprisingly, spikes did not outperform LFPs even when discriminability was computed using multiple electrodes. These results constrain the spatial scale attention operates over and highlight the usefulness of LFPs in studying attention.

Animals compare their ongoing sensations with internal, experience-based, reference models; mismatch between reality and expectation can signal opportunity or danger, and can shape behavior. The nature of internal reference models is largely unknown. We describe a model that enables moment-to-moment luminance evaluation in flies. Abrupt shifts to lighting conditions inconsistent with the subjective time-of-day trigger locomotion,whereas shifts to appropriate conditions induce quiescence. The time-of-day prediction is generated by a slowly shifting activity balance between opposing neuronal populations, LNvs and DN1as. The two populations undergo structural changes in axon length that accord with, and are required for, conveying time-of-day information. Each day, in each population, the circadian clock directs cellular remodeling such that the maximum axonal length in one population coincides with the minimum in the other; preventing remodeling prevents transitioning between opposing internal states. We propose that a dynamic predictive model resides in the shifting connectivities of the LNv-DN1a circuit.

Hyperglycemia is a key determinant for development of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Inadequate glycemic control exacerbates retinopathy, while normalization of glucose levels delays its progression. In hyperglycemia, hexokinase is saturated and excess glucose is metabolized to sorbitol by aldose reductase via the polyol pathway. Therapies to reduce retinal polyol accumulation for the prevention of DR have been elusive due to low sorbitol dehydrogenase levels in the retina and inadequate inhibition of aldose reductase. Using systemic and conditional genetic inactivation, we targeted the primary facilitative glucose transporter in the retina, Glut1, as a preventative therapeutic in diabetic male and female mice. Unlike wildtype diabetics, diabetic Glut1+/- mice did not display elevated Glut1 levels in the retina. Furthermore, diabetic Glut1+/- mice exhibited ameliorated ERG defects, inflammation and oxidative stress, which was correlated with a significant reduction in retinal sorbitol accumulation. RPE-specific reduction of Glut1 did not prevent an increase in retinal sorbitol content or early hallmarks of DR. However, like diabetic Glut1+/- mice, reduction of Glut1 specifically in retinal neurons mitigated polyol accumulation and completely prevented retinal dysfunction and the elevation of markers for oxidative stress and inflammation associated with diabetes. These results suggest that modulation of retinal polyol accumulation via Glut1 in photoreceptors can circumvent the difficulties in regulating systemic glucose metabolism and be exploited to prevent DR.

Age-related memory deficits are correlated with neural hyperactivity in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Abnormal CA3 hyperactivity in aged rats has been proposed to contribute to an imbalance between the normal tradeoff between pattern separation and pattern completion, resulting in overly rigid representations. Recent evidence of functional heterogeneity along the CA3 transverse axis suggests that proximal CA3 supports pattern separation while distal CA3 supports pattern completion. It is not known whether age-related CA3 hyperactivity is uniformly represented along the CA3 transverse axis. We examined the firing rates of CA3 neurons from male young and aged Long-Evans rats along the CA3 transverse axis. Consistent with prior studies, young CA3 cells showed an increasing gradient in mean firing rate from proximal to distal CA3. However, aged CA3 cells showed an opposite trend, with a decreasing gradient from proximal to distal CA3. Thus, CA3 cells in aged rats were hyperactive in proximal CA3, but possibly hypoactive in distal CA3, compared to young rats. We suggest that, in combination with altered inputs from the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus, the proximal CA3 region of aged rats may switch from its normal function that reflects the pattern separation output of the DG and instead performs a computation that reflects an abnormal bias toward pattern completion. In parallel, distal CA3 of aged rats may create weaker attractor basins that promote bistable representations under certain conditions.

<p>by Yoonjoo Choi, Sukyo Jeong, Jung-Min Choi, Christian Ndong, Karl E. Griswold, Chris Bailey-Kellogg, Hak-Sung Kim</p>

Precise binding mode identification and subsequent affinity improvement without structure determination remain a challenge in the development of therapeutic proteins. However, relevant experimental techniques are generally quite costly, and purely computational methods have been unreliable. Here, we show that integrated computational and experimental epitope localization followed by full-atom energy minimization can yield an accurate complex model structure which ultimately enables effective affinity improvement and redesign of binding specificity. As proof-of-concept, we used a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein binder, called a repebody (Rb), that specifically recognizes human IgG<sub>1</sub> (hIgG<sub>1</sub>). We performed computationally-guided identification of the Rb:hIgG<sub>1</sub> binding mode and leveraged the resulting model to reengineer the Rb so as to significantly increase its binding affinity for hIgG<sub>1</sub> as well as redesign its specificity toward multiple IgGs from other species. Experimental structure determination verified that our Rb:hIgG<sub>1</sub> model closely matched the co-crystal structure. Using a benchmark of other LRR protein complexes, we further demonstrated that the present approach may be broadly applicable to proteins undergoing relatively small conformational changes upon target binding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wzv2JsLh9jY" width="1" />

Interactions between species generate the functions on which ecosystems and humans depend. However, we lack an understanding of the risk that interaction loss poses to ecological communities. Here, we quantify the risk of interaction loss for 4,330 species interactions from 41 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks across 6 continents. We estimate risk as a function of interaction vulnerability to extinction (likelihood of loss) and contribution to network feasibility, a measure of how much an interaction helps a community tolerate environmental perturbations. Remarkably, we find that more vulnerable interactions have higher contributions to network feasibility. Furthermore, interactions tend to have more similar vulnerability and contribution to feasibility across networks than expected by chance, suggesting that vulnerability and feasibility contribution may be intrinsic properties of interactions, rather than only a function of ecological context. These results may provide a starting point for prioritising interactions for conservation in species interaction networks in the future.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VUTxJ8X8-Rk" width="1" />

Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-severing protein spastin (spastic paraplegia 4 [SPG4]) cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), associated with neurodegeneration, spasticity, and motor impairment. Complicated forms (complicated HSP [cHSP]) further include cognitive deficits and dementia; however, the etiology and dysfunctional mechanisms of cHSP have remained unknown. Here, we report specific working and associative memory deficits upon spastin depletion in mice. Loss of spastin-mediated severing leads to reduced synapse numbers, accompanied by lower miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequencies. At the subcellular level, mutant neurons are characterized by longer microtubules with increased tubulin polyglutamylation levels. Notably, these conditions reduce kinesin-microtubule binding, impair the processivity of kinesin family protein (KIF) 5, and reduce the delivery of presynaptic vesicles and postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Rescue experiments confirm the specificity of these results by showing that wild-type spastin, but not the severing-deficient and disease-associated K388R mutant, normalizes the effects at the synaptic, microtubule, and transport levels. In addition, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of tubulin polyglutamylation on spastin knockout background normalizes KIF5 transport deficits and attenuates the loss of excitatory synapses. Our data provide a mechanism that connects spastin dysfunction with the regulation of kinesin-mediated cargo transport, synapse integrity, and cognition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qIyNCUbD91s" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with cognitive trajectories.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants were 343 clinically normal individuals (women, 58%; 73.8 [8.5] years) and 55 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; women, 38%; 76.9 [7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined <sup>18</sup>F‐Flortaucipir (FTP)‐positron emission tomography (PET) signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP‐signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Aβ‐PET positive / negative (+ / −) and sex*apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex‐differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Women showed significantly higher FTP‐signals than men across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.007). β‐amyloid (Aβ)‐moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio‐lateral temporal regions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.007); Aβ + women exhibited greater FTP‐signal than other groups. APOEε4‐moderated sex differences in FTP‐signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Women with higher FTP‐signals in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than men (<i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra‐temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in women with the onset of clinical symptomatology.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial conducted at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 patients with PD with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society ‐ Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25 mg once daily to 1 mg twice daily, phase I). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for 4 weeks (phase II). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week 4. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose = 0.75 mg) or placebo. At week 4, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 3.74, <i>p</i> = 0.002, effect size = 1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95% CI −0.16 to 2.16, <i>p</i> = 0.280, effect size = 0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference: 1.63, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.18, <i>p</i> = 0.030, effect size = 0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% in the placebo group and 32% in the nabilone group). There were no serious AEs.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for patients with PD with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Manifestation of neurological symptoms in certain patients of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) has warranted for their virus‐induced etiogenesis. SARS‐CoV‐2, the causative agent of COVID‐19, belongs to the genus of betacoronaviruses which also includes SARS‐CoV‐1 and MERS‐CoV; causative agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, respectively. Studies demonstrating the neural invasion of SARS‐CoV‐2 <i>in vivo</i> are still scarce, although such characteristics of certain other betacoronaviruses are well demonstrated in the literature. Based on the recent evidence for the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 host cell entry receptors in specific components of the human nervous and vascular tissue, a neural (olfactory and/or vagal), and a hematogenous—crossing the blood–brain barrier, routes have been proposed. The neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 may also arise as a consequence of the “cytokine storm” (characteristically present in severe disease) induced neuroinflammation, or co‐morbidities. There is also a possibility that, there may be multiple routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the brain, or multiple mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms. In this review article, we have discussed the possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 brain entry based on the emerging evidence for this virus, and that available for other betacoronaviruses in literature.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine associations between tau and amyloid‐beta (Aβ) molecular PET and both Alzheimer‐related pathology and 4‐repeat tau pathology in autopsy‐confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‐four patients had [<sup>18</sup>F]‐Flortaucipir PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) n = 10, corticobasal degeneration (CBD) n = 10, FTLD‐TDP n = 3 and Pick's disease n = 1). All but one had Pittsburgh Compound‐B (PiB) PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts and semi‐quantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta‐region‐of‐interest (ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in one PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty‐one (87.5%) had Braak I‐IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta‐ROI SUVR were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age‐related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer‐related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Children with sickle cell disease experience cognitive deficits even when unaffected by stroke. Using functional connectivity MRI as a potential biomarker of cognitive function, we tested our hypothesis that children with sickle cell disease would have decreased functional connectivity, and that children experiencing the greatest metabolic stress, indicated by elevated oxygen extraction fraction, would have the lowest connectivity.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We prospectively obtained brain MRIs and cognitive testing in healthy controls and children with sickle cell disease.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from 60 participants (20 controls, 40 sickle cell disease). There was no difference in global cognition or cognitive subdomains between cohorts. However, we found decreased functional connectivity within the sensory‐motor, lateral sensory‐motor, auditory, salience and subcortical networks in participants with sickle cell disease compared to controls. Further, as white matter oxygen extraction fraction increased, connectivity within the visual (p = 0.008, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.760 [‐1.297, ‐0.224]), default mode (p = 0.012, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.417 [‐0.731, ‐0.104]), and cingulo‐opercular (p = 0.009, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.883 [‐1.517, ‐0.250]) networks decreased.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We conclude that there is diminished functional connectivity within these anatomically‐contiguous networks in children with sickle cell disease compared to controls, even when differences are not seen with cognitive testing. Increased white matter oxygen extraction fraction was associated with decreased connectivity in select networks. These data suggest that elevated oxygen extraction fraction and disrupted functional connectivity are potentially pre‐symptomatic neuroimaging biomarkers for cognitive decline in sickle cell disease.</p>

<p>Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific <i>Bmal1</i> knockout cones (cone‐<i>Bmal1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup>) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, <i>Complexin3</i> (<i>Cplx3</i>), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐<i>Bmal1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of <i>Cplx4—</i>the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of <i>Cplx3</i> and none upstream of exon one of <i>Cplx4</i>. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.</p>

<p>The deterioration of field potential (FP) recording quality and yield by in vivo multielectrode arrays (MEA) within days to weeks of implantation severely limits progress in basic and applied brain research. The prevailing hypothesis is that implantation of MEA platforms initiate and perpetuate inflammatory processes which culminate in the formation of scar tissue (the foreign body response, FBR) around the implant. The FBR leads to progressive degradation of the recording qualities by displacing neurons away from the electrode surfaces, increasing the resistance between neurons (current source) and the sensing pads and by reducing the neurons’ excitable membrane properties and functional synaptic connectivity through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meticulous attempts to causally relate the cellular composition, cell density, and electrical properties of the FBR have failed to unequivocally correlate the deterioration of recording quality with the histological severity of the FBR. Based on confocal and electron microscope analysis of thin sections of polyimide based MEA implants along with the surrounding brain tissue at different points in time after implantation, we propose that abrupt FP amplitude attenuation occurs at the implant/brain-parenchyma junction as a result of high seal resistance insulation formed by adhering microglia to the implant surfaces. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, that FP decrease occurs across the encapsulating scar of the implanted MEA, this mechanism potentially explains why no correlations have been found between the dimensions and density of the FBR and the recording quality. Recognizing that the seal resistance formed by adhering-microglia to the implant constitutes a downstream element undermining extracellular FP recordings, suggests that approaches to mitigate the formation of the insulating glial could lead to improved recording quality and yield.</p>

<p>Interleukin (IL)-33 belongs to a novel chromatin-associated cytokine newly recognized by the IL-1 family, and its specific receptor is the orphan IL-1 receptor (ST2). Cumulative evidence suggests that IL-33 plays a crucial effect on the pathological changes and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and injuries, such as recurrent neonatal seizures (RNS). However, the specific roles of IL-33 and its related molecular mechanisms in RNS remain confused. In the present study, we investigated the protein expression changes and co-localized cell types of IL-33 or ST2, as well as the effect of IL-33 on RNS-induced neurobehavioral defects, weight loss, and apoptosis. Moreover, an inhibitor of IL-33, anti-IL-33 was performed to further exploited underlying mechanisms. We found that administration of IL-33 up-regulated the expression levels of IL-33 and ST2, and increased the number of its co-localization with Olig-2-positive oligodendrocytes and NeuN-positive neurons at 72 h post-RNS. Noteworthily, RNS-induced neurobehavioral deficits, bodyweight loss, and spatial learning and memory impairment, as well as cell apoptosis, were reversed by IL-33 pretreatment. Additionally, the increase in IL-1β and TNF-α levels, up-regulation of ER stress, as well as a decrease in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and an increase in pro-apoptotic protein CC-3 induced by RNS are prevented by administration of IL-33. Moreover, IL-33 in combination with Anti-IL-33 significantly inverted the effects of IL-33 or Anti-IL-33 alone on apoptosis, ER stress, and inflammation. Collectively, these data suggest that IL-33 attenuates RNS-induced neurobehavioral disorders, bodyweight loss, and spatial learning and memory deficits, at least in part through mechanisms involved in inhibition of apoptosis, ER stress, and neuro-inflammation.</p>

<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked muscular disease caused by defective expression of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin (Dp427). Selected autonomic and central neurons, including retinal neurons, express Dp427 and/or dystrophin shorter isoforms. Because of this, DMD patients may also experience different forms of cognitive impairment, neurological and autonomic disorders, and specific visual defects. DMD-related damages to the nervous system are established during development, suggesting a role for all dystrophin isoforms in neural circuit development and differentiation; however, to date, their function in retinogenesis has never been investigated. In this large-scale study, we analyzed whether the lack of Dp427 affects late retinogenesis in the mdx mouse, the most well studied animal model of DMD. Retinal gene expression and layer maturation, as well as neural cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, were evaluated in E18 and/or P0, P5, P10, and adult mice. In mdx mice, expression of Capn3, Id3 (E18-P5), and Dtnb (P5) genes, encoding proteins involved in different aspects of retina development and synaptogenesis (e.g., Calpain 3, DNA-binding protein inhibitor-3, and β-dystrobrevin, respectively), was transiently reduced compared to age-matched wild type mice. Concomitantly, a difference in the time required for the retinal ganglion cell layer to reach appropriate thickness was observed (P0–P5). Immunolabeling for specific cell markers also evidenced a significant dysregulation in the number of GABAergic amacrine cells (P5–P10), a transient decrease in the area immunopositive for the Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 1 (VGluT1) during ribbon synapse maturation (P10) and a reduction in the number of calretinin<sup>+</sup> retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (adults). Finally, the number of proliferating retinal progenitor cells (P5–P10) and apoptotic cells (P10) was reduced. These results support the hypothesis of a role for Dp427 during late retinogenesis different from those proposed in consolidated neural circuits. In particular, Dp427 may be involved in shaping specific steps of retina differentiation. Notably, although most of the above described quantitative alterations recover over time, the number of calretinin<sup>+</sup> RGCs is reduced only in the mature retina. This suggests that alterations subtler than the timing of retinal maturation may occur, a hypothesis that demands further in-depth functional studies.</p>

<p>The understanding of human and non-human microstructural brain alterations in the course of neurodegenerative diseases has substantially improved by the non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Animal models (including disease or knockout models) allow for a variety of experimental manipulations, which are not applicable to humans. Thus, the DTI approach provides a promising tool for cross-species cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations of the neurobiological targets and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. This overview with a systematic review focuses on the principles of DTI analysis as used in studies at the group level in living preclinical models of neurodegeneration. The translational aspect from in-vivo animal models toward (clinical) applications in humans is covered as well as the DTI-based research of the non-human brains' microstructure, the methodological aspects in data processing and analysis, and data interpretation at different abstraction levels. The aim of integrating DTI in multiparametric or multimodal imaging protocols will allow the interrogation of DTI data in terms of directional flow of information and may identify the microstructural underpinnings of neurodegeneration-related patterns.</p>

<p>A deep brain stimulation system capable of closed-loop neuromodulation is a type of bidirectional deep brain-computer interface (dBCI), in which neural signals are recorded, decoded, and then used as the input commands for neuromodulation at the same site in the brain. The challenge in assuring successful implementation of bidirectional dBCIs in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is to discover and decode stable, robust and reliable neural inputs that can be tracked during stimulation, and to optimize neurostimulation patterns and parameters (control policies) for motor behaviors at the brain interface, which are customized to the individual. In this perspective, we will outline the work done in our lab regarding the evolution of the discovery of neural and behavioral control variables relevant to PD, the development of a novel personalized dual-threshold control policy relevant to the individual’s therapeutic window and the application of these to investigations of closed-loop STN DBS driven by neural or kinematic inputs, using the first generation of bidirectional dBCIs.</p>

<p>Action real-time strategy gaming (ARSG)—a major genre of action video gaming (AVG)—has both action and strategy elements. ARSG requires attention, visual working memory (VWM), sensorimotor skills, team cooperation, and strategy-making abilities, thus offering promising insights into the learning-induced plasticity. However, it is yet unknown whether the ARSG experience is related to the development of VWM capacity. Using both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements, this study tested whether ARSG experts had larger VWM capacity than non-experts in a change detection task. The behavioral results showed that ARSG experts had higher accuracy and larger VWM capacity than non-experts. In addition, the ERP results revealed that the difference wave of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) component (size 4–size 2) elicited by experts was significantly larger than that of non-experts, suggesting that the VWM capacity was higher in experts than in non-experts. Thus, the findings suggested that prolonged ARSG experience is correlative with the enhancement of VWM.</p>

<p>Human memory retrieval is the core cognitive process of the human brain whenever it is processing the information. Less study has focused on exploring the neural correlates of the memory retrieval of scientific concepts when presented in word and picture modalities. Fewer studies have investigated the differences in the involved brain regions and how the brain dynamics in these regions would associate with the accuracy of the memory retrieval process. Therefore, this study specifically focused on investigating the human brain dynamics of participants when they retrieve physics concepts in word vs. pictorial modalities, and whether electroencephalogram (EEG) activities can predict the correctness of the retrieval of physics concepts. The results indicated that word modality induced a significant stronger right frontal theta augmentation than pictorial modality during the physics concepts retrieval process, whereas the picture modality induced a significantly greater right parietal alpha suppression than the word modality throughout the retrieval process spurred by the physics concept presentations. In addition, greater frontal midline theta augmentation was observed for incorrect responses than the correct responses during retrieve physics concepts. Moreover, the frontal midline theta power has greater negative predictive power for predicting the accuracy of physics concepts retrieval. In summary, the participants were more likely to retrieve physics concepts correctly if a lower amount of theta were allocated during the maintaining period from 2,000 ms through 3,500 ms before making responses. It provides insight for our future application of brain computer interface (BCI) in real-time science learning. This study implies that the lower frontal midline theta power is associated with a lower degree of cognitive control and active maintenance of representations as participants approach a correct answer.</p>

<p>Objectives: Investigate and identify the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance measured by using different cognitive tests taken from Cambridge Brain Science (CBS).</p><p>Methods: Thirty subjects, divided into two groups (aerobic and effort), undergo twelve cognitive tests from CBS. A comparison between the pre- and post-exercise results in terms of cognitive performance differences is carried out. Regression analysis between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features and CBS tests results is performed.</p><p>Results: In most CBS tests, there is an improvement, or at least a confirmation, of the subject's cognitive ability, for both groups. Reasoning (80–100%), concentration (80–87%), and planning tests (93–100%) seem to undergo critical positive changes. The regression analysis, performed by using a set of different algorithms, has demonstrated that it is possible, by monitoring the HRV during the exercise, to predict to some extent the cognitive performance, i.e., the CBS tests results. The best performing regression algorithms are Simple Linear (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.098, effort group: 3.350, both groups: 2.747) and REPTree (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.955, effort group: 3.315, both groups: 3.121). The statistical analysis has proved that physical activity is statistically useful for the subjects in improving their cognitive performance.</p><p>Conclusions: This study has numerically appraised the improvement, the conservation, or the worsening on different aspects of cognition. The found mathematical relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance suggests that it is possible to predict the beneficial effect of various exercises on executive and attentive control.</p>

<p>Scaffolds and patterned substrates are among the most successful strategies to dictate the connectivity between neurons in culture. Here, we used numerical simulations to investigate the capacity of physical obstacles placed on a flat substrate to shape structural connectivity, and in turn collective dynamics and effective connectivity, in biologically-realistic neuronal networks. We considered μ-sized obstacles placed in mm-sized networks. Three main obstacle shapes were explored, namely crosses, circles and triangles of isosceles profile. They occupied either a small area fraction of the substrate or populated it entirely in a periodic manner. From the point of view of structure, all obstacles promoted short length-scale connections, shifted the in- and out-degree distributions toward lower values, and increased the modularity of the networks. The capacity of obstacles to shape distinct structural traits depended on their density and the ratio between axonal length and substrate diameter. For high densities, different features were triggered depending on obstacle shape, with crosses trapping axons in their vicinity and triangles funneling axons along the reverse direction of their tip. From the point of view of dynamics, obstacles reduced the capacity of networks to spontaneously activate, with triangles in turn strongly dictating the direction of activity propagation. Effective connectivity networks, inferred using transfer entropy, exhibited distinct modular traits, indicating that the presence of obstacles facilitated the formation of local effective microcircuits.

<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Prolonged excessive alcohol intake contributes to increased production of reactive oxygen species that triggers neuroimmune response and cellular apoptosis and necrosis via lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial, protein or DNA damage. Long term binge alcohol consumption also upregulates glutamate receptors, glucocorticoids and reduces reuptake of glutamate in the central nervous system, resulting in glutamate excitotoxicity, and eventually mitochondrial injury and cell death. In this review, we delineate the following principles in alcohol-induced neurodegeneration: (1) alcohol-induced oxidative stress, (2) neuroimmune response toward increased oxidants and lipopolysaccharide, (3) glutamate excitotoxicity and cell injury, and (4) interplay between oxidative stress, neuroimmune response and excitotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration and (5) potential chronic alcohol intake-induced development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>In the central nervous system, dopamine is well-known as the neuromodulator that is involved with regulating reward, addiction, motivation, and fine motor control. Yet, decades of findings are revealing another crucial function of dopamine: modulating sensory systems. Dopamine is endogenous to subsets of neurons in the retina and olfactory bulb (OB), where it sharpens sensory processing of visual and olfactory information. For example, dopamine modulation allows the neural circuity in the retina to transition from processing dim light to daylight and the neural circuity in the OB to regulate odor discrimination and detection. Dopamine accomplishes these tasks through numerous, complex mechanisms in both neural structures. In this review, we provide an overview of the established and emerging research on these mechanisms and describe similarities and differences in dopamine expression and modulation of synaptic transmission in the retinas and OBs of various vertebrate organisms. This includes discussion of dopamine neurons’ morphologies, potential identities, and biophysical properties along with their contributions to circadian rhythms and stimulus-driven synthesis, activation, and release of dopamine. As dysregulation of some of these mechanisms may occur in patients with Parkinson’s disease, these symptoms are also discussed. The exploration and comparison of these two separate dopamine populations shows just how remarkably similar the retina and OB are, even though they are functionally distinct. It also shows that the modulatory properties of dopamine neurons are just as important to vision and olfaction as they are to motor coordination and neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative conditions, thus, we hope this review encourages further research to elucidate these mechanisms.</p>

<p>The aim of the study was to investigate whether blood pressure (BP) differed among people with different dementia diagnoses, mild cognitive impairment, and subjective cognitive decline and whether BP differences were observed across age and sex. Our study population comprised clinical data from 6,236 patients (53.5% women) aged 45–97 years (Mean = 73.9, SD = 9.6) referred to dementia assessment in 42 outpatient clinics across Norway during 2009–2019. Patients with the following diagnoses were included: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), mixed AD and VaD, and dementia in Parkinson’s disease/Lewy body disease (PDD/LBD). For all diagnostic groups, SBP increased with age until about 80 years, after which it trended downward, whereas DBP declined after 60 years of age for all diagnostic groups. Patients aged 65 years and younger with SCD had lower SBP compared to AD patients at the same age, but SBP increased rapidly with increasing age, resulting in a substantially higher SBP at 80 + years compared with all other diagnostic groups. No other differences in SBP or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were found among patients with the different dementia diagnosis. Neither SBP nor DBP differed between MCI and AD groups. An interaction between age and gender was found for SBP at younger ages, as women started out with a lower pressure than men did but ended up with higher SBP.</p>Conclusion<p>Among 80+ patients, blood pressure did not differ as a function of the various dementia disorders. The SBP for the SCD patients of various age groups differed from all other diagnostic groups, indicating either that internal regulation of BP in older people is a risk factor for dementia or that brain damage causing dementia or MCI may led to changes in blood pressure. Brain aging seems to influence SBP differently in men and women.</p>

<p>Gait disturbances are important clinical features of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) that increase the risk of falls and disability. Brain structural alterations and gait disturbances in CSVD patients have been well demonstrated. However, intrinsic resting cerebral function patterns in CSVD patients with gait disorders remain largely unknown. Fifty-eight CSVD patients were enrolled in our studies and categorized into the gait disorder group (CSVD-GD, n = 29) and no-gait disorder group (CSVD-NGD, n = 29) based on a gait examination. Gait was quantitatively assessed with the Timed Up and Go test and the intelligent device for energy expenditure and activity (IDEEA). Functional MRI and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) analyses were employed to explore local intrinsic neural oscillation alterations. Functional connectivity based on fALFF results was calculated to detect the potential changes in remote connectivity. Compared with the CSVD-NGD group, the CSVD-GD group showed decreased fALFF in regions mainly located in the sensorimotor network and frontoparietal network, such as the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) and the left superior parietal gyrus, and increased fALFF in the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part), the left caudate, and the left precuneus. Moreover, the CSVD-GD patients exhibited lower connectivity between the SMA.L and temporal lobe, which was related to gait speed. The fALFF value of the SMA.L was associated with cadence. This study highlights the regional and network interaction abnormalities of the SMA in CSVD patients with gait disturbances. These findings could provide further insight into the neural mechanisms of gait disturbances in CSVD.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to identify the genetic cause for progressive peripheral nerve disease in a Venezuelan family. Despite the growing list of genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, many patients with axonal forms lack a genetic diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pedigree was constructed, based on family clinical data. Next‐generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was performed for 6 affected family members. Muscle biopsies from 4 family members were used for analysis of muscle histology and ultrastructure, mtDNA sequencing, and RNA quantification. Ultrastructural studies were performed on sensory nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Electrodiagnostic testing showed a motor and sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Pedigree analysis revealed inheritance only through the maternal line, consistent with mitochondrial transmission. Sequencing of mtDNA identified a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Val</sup> (<i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Val</i>
</sup>) gene, m.1661A&gt;G, present at nearly 100% heteroplasmy, which disrupts a Watson–Crick base pair in the T‐stem‐loop. Muscle biopsies showed chronic denervation/reinnervation changes, whereas biochemical analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme activities showed reduction in multiple ETC complexes. Northern blots from skeletal muscle total RNA showed severe reduction in abundance of <i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Val</i>
</sup>, and mildly increased <i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Phe</i>
</sup>, in subjects compared with unrelated age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members demonstrated ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities (hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and crystalline arrays) consistent with a mitochondrial neuropathy.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We identify a previously unreported cause of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, a mutation in the <i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Val</i>
</sup>, in a Venezuelan family. This work expands the list of CMT‐associated genes from protein‐coding genes to a mitochondrial <i>tRNA</i> gene. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The number of diagnosed fatal encephalitis cases in humans caused by the classical Borna disease virus (BoDV‐1) has been increasing, ever since it was proved that BoDV‐1 can cause human infections. However, awareness of this entity is low, and a specific imaging pattern has not yet been identified. We therefore provide the first comprehensive description of the morphology of human BoDV‐1 encephalitis, with histopathological verification of imaging abnormalities.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In an institutional review board‐approved multicenter study, we carried out a retrospective analysis of 55 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 19 patients with confirmed BoDV‐1 encephalitis. Fifty brain regions were analyzed systematically (T1w, T2w, T2*w, T1w + Gd, and DWI), in order to discern a specific pattern of inflammation. Histopathological analysis of 25 locations in one patient served as correlation for MRI abnormalities.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline imaging, acquired at a mean of 11 ± 10 days after symptom onset, in addition to follow‐up scans of 16 patients, revealed characteristic T2 hyperintensities with a predilection for the head of the caudate nucleus, insula, and cortical spread to the limbic system, whereas the occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres were unaffected. This gradient was confirmed by histology. Nine patients (47.4%) developed T1 hyperintensities of the basal ganglia, corresponding to accumulated lipid phagocytes on histology and typical for late‐stage necrosis.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BoDV‐1 encephalitis shows a distinct pattern of inflammation in both the early and late stages of the disease. Its appearance can mimic sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease on MRI and should be considered a differential diagnosis in the case of atypical clinical presentation. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Early discrimination of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics (SMs) poses a diagnostic challenge. The circulating metabolome might reflect pathophysiological events related to acute IS. Here, we investigated the utility of early metabolic changes for differentiating IS from SM.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed untargeted metabolomics on serum samples obtained from patients with IS (N = 508) and SM (N = 349; defined by absence of a diffusion weighted imaging [DWI] positive lesion on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) who presented to the hospital within 24 hours after symptom onset (median time from symptom onset to blood sampling = 3.3 hours; interquartile range [IQR] = 1.6–6.7 hours) and from neurologically normal controls (NCs; N = 112). We compared diagnostic groups in a discovery‐validation approach by applying multivariable linear regression models, machine learning techniques, and propensity score matching. We further performed a targeted look‐up of published metabolite sets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of 41 metabolites were significantly associated with IS compared to NCs. The top metabolites showing the highest value in separating IS from SMs were asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine, pregnenolone sulfate, and adenosine. Together, these 4 metabolites differentiated patients with IS from SMs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 in the replication sample, which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography (CT; AUC = 0.80) obtained for routine diagnostics. They were further superior to previously published metabolite sets detected in our samples. All 4 metabolites returned to control levels by day 90.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A set of 4 metabolites with known biological effects relevant to stroke pathophysiology shows unprecedented utility to identify patients with IS upon hospital arrival, thus encouraging further investigation, including multicenter studies. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>by Zhiyuan Li, Bo Liu, Sophia Hsin-Jung Li, Christopher G. King, Zemer Gitai, Ned S. Wingreen</p>

Microbes face intense competition in the natural world, and so need to wisely allocate their resources to multiple functions, in particular to metabolism. Understanding competition among metabolic strategies that are subject to trade-offs is therefore crucial for deeper insight into the competition, cooperation, and community assembly of microorganisms. In this work, we evaluate competing metabolic strategies within an ecological context by considering not only how the environment influences cell growth, but also how microbes shape their chemical environment. Utilizing chemostat-based resource-competition models, we exhibit a set of intuitive and general procedures for assessing metabolic strategies. Using this framework, we are able to relate and unify multiple metabolic models, and to demonstrate how the fitness landscape of strategies becomes intrinsically dynamic due to species-environment feedback. Such dynamic fitness landscapes produce rich behaviors, and prove to be crucial for ecological and evolutionarily stable coexistence in all the models we examined.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/swn6bAByPBQ" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has long been known that age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is more common, more severe, and with an earlier onset in men compared to women. Even in the absence of confounding factors such as noise exposure, these sexdifferences in susceptibility to ARHL remain. In the last decade, insight into the pleiotrophic nature by which estrogen signaling can impact multiple signaling mechanisms to mediate downstream changes in gene expression and/or elicit rapid changes in cellular function has rapidly gathered pace, and a role for estrogen signaling in the biological pathways that confer neuroprotection is becoming undeniable. Here I review the evidence why we need to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) when investigating the etiology of ARHL. Loss of auditory function with aging is frequency‐specific and modulated by SABV. Evidence also suggests that differences in cochlear physiology between women and men are already present from birth. Understanding the molecular basis of these sex differences in ARHL will accelerate the development of precision medicine therapies for ARHL.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Deleterious age‐related changes in the central auditory nervous system have been referred to as central age‐related hearing impairment (ARHI) or central presbycusis. Central ARHI is often assumed to be the consequence of peripheral ARHI. However, it is possible that certain aspects of central ARHI are independent from peripheral ARHI. A confirmation of this possibility could lead to significant improvements in current rehabilitation practices. The major difficulty in addressing this issue arises from confounding factors, such as other age‐related changes in both the cochlea and central non‐auditory brain structures. Because gap detection is a common measure of central auditory temporal processing, and gap detection thresholds are less influenced by changes in other brain functions such as learning and memory, we investigated the potential relationship between age‐related peripheral hearing loss (i.e., audiograms) and age‐related changes in gap detection. Consistent with previous studies, a significant difference was found for gap detection thresholds between young and older adults. However, among older adults, no significant associations were observed between gap detection ability and several other independent variables including the pure tone audiogram average, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐Vocabulary score, gender, and age. Statistical analyses showed little or no contributions from these independent variables to gap detection thresholds. Thus, our data indicate that age‐related decline in central temporal processing is largely independent of peripheral ARHI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and aldosterone all demonstrate vital roles in sustaining auditory function through either the maintenance of cochlear neurons, up/down regulation of critical molecules (i.e., IGF‐1, BDNF, etc.), or generation of the endocochlear potential. With disease and/or age, hormone expression begins to decline drastically, which ultimately affects cochlear structures and the integrity of cochlear cells. The following review explores the latest findings as well as realistic outcomes for hormone therapy treatment in the auditory system. This information could serve as a potential guide for patients considering hormone therapy as a medicinal choice to alleviate the signs of onset of presbycusis—age‐related hearing loss. Additional scientific investigations could also be carried out to further enhance recent findings.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The aging cochlea is subjected to a number of pathological changes to play a role in the onset of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL). Although ARHL has often been thought of as the result of the loss of hair cells, it is in fact a disorder with a complex etiology, arising from the changes to both the organ of Corti and its supporting structures. In this study, we examine two aging pathologies that have not been studied in detail despite their apparent prevalence; the fusion, elongation, and engulfment of cochlear inner hair cell stereocilia, and the changes that occur to the tectorial membrane (TM), a structure overlying the organ of Corti that modulates its physical properties in response to sound. Our work demonstrates that similar pathological changes occur in these two structures in the aging cochleae of both mice and humans, examines the ultrastructural changes that underlie stereocilial fusion, and identifies the lost TM components that lead to changes in membrane structure. We place these changes into the context of the wider pathology of the aging cochlea, and identify how they may be important in particular for understanding the more subtle hearing pathologies that precede auditory threshold loss in ARHL.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) has recently been confirmed as a common complex trait, that is, it is heritable with many genetic variants each contributing a small amount of risk, as well as environmental determinants. Historically, attempts to identify the genetic variants underlying the ARHL have been of limited success, relying on the selection of candidate genes based on the limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of the condition, and linkage studies in samples comprising related individuals. More recently genome‐wide association studies have been performed, but these require very large samples having consistent and reliable phenotyping for hearing loss (HL), and early attempts suffered from lack of reliable replication of their findings. Replicated variants shown associated with ARHL include those lying in genes <i>GRM7</i>, <i>ISG20</i>, <i>TRIOBP</i>,<i> ILDR1</i>, and <i>EYA4.</i> The availability of large biobanks and the development of collaborative consortia have led to a breakthrough over the last couple of years, and many new genetic variants associated with ARHL are becoming available, through the analysis publicly available bioresources and electronic health records. These findings along with immunohistochemistry and mouse models of HL look set to help disentangle the genetic architecture of ARHL, and highlight the need for standardization of phenotyping methods to facilitate data sharing and collaboration across research networks.</p>

<p>Deficiency of GDNF in cochlear hair cells (Atoh1‐Cre) reduces inner hair cell (IHC)/cochlear output, although outer hair cell (OHC) function is normal. Deficiency of GDNF in cochlear neurons (TrkC‐Cre) leads to increased OHC and IHC/auditory nerve responses. Tissue‐specific GDNF expression during development is thus required to maintain normal hearing.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glial‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been proposed as a potent neurotrophic factor with the potential to cure neurodegenerative diseases. In the cochlea, GDNF has been detected in auditory neurons and sensory receptor cells and its expression is upregulated upon trauma. Moreover, the application of GDNF in different animal models of deafness has shown its capacity to prevent hearing loss and promoted its future use in therapeutic trials in humans. In the present study we have examined the endogenous requirement of GDNF during auditory development in mice. Using a <i>lacZ</i> knockin allele we have confirmed the expression of GDNF in the cochlea including its sensory regions during development. Global inactivation of GDNF throughout the hearing system using a <i>Foxg1‐</i>Cre line causes perinatal lethality but reveals no apparent defects during formation of the cochlea. Using <i>TrkC‐</i>Cre and <i>Atoh1‐</i>Cre lines, we were able to generate viable mutants lacking GDNF in auditory neurons or both auditory neurons and sensory hair cells. These mutants show normal frequency‐dependent auditory thresholds. However, mechanoelectrical response properties of outer hair cells (OHCs) in <i>TrkC‐</i>Cre <i>GDNF</i> mutants are altered at low thresholds. Furthermore, auditory brainstem wave analysis shows an abnormal increase of wave I. On the other hand, <i>Atoh1‐</i>Cre <i>GDNF</i> mutants show normal OHC function but their auditory brainstem wave pattern is reduced at the levels of wave I, III and IV. These results show that GDNF expression during the development is required to maintain functional hearing at different levels of the auditory system.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to perceive and interpret environmental sound accurately is conserved across many species and is fundamental for understanding communication via vocalizations. Auditory acuity and temporally controlled neuronal firing underpin this ability. Deterioration in neuronal firing precision likely contributes to poorer hearing performance, yet the role of neural processing by key nuclei in the central auditory pathways is not fully understood. Here, we record from the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body [MGB]) of young and middle‐aged, normally hearing male CBA/Ca mice. We report changes in temporal processing of auditory stimuli, with neurons recorded from ventral and medial MGB subdivisions of older animals more likely to synchronize to rapid temporally varying stimuli. MGB subdivisions also showed increased probability of neuronal firing and shorter response latencies to clicks in older animals. Histological investigation of neuronal extracellular specializations, perineuronal nets (PNNs) and axonal coats, in the MGB identified greater organization of PNNs around MGB neurons and the presence of axonal coats within older animals. This supports the observation that neural responses recorded from ventral and medial MGB of older mice were more likely to synchronize to temporally varying stimuli presented at faster repetition rates than those recorded from young adult animals. These changes are observed in animals with normal hearing thresholds, confirming that neural processing differs between the MGB subdivisions and such processing is associated with age‐related changes to PNNs. Understanding these age‐related changes and how they occur have important implications for the design of effective therapeutic interventions to improve speech intelligibility into later life.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decrease in hearing sensitivity. Previous electrophysiological and behavioral studies have demonstrated that the CBA/CaJ mouse strain is an appropriate model for the late‐onset hearing loss found in humans. However, few studies have characterized hearing in these mice behaviorally using longitudinal methodologies. The goal of this research was to utilize a longitudinal design and operant conditioning procedures with positive reinforcement to construct audiograms and temporal integration functions in aging CBA/CaJ mice. In the first experiment, thresholds were collected for 8, 16, 24, 42, and 64 kHz pure tones in 30 male and 35 female CBA/CaJ mice. Similar to humans, mice had higher thresholds for high frequency tones than for low frequency pure tones across the lifespan. Female mice had better hearing acuity than males after 645 days of age. In the second experiment, temporal integration functions were constructed for 18 male and 18 female mice for 16 and 64 kHz tones varying in duration. Mice showed an increase in thresholds for tones shorter than 200 ms, reaching peak performance at shorter durations than other rodent species. Overall, CBA/CaJ mice experience ARHL for pure tones of different frequencies and durations, making them a good model for studies on hearing loss. These findings highlight the importance of using a wide range of stimuli and a longitudinal design when comparing presbycusis across different species.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Presbycusis, or age‐related hearing loss (ARHL), occurs in most mammals with variations in the age of onset, rate of decline, and magnitude of degeneration in the central nervous system and inner ear. The affected cochlear structures include the stria vascularis and its vasculature, spiral ligament, sensory hair cells and auditory neurons. Dysfunction of the stria vascularis results in a reduced endocochlear potential. Without this potential, the cochlear amplification provided by the electro‐motility of the outer hair cells is insufficient, and a high‐frequency hearing‐loss results. Degeneration of the sensory cells, especially the outer hair cells also leads to hearing loss due to lack of amplification. Neuronal degeneration, another hallmark of ARHL, most likely underlies difficulties with speech discrimination, especially in noisy environments. Noise exposure is a major cause of ARHL. It is well‐known to cause sensory cell degeneration, especially the outer hair cells at the high frequency end of the cochlea. Even loud, but not uncomfortable, sound levels can lead to synaptopathy and ultimately neuronal degeneration. Even in the absence of a noisy environment, aged cells degenerate. This pathology most likely results from damage to mitochondria and contributes to degenerative changes in the stria vascularis, hair cells, and neurons. The genetic underpinnings of ARHL are still unknown and most likely involve various combinations of genes. At present, the only effective strategy for reducing ARHL is prevention of noise exposure. If future strategies can improve mitochondrial activity and reduce oxidative damage in old age, these should also bring relief.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathophysiology of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL), or presbycusis, involves a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. The fundamental biomolecular mechanisms of ARHL have been well described, including the roles of membrane transport, reactive oxygen species, cochlear synaptopathy, vascular insults, hormones, and microRNA, to name a few. The genetic basis underlying these mechanisms remains under‐investigated and poorly understood. The emergence of genome‐wide association studies has allowed for the identification of specific groups of genes involved in ARHL. This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of ARHL, the genetic basis underlying these processes and suggests future directions for research and potential therapeutic avenues.</p>

<p>The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.</p>

<p>Schwann cells were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by Western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mesolimbic dopamine system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic dopamine system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic dopamine systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.</p>

<p>The present report examines the coinciding results of two study groups each presenting a power-of-two function to describe network structures underlying perceptual processes in one case and word production during verbal fluency tasks in the other. The former is theorized as neural cliques organized according to the function N = 2<sup>i</sup> − 1, whereas the latter assumes word conglomerations thinkable as tuples following the function N = 2<sup>i</sup>. Both theories assume the innate optimization of energy efficiency to cause the specific connectivity structure. The vast resemblance between both formulae motivated the development of a common formulation. This was obtained by using a vector space model, in which the configuration of neural cliques or connected words is represented by a N-dimensional state vector. A further analysis of the model showed that the entire time course of word production could be derived using basically one single minimal transformation-matrix. This again seems in line with the principle of maximum energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Dendritic spines are small protrusions studding neuronal dendrites, first described in 1888 by Ramón y Cajal using his famous Golgi stainings. Around 50 years later the advance of electron microscopy (EM) confirmed Cajal’s intuition that spines constitute the postsynaptic site of most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. The finding that spine density decreases between young and adult ages in fixed tissues suggested that spines are dynamic. It is only a decade ago that two-photon microscopy (TPM) has unambiguously proven the dynamic nature of spines, through the repeated imaging of single spines in live animals. Spine dynamics comprise formation, disappearance, and stabilization of spines and are modulated by neuronal activity and developmental age. Here, we review several emerging concepts in the field that start to answer the following key questions: What are the external signals triggering spine dynamics and the molecular mechanisms involved? What is, in return, the role of spine dynamics in circuit-rewiring, learning, and neuropsychiatric disorders?</p>

<p>Muscle dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC) links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. In neurons, dystroglycan and dystrophin, two major components of the DGC, localize in a subset of GABAergic synapses, where their function is unclear. Here we used mouse models to analyze the specific role of the DGC in the organization and function of inhibitory synapses. Loss of full-length dystrophin in mdx mice resulted in a selective depletion of the transmembrane β-dystroglycan isoform from inhibitory post-synaptic sites in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Remarkably, there were no differences in the synaptic distribution of the extracellular α-dystroglycan subunit, of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and neuroligin 2. In contrast, conditional deletion of the dystroglycan gene from Purkinje cells caused a disruption of the DGC and severely impaired post-synaptic clustering of neuroligin 2, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and scaffolding proteins. Accordingly, whole-cell patch-clamp analysis revealed a significant reduction in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs recorded from Purkinje cells. In the long-term, deletion of dystroglycan resulted in a significant decrease of GABAergic innervation of Purkinje cells and caused an impairment of motor learning functions. These results show that dystroglycan is an essential synaptic organizer at GABAergic synapses in Purkinje cells.</p>

<p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the chemical synapse connecting motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers. NMJs allow all voluntary movements, and ensure vital functions like breathing. Changes in the structure and function of NMJs are hallmarks of numerous pathological conditions that affect muscle function including sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the morphological and functional perturbations in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments of the NMJ remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the role of the metabolic pathway associated to the kinase TOR (Target of Rapamycin) in the development, maintenance and alterations of the NMJ. This is of particular interest as the TOR pathway has been implicated in aging, but its role at the NMJ is still ill-defined. We highlight the respective functions of the two TOR-associated complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, and discuss the role of localized protein synthesis and autophagy regulation in motor neuron terminals and sub-synaptic regions of muscle fibers and their possible effects on NMJ maintenance.</p>

<p>Patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) show severe problems in hippocampus dependent memory consolidation. Memory consolidation strongly depends on an intact dialog between the hippocampus and neocortical structures. Deficits in hippocampal signal transmission are known to provoke disturbances in memory formation. In the present study, we investigate changes of synaptic plasticity at hippocampal output structures in an experimental animal model of TLE. In pilocarpine-treated rats, we found suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions such as the subiculum and the entorhinal cortex (EC). Subsequently we focused on the subiculum, serving as the major relay station between the hippocampus proper and downstream structures. In control animals, subicular pyramidal cells express different forms of LTP depending on their intrinsic firing pattern. In line with our extracellular recordings, we could show that LTP could only be induced in a minority of subicular pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that a well-characterized cAMP-dependent signaling pathway involved in presynaptic forms of LTP is perturbed in pilocarpine-treated animals. Our findings suggest that in TLE, disturbances of synaptic plasticity may influence the information flow between the hippocampus and the neocortex.</p>

<p>Excessive tau phosphorylation is the hallmark of tauopathies. Today’s research thus focusses on the development of drugs targeting this pathological feature. To test new drugs in preclinical studies, animal models are needed that properly mimic this pathological hallmark. The htau mouse is a well-known model expressing human but lacking murine tau, allowing to evaluate the efficacy of tau modifying compounds without interference from murine tau. Htau mice are well-characterized for tau pathology at older age, although it is often not specified on which genetic background analyzed animals were bred. Since it was shown that the genetic background can influence the pathology, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of young and adult htau mice on a C57BL/6J background by analyzing ptau Ser202 and ptau Ser396 levels in the cortex and hippocampus of 3 and 12 month old animals by immunofluorescent labelling. Additionally, we evaluated total tau, ptau Thr231 and ptau Thr181 in the soluble and insoluble brain fraction of 3–15 month old htau mice by immunosorbent assay. Our results show that ptau levels of all analyzed residues and age groups are similar without strong increases over age. These data show that tau is already phosphorylated at the age of 3 months suggesting that phosphorylation starts even earlier. The early start of tau phosphorylation in htau mice enables the use of these mice for efficacy studies already at very young age.</p>

<p>The present study aims to investigate intrinsic abnormalities of brain and the effect of antiepileptic treatment on brain activity in Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Twenty-six drug-naïve patients (DNP) and 22 drug-receiving patients (DRP) with BECTS were collected in this study. Static amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (sALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) were applied to resting-state fMRI data. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed for affected regions identified by static and dynamic analysis. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc statistical analyses were performed for between-group differences. Abnormal sALFF and dALFF values were correlated with clinical features of patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC), DNP group demonstrated alterations of sALFF and/or dALFF in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellum, hippocampus, pallidum and cingulate cortex, in which the values were close to normal in DRP. Notably, sALFF and dALFF showed specific sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in basal ganglia and cerebellum. Additionally, DRP showed additional changes in precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and occipital visual cortex. Compared with HC, the DNP showed increased FC in default network and motion-related networks, and the DRP showed decreased FC in default network. The MPFC, hippocampus, SMA, basal ganglia and cerebellum are indicated to be intrinsically affected regions and effective therapeutic targets. And the FC profiles of default and motion-related networks might be potential core indicators for clinical treatment. This study revealed potential neuromodulatory targets and helped understand pathomechanism of BECTS. Static and dynamic analyses should be combined to investigate neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Meditation practices are often used to cultivate interoception or internally-oriented attention to bodily sensations, which may improve health via cognitive and emotional regulation of bodily signals. However, it remains unclear how meditation impacts internal attention (IA) states due to lack of measurement tools that can objectively assess mental states during meditation practice itself, and produce time estimates of internal focus at individual or group levels. To address these measurement gaps, we tested the feasibility of applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to single-subject fMRI data to: (1) learn and recognize internal attentional states relevant for meditation during a directed IA task; and (2) decode or estimate the presence of those IA states during an independent meditation session. Within a mixed sample of experienced meditators and novice controls (N = 16), we first used MVPA to develop single-subject brain classifiers for five modes of attention during an IA task in which subjects were specifically instructed to engage in one of five states [i.e., meditation-related states: breath attention, mind wandering (MW), and self-referential processing, and control states: attention to feet and sounds]. Using standard cross-validation procedures, MVPA classifiers were trained in five of six IA blocks for each subject, and predictive accuracy was tested on the independent sixth block (iterated until all volumes were tested, N = 2,160). Across participants, all five IA states were significantly recognized well above chance (&gt;41% vs. 20% chance). At the individual level, IA states were recognized in most participants (87.5%), suggesting that recognition of IA neural patterns may be generalizable for most participants, particularly experienced meditators. Next, for those who showed accurate IA neural patterns, the originally trained classifiers were applied to a separate meditation run (10-min) to make an inference about the percentage time engaged in each IA state (breath attention, MW, or self-referential processing). Preliminary group-level analyses demonstrated that during meditation practice, participants spent more time attending to breath compared to MW or self-referential processing. This paradigm established the feasibility of using MVPA classifiers to objectively assess mental states during meditation at the participant level, which holds promise for improved measurement of internal attention states cultivated by meditation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00290">Neural Correlates of Group Versus Individual Problem Solving Revealed by fMRI</a></h4>

<p>Group problem solving is a prototypical complex collective intellectual activity. Psychological research provides compelling evidence that problem solving in groups is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from doing so alone. However, the question of whether individual and collective problem solving involve the same neural substrate has not yet been addressed, mainly due to methodological limitations. In the current study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to compare brain activation when participants solved Raven-like matrix problems in a small group and individually. In the group condition, the participant in the scanner was able to discuss the problem with other team members using a special communication device. In the individual condition, the participant was required to think aloud while solving the problem in the silent presence of the other team members. Greater activation was found in several brain regions during group problem solving, including the medial prefrontal cortex; lateral parietal, cingulate, precuneus and retrosplenial cortices; frontal and temporal poles. These areas have been identified as potential components of the so-called “social brain” on the basis of research using offline judgments of material related to socializing. Therefore, this study demonstrated the actual involvement of these regions in real-time social interactions, such as group problem solving. However, further connectivity analysis revealed that the social brain components are co-activated, but do not increase their coupling during cooperation as would be suggested for a holistic network. We suggest that the social mode of the brain may be described instead as a re-configuration of connectivity between basic networks, and we found decreased connectivity between the language and salience networks in the group compared to the individual condition. A control experiment showed that the findings from the main experiment cannot be entirely accounted for by discourse comprehension. Thus, the study demonstrates affordances provided by the presented new technique for neuroimaging the “group mind,” implementing the single-brain version of the second-person neuroscience approach.</p>

<p>Chronotherapy is a treatment for mood disorders, including major depressive disorder, mania, and bipolar disorder (BD). Neurotransmitters associated with the pathology of mood disorders exhibit circadian rhythms. A functional deficit in the neural circuits related to mood disorders disturbs the circadian rhythm; chronotherapy is an intervention that helps resynchronize the patient's biological clock with the periodic daily cycle, leading to amelioration of symptoms. In previous reports, Hadaeghi et al. proposed a non-linear dynamic model composed of the frontal and sensory cortical neural networks and the hypothalamus to explain the relationship between deficits in neural function in the frontal cortex and the disturbed circadian rhythm/mood transitions in BD (hereinafter referred to as the Hadaeghi model). In this model, neural activity in the frontal and sensory lobes exhibits periodic behavior in the healthy state; while in BD, this neural activity is in a state of chaos-chaos intermittency; this temporal departure from the healthy periodic state disturbs the circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus. In this study, we propose an intervention based on a feedback method called the “reduced region of orbit” (RRO) method to facilitate the transition of the disturbed frontal cortical neural activity underlying BD to healthy periodic activity. Our simulation was based on the Hadaeghi model. We used an RRO feedback signal based on the return-map structure of the simulated frontal and sensory lobes to induce synchronization with a relatively weak periodic signal corresponding to the healthy condition by applying feedback of appropriate strength. The RRO feedback signal induces chaotic resonance, which facilitates the transition to healthy, periodic frontal neural activity, although this synchronization is restricted to a relatively low frequency of the periodic input signal. Additionally, applying an appropriate strength of the RRO feedback signal lowered the amplitude of the periodic input signal required to induce a synchronous state compared with the periodic signal applied alone. In conclusion, through a chaotic-resonance effect induced by the RRO feedback method, the state of the disturbed frontal neural activity characteristic of BD was transformed into a state close to healthy periodic activity by relatively weak periodic perturbations. Thus, RRO feedback-modulated chronotherapy might be an innovative new type of minimally invasive chronotherapy.</p>

<p>Generation of neuronal diversity is a biological strategy widely used in the brain to process complex information. The olfactory bulb is the first relay station of olfactory information in the vertebrate central nervous system. In the olfactory bulb, axons of the olfactory sensory neurons form synapses with dendrites of projection neurons that transmit the olfactory information to the olfactory cortex. Historically, the olfactory bulb projection neurons have been classified into two populations, mitral cells and tufted cells. The somata of these cells are distinctly segregated within the layers of the olfactory bulb; the mitral cells are located in the mitral cell layer while the tufted cells are found in the external plexiform layer. Although mitral and tufted cells share many morphological, biophysical, and molecular characteristics, they differ in soma size, projection patterns of their dendrites and axons, and odor responses. In addition, tufted cells are further subclassified based on the relative depth of their somata location in the external plexiform layer. Evidence suggests that different types of tufted cells have distinct cellular properties and play different roles in olfactory information processing. Therefore, mitral and different types of tufted cells are considered as starting points for parallel pathways of olfactory information processing in the brain. Moreover, recent studies suggest that mitral cells also consist of heterogeneous subpopulations with different cellular properties despite the fact that the mitral cell layer is a single-cell layer. In this review, we first compare the morphology of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb of different vertebrate species. Next, we explore the similarities and differences among subpopulations of projection neurons in the rodent olfactory bulb. We also discuss the timing of neurogenesis as a factor for the generation of projection neuron heterogeneity in the olfactory bulb. Knowledge about the subpopulations of olfactory bulb projection neurons will contribute to a better understanding of the complex olfactory information processing in higher brain regions.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder in which maternal immune activation (MIA) and increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) may contribute. Previous studies using iPSC-derived cerebral organoids and neuronal cells demonstrated developmental malformation and transcriptional dysregulations, including TNF receptors and their signaling genes, common to SZ patients with diverse genetic backgrounds. In the present study, we examined the significance of the common TNF receptor dysregulations by transiently exposing cerebral organoids from embryonic stem cells (ESC) and from representative control and SZ patient iPSCs to TNF. In control iPSC organoids, TNF produced malformations qualitatively similar in, but generally less pronounced than, the malformations of the SZ iPSC-derived organoids. TNF and SZ alone disrupted subcortical rosettes and dispersed proliferating Ki67<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells (NPC) from the organoid ventricular zone (VZ) into the cortical zone (CZ). In the CZ, the absence of large ramified pan-Neu<sup>+</sup> neurons coincided with loss of myelinated neurites despite increased cortical accumulation of O4<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes. The number of calretinin<sup>+</sup> interneurons increased; however, they lacked the preferential parallel orientation to the organoid surface. SZ and SZ+TNF affected fine cortical and subcortical organoid structure by replacing cells with extracellular matrix (ECM)-like fibers The SZ condition increased developmental vulnerability to TNF, leading to more pronounced changes in NPC, pan-Neu<sup>+</sup> neurons, and interneurons. Both SZ- and TNF-induced malformations were associated with the loss of nuclear (n)FGFR1 form in the CZ and its upregulation in deep IZ regions, while in earlier studies blocking nFGFR1 reproduced cortical malformations observed in SZ. Computational analysis of ChiPseq and RNAseq datasets shows that nFGFR1 directly targets neurogenic, oligodendrogenic, cell migration, and ECM genes, and that the FGFR1-targeted TNF receptor and signaling genes are overexpressed in SZ NPC. Through these changes, the developing brain with the inherited SZ genome dysregulation may suffer increased vulnerability to TNF and thus, MIA.</p>

Background<p>This pilot study explored differences in distribution of white matter hyperintensities (called leukoaraiosis; LA) in older adults (mean age = 67 years) with atrial fibrillation (AF) vs. non-AF peers measured by: (1) depth distribution; (2) anterior-posterior distribution; (3) associations between LA and cortical thickness; and (4) presence of lacunae and stroke.</p>Methods<p>Participant data (AF n = 17; non-AF peers n = 17) were acquired with the same magnetic resonance imaging protocols.

Cortical thickness by lobe was assessed relative to LA load.</p>Results<p>Relative to non-AF peers, the AF group had twice the total LA volume (AF = 2.1% vs. Non-AF = 0.9%), over 10 times greater infracortical LA (AF = 0.72% vs. Non-AF = 0.07%), and three times greater deep LA (AF = 2.1% vs. Non-AF = 0.6%). Examinations of the extent of LA in anterior vs. posterior regions revealed a trend for more posterior relative to anterior LA. In the entire sample, total LA and infracortical LA were negatively associated with temporal lobe thickness. Only those with AF presented with lacunae or stroke.</p>Conclusion<p>Aging adults with AF had more total white matter disease than those without AF, particularly near the cortical mantle and deep within the cortex. Total and infracortical white matter disease in the entire sample negatively associated with temporal lobe thickness. Results suggest that those with AF have a distinct pattern of LA relative to those without AF, and that LA severity for all individuals may associate with structural changes in the cortex.</p>

Background<p>The human brain has high energy requirements that continuously support healthy neuronal activity and cognition. A disruption in brain energy metabolism (BEM) may contribute to early neuropathological changes such as accumulation of β-amyloid and tau in vulnerable populations. One such population is amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) where some individuals are at risk for developing dementia, i.e. Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent advances in imaging technology are providing new avenues to measure BEM accurately using 31phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) at ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic strength 7-Tesla. This study investigates whether a methodology using partial volume-coil 31P MRS at 7T over parieto-occipital lobes can accurately quantify high-energy phosphate and membrane phospholipid metabolites in aMCI. A secondary objective was to explore BEM and membrane phospholipid indices’ correspondence with cognitive performance in domains of executive function (EF), memory, attention, and visuospatial skills in aMCI, a heterogeneous population.</p>Methods<p>19 aMCI participants enrolled in the study completed cognitive assessment and 31P MRS scan. BEM indices were measured using three energy indicators: energy reserve (PCr/t-ATP), energy consumption (intracellular_Pi/t-ATP), and metabolic state (PCr/intracellular_Pi) along with regulatory co-factors of BEM-intracellular Mg<sup>2 + </sup> and pH; whereas the ratio of phosphomonoesters (PMEs) to phosphodiesters (PDEs) – membrane phospholipid indicator.</p>Results<p>31P MRS scan showed thirteen well-resolved peaks with precise quantification of the phosphorus metabolites at UHF. The higher BEM indices were associated with lower cognitive performance of memory [(energy reserve indicator: CVLT p = 0.004), (metabolic state indicator: CVLT p = 0.007)], executive function [(metabolic state indicator: TOSL (p = 0.044)], and attention [(pH: selective auditory task, p = 0.044)]. The finding of an inverse relationship observed in the parieto-occipital lobes suggests an association between neuronal energy markers with cognition in aMCI.</p>Conclusion<p>The significant contribution of this preliminary research was to establish the feasibility of utilizing a methodology at UHF to accurately measure high-energy phosphate and membrane phospholipid metabolites in a population with heterogeneous outcomes. This work offers a novel approach for future work to further elucidate early dementia biomarkers or precursors to the downstream accumulation of amyloid and tau using the combination of MRS-PET imaging modalities in AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59799">Dissociable control of unconditioned responses and associative fear learning by parabrachial CGRP neurons</a></h4>

Parabrachial CGRP neurons receive diverse threat-related signals and contribute to multiple phases of adaptive threat responses in mice, with their inactivation attenuating both unconditioned behavioral responses to somatic pain and fear-memory formation. Because CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons respond broadly to multi-modal threats, it remains unknown how these distinct adaptive processes are individually engaged. We show that while three partially separable subsets of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons broadly collateralize to their respective downstream partners, individual projections accomplish distinct functions: hypothalamic and extended amygdalar projections elicit assorted unconditioned threat responses including autonomic arousal, anxiety, and freezing behavior, while thalamic and basal forebrain projections generate freezing behavior and, unexpectedly, contribute to associative fear learning. Moreover, the unconditioned responses generated by individual projections are complementary, with simultaneous activation of multiple sites driving profound freezing behavior and bradycardia that are not elicited by any individual projection. This semi-parallel, scalable connectivity schema likely contributes to flexible control of threat responses in unpredictable environments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57670">Neural signatures of α2-Adrenergic agonist-induced unconsciousness and awakening by antagonist</a></h4>

How the brain dynamics change during anesthetic-induced altered states of consciousness is not completely understood. The α2-adrenergic agonists are unique. They generate unconsciousness selectively through α2-adrenergic receptors and related circuits. We studied intracortical neuronal dynamics during transitions of loss of consciousness (LOC) with the α2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine and return of consciousness (ROC) in a functionally interconnecting somatosensory and ventral premotor network in non-human primates. LOC, ROC and full task performance recovery were all associated with distinct neural changes. The early recovery demonstrated characteristic intermediate dynamics distinguished by sustained high spindle activities. Awakening by the α2-adrenergic antagonist completely eliminated this intermediate state and instantaneously restored awake dynamics and the top task performance while the anesthetic was still being infused. The results suggest that instantaneous functional recovery is possible following anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and the intermediate recovery state is not a necessary path for the brain recovery.

<p>by Ondrej Maxian, Alex Mogilner, Wanda Strychalski</p>

Cell migration through a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) underlies important physiological phenomena and is based on a variety of mechanical strategies depending on the cell type and the properties of the ECM. By using computer simulations of the cell’s mid-plane, we investigate two such migration mechanisms—‘push-pull’ (forming a finger-like protrusion, adhering to an ECM node, and pulling the cell body forward) and ‘rear-squeezing’ (pushing the cell body through the ECM by contracting the cell cortex and ECM at the cell rear). We present a computational model that accounts for both elastic deformation and forces of the ECM, an active cell cortex and nucleus, and for hydrodynamic forces and flow of the extracellular fluid, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm. We find that relations between three mechanical parameters—the cortex’s contractile force, nuclear elasticity, and ECM rigidity—determine the effectiveness of cell migration through the dense ECM. The cell can migrate persistently even if its cortical contraction cannot deform a near-rigid ECM, but then the contraction of the cortex has to be able to sufficiently deform the nucleus. The cell can also migrate even if it fails to deform a stiff nucleus, but then it has to be able to sufficiently deform the ECM. Simulation results show that nuclear stiffness limits the cell migration more than the ECM rigidity. Simulations show the rear-squeezing mechanism of motility results in more robust migration with larger cell displacements than those with the push-pull mechanism over a range of parameter values. Additionally, results show that the rear-squeezing mechanism is aided by hydrodynamics through a pressure gradient.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0LW-rCLTGRs" width="1" />

<p>by Quynh-Anh Nguyen, John Rinzel, Rodica Curtu</p>

A repeating triplet-sequence <i>ABA</i><sub>−</sub> of non-overlapping brief tones, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, is a valued paradigm for studying auditory stream formation and the cocktail party problem. The stimulus is “heard” either as a galloping pattern (integration) or as two interleaved streams (segregation); the initial percept is typically integration then followed by spontaneous alternations between segregation and integration, each being dominant for a few seconds. The probability of segregation grows over seconds, from near-zero to a steady value, defining the buildup function, BUF. Its stationary level increases with the difference in tone frequencies, <i>DF</i>, and the BUF rises faster. Percept durations have <i>DF</i>-dependent means and are gamma-like distributed. Behavioral and computational studies usually characterize triplet streaming either during alternations or during buildup. Here, our experimental design and modeling encompass both. We propose a pseudo-neuromechanistic model that incorporates spiking activity in primary auditory cortex, A1, as input and resolves perception along two network-layers downstream of A1. Our model is straightforward and intuitive. It describes the noisy accumulation of evidence against the current percept which generates switches when reaching a threshold. Accumulation can saturate either above or below threshold; if below, the switching dynamics resemble noise-induced transitions from an attractor state. Our model accounts quantitatively for three key features of data: the BUFs, mean durations, and normalized dominance duration distributions, at various <i>DF</i> values. It describes perceptual alternations without competition per se, and underscores that treating triplets in the sequence independently and averaging across trials, as implemented in earlier widely cited studies, is inadequate.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1vsFHX6bz5M" width="1" />

<p>by Saurav Mallik, Dan S. Tawfik</p>

Oligomeric proteins are central to life. Duplication and divergence of their genes is a key evolutionary driver, also because duplications can yield very different outcomes. Given a homomeric ancestor, duplication can yield two paralogs that form two distinct homomeric complexes, or a heteromeric complex comprising both paralogs. Alternatively, one paralog remains a homomer while the other acquires a new partner. However, so far, conflicting trends have been noted with respect to which fate dominates, primarily because different methods and criteria are being used to assign the interaction status of paralogs. Here, we systematically analyzed all <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> oligomeric complexes that include paralogous proteins. We found that the proportions of homo-hetero duplication fates strongly depend on a variety of factors, yet that nonetheless, rigorous filtering gives a consistent picture. In <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> about 50%, of the paralogous pairs appear to have retained the ancestral homomeric interaction, whereas in <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> only ~10% retained a homomeric state. This difference was also observed when unique complexes were counted instead of paralogous gene pairs. We further show that this difference is accounted for by multiple cases of heteromeric yeast complexes that share common ancestry with homomeric bacterial complexes. Our analysis settles contradicting trends and conflicting previous analyses, and provides a systematic and rigorous pipeline for delineating the fate of duplicated oligomers in any organism for which protein-protein interaction data are available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MC0alpuNUGM" width="1" />

<p>by Carolyn Coyne, Jimmy D. Ballard, Ira J. Blader</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic challenged universities and other academic institutions to rapidly adapt to urgent and life-threatening situations. It forced most institutions to shut down nearly every aspect of their research and educational enterprises. In doing so, university leaders were thrust into unchartered waters and forced them to make unprecedented decisions. Successes and failures along the way highlighted how the autonomous nature of the American academic research enterprise and skillsets normally required of university leaders were ill-suited to mounting an emergency response. Here, as faculty from medical centers in the United States, we draw lessons from these experiences and apply them as we plan for the next possible COVID-19-induced shutdown as well as other large-scale pandemics and emergencies at universities in the United States and throughout the world.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OVez8-R12xM" width="1" />

<p>Anti‐IgLON5 disease is a neurological disorder characterized by autoantibodies against IgLON5 and pathological evidence of neuronal‐specific tau accumulation. Here, we report that patients' IgLON5 IgG, but not other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt the cytoskeletal organization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, resulting in dystrophic neurites and axonal swelling. Adsorption of IgLON5 IgG with HEK293 cells expressing IgLON5 abrogated the indicated cytoskeletal changes. These findings, along with an increase of levels of neurofilaments in patients' cerebrospinal fluid, suggest that IgLON5 IgG, unlike other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupts neuronal cytoskeleton maintenance, providing a link between autoimmunity and neurodegeneration.

<p>γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway striatal neurons are increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of R6/2 mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In Huntington's disease (HD), the output of striatal indirect pathway medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs) is altered in its target region, the external globus pallidus (GPe). In a previous study we demonstrated that selective optogenetic stimulation of indirect pathway MSNs induced prolonged decay time of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in GPe neurons. Here we identified the mechanism underlying this alteration. Electrophysiological recordings in slices from symptomatic R6/2 and wildtype (WT) mice were used to evaluate, primarily, the effects of GABA transporter (GAT) antagonists on responses evoked by optogenetic activation of indirect pathway MSNs. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blots (WBs) were used to examine GAT‐3 expression in HD and WT mice. A GAT‐3 blocker (SNAP5114) increased decay time of GABA responses in WT and HD GPe neurons, but the effect was significantly greater in WT neurons. In contrast, a GAT‐1 antagonist (NO‐711) or a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist (CGP 54626) produced small increases in decay time but no differential effects between genotypes. IHC and WBs showed reduction of GAT‐3 expression in the GPe of HD mice. Thus, reduced expression or dysfunction of GAT‐3 could underlie alterations of GPe responses to GABA inputs from striatum and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase (PI3K) complex have been associated with a broad spectrum of brain and organ overgrowth syndromes. For example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase regulatory subunit 2 (<i>PIK3R2</i>) have been identified in patients with megalencephaly‐polymicrogyria‐polydactyly‐hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which includes brain overgrowth. To better understand the pathogenesis of <i>PIK3R2</i> related mutations, we have developed and characterized a murine model.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated a knock‐in mouse model for the most common human <i>PIK3R2</i> mutation, p.G373R (p.G367R in mice) using CRISPR/Cas9. The mouse phenotypes, including brain size, seizure activity, cortical lamination, cell proliferation/size/density, interneuron migration, and PI3K pathway activation were analyzed using standard methodologies. For patients with <i>PIK3R2</i> mutations, clinical data (OFC and epilepsy) were retrospectively obtained from our clinical records (published/unpublished).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The PI3K‐AKT pathway was hyperactivated in these mice, confirming the p.G367R mutation is an activating mutation <i>in vivo</i>. Similar to patients with <i>PIK3R2</i> mutations, these mice have enlarged brains. We found cell size to be increased but not cell numbers. The embryonic brain showed mild defects in cortical lamination, although not observed in the mature brain. Furthermore, EEG recordings from mutant mice showed background slowing and rare seizures, again similar to our observations in patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We have generated a <i>PIK3R2</i> mouse model that exhibits megalencephaly and EEG changes, both of which overlap with human patients. Our data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease caused by PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. We anticipate this model will be valuable in testing therapeutic options for MPPH patients.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of LRRK2 mutations causal to Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the early 2000s, the LRRK2 protein has been implicated in a plethora of cellular processes in which pathogenesis could occur, yet its physiological function remains elusive. The development of genetic models of LRRK2 PD has helped identify the etiological and pathophysiological underpinnings of the disease, and may identify early points of intervention. An important role for LRRK2 in synaptic function has emerged in recent years, which links LRRK2 to other genetic forms of PD, most notably those caused by mutations in the synaptic protein α-synuclein. This point of convergence may provide useful clues as to what drives dysfunction in the basal ganglia circuitry and eventual death of substantia nigra (SN) neurons. Here, we discuss the evolution and current state of the literature placing LRRK2 at the synapse, through the lens of knock-out, overexpression, and knock-in animal models. We hope that a deeper understanding of LRRK2 neurobiology, at the synapse and beyond, will aid the eventual development of neuroprotective interventions for PD, and the advancement of useful treatments in the interim.</p>

<p>With marketing approval of the first ocular gene therapy, and other gene therapies in clinical trial, treatments for inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) have become a reality. Biallelic mutations in the tubby like protein 1 gene (TULP1) are causative of IRDs in humans; a mouse knock-out model (Tulp1−/−) is characterized by a similar disease phenotype. We developed a Tulp1 supplementation therapy for Tulp1−/− mice. Utilizing subretinal AAV2/5 delivery at postnatal day (p)2–3 and rhodopsin-kinase promoter (GRK1P) we targeted Tulp1 to photoreceptor cells exploring three doses, 2.2E9, 3.7E8, and 1.2E8 vgs. Tulp1 mRNA and TULP1 protein were assessed by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry, and visual function by electroretinography. Our results indicate that TULP1 was expressed in photoreceptors; achieved levels of Tulp1 mRNA and protein were similar to wild type levels at p20. However, the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) did not improve in treated Tulp1−/− mice. There was a small and transient electroretinography benefit in the treated retinas at 4 weeks of age (not observed by 6 weeks) when using 3.7E8 vg dose. Dark-adapted mixed rod and cone a- and b-wave amplitudes were 24.3 ± 13.5 μV and 52.2 ± 31.7 μV in treated Tulp1−/− mice, which were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001, t-test), from those detected in untreated eyes (7.1 ± 7.0 μV and 9.4 ± 15.1 μV, respectively). Our results indicate that Tulp1 supplementation in photoreceptors may not be sufficient to provide robust benefit in Tulp1−/− mice. As such, further studies are required to fine tune the Tulp1 supplementation therapy, which, in principle, should rescue the Tulp1−/− phenotype.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a chronic multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorder is a leading cause of dementia. Recently, neuroinflammation has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to AD pathogenesis. The role of adaptive immune responses against neuronal antigens, which can either confer protection or induce damage in AD, has not been fully characterized. Here, we measured T cell responses to several potential antigens of neural origin including amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, α-synuclein, and transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) in patients with AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Antigen-specific T cell reactivity was detected for all tested antigens, and response to tau-derived epitopes was particularly strong, but no significant differences between individuals with AD and age-matched HC were identified. We also did not observe any correlation between the antigen-specific T cell responses and clinical variables including age, gender, years since diagnosis and cognitive score. Additionally, further characterization did not reveal any differences in the relative frequency of major Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) subsets, or in the expression of genes between AD patients and HC. These observations have not identified a key role of neuronal antigen-specific T cell responses in AD.</p>

<p>A single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to increase arousal in healthy participants for up to 24 h post-stimulation. However, little is known about the effects of tDCS on subsequent sleep in this population. Based on previous clinical studies, we hypothesized that anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) would produce higher arousal with decreased sleep time and stimulation to the primary motor cortex (M1) would have the converse effect. Thirty-six active duty military were randomized into one of three groups (n = 12/group); active anodal tDCS over the lDLPFC, active anodal tDCS over left M1, or sham tDCS. Participants answered questionnaires 3 times a day and wore a wrist activity monitor (WAM) to measure sleep time and efficiency for 3 weeks. On weeks 2 and 3 (order counterbalance), participants received stimulation at 1800 h before 26 h of sustained wakefulness testing (sleep deprived) and at 1800 h without sleep deprivation (non-sleep deprived). There were no significant effects for the non-sleep deprived portion of testing. For the sleep deprived portion of testing, there were main effects of group and night on sleep time. The DLPFC group slept less than the other groups on the second and third night following stimulation. There is no negative effect on mood or sleep quality from a single dose of tDCS when participants have normal sleep patterns (i.e., non-sleep deprived portion of testing). The results suggest that stimulation may result in faster recovery from fatigue caused by acute periods of sleep deprivation, as their recovery sleep periods were less.</p>

<p>Social contact is one of the best methods for reducing stigma, and the effect may be associated with emotional response and social cognition. The amygdala is a key region of these functions and can be divided into three subregions, each of which has a different function and connectivity. We investigated whether the amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity is associated with the effect of anti-stigma interventions on reducing mental health-related stigma in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) over 12 months. Healthy young adults [n = 77, age, mean (SD) = 21.23 (0.94) years; male, n = 48], who were subsampled from an RCT (n = 259) investigating the effect of anti-stigma interventions, using filmed social contacts (FSC) or internet self-learning (INS), on reducing stigma, underwent 10 min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging between the trial registration and 12 months follow-up. The extent of stigma was assessed at the baseline, post-intervention and 12 month follow-up surveys, using the Japanese-language version of the Social Distance Scale (SDSJ), to assess negative emotional attitude toward people with schizophrenia. We compared associations between amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity and changes in the SDSJ scores for 12 months across the control, INS, and FSC groups. Associations between the change in stigma for 12 months and the superficial (SF) subregion of the amygdala-related connectivity in the intracalcarine cortex [(x, y, z) = (−8, −66, 12), z = 4.21, P<sub>FWE–corrected</sub> = 0.0003, cluster size = 192] differed across groups. The post hoc analysis showed that the SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity was negatively correlated with the change in stigma only in the FSC group. The current results indicate that greater SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity is associated with a better response to the FSC interventions, suggesting that biological variability could underlie the long-term effect of anti-stigma interventions on stigma in the real world.</p>

<p>Postural stability is commonly decreased in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis due to multisystemic deficits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method to modulate cortical excitability, inducing neuroplastic changes to the targeted cortical areas and has been suggested to potentially improve motor functions in individuals with neurological impairments. The purpose of this double-blinded, sham-controlled study was to examine the acute effects of anodal tDCS over the lesioned motor cortex leg area with concurrent limits of stability training on postural control in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis. Ten individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis received either anodal or sham tDCS stimulation over the lesioned leg region of the motor cortex while undergoing 20 min of postural training. The type of stimulation to receive during the first session was pseudorandomized, and the two sessions were separated by 14 days. Before and immediately after 20 min of tDCS, the 10 m walk test, the Berg Balance Scale, and dynamic posturography assessments were performed. After a single session of anodal tDCS with concurrent postural training, we observed no changes in clinical measures of balance and walking, assessed using the Berg Balance Scale and 10 m walk test. For dynamic posturography assessments, participants demonstrated improvements in adaptation responses to toes-up and toes-down perturbations, regardless of the type of tDCS received. Additionally, improved performance in the shifting center of gravity was observed during anodal tDCS. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that tDCS can potentially be used as a feasible approach be incorporated into the rehabilitation of chronic post-stroke individuals with issues related to postural control and fear of falling, and that multiple sessions of tDCS stimulation may be needed to improve functional measures of postural control and walking.</p>

<p>This paper explores in parallel the underlying mechanisms in human perception of biological motion and the best approaches for automatic classification of gait. The experiments tested three different learning paradigms, namely, biological, biomimetic, and non-biomimetic models for gender identification from human gait. Psychophysical experiments with twenty-one observers were conducted along with computational experiments without applying any gender specific modifications to the models or the stimuli. Results demonstrate the utilization of a generic memory based learning system in humans for gait perception, thus reducing ambiguity between two opposing learning systems proposed for biological motion perception. Results also support the biomimetic nature of memory based artificial neural networks (ANN) in their ability to emulate biological neural networks, as opposed to non-biomimetic models. In addition, the comparison between biological and computational learning approaches establishes a memory based biomimetic model as the best candidate for a generic artificial gait classifier (83% accuracy, p &lt; 0.001), compared to human observers (66%, p &lt; 0.005) or non-biomimetic models (83%, p &lt; 0.001) while adhering to human-like sensitivity to gender identification, promising potential for application of the model in any given non-gender based gait perception objective with superhuman performance.</p>

A meta-analysis quantified pooled data for measures including motor threshold, motor latency, and motor evoked potential amplitude and for inhibitory measures such as cortical silent period duration, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) ratios.</p><p>Results: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies were arbitrarily classified into the groups, based on time post-concussion, “acute” (subjects 0–3 months post-injury, n = 8) and “post-acute” (3 months−2 years post-concussion, n = 7). A TMS quality of study checklist rated studies from moderate to high in methodological quality; however, the risk of bias analysis found that the included studies were categorised as high risk of bias, particularly for a lack of allocation concealment and blinding of participants in the methodologies. A meta-analysis showed no differences in excitability measures, apart from a decreased motor threshold that was observed in the concussed group (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.51 to −0.04; P = 0.02) for the post-acute time frame. Conversely, all inhibitory measures showed differences between groups. Cortical silent period duration was found to be significantly increased in the acute (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.58–1.81; P &lt; 0.001) and post-acute (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.12–0.98; P = 0.01) time frames. The SICI (SMD −1.15, 95% CI −1.95 to −0.34; P = 0.005) and LICI (SMD −1.95, 95% CI −3.04 to −0.85; P = 0.005) ratios were reduced, inferring increased inhibition, for the post-acute time frame.</p><p>Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that inhibitory pathways are affected in the acute period post-concussion. However, persistent alterations in cortical excitability remain, with increased intracortical inhibition. While TMS should be considered as a reliable technique to measure the functional integrity of the central nervous system, the high risk of bias and heterogeneity in data suggest that future studies should aim to incorporate standardised methodological techniques, particularly with threshold determination and stimulus intervals for paired-pulse measures.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00274">The Inflamed Brain in Schizophrenia: The Convergence of Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors That Lead to Uncontrolled Neuroinflammation</a></h4>

<p>Schizophrenia is a disorder with a heterogeneous etiology involving complex interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. The immune system is now known to play vital roles in nervous system function and pathology through regulating neuronal and glial development, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. In this regard, the immune system is positioned as a common link between the seemingly diverse genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. Synthesizing information about how the immune-brain axis is affected by multiple factors and how these factors might interact in schizophrenia is necessary to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Such knowledge will aid in the development of more translatable animal models that may lead to effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we provide an overview of the genetic risk factors for schizophrenia that modulate immune function. We also explore environmental factors for schizophrenia including exposure to pollution, gut dysbiosis, maternal immune activation and early-life stress, and how the consequences of these risk factors are linked to microglial function and dysfunction. We also propose that morphological and signaling deficits of the blood-brain barrier, as observed in some individuals with schizophrenia, can act as a gateway between peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, thus affecting microglia in their essential functions. Finally, we describe the diverse roles that microglia play in response to neuroinflammation and their impact on brain development and homeostasis, as well as schizophrenia pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Many neural mechanisms regulate experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex (V1), and new techniques for quantifying large numbers of proteins or genes are transforming how plasticity is studied into the era of big data. With those large data sets comes the challenge of extracting biologically meaningful results about visual plasticity from data-driven analytical methods designed for high-dimensional data. In other areas of neuroscience, high-information content methodologies are revealing more subtle aspects of neural development and individual variations that give rise to a richer picture of brain disorders. We have developed an approach for studying V1 plasticity that takes advantage of the known functions of many synaptic proteins for regulating visual plasticity. We use that knowledge to rebrand protein measurements into plasticity features and combine those into a plasticity phenotype. Here, we provide a primer for analyzing experience-dependent plasticity in V1 using example R code to identify high-dimensional changes in a group of proteins. We describe using PCA to classify high-dimensional plasticity features and use them to construct a plasticity phenotype. In the examples, we show how to use this analytical framework to study and compare experience-dependent development and plasticity of V1 and apply the plasticity phenotype to translational research questions. We include an R package “PlasticityPhenotypes” that aggregates the coding packages and custom code written in RStudio to construct and analyze plasticity phenotypes.</p>

<p>Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is a combination of cellular processes that govern protein quality control, namely, protein translation, folding, processing, and degradation. Disruptions in these processes can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. Proteostatic disruption can lead to cellular changes such as endoplasmic reticulum or oxidative stress; organelle dysfunction; and, if continued, to cell death. A majority of neurodegenerative diseases involve the pathologic aggregation of proteins that subverts normal neuronal function. While prior reviews of neuronal proteostasis in neurodegenerative processes have focused on cytoplasmic chaperones, there is increasing evidence that chaperones secreted both by neurons and other brain cells in the extracellular – including transsynaptic – space play important roles in neuronal proteostasis. In this review, we will introduce various secreted chaperones involved in neurodegeneration. We begin with clusterin and discuss its identification in various protein aggregates, and the use of increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin as a potential biomarker and as a potential therapeutic. Our next secreted chaperone is progranulin; polymorphisms in this gene represent a known genetic risk factor for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and progranulin overexpression has been found to be effective in reducing Alzheimer’s- and Parkinson’s-like neurodegenerative phenotypes in mouse models. We move on to BRICHOS domain-containing proteins, a family of proteins containing highly potent anti-amyloidogenic activity; we summarize studies describing the biochemical mechanisms by which recombinant BRICHOS protein might serve as a therapeutic agent. The next section of the review is devoted to the secreted chaperones 7B2 and proSAAS, small neuronal proteins which are packaged together with neuropeptides and released during synaptic activity. Since proteins can be secreted by both classical secretory and non-classical mechanisms, we also review the small heat shock proteins (sHsps) that can be secreted from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment and provide evidence for their involvement in extracellular proteostasis and neuroprotection. Our goal in this review focusing on extracellular chaperones in neurodegenerative disease is to summarize the most recent literature relating to neurodegeneration for each secreted chaperone; to identify any common mechanisms; and to point out areas of similarity as well as differences between the secreted chaperones identified to date.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically defined by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides generated by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), strings of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins accumulating inside neurons known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal loss. The association between the two hallmarks and cognitive decline has been known since the beginning of the 20th century when the first description of the disease was carried out by Alois Alzheimer. Today, more than 40 million people worldwide are affected by AD that represents the most common cause of dementia and there is still no effective treatment available to cure the disease. In general, the aggregation of Aβ is considered an essential trigger in AD pathogenesis that gives rise to NFTs, neuronal dysfunction and dementia. During the process leading to AD, tau and Aβ first misfold and form aggregates in one brain region, from where they spread to interconnected areas of the brain thereby inducing its gradual morphological and functional deterioration. In this mini-review article, we present an overview of the current literature on the spreading mechanisms of Aβ and tau pathology in AD since a more profound understanding is necessary to design therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or halting disease progression.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59222">Orderly assembly underpinning built-in asymmetry in the yeast centrosome duplication cycle requires cyclin-dependent kinase</a></h4>

Asymmetric astral microtubule organization drives the polarized orientation of the <i>S. cerevisiae </i>mitotic spindle and primes the invariant inheritance of the old spindle pole body (SPB, the yeast centrosome) by the bud. This model has anticipated analogous centrosome asymmetries featured in self-renewing stem cell divisions. We previously implicated Spc72, the cytoplasmic receptor for the gamma-tubulin nucleation complex, as the most upstream determinant linking SPB age, functional asymmetry and fate. Here we used structured illumination microscopy and biochemical analysis to explore the asymmetric landscape of nucleation sites inherently built into the spindle pathway and under the control of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). We show that CDK enforces Spc72 asymmetric docking by phosphorylating Nud1/centriolin. Furthermore, CDK-imposed order in the construction of the new SPB promotes the correct balance of nucleation sites between the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces of the SPB. Together these contributions by CDK inherently link correct SPB morphogenesis, age and fate.

Human brain development is influenced by early-life experiences, particularly during sensitive periods, with impact on cognitive and emotional outcomes. Understanding how the timing and nature of such experiences (including adversity, trauma, and enrichment) govern their influence on brain organization is crucial for harnessing key environmental factors early in life to enhance brain development. Here we synthesize findings from human and animal studies focusing on sensitive periods and their regional and circuit specificity and highlight the challenge and power of such cross-species approaches in informing the ‘next steps’ to optimize cognitive and emotional health in developing children.

<p>by John R. Casey, Michael J. Follows</p>

Microbes acclimate to changes in substrate availability by altering the number of transporters on the cell surface, however there is some disagreement on just how. We revisit the physics of substrate uptake and consider the steady-state scenario whereby cells have acclimated to maximize fitness. Flux balance analysis of a stoichiometric model of <i>Escherichia coli</i> was used in conjunction with quantitative proteomics data and molecular modeling of membrane transporters to reconcile these opposing views. An emergent feature of the proposed model is a critical substrate concentration <i>S</i>*, which delineates two rate limits. At concentrations above <i>S</i>*, transporter abundance can be regulated to maintain uptake rates as demanded by maximal growth rates, whereas below <i>S</i>*, uptake rates are strictly diffusion limited. In certain scenarios, the proposed model can take on a qualitatively different shape from the familiar hyperbolic kinetics curves, instead resembling the long-forgotten Blackman kinetics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bm1t2IRj0pU" width="1" />

<p>by Florian Destoky, Julie Bertels, Maxime Niesen, Vincent Wens, Marc Vander Ghinst, Jacqueline Leybaert, Marie Lallier, Robin A. A. Ince, Joachim Gross, Xavier De Tiège, Mathieu Bourguignon</p>

Humans’ propensity to acquire literacy relates to several factors, including the ability to understand speech in noise (SiN). Still, the nature of the relation between reading and SiN perception abilities remains poorly understood. Here, we dissect the interplay between (1) reading abilities, (2) classical behavioral predictors of reading (phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming), and (3) electrophysiological markers of SiN perception in 99 elementary school children (26 with dyslexia). We demonstrate that, in typical readers, cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN relates to the degree of development of the lexical (but not sublexical) reading strategy. In contrast, classical behavioral predictors of reading abilities and the ability to benefit from visual speech to represent the syllabic content of SiN account for global reading performance (i.e., speed and accuracy of lexical and sublexical reading). In individuals with dyslexia, we found preserved integration of visual speech information to optimize processing of syntactic information but not to sustain acoustic/phonemic processing. Finally, within children with dyslexia, measures of cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN were negatively related to reading speed and positively related to the compromise between reading precision and reading speed, potentially owing to compensatory attentional mechanisms. These results clarify the nature of the relation between SiN perception and reading abilities in typical child readers and children with dyslexia and identify novel electrophysiological markers of emergent literacy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GrlGEmn0lpk" width="1" />

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by chronic neuronal and/or glial cell loss, while traumatic injury is often accompanied by the acute loss of both. Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain spontaneously proliferate, forming neuronal and glial progenitors that migrate toward lesion sites upon injury. However, they fail to replace neurons and glial cells due to molecular inhibition and the lack of pro-regenerative cues. A major challenge in regenerative biology therefore is to unveil signaling pathways that could override molecular brakes and boost endogenous repair. In physiological conditions, thyroid hormone (TH) acts on NSC commitment in the subventricular zone, and the subgranular zone, the two largest NSC niches in mammals, including humans. Here, we discuss whether TH could have beneficial actions in various pathological contexts too, by evaluating recent data obtained in mammalian models of multiple sclerosis (MS; loss of oligodendroglial cells), Alzheimer’s disease (loss of neuronal cells), stroke and spinal cord injury (neuroglial cell loss). So far, TH has shown promising effects as a stimulator of remyelination in MS models, while its role in NSC-mediated repair in other diseases remains elusive. Disentangling the spatiotemporal aspects of the injury-driven repair response as well as the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which TH acts, could unveil new ways to further exploit its pro-regenerative potential, while TH (ant)agonists with cell type-specific action could provide safer and more target-directed approaches that translate easier to clinical settings.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a key role in multiple sclerosis (MS), but clinical data on oxidative stress markers in MS patients were inconsistent. This study sought to quantitatively summarize the data of oxidative stress markers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS in the literature. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science and included studies if they provided data on the concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the peripheral blood and CSF of MS patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. The systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 31 studies with 2,001 MS patients and 2,212 HC subjects for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with MS had significantly increased concentrations of blood oxidative stress markers compared with HC subjects for malondialdehyde (MDA; Hedges' g, 2.252; 95% CI, 1.080 to 3.424; p &lt; 0.001) and lipid hydroperoxide by tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence (CL-LOOH; Hedges' g, 0.383; 95% CI, 0.065 to 0.702; p = 0.018). In contrast, concentrations of albumin (Hedges' g, −1.036; CI, −1.679 to −0.394; p = 0.002) were significantly decreased in MS patients when compared with those in HC subjects. However, the other analyzed blood oxidative stress markers did not show significant differences between cases and controls. Furthermore, this meta-analysis showed significant association between CSF MDA and MS (Hedges' g, 3.275; 95% CI, 0.859 to 5.691; p = 0.008). Taken together, our results revealed increased blood and CSF MDA and decreased blood albumin levels in patients with MS, strengthening the clinical evidence of increased oxidative stress in MS.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging studies suggest disrupted connections of the brain white matter (WM) network in bipolar disorder (BD). A group of highly interconnected high-density structures, termed the ‘rich club,’ represents an important network for brain functioning. Recent works have revealed abnormal rich club organization in brain networks in BD. However, little is known regarding changes in the rich club organization of the hemispheric WM network in BD. Forty-nine BD patients and fifty-five age- and sex-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Graph theory approaches were applied to quantify group-specific rich club organization and nodal degree of hemispheric WM networks. We demonstrated that rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks in BD was disrupted, with disrupted feeder and local connections among hub and peripheral regions located in the default mode network (DMN) and the control execution network (CEN). In addition, BD patients showed abnormal asymmetry in the feeder and local connections, involving the hub and peripheral regions associated with emotion regulation and visuospatial functions. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of BD showed a significant correlation with the aberrant asymmetry in the regional degree of peripheral regions. These findings reveal that BD is closely associated with disrupted feeder and local connections but no alteration in rich-club connections in the rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks and provide novel insight into the changes of brain functions in BD.</p>

<p>Reflex responses generated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors of the plantar foot are important for the maintenance of balance during postural tasks and gait. With aging, reflex generation, particularly from fast adapting type I receptors, is reduced, which likely contributes to impaired postural stability in this population. Therefore, improving reflex generation from these receptors may serve as a tool to improve balance performance. A mechanism to enhance reflexes may lie in the phenomenon of stochastic resonance, whereby the addition of certain intensities and frequencies of noise stimuli improves the performance of a system. This study was conducted to determine whether tactile noise stimuli could improve cutaneous reflex generation. In 12 healthy young adults, we evoked cutaneous reflex responses using a 0–50 Hz Gaussian noise vibration applied to the plantar heel. Concurrently, we applied one of six subthreshold intensities of electrical tactile noise to the plantar heel [0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% (threshold)] and were able to analyze data from 0%, 20% and 40% trials. Across participants, it was found that the addition of a 20% perceptual threshold (PT) noise resulted in enhanced reflex responses when analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. These data provide evidence that cutaneous reflex generation can be enhanced via a stochastic resonance effect and that 20% PT is the optimal intensity of noise to do so. Therefore, the addition of noise stimuli may be a valuable clinical intervention to improve reflex responses associated with postural balance in populations with impairments.</p>

<p>The human species possesses two complementary, yet distinct, universal communication systems—language and music. Functional imaging studies have revealed that some core elements of these two systems are processed in closely related brain regions, but there are also clear differences in brain circuitry that likely underlie differences in functionality. Music affects many aspects of human behavior, especially in encouraging prosocial interactions and promoting trust and cooperation within groups of culturally compatible but not necessarily genetically related individuals. Music, presumably via its impact on the limbic system, is also rewarding and motivating, and music can facilitate aspects of learning and memory. In this review these special characteristics of music are considered in light of recent research on the neuroscience of the peptide oxytocin, a hormone that has both peripheral and central actions, that plays a role in many complex human behaviors, and whose expression has recently been reported to be affected by music-related activities. I will first briefly discuss what is currently known about the peptide’s physiological actions on neurons and its interactions with other neuromodulator systems, then summarize recent advances in our knowledge of the distribution of oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) in the human brain. Next, the complex links between oxytocin and various social behaviors in humans are considered. First, how endogenous oxytocin levels relate to individual personality traits, and then how exogenous, intranasal application of oxytocin affects behaviors such as trust, empathy, reciprocity, group conformity, anxiety, and overall social decision making under different environmental conditions. It is argued that many of these characteristics of oxytocin biology closely mirror the diverse effects that music has on human cognition and emotion, providing a link to the important role music has played throughout human evolutionary history and helping to explain why music remains a special prosocial human asset. Finally, it is suggested that there is a potential synergy in combining oxytocin- and music-based strategies to improve general health and aid in the treatment of various neurological dysfunctions.</p>

<p>High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a promising biomarker of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). But accurate delineation of EZ based on HFOs is still challenging. Our study compared HFOs from EZ and non-EZ on the basis of their associations with interictal slow waves, aiming at exploring a new way to localize EZ. Nineteen medically intractable epilepsy patients with good surgical outcome were included. Five minute interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) epochs of slow-wave sleep were randomly selected; then ripples (80–200 Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 200–500 Hz), and slow waves (0.1–4 Hz) were automatically analyzed. The EZ and non-EZ were identified by resection range during the surgeries. We found that both ripples and FRs superimposed more frequently on slow waves in EZ than in non-EZ (P &lt; 0.01). Although ripples preferred to occur on the down state of slow waves in both two groups, ripples in EZ tended to be closer to the down-state peak of slow wave than in non-EZ (-174 vs. -231 ms, P = 0.008). As for FR, no statistical difference was found between the two groups (P = 0.430). Additionally, slow wave-containing ripples in EZ had a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.5 μV/ms, P &lt; 0.001) and wider distribution ratio (32.3 vs. 30.1%, P &lt; 0.001) than those in the non-EZ. But for slow wave-containing FR, only a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.4 μV/ms, P &lt; 0.001) was observed. Our study innovatively compared the different features of association between HFOs and slow wave in EZ and non-EZ from refractory focal epilepsy with good surgical outcome, proposing a new method to localize EZ and facilitating the surgical plan.</p>

<p>The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains – including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry – are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.</p>

<p>Kainate receptors (KAR) play a crucial role in the plasticity and functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses. However, how they regulate structural plasticity of dendritic spines is not known. The GluK2 subunit was recently shown to coexist in a functional complex with the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2. Apart from having a crucial role in the maturation of GABAergic transmission, KCC2 has a morphogenic role in the maturation of dendritic spines. Here, we show that in vivo local inactivation of GluK2 expression in CA3 hippocampal neurons induces altered morphology of dendritic spines and reduction in mEPSC frequency. GluK2 deficiency also resulted in a strong change in the subcellular distribution of KCC2 as well as a smaller somatodendritic gradient in the reversal potential of GABA<sub>A</sub>. Strikingly, the aberrant morphology of dendritic spines in GluK2-deficient CA3 pyramidal neurons was restored by overexpression of KCC2. GluK2 silencing in hippocampal neurons significantly reduced the expression of 4.1N and functional form of the actin filament severing protein cofilin. Consistently, assessment of actin dynamics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of β-actin showed a significant increase in the stability of F-actin filaments in dendritic spines. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that GluK2-KCC2 interaction plays an important role in the structural maturation of dendritic spines. This also provides novel insights into the connection between KAR dysfunction, structural plasticity, and developmental disorders.</p>

<p>Healthy human aging has been associated with brain atrophy in prefrontal and selective temporal regions, but reductions in other brain areas have been observed. We previously found regional covariance patterns of gray matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy humans and rhesus macaques, using multivariate network Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), supporting aging effects including in prefrontal and temporal cortices. This approach has yet to be applied to neuroimaging in rodent models of aging. We investigated 7.0T MRI gray matter covariance in 10 young and 10 aged adult male Fischer 344 rats to identify, using SSM VBM, the age-related regional network gray matter covariance pattern in the rodent. SSM VBM identified a regional pattern that distinguished young from aged rats, characterized by reductions in prefrontal, temporal association/perirhinal, and cerebellar areas with relative increases in somatosensory, thalamic, midbrain, and hippocampal regions. Greater expression of the age-related MRI gray matter pattern was associated with poorer spatial learning in the age groups combined. Aging in the rat is characterized by a regional network pattern of gray matter reductions corresponding to aging effects previously observed in humans and non-human primates. SSM MRI network analyses can advance translational aging neuroscience research, extending from human to small animal models, with potential for evaluating mechanisms and interventions for cognitive aging.</p>

Objective<p>This study aimed to evaluate the value of odors in the olfactory identification (OI) test and other known risk factors for predicting incident dementia in the prospective Shanghai Aging Study.</p>Methods<p>At baseline, OI was assessed using the Sniffin’ Sticks Screening Test 12, which contains 12 different odors. Cognition assessment and consensus diagnosis were conducted at both baseline and follow-up to identify incident dementia. Four different multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were used for predicting incident dementia. In the no-odor model, only demographics, lifestyle, and medical history variables were included. In the single-odor model, we further added one single odor to the first model. In the full model, all 12 odors were included. In the stepwise model, the variables were selected using a bidirectional stepwise selection method. The predictive abilities of these models were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The permutation importance method was used to evaluate the relative importance of different odors and other known risk factors.</p>Results<p>Seventy-five (8%) incident dementia cases were diagnosed during 4.9 years of follow-up among 947 participants. The full and the stepwise MLR model (AUC = 0.916 and 0.914, respectively) have better predictive abilities compared with those of the no- or single-odor models. The five most important variables are Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, age, peppermint detection, coronary artery disease, and height in the full model, and MMSE, age, peppermint detection, stroke, and education in the stepwise model. The combination of only the top five variables in the stepwise model (AUC = 0.901 and sensitivity = 0.880) has as a good a predictive ability as other models.</p>Conclusion<p>The ability to smell peppermint might be one of the useful indicators for predicting dementia. Combining peppermint detection with MMSE, age, education, and history of stroke may have sensitive and robust predictive value for dementia in older adults.</p>

<p>Recent small subcortical infarcts (RSSIs) can occur in different brain regions. Distinct etiologies might be involved for RSSIs in different locations and could further affect RSSI cavitation and functional outcomes. In this study, we aim to analyze the baseline clinical and imaging characteristics associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We retrospectively include patients who presented with RSSIs from a database for cerebral small vessel disease. Detailed information, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data, were collected. We identify baseline RSSIs on diffusion-weighted images and divide them into brainstem, subcortical white matter, and basal ganglia region groups. Cavitation is evaluated on follow-up T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Statistical analysis is performed to determine factors associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We find that patients with brainstem RSSIs have a higher proportion of diabetes (64.1%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (27.3%, P &lt; 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (35.2%, P = 0.006) and have higher levels of HbA1c (7.20%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (6.10%, P = 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (6.20%, P = 0.003). In addition, patients with brainstem RSSIs have higher NIHSS scores than patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs (2 vs 0, P = 0.001). Patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs have higher a white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden compared to patients with basal ganglia region RSSIs (21.64 cm<sup>3</sup> vs 11.10 cm<sup>3</sup>, P = 0.004). Follow-up analysis demonstrates that basal ganglia region RSSIs are less likely to cavitate than subcortical white matter RSSIs (61.4% vs 83.6%, P = 0.010), and contacting with WMH is associated with the cavitation of subcortical white matter RSSIs (OR: 101.760, P = 0.003). Our study demonstrates that RSSIs in different locations are associated with different clinical and imaging characteristics. Furthermore, cavitation of RSSIs might be affected by local lesion features and the surrounding environment rather than general demographic and clinical factors.</p>

<p>Background: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a significant association between microglia-driven inflammation in the brain and neurodegenerative dementia. We previously showed a significant decline in CISD2 expression in mice models with advanced age. Moreover, we observed that the knockdown of CISD2 led to remarkable inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells. In the present study, we investigated whether CISD2 attenuation influences anti-inflammatory effects and M1-M2 polarization in microglia.</p><p>Materials and Methods: The knockdown of CISD2 expression by siRNA (siCISD2) in EOC microglial cells was performed to mimic the age-driven decline of CISD2 expression. The extent of the inflammatory reaction, polarization in the M1/M2 spectrum, and NFκB activation were verified in EOC microglial cells exhibiting CISD2 deficiency.</p><p>Results: In the cellular model of microglia, loss of CISD2 function mediated by siCISD2 exhibited a significant augmentation of proinflammatory signaling, as well as reduced expression levels of Arg-1, Ym1, IL-10, and BCL2. Attenuation of CISD2 expression led to a decrease in the proportion of the M2 phenotype of microglia (compared to M1). Enhanced DNA-binding activity of the NFκB p65 subunit was confirmed in cells transfected with siCISD2, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p><p>Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report examining the following phenomena: (1) anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia via NFκB regulation; and (2) microglial CISD2 assistance in the restoration of M2 microglia phenotype. The anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia eventually augment anti-apoptotic effects, which provides a rationale for the development of potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and neurodegenerative dementia.</p>

<p>This review aimed to systematically summarize the possible neural correlates of cognitive reserve thus giving an insight into prospective biomarkers for the concept. A total of 44 studies were analyzed following PRISMA guidelines and four studies were included in the further analysis. The results indicated a relationship between P3b waveform and cognitive reserve, while more ambiguous outcomes were found when conducting resting-state EEG. This review indicates the first steps into assessing CR using physiological measures; however, more research is needed for deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms.</p>

How does our visual brain generate perceptual color space? Liu et al. find that within a uniform blob-like architecture of hue responses, chromotopic maps develop progressively in scale and precision along the visual hierarchy of macaque V1, V2, and V4. Such hierarchical refinement improves spectral uniformity, better reflecting color perception.

The effect of mutations in individual mammalian tRNA genes is unknown.

<p>by Thiago S. Guzella, Vasco M. Barreto, Jorge Carneiro</p>

Phenotypic variation in the copy number of gene products expressed by cells or tissues has been the focus of intense investigation. To what extent the observed differences in cellular expression levels are persistent or transient is an intriguing question. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that resolves the expression variation into stable and unstable components. The difference between the expression means in two cohorts isolated from any cell population is shown to converge to an asymptotic value, with a characteristic time, <i>τ</i><sub>T</sub>, that measures the timescale of the unstable dynamics. The asymptotic difference in the means, relative to the initial value, measures the stable proportion of the original population variance R α 2. Empowered by this insight, we analysed the T-cell receptor (TCR) expression variation in CD4 T cells. About 70% of TCR expression variance is stable in a diverse polyclonal population, while over 80% of the variance in an isogenic TCR transgenic population is volatile. In both populations the TCR levels fluctuate with a characteristic time of 32 hours. This systematic characterisation of the expression variation dynamics, relying on time series of cohorts’ means, can be combined with technologies that measure gene or protein expression in single cells or in bulk.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BAblQzdt3Fo" width="1" />

<p>by Claudia Bachmann, Tom Tetzlaff, Renato Duarte, Abigail Morrison</p>

The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is clearly correlated to synapse loss. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in sparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons alters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the activity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory neurons reduces the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations. This decrease in sensitivity can be considered as an indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the network’s dynamical characteristics and sensitivity can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here implemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses. Mean-field analysis reveals that the stability of the linearised network dynamics is, in good approximation, uniquely determined by the firing rate, and thereby explains why firing rate homeostasis preserves not only the firing rate but also the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jQqBQvPlo5c" width="1" />

Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance of the vaginal microbiome, are more likely to be colonized by potential pathogens such as <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, a bacterium linked with intrauterine infection and preterm birth. However, the conditions and mechanisms supporting pathogen colonization during vaginal dysbiosis remain obscure. We demonstrate that sialidase activity, a diagnostic feature of BV, promoted <i>F</i>. <i>nucleatum</i> foraging and growth on mammalian sialoglycans, a nutrient resource that was otherwise inaccessible because of the lack of endogenous <i>F</i>. <i>nucleatum</i> sialidase. In mice with sialidase-producing vaginal microbiotas, mutant <i>F</i>. <i>nucleatum</i> unable to consume sialic acids was impaired in vaginal colonization. These experiments in mice also led to the discovery that <i>F</i>. <i>nucleatum</i> may also “give back” to the community by reinforcing sialidase activity, a biochemical feature of human dysbiosis. Using human vaginal bacterial communities, we show that <i>F</i>. <i>nucleatum</i> supported robust outgrowth of <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i>, a major sialidase producer and one of the most abundant organisms in BV. These results illustrate that mutually beneficial relationships between vaginal bacteria support pathogen colonization and may help maintain features of dysbiosis. These findings challenge the simplistic dogma that the mere absence of “healthy” lactobacilli is the sole mechanism that creates a permissive environment for pathogens during vaginal dysbiosis. Given the ubiquity of <i>F</i>. <i>nucleatum</i> in the human mouth, these studies also suggest a possible mechanism underlying links between vaginal dysbiosis and oral sex.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7TBR4CibSDA" width="1" />

<p>We investigated potential neuroprotective effects of dietary omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on white matter damage following closed‐head injury in mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Previous studies suggest that long‐term supplementation and dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have neuroprotective effects following brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate potential neuroprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs on white matter following closed‐head trauma. The closed‐head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) produces a reproducible injury in the optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus in mice. Damage is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy (FA), with sensitivity comparable to histology. We acquired <i>in vivo</i> (<i>n</i> = 38) and <i>ex vivo</i> (<i>n</i> = 41) DTI data in mice divided into sham and CHIMERA groups with two dietary groups: one deficient in omega‐3 PUFAs and one adequate in omega‐3 PUFAs. We examined injury effects (reduction in FA) and neuroprotection (FA reduction modulated by diet) in the optic tract and brachium. We verified that diet did not affect FA in sham animals. In injured animals, we found significantly reduced FA in the optic tract and brachium (~10% reduction, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, Bayes factor analysis showed substantial evidence to accept the null hypothesis of no diet‐related FA differences in injured animals in the <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> samples. Our results indicate no neuroprotective effect from adequate dietary omega‐3 PUFA intake on white matter damage following traumatic brain injury. Since damage from CHIMERA mainly affects white matter, our results do not necessarily contradict previous findings showing omega‐3 PUFA‐mediated neuroprotection in gray matter.</p>

<p>Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of non‐neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.</p>

<p>Long‐term exposure to lipid‐lowering drugs might affect Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD. Statin exposure was not predicted to increase PD risk, although results were not precise enough to support benefits for prevention clearly (odds ratio: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.65, 1.07). Other target results were null, except for variants indicating Apolipoprotein‐A5 or Apolipoprotein‐C3 inhibition might confer protection. These findings suggest peripheral lipid variation may not have a prominent role in PD etiology, but some related drug targets could influence PD via alternate pathways.</p>

<p>Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a tripartite neuroanatomical organization and revealed similar innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e. the podia and the spines).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of members of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i>, the asteroid <i>Patiria miniata</i>, and the holothuroid <i>Parastichopus parvimensis</i>. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species. Our results sustain the hypotheses of previous work for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally, and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis of more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate <i>Leucoraja erinacea.</i> We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor:ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal’s anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.</p>

<p>A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a scarcely encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.


</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The natural endocast MGPT‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between <i>c.</i> 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient of MGPT‐PU 13873 is <i>c.</i> 1.81, therefore this specimen shows an encephalization quotient in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.</p>

<p>Many of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) molecules play pivotal roles in cell communication. The Sidekick (Sdk) gene, first described in Drosophila, encodes the single-pass transmembrane protein, Sdk, which is one of the largest among IgSF membrane proteins. Sdk first appeared in multicellular animals during the Precambrian age and later evolved to Sdk1 and Sdk2 in vertebrates by gene duplication. In flies, a single Sdk is involved in positioning photoreceptor neurons and their axons in the visual system and is responsible for dynamically rearranging cell shapes by strictly populating tricellular adherens junctions in epithelia. In vertebrates, Sdk1 and Sdk2 are expressed by unique sets of cell types and distinctively participate in the formation and/or maintenance of neural circuits in the retina, indicating that they are determinants of synaptic specificity. These functions are mediated by specific homophilic binding of their ectodomains and by intracellular association with PDZ scaffold proteins. Recent human genetic studies as well as animal experiments implicate that Sdk genes may influence various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and depression. The gigantic Sdk1 gene is susceptible to erratic gene rearrangements or mutations in both somatic and germ-line cells, potentially contributing to neurological disorders and some types of cancers. This review summarizes what is known about the structure and roles of Sdks.</p>

<p>Blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO) with pulsed Focused Ultrasound (pFUS) and microbubbles (MB) has received increasing interest as a method for neurotherapeutics of the central nervous system. In general, conventional MRI [i.e., T2w, T2<sup>∗</sup>w, gadolinium (Gd) enhanced T1w] is used to monitor the effects of pFUS+MB on BBBO and/or assess whether sonication results in parenchymal damage. This study employed multimodal MRI techniques and <sup>18</sup>F-Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate the effects of single and multiple weekly pFUS+MB sessions on morphology and glucose utilization levels in the rat cortex and hippocampus. pFUS was performed with 0.548 MHz transducer with a slow infusion over 1 min of Optison<sup>TM</sup> (5–8 × 10<sup>7</sup> MB) in nine focal points in cortex and four in hippocampus. During pFUS+MB treatment, Gd-T1w was performed at 3 T to confirm BBBO, along with subsequent T2w, T2<sup>∗</sup>w, DTI and glucose CEST (glucoCEST)-weighted imaging by high field 9.4 T and compared with FDG-PET and immunohistochemistry. Animals receiving a single pFUS+MB exhibited minimal hypointense voxels on T2<sup>∗</sup>w. Brains receiving multiple pFUS+MB treatments demonstrated persistent T2w and T2<sup>∗</sup> abnormalities associated with changes in DTI and glucoCEST when compared to contralateral parenchyma. Decreased glucoCEST contrast was substantiated by FDG-PET in cortex following multiple sonications. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly dilated vessels and decreased neuronal glucose transporter (GLUT3) expression in sonicated cortex and hippocampus without changes in neuronal counts. These results suggest the importance to standardize MRI protocols in concert with advanced imaging techniques when evaluating long term effects of pFUS+MB BBBO in clinical trials for neurological diseases.</p>

<p>Olfaction is in addition to touch the most ancient of our senses, developing already in the womb it decays progressively from 65 years of age with a more pronounced impairment associated with dementia. Despite its clinical relevance and testing accessibility, smell remains an overlooked biomarker, which is rarely used by neurologists in the early screening phase. In this perspective article, we outline the reasons underlying the lack of awareness for this sense. In an attempt to put olfaction forward as an early biomarker for pathological brain aging, we draw a comparison with vision and hearing, regarded as more relevant for general health. This perspective article wants to encourage further studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms responsible for the early smell dysfunction in individuals a decade or more before the onset of cognitive symptoms.</p>

<p>Neurodynamic Utility Toolbox for Magnetoencephalo- and Electroencephalography (NUTMEG) is an open-source MATLAB-based toolbox for the analysis and reconstruction of magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography data in source space. NUTMEG includes a variety of options for the user in data import, preprocessing, source reconstruction, and functional connectivity. A group analysis toolbox allows the user to run a variety of inferential statistics on their data in an easy-to-use GUI-driven format. Importantly, NUTMEG features an interactive five-dimensional data visualization platform. A key feature of NUTMEG is the availability of a large menu of interference cancelation and source reconstruction algorithms. Each NUTMEG operation acts as a stand-alone MATLAB function, allowing the package to be easily adaptable and scripted for the more advanced user for interoperability with other software toolboxes. Therefore, NUTMEG enables a wide range of users access to a complete “sensor-to- source-statistics” analysis pipeline.</p>

<p>Respect is a positive other-oriented social emotion upon the recognition of excellence in others. We previously reported that respect-related brain activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Since brain activity and structure are often involved in common cognitive functions, we investigated the morphological properties of the left ATL using voxel-based morphometry analysis. We found an association of trait respect with reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in part of the left ATL. Moreover, since the ATL is involved in general conceptual knowledge, we investigated the relationships between other social emotions with similar properties as respect and the GMV of the left ATL. We observed an association of reduced GMV with empathic concern, which is an other-oriented and affective aspect of trait empathy. Our findings indicated an association of the left ATL with other-oriented and affective aspect of social emotions.</p>

Objectives<p>Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) have been hypothesized to emerge in the context of neural networks instability. To explore this hypothesis in children, we applied a graph theory approach to examine connectivity in neural networks in the resting-state EEG in 35 children with PNES, 31 children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES), and 75 healthy controls.</p>Methods<p>The networks were extracted from Laplacian-transformed time series by a coherence connectivity estimation method.</p>Results<p>Children with PNES (vs. controls) showed widespread changes in network metrics: increased global efficiency (gamma and beta bands), increased local efficiency (gamma band), and increased modularity (gamma and alpha bands). Compared to controls, they also had higher levels of autonomic arousal (e.g., lower heart variability); more anxiety, depression, and stress on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales; and more adverse childhood experiences on the Early Life Stress Questionnaire. Increases in network metrics correlated with arousal. Children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES) showed scattered and less pronounced changes in network metrics.</p>Conclusion<p>The results indicate that children with PNES present with increased activation of neural networks coupled with increased physiological arousal. While this shift in functional organization may confer a short-term adaptive advantage—one that facilitates neural communication and the child’s capacity to respond self-protectively in the face of stressful life events—it may also have a significant biological cost. It may predispose the child’s neural networks to periods of instability—presenting clinically as PNES—when the neural networks are faced with perturbations in energy flow or with additional demands.</p>

<p>Musicians display individual differences in their spontaneous performance rates (tempo) for simple melodies, but the factors responsible are unknown. Previous research suggests that musical tempo modulates listeners’ cardiovascular activity. We report an investigation of musicians’ melody performances measured over a 12-h day and subsequent changes in the musicians’ physiological activity. Skilled pianists completed four testing sessions in a single day as cardiac activity was recorded during an initial 5 min of baseline rest and during performances of familiar and unfamiliar melodies. Results indicated slower tempi for familiar and unfamiliar melodies at early testing times. Performance rates at 09 h were predicted by differences in participants’ alertness and musical training; these differences were not explained by sleep patterns, chronotype, or cardiac activity. Individual differences in pianists’ performance tempo were consistent across testing sessions: participants with a faster tempo at 09 h maintained a faster tempo at later testing sessions. Cardiac measures at early testing times indicated increased heart rates and more predictable cardiac dynamics during music performance than baseline rest, and during performances of unfamiliar melodies than familiar melodies. These findings provide the first evidence of cardiac dynamics that are unique to music performance contexts.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00258">Rac1 Impairs Forgetting-Induced Cellular Plasticity in Mushroom Body Output Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Active memory forgetting is a well-regulated biological process thought to be adaptive and to allow proper cognitive functions. Recent efforts have elucidated several molecular players involved in the regulation of olfactory forgetting in Drosophila, including the small G protein Rac1, the dopamine receptor DAMB, and the scaffold protein Scribble. Similarly, we recently reported that dopaminergic neurons mediate both learning- and forgetting-induced plasticity in the mushroom body output neuron MBON-γ2α′1. Two open questions remain: how does forgetting affect plasticity in other, highly plastic, mushroom body compartments and how do genes that regulate forgetting affect this cellular plasticity? Here, we show that forgetting reverses short-term synaptic depression induced by aversive conditioning in the highly plastic mushroom body output neuron MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β. In addition, our results indicate that genetic tampering with normal forgetting by inhibition of small G protein Rac1 impairs restoration of depressed odor responses to learned odor by intrinsic forgetting through time passing and forgetting induced acutely by shock stimulation after conditioning or reversal learning. These data further indicate that some forms of forgetting truly erase physiological changes generated by memory encoding.</p>

Humans and other primates outstrip most animals in their sharpness of vision. This performance originates with the fine-grained array of photoreceptors in the primate fovea. Bryman et al. investigate form and function relationships within these neurons, revealing biophysical optimizations for high-fidelity signaling and constraints on the evolution of foveal size.

Park et al. characterize transcriptome responses of colon cancer cells to 5FU-induced DNA damage at single-cell resolution. Many DNA damage response genes are heterogeneously expressed across the cell population. Specifically, cells undergoing different fates had distinct transcriptomic landscapes, characterized by the expression of fate-specific DNA damage response genes.

Arterial growth and remodeling at the tissue level is driven by mechanobiological processes at cellular and sub-cellular levels. Although it is widely accepted that cells seek to promote tissue homeostasis in response to biochemical and biomechanical cues—such as increased wall stress in hypertension—the ways by which these cues translate into tissue maintenance, adaptation, or maladaptation are far from understood. In this paper, we present a logic-based computational model for cell signaling within the arterial wall, aiming to predict changes in extracellular matrix turnover and cell phenotype in response to pressure-induced wall stress, flow-induced wall shear stress, and exogenous sources of angiotensin II, with particular interest in mouse models of hypertension. We simulate a number of experiments from the literature at both the cell and tissue level, involving single or combined inputs, and achieve high qualitative agreement in most cases. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach for simulating alterations (in this case knockdowns) of individual nodes within the signaling network. Continued modeling of cellular signaling will enable improved mechanistic understanding of arterial growth and remodeling in health and disease, and will be crucial when considering potential pharmacological interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4OLENivxTvA" width="1" />

Breast cancer prognosis is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method, <i>scPrognosis</i>, to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data. <i>scPrognosis</i> uses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show that <i>scPrognosis</i> outperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. <i>scPrognosis</i> will also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H_btbruXGNk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/CMiBQ8bKMe8/article">Choosing fast and simply: Construction of preferences by starlings through parallel option valuation</a></h4>

<p>by Tiago Monteiro, Marco Vasconcelos, Alex Kacelnik</p>

The integration of normative and descriptive analyses of decision processes in humans struggles with the fact that measuring preferences by different procedures yields different rankings and that humans appear irrationally impulsive (namely, show maladaptive preference for immediacy). Failure of procedure invariance has led to the widespread hypothesis that preferences are constructed “on the spot” by cognitive evaluations performed at choice time, implying that choices should take extra time in order to perform the necessary comparisons. We examine this issue in experiments with starlings (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>) and show that integrating normative and descriptive arguments is possible and may help reinterpreting human decision results. Our main findings are that (1) ranking alternatives through direct rating (response time) accurately predicts preference in choice, overcoming failures of procedure invariance; (2) preference is not constructed at choice time nor does it involve extra time (we show that the opposite is true); and (3) starlings’ choices are not irrationally impulsive but are instead directly interpretable in terms of profitability ranking. Like all nonhuman research, our protocols examine decisions by experience rather than by description, and hence support the conjecture that irrationalities that prevail in research with humans may not be observed in decisions by experience protocols.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CMiBQ8bKMe8" width="1" />

In eukaryotes, conserved mechanisms ensure that cell growth is coordinated with nutrient availability. Overactive growth during nutrient limitation (“nutrient–growth dysregulation”) can lead to rapid cell death. Here, we demonstrate that cells can adapt to nutrient–growth dysregulation by evolving major metabolic defects. Specifically, when yeast lysine-auxotrophic mutant <i>lys</i><sup>−</sup> encountered lysine limitation, an evolutionarily novel stress, cells suffered nutrient–growth dysregulation. A subpopulation repeatedly evolved to lose the ability to synthesize organosulfurs (<i>lys</i><sup>−</sup><i>orgS</i><sup>−</sup>). Organosulfurs, mainly reduced glutathione (GSH) and GSH conjugates, were released by <i>lys</i><sup>−</sup> cells during lysine limitation when growth was dysregulated, but not during glucose limitation when growth was regulated. Limiting organosulfurs conferred a frequency-dependent fitness advantage to <i>lys</i><sup>−</sup><i>orgS</i><sup>−</sup> by eliciting a proper slow growth program, including autophagy. Thus, nutrient–growth dysregulation is associated with rapid organosulfur release, which enables the selection of organosulfur auxotrophy to better tune cell growth to the metabolic environment. We speculate that evolutionarily novel stresses can trigger atypical release of certain metabolites, setting the stage for the evolution of new ecological interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jxdMs7q_oR0" width="1" />

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long‐lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long‐term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP‐memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The functional connectivity of the hippocampus with its primary cortical input, the entorhinal cortex, is organized topographically. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, this leads to different functional gradients along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of spatial/sensory responsivity and spatial resolution respectively. CA1 ripples, a network phenomenon, allow us to test whether the hippocampal neural network shows corresponding gradients in functional connectivity along the two axes. We studied the occurrence and propagation of ripples across the entire proximodistal axis along with a comparable spatial range of the septotemporal axis of dorsal CA1. We observed that ripples could occur at any location, and their amplitudes were independent of the tetrode location along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes. When a ripple was detected on a particular tetrode (“reference tetrode”), however, the probability of cooccurrence of ripples and ripple amplitude observed on the other tetrodes decreased as a function of distance from the reference tetrode. This reduction was greater along the proximodistal axis than the septotemporal axis. Furthermore, we found that ripples propagate primarily along the proximodistal axis. Thus, over a spatial scale of ∼1.5 mm, the network is anisotropic along the two axes, complementing the topographically organized cortico‐hippocampal connections.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) is primarily responsible for initiating an immune response following pathogen recognition. However, TLR4 is also expressed on neural progenitor cells and has been reported to regulate hippocampal neurogenesis as young male TLR4 knockout mice show increases in cell proliferation and doublecortin positive cells. Whether these effects occur in both sexes and are sustained with normal aging is currently unknown. The present study evaluated whether TLR4 deficiency alters adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months), male and female, TLR4 deficient (TLR4−/−; B6.B10ScN‐Tlr4lps‐del/JthJ) and wild type (WT) mice. Additionally, neurogenesis within the dorsal and the ventral hippocampal subdivisions was evaluated to determine if TLR4 has differential effects across the hippocampus. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to quantify new cell survival as well as cell differentiation. Ki‐67 was measured to evaluate cell proliferation. Results show that young TLR4−/− females had higher rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus relative to WT females. Young TLR4−/− males show elevated proliferation and neuronal differentiation mainly in the ventral hippocampus. While young TLR4−/− mice show enhanced neurogenesis compared to young WT mice, the increase was not apparent in the aged TLR4−/− mice. Both aged WT and TLR4−/− mice showed a decrease in proliferation, new cell survival, and neuronal differentiation compared to young WT and TLR4−/− mice. The data collectively indicate that TLR4 regulates hippocampal neurogenesis in young adults, but that these effects are region‐specific in males and that females show broader changes in neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning is well established, but the precise relative contributions by the dorsal (septal) and ventral (temporal) subregions remain unresolved. One debate revolves around the extent to which the ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial navigation and learning. Here, separate small subtotal lesions of dorsal hippocampus or ventral hippocampus alone (destroying 18.9 and 28.5% of total hippocampal volume, respectively) spared reference memory acquisition in the water maze. By contrast, combining the two subtotal lesions significantly reduced the rate of acquisition across days. This constitutes evidence for synergistic integration between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. Evidence that ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial/navigation learning also emerged early on during the retention probe test as search preference was reduced in mice with ventral lesions alone or combined lesions. The small ventral lesions also led to anxiolysis in the elevated plus maze and over‐generalization of the conditioned freezing response to a neutral context. Similar effects of comparable magnitudes were seen in mice with combined lesions, suggesting that they were largely due to the small ventral damage. By contrast, small dorsal lesions were uniquely associated with a severe spatial working memory deficit in the water maze. Taken together, both dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus contribute to efficient spatial navigation in mice: While the integrity of dorsal hippocampus is necessary for spatial working memory, the acquisition and retrieval of spatial reference memory are modulated by the ventral hippocampus. Although the impairments following ventral damage (alone or in combination with dorsal damage) were less substantial, a wider spectrum of spatial learning, including context conditioning, was implicated. Our results encourage the search for integrative mechanism between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in spatial learning. Candidate neural substrates may include dorsoventral longitudinal connections and reciprocal modulation via overlapping polysynaptic networks beyond hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue‐target associations, and subsequently were scanned using ultra‐high‐field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the associated or not‐associated time intervals. When temporal expectations were met during testing trials, activity in left and right hippocampal subfields and right putamen decreased, compared to when temporal expectations were not met. Further, psycho‐physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left hippocampal subfields and caudate decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal‐striatal network in temporal associative processing.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The acquisition of active avoidance (AA) behavior is typically aided by the presence of two signals—the warning signal, which predicts the future occurrence of an aversive event (e.g., shocks), and the safety signal, which is presented upon successful avoidance of oncoming shocks. While the warning signal could be conceived to act as a Pavlovian fear cue, and is likely mediated by brain areas that underlie Pavlovian fear cue conditioning, the neural substrates underlying safety signaling are less clear, largely due to the unavailability of AA tasks that are devoid of an explicit warning signal. The present study sought to investigate the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH) in safety signaled AA performance acquired without an explicit warning signal, using a novel discrete trial paradigm. Adult male Long Evans rats were divided into two groups and trained to acquire AA responses with, or without a safety signal. Analysis of the acquisition and stable state performance data revealed that the availability of a safety signal alone did not improve the acquisition or performance of AA responses. Furthermore, post‐training, reversible VH inactivation did not impact stable state avoidance behavior. However, extinction of avoidance responses was facilitated in the group trained with a safety signal, and this effect was further potentiated by VH inactivation. Additional elevated plus maze (EPM), light–dark box, and locomotor tests demonstrated that VH inactivation reduced anxiety without affecting locomotor activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of VH in the extinction of persistent pathological avoidance behavior when safety is signaled.</p>

Null mutations of this gene on one copy of chromosome 5 in humans are associated with intellectual disability and seizures. Mice with deletion of one copy of the gene have similar problems and their cortical neurons show enlarged dendritic spines (shown here) with reduced expression of potassium channels, thus predisposing to hyperexcitability which can be normalized with lithium treatment.

<p>Disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered primarily a result of axonal loss. However, correlation with spinal cord cross‐sectional area—a predictor of disability—is poor, questioning the unique role of axonal loss. We investigated the degree of synaptic loss in postmortem spinal cords (18 chronic MS, 8 healthy controls) using immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and synapsin. Substantial (58–96%) loss of synapses throughout the spinal cord was detected, along with moderate (47%) loss of anterior horn neurons, notably in demyelinating MS lesions. We conclude that synaptic loss is significant in chronic MS, likely contributing to disability accrual. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:619–625</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impairment of glycinergic neurotransmission leads to complex movement and behavioral disorders. Patients harboring glycine receptor autoantibodies suffer from stiff‐person syndrome or its severe variant progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Enhanced receptor internalization was proposed as the common molecular mechanism upon autoantibody binding. Although functional impairment of glycine receptors following autoantibody binding has recently been investigated, it is still incompletely understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A cell‐based assay was used for positive sample evaluation. Glycine receptor function was assessed by electrophysiological recordings and radioligand binding assays. The in vivo passive transfer of patient autoantibodies was done using the zebrafish animal model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Glycine receptor function as assessed by glycine dose–response curves showed significantly decreased glycine potency in the presence of patient sera. Upon binding of autoantibodies from 2 patients, a decreased fraction of desensitized receptors was observed, whereas closing of the ion channel remained fast. The glycine receptor N‐terminal residues <sup>29</sup>A to <sup>62</sup>G were mapped as a common epitope of glycine receptor autoantibodies. An in vivo transfer into the zebrafish animal model generated a phenotype with disturbed escape behavior accompanied by a reduced number of glycine receptor clusters in the spinal cord of affected animals.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Autoantibodies against the extracellular domain mediate alterations of glycine receptor physiology. Moreover, our in vivo data demonstrate that the autoantibodies are a direct cause of the disease, because the transfer of human glycine receptor autoantibodies to zebrafish larvae generated impaired escape behavior in the animal model compatible with abnormal startle response in stiff‐person syndrome or progressive encephalitis with rigidity and myoclonus patients.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to demonstrate that antibodies from patients with anti‐<i>N</i>‐methyl‐<span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis alter the levels of dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) and cause psychotic‐like features in mice.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis or controls, and the effects on clusters of D1R and D2R were quantified. In vivo studies included 71 C57BL/6J mice that were chronically infused with CSF from patients or controls through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startling reflex (PPI; a marker of psychotic‐like behavior), memory, locomotor activity, and the density of cell‐surface and synaptic D1R, D2R, and NMDAR clusters were examined at different time points using reported techniques.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In cultured neurons, CSF from patients, but not from controls, caused a significant decrease of cell‐surface D1R and an increase of D2R clusters. In mice, CSF from patients caused a significant decrease of synaptic and total cell‐surface D1R clusters and an increase of D2R clusters associated with a decrease of PPI. These effects were accompanied by memory impairment and a reduction of surface NMDARs, as reported in this model. The psychotic‐like features, memory impairment, and changes in levels of D1R, D2R, and NMDAR progressively improved several days after the infusion of CSF from patients stopped.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In addition to memory deficits and reduction of NMDARs, CSF antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis cause reversible psychotic‐like features accompanied by changes (D1R decrease, D2R increase) in cell‐surface dopamine receptor clusters.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic variants of the cytoplasmic FMR1‐interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2</i>) encoding an actin‐regulatory protein are associated with brain disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy. However, specific in vivo neuronal defects and potential treatments for <i>CYFIP2</i>‐associated brain disorders remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized <i>Cyfip2</i> heterozygous (<i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup>) mice to understand their neurobehavioral phenotypes and the underlying pathological mechanisms. Furthermore, we examined a potential treatment for such phenotypes of the <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/−</i>
</sup> mice and specified a neuronal function mediating its efficacy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed behavioral analyses of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice. We combined molecular, ultrastructural, and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological analyses of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> prefrontal neurons. We also selectively reduced CYFIP2 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice with virus injections.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adult <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice exhibited lithium‐responsive abnormal behaviors. We found increased filamentous actin, enlarged dendritic spines, and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability in the adult <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> PFC that was restricted to layer 5 (L5) neurons. Consistently, adult <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice showed increased seizure susceptibility and auditory steady‐state responses from the cortical electroencephalographic recordings. Among the identified prefrontal defects, lithium selectively normalized the hyperexcitability of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> L5 neurons. RNA sequencing revealed reduced expression of potassium channel genes in the adult <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> PFC. Virus‐mediated reduction of CYFIP2 in the PFC was sufficient to induce L5 hyperexcitability and lithium‐responsive abnormal behavior.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that L5‐specific prefrontal dysfunction, especially hyperexcitability, underlies both the pathophysiology and the lithium‐mediated amelioration of neurobehavioral phenotypes in adult <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice, which can be implicated in <i>CYFIP2</i>‐associated brain disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:526–543</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine associations of molecular markers of brain insulin signaling with Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognition among older persons with or without diabetes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This clinical–pathologic study was derived from a community‐based cohort study, the Religious Orders Study. We studied 150 individuals (mean age at death =87 years, 48% women): 75 with and 75 without diabetes (matched by sex on age at death and education). Using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo stimulation of brain tissue with insulin, we assessed insulin signaling in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus cortex. Postmortem data documented AD neuropathology. Clinical evaluations documented cognitive function proximate to death, based on 17 neuropsychological tests. In adjusted regression analyses, we examined associations of brain insulin signaling with diabetes, AD, and level of cognition.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain insulin receptor substrate‐1 (IRS1) phosphorylation (pS<sup>307</sup>IRS1/total IRS1) and serine/threonine‐protein kinase (AKT) phosphorylation (pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1/total AKT1) were similar in persons with or without diabetes. AKT phosphorylation was associated with the global AD pathology score (<i>p =</i> 0.001). In contrast, IRS1 phosphorylation was not associated with AD (<i>p</i> = 0.536). No other associations of insulin signaling were found with the global AD score, including when using the ex vivo brain insulin stimulation method. In secondary analyses, normalized pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1 was positively correlated with both the amyloid burden and tau tangle density, and no other associations of brain insulin signaling with neuropathology were observed. Moreover, normalized pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1 was associated with a lower level of global cognitive function (estimate = −0.212, standard error = 0.097; <i>p</i> = 0.031).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Brain AKT phosphorylation, a critical node in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors, is associated with AD neuropathology and lower cognitive function. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:513–525</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to contrast findings with Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a discovery cohort of well‐characterized early MSA patients (n = 24) and matched healthy controls (CON, n = 14), we utilized enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay to measure NFL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF. We confirmed findings in a separate prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with early MSA (n = 38), Parkinson disease (PD, n = 16), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), and CON subjects (n = 15).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the discovery cohort, NFL was markedly elevated in MSA patients, with perfect separation from CON. αSyn‐PMCA was nonreactive in all CON, whereas all MSA samples were positive. In the confirmatory cohort, NFL again perfectly separated MSA from CON, and was significantly lower in PD and DLB compared to MSA. PMCA was again nonreactive in all CON, and positive in all but 2 MSA cases. All PD and all but 2 DLB samples were also positive for αSyn aggregates but with markedly different reaction kinetics from MSA; aggregation occurred later, but maximum fluorescence was higher, allowing for perfect separation of reactive samples between MSA and Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NFL and αSyn oligomers in CSF faithfully differentiate early MSA not only from CON but also from Lewy body synucleinopathies. The findings support the role of these markers as diagnostic biomarkers, and have important implications for understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synucleinopathies.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS) induces long‐term depression (LTD)‐like reduction of cortical excitability (DCS‐LTD), which has been tested in the treatment of epilepsy with modest effects. In part, this may be due to variable cortical neuron orientation relative to the electric field. We tested, in vivo and in vitro, whether DCS‐LTD occurs throughout the cortical thickness, and if not, then whether drug–DCS pairing can enhance the uniformity of the cortical response and the cDCS antiepileptic effect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cDCS‐mediated changes in cortical excitability were measured in vitro in mouse motor cortex (M1) and in human postoperative neocortex, in vivo in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), and in a mouse kainic acid (KA)‐seizure model. Contributions of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate–type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to cDCS‐mediated plasticity were tested with application of NMDAR blockers (memantine/D‐AP5).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>cDCS reliably induced DCS‐LTD in superficial cortical layers, and a long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like enhancement (DCS‐LTP) was recorded in deep cortical layers. Immunostaining confirmed layer‐specific increase of phospho‐S6 ribosomal protein in mouse M1. Similar nonuniform cDCS aftereffects on cortical excitability were also found in human neocortex in vitro and in S1 of alert mice in vivo. Application of memantine/D‐AP5 either produced a more uniform DCS‐LTD throughout the cortical thickness or at least abolished DCS‐LTP. Moreover, a combination of memantine and cDCS suppressed KA‐induced seizures.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>cDCS aftereffects are not uniform throughout cortical layers, which may explain the incomplete cDCS clinical efficacy. NMDAR antagonists may augment cDCS efficacy in epilepsy and other disorders where regional depression of cortical excitability is desirable. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:489–502</p>

<p>Facial expressions are important for intentional display of emotions in social interaction. For people with severe paralysis, the ability to display emotions intentionally can be impaired. Current brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for linguistic communication but are cumbersome for expressing emotions. Here, we investigated the feasibility of a BCI to display emotions by decoding facial expressions. We used electrocorticographic recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of people with refractory epilepsy and classified five facial expressions, based on neural activity. The mean classification accuracy was 72%. This approach could be a promising avenue for development of BCI‐based solutions for fast communication of emotions. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:631–636</p>

<p>Vision therapy in the form of ocular motor training is increasingly used to treat visual complaints, particularly in the setting of persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this review, we discuss the rationale behind this intervention and the evidence for its utility. Although the efficacy of exercises for primary convergence insufficiency is plausible and supported by data, there is not yet strong evidence of benefit for the post‐traumatic variant. It is not established that abnormalities in fixation, pursuit, and saccades in mTBI are the cause of post‐concussive symptoms, or that these abnormalities arise from ocular motor damage rather than being secondary effects of cognitive problems with attention or executive control. The few studies to date have significant methodological weaknesses. More substantial evidence is required before vision therapy can be accepted as a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with brain trauma. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:453–461</p>

<p>Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the hippocampus but increased binding in the prefrontal cortex relative to control. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g., periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the function of the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas in forming associations is generally recognized, how MTL contributes to form creative associations that could result in novel and appropriate functions or meanings remains unclear. In this study, we compared highly creative combinations (HCCs) of two objects (e.g., that of “lifejacket” and “distress signal device”) that resulted in genuine innovative designs comprising additionally unprecedented functions (the “1 + 1 &gt; 2” effects) with the lowly creative combinations (LCCs, e.g., the combination of “set‐top box” and “jewelry box”) that resulted in nothing more than simple “1 + 1 = 2” effects. The event‐related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that during the “early binding phase,” when the combinations of the two objects were initially encoded, the right parahippocampus was more intensively activated during the encoding of HCC relative to LCC trials. However, during the “late integration phase,” when participants finally formed a holistic mental representation of new products based on the two‐object combinations, both HCCs and LCCs were found to be associated with significantly increased hippocampal and parahippocampal activation relative to the baseline condition, but at a similar level. In this “late integration phase,” the functional areas appeared to be more intensively activated in HCCs relative to LCCs located in the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), the area known to mediate category‐related processing. Consistently, our supplementary behavioral study found that, relative to LCCs, HCCs had a higher possibility of resulting in some new conceptual expansions that differed from each of the original two objects that constituted the combinations. These findings indicate that the formation of creative combinations not only require MTL‐based novel association‐formation, but also pMTG‐based novel concept‐expansion.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A functional gradient has been proposed across the medial temporal lobes (MTL) such that the anterior MTL is thought to support processing of individual items (e.g., item memory and complex object perception), whereas the posterior MTL is thought to support item‐context retrieval (e.g., source memory). Whereas functional imaging studies have provided evidence supporting this anatomical organization, results from structural analyses remain inconclusive. The current study examined the relationship between volume of MTL regions of interest (ROIs), and performance on a source memory task and a fine‐grain complex object perception task, in healthy young adults (mean age = 21.5, range = 18–29). Using a semiautomated procedure, we segmented the parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices (PHC, PRC), posteromedial and anterolateral entorhinal cortices (pmERC, alERC), and posterior and anterior hippocampus (postHC, antHC) on high‐resolution T2‐weighted MRIs. Regional volumes were computed as proportions of intracranial volume, and as posterior–anterior volumetric ratios (PHC:PRC, pmERC:alERC, postHC:antHC). Partial‐least squares regressions were applied to predict source and item memory, and perceptual discrimination accuracy, based on ROI and ratio volumes. In our ROI regressions, we found that postHC volume was positively correlated with a latent factor predicting source memory, and PRC and antHC volumes were negatively correlated to this latent factor. In our ratio regressions, we observed an effect relating the posterior–anterior distribution of gray matter across the MTL with source memory. Our results demonstrate differential associations between anterior and posterior MTL and source memory performance. Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering patterns of structure–behavior associations in the neurobiology of episodic memory.</p>

<p>Spasticity and motor recovery are both related to neural plasticity after stroke. A balance of activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) in both hemispheres is essential for functional recovery. In this study, we assessed the intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in the contralesional M1 area in four patients with severe upper limb spasticity after chronic stroke and treated with botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) injection and 12 weeks of upper limb rehabilitation. There was little to no change in the level of spasticity post-injection, and only one participant experienced a small improvement in arm function. All reported improvements in quality of life. However, the levels of intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the contralesional hemisphere were different at baseline for all four participants, and there was no clear pattern in the response to the intervention. Further investigation is needed to understand how BoNT-A injections affect inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in the contralesional hemisphere, the severity of spasticity, and functional improvement.</p>

Using two-photon holographic optogenetics, Gill, Lerman et al. show that mice can reliably detect single spikes across small sets of targeted olfactory bulb neurons. They find that detection performance depends strongly on neuronal synchrony, but not on latency relative to inhalation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The actions of endogenous opioids and nociceptin/orphanin FQ are mediated by four homologous G protein‐coupled receptors that constitute the opioid receptor family. However, little is known about opioid systems in cyclostomes (living jawless fish) and how opioid systems might have evolved from invertebrates. Here, we leveraged de novo transcriptome and low‐coverage whole‐genome assembly in the Pacific hagfish (<i>Eptatretus stoutii</i>) to identify and characterize the first full‐length coding sequence for a functional opioid receptor in a cyclostome. Additionally, we define two novel endogenous opioid precursors in this species that predict several novel opioid peptides. Bioinformatic analysis shows no closely related opioid receptor genes in invertebrates with regard either to the genomic organization or to conserved opioid receptor‐specific sequences that are common in all vertebrates. Furthermore, no proteins analogous to vertebrate opioid precursors could be identified by genomic searches despite previous claims of protein or RNA‐derived sequences in several invertebrate species. The presence of an expressed orthologous receptor and opioid precursors in the Pacific hagfish confirms that a functional opioid system was likely present in the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates some 550 million years ago, earlier than all previous authenticated accounts. We discuss the premise that the cyclostome and vertebrate opioid systems evolved from invertebrate systems concerned with antimicrobial defense and speculate that the high concentrations of opioid precursors in tissues such as the testes, gut, and activated immune cells are key remnants of this evolutionary role.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carrying a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function, we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, ABRs show longer latencies in central waves (II–IV) that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs presenting only Waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacoustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC; therefore, screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.</p>

Management strategies for control of vector-borne diseases, for example Zika or dengue, include using larvicide and/or adulticide, either through large-scale application by truck or plane or through door-to-door efforts that require obtaining permission to access private property and spray yards. The efficacy of the latter strategy is highly dependent on the compliance of local residents. Here we develop a model for vector-borne disease transmission between mosquitoes and humans in a neighborhood setting, considering a network of houses connected via nearest-neighbor mosquito movement. We incorporate large-scale application of adulticide via aerial spraying through a uniform increase in vector death rates in all sites, and door-to-door application of larval source reduction and adulticide through a decrease in vector emergence rates and an increase in vector death rates in compliant sites only, where control efficacies are directly connected to real-world experimentally measurable control parameters, application frequencies, and control costs. To develop mechanistic insight into the influence of vector motion and compliance clustering on disease controllability, we determine the the basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for the system, provide analytic results for the extreme cases of no mosquito movement, infinite hopping rates, and utilize degenerate perturbation theory for the case of slow but non-zero hopping rates. We then determine the application frequencies required for each strategy (alone and combined) in order to reduce <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> to unity, along with the associated costs. Cost-optimal strategies are found to depend strongly on mosquito hopping rates, levels of door-to-door compliance, and spatial clustering of compliant houses, and can include aerial spray alone, door-to-door treatment alone, or a combination of both. The optimization scheme developed here provides a flexible tool for disease management planners which translates modeling results into actionable control advice adaptable to system-specific details.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-4Cq1nPXDU" width="1" />

<p>by Tomer Stern, Stanislav Y. Shvartsman, Eric F. Wieschaus</p>

Tissue morphogenesis relies on repeated use of dynamic behaviors at the levels of intracellular structures, individual cells, and cell groups. Rapidly accumulating live imaging datasets make it increasingly important to formalize and automate the task of mapping recurrent dynamic behaviors (motifs), as it is done in speech recognition and other data mining applications. Here, we present a “template-based search” approach for accurate mapping of sub- to multi-cellular morphogenetic motifs using a time series data mining framework. We formulated the task of motif mapping as a subsequence matching problem and solved it using dynamic time warping, while relying on high throughput graph-theoretic algorithms for efficient exploration of the search space. This formulation allows our algorithm to accurately identify the complete duration of each instance and automatically label different stages throughout its progress, such as cell cycle phases during cell division. To illustrate our approach, we mapped cell intercalations during germband extension in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. Our framework enabled statistical analysis of intercalary cell behaviors in wild-type and mutant embryos, comparison of temporal dynamics in contracting and growing junctions in different genotypes, and the identification of a novel mode of iterative cell intercalation. Our formulation of tissue morphogenesis using time series opens new avenues for systematic decomposition of tissue morphogenesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TK83tSWZtVg" width="1" />

<p>by Ashkan Tabibian, Siavash Ghaffari, Diego A. Vargas, Hans Van Oosterwyck, Elizabeth A. V. Jones</p>

Shear stress induces directed endothelial cell (EC) migration in blood vessels leading to vessel diameter increase and induction of vascular maturation. Other factors, such as EC elongation and interaction between ECs and non-vascular areas are also important. Computational models have previously been used to study collective cell migration. These models can be used to predict EC migration and its effect on vascular remodelling during embryogenesis. We combined live time-lapse imaging of the remodelling vasculature of the quail embryo yolk sac with flow quantification using a combination of micro-Particle Image Velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics. We then used the flow and remodelling data to inform a model of EC migration during remodelling. To obtain the relation between shear stress and velocity <i>in vitro</i> for EC cells, we developed a flow chamber to assess how confluent sheets of ECs migrate in response to shear stress. Using these data as an input, we developed a multiphase, self-propelled particles (SPP) model where individual agents are driven to migrate based on the level of shear stress while maintaining appropriate spatial relationship to nearby agents. These agents elongate, interact with each other, and with avascular agents at each time-step of the model. We compared predicted vascular shape to real vascular shape after 4 hours from our time-lapse movies and performed sensitivity analysis on the various model parameters. Our model shows that shear stress has the largest effect on the remodelling process. Importantly, however, elongation played an especially important part in remodelling. This model provides a powerful tool to study the input of different biological processes on remodelling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jh8yMFKwZnU" width="1" />

Genomic epidemiology can provide a unique, real-time understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Yet the potential for genomic analyses to guide local policy and community-based behavioral decisions is limited because they are often oriented towards specially trained scientists and conducted on a national or global scale. Here, we propose a new paradigm: Phylogenetic analyses performed on a local level (municipal, county, or state), with results communicated in a clear, timely, and actionable manner to strengthen public health responses. We believe that presenting results rapidly, and tailored to a non-expert audience, can serve as a template for effective public health response to COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QU8piv4kS-E" width="1" />

<p>by Gustavo A. Rodriguez, Geoffrey M. Barrett, Karen E. Duff, S. Abid Hussaini</p>

High levels of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide have been shown to disrupt neuronal function and induce hyperexcitability, but it is unclear what effects Aβ-associated hyperexcitability may have on tauopathy pathogenesis or propagation in vivo. Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of human APP (hAPP)/Aβ accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex–hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP overexpression aggravates EC-Tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus. In vivo recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/Aβ, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chronic chemogenetic attenuation of EC neuronal hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/Aβ accumulation and reduced pathological tau spread into downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Aβ-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology in vivo.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/72Wsaso3B-M" width="1" />

<p>There are a pressing and unmet need for effective therapies for freezing of gait (FOG) and other neurological gait disorders. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a midbrain target known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) was proposed as a potential treatment based on its postulated involvement in locomotor control as part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). However, DBS trials fell short of expectations, leading many clinicians to abandon this strategy. Here, we discuss the potential reasons for this failure and review recent clinical data along with preclinical optogenetics evidence to argue that another nearby nucleus, the cuneiform nucleus (CnF), may be a superior target.</p>

<p>Currently, there are no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or any other dementia subtype. The renaissance in psychedelic research in recent years, in particular studies involving psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), coupled with anecdotal reports of cognitive benefits from micro-dosing, suggests that they may have a therapeutic role in a range of psychiatric and neurological conditions due to their potential to stimulate neurogenesis, provoke neuroplastic changes and reduce neuroinflammation. This inevitably makes them interesting candidates for therapeutics in dementia. This mini-review will look at the basic science and current clinical evidence for the role of psychedelics in treating dementia, especially early AD, with a particular focus on micro-dosing of the classical psychedelics LSD and psilocybin.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Although the incidence of AD is high, the rates of diagnosis and treatment are relatively low. Moreover, effective means for the diagnosis and treatment of AD are still lacking. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are non-coding RNAs that play regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs. The expression of miRNAs is conserved, temporal, and tissue-specific. Impairment of microRNA function is closely related to AD pathogenesis, including the beta-amyloid and tau hallmarks of AD, and there is evidence that the expression of some microRNAs differs significantly between healthy people and AD patients. These properties of miRNAs endow them with potential diagnostic and therapeutic value in the treatment of this debilitating disease. This review provides comprehensive information about the regulatory function of miRNAs in AD, as well as potential applications as diagnostic biomarkers.</p>

<p>The inability of individual neurons to compensate for aging-related damage leads to a gradual loss of functional plasticity in the brain accompanied by progressive impairment in learning and memory. Whereas this loss in neuroplasticity is gradual during normal aging, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), this loss is accelerated dramatically, leading to the incapacitation of patients within a decade of onset of cognitive symptoms. The mechanisms that underlie this accelerated loss of neuroplasticity in AD are still not completely understood. While the progressively increasing proteinopathy burden, such as amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, definitely contribute directly to a neuron’s functional demise, the role of non-neuronal cells in controlling neuroplasticity is slowly being recognized as another major factor. These non-neuronal cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, which through regulating brain homeostasis, structural stability, and trophic support, play a key role in maintaining normal functioning and resilience of the neuronal network. It is believed that chronic signaling from these cells affects the homeostatic network of neuronal and non-neuronal cells to an extent to destabilize this harmonious milieu in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Here, we will examine the experimental evidence regarding the direct and indirect pathways through which astrocytes and microglia can alter brain plasticity in AD, specifically as they relate to the development and progression of tauopathy. In this review article, we describe the concepts of neuroplasticity and glial plasticity in healthy aging, delineate possible mechanisms underlying tau-induced plasticity dysfunction, and discuss current clinical trials as well as future disease-modifying approaches.</p>

<p>There is increasing evidence that sex differences in the brain may contribute to gender-related behavioral differences, including cognitive function. Literature has revealed gender dimorphisms in cognitive function between males and females. Additionally, several risk factors associated with cognitive decline depend on chronological age. It is well recognized that the process of aging is associated with a decline in cognitive ability and brain function. Various explanations may account for these gender-related cognitive differences and age-associated cognitive changes. Recent investigations have highlighted the importance of vitamin C in maintaining brain health and its association with cognitive function in both cognitively intact and impaired cohorts. The present review explores previous literature that has evaluated differences in plasma/brain vitamin C between genders and during aging. It then assesses whether these age and gender-related differences may affect the relationship between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition. The purpose of this review was to examine the evidence for a link between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition and the impact of gender and age on this relationship. Epidemiological studies have frequently shown higher vitamin C plasma concentrations in women. Similarly, aging has been systematically associated with reductions in plasma vitamin C levels. A range of animal studies has demonstrated potential gender and age-related differences in vitamin C brain distribution and utilization. The reviewed literature suggests that gender differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may potentially contribute to differences in gender-associated cognitive ability, particularly while females are pre-menopausal. Additionally, we can propose that age-associated differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may be potentially linked to age-associated cognitive differences, with older cohorts appearing more vulnerable to experience declines in plasma vitamin C concentrations alongside compromised vitamin C brain regulation. This review encourages future investigations to take into account both gender and age when assessing the link between plasma vitamin C concentrations and cognitive function. Further large scale investigations are required to assess whether differences in cognitive function between genders and age groups may be causally attributed to plasma vitamin C status and brain distribution and utilization.</p>

<p>Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disorder due to loss of function of TSC1/TSC2 resulting in increased mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. In the brain, TSC is characterized by the formation of specific lesions that include subependymal and white matter nodules and cortical tubers. Cells that constitute TSC lesions are mainly Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons and astrocytes, but normal cells also populate the tubers. Although considered as a developmental disorder, the histopathological features of brain lesions have been described in only a limited number of fetal cases, providing little information on how these lesions develop. In this report we characterized the development of TSC lesions in 14 fetal brains ranging from 19 gestational weeks (GW) to term and 2 postnatal cases. The study focused on the telencephalon at the level of the caudothalamic notch. Our data indicate that subcortical lesions, forming within and at the vicinity of germinative zones, are the first alterations (already detected in 19GW brains), characterized by the presence of numerous dysmorphic astrocytes and Giant, balloon-like, cells. Our data show that cortical tuber formation is a long process that initiates with the presence of dysmorphic astrocytes (by 19–21GW), progress with the apparition of Giant cells (by 24GW) and mature with the appearance of dysmorphic neurons by the end of gestation (by 36GW). Furthermore, the typical tuberal aspect of cortical lesions is only reached when bundles of neurofilament positive extensions delineate the bottom of the cortical lesion (by 36GW). In addition, our study reveals the presence of Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons immunopositive for interneuron markers such as calbindin and parvalbumin, suggesting that TSC lesions would be mosaic lesions generated from different classes of progenitors.</p>

<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a part of the cerebellar neurodegenerative disease group that is diverse in genetics and phenotypes. It usually shows autosomal dominant inheritance. SCAs, always together with the cerebellar degeneration, may exhibit clinical deficits in brainstem or eye, especially retina or optic nerve. Interestingly, autosomal dominant SCAs share a common genetic mechanism; the length of the glutamine chain is abnormally expanded due to the increase in the cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeats of the disease causing gene. Studies have suggested that the mutant ataxin induces alteration of protein conformation and abnormal aggregation resulting in nuclear inclusions, and causes cellular loss of photoreceptors through a toxic effect. As a result, these pathologic changes induce a downregulation of genes involved in the phototransduction, development, and differentiation of photoreceptors such as CRX, one of the photoreceptor transcription factors. However, the exact mechanism of neuronal degeneration by mutant ataxin restricted to only certain type of neuronal cell including cerebellar Purkinje neurons and photoreceptor is still unclear. The most common SCAs are types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 which contain about 80% of autosomal dominant SCA cases. Various aspects of eye movement abnormalities are evident depending on the degree of cerebellar and brainstem degeneration in SCAs. In addition, certain types of SCAs such as SCA7 are characterized by both cerebellar ataxia and visual loss mainly due to retinal degeneration. The severity of the retinopathy can vary from occult macular photoreceptor disruption to extensive retinal atrophy and is correlated with the number of CAG repeats. The value of using optical coherence tomography in conjunction with electrodiagnostic and genetic testing is emphasized as the combination of these tests can provide critical information regarding the etiology, morphological evaluation, and functional significances. Therefore, ophthalmologists need to recognize and differentiate SCAs in order to properly diagnose and evaluate the disease. In this review, we have described and discussed SCAs showing ophthalmic abnormalities with particular attention to their ophthalmic features, neurodegenerative mechanisms, genetics, and future perspectives.</p>

Objective<p>To evaluate whether introducing gamification in BCI rehabilitation of the upper limbs of post-stroke patients has a positive impact on their experience without altering their efficacy in creating motor mental images (MI).</p>Design<p>A game was designed purposely adapted to the pace and goals of an established BCI-rehabilitation protocol. Rehabilitation was based on a double feedback: functional electrostimulation and animation of a virtual avatar of the patient’s limbs. The game introduced a narrative on top of this visual feedback with an external goal to achieve (protecting bits of cheese from a rat character). A pilot study was performed with 10 patients and a control group of six volunteers. Two rehabilitation sessions were done, each made up of one stage of calibration and two training stages, some stages with the game and others without. The accuracy of the classification computed was taken as a measure to compare the efficacy of MI. Users’ opinions were gathered through a questionnaire. No potentially identifiable human images or data are presented in this study.</p>Results<p>The gamified rehabilitation presented in the pilot study does not impact on the efficacy of MI, but it improves users experience making it more fun.</p>Conclusion<p>These preliminary results are encouraging to continue investigating how game narratives can be introduced in BCI rehabilitation to make it more gratifying and engaging.</p>

<p>Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder and is suggested to be caused by central nervous system abnormalities. Non-invasive transcutaneous spinal direct-current stimulation (tsDCS) was recently used for RLS therapy. However, the neurophysiological basis of tsDCS treatment is still unknown. In this study, we explored the neural basis of tsDCS in 15 RLS patients and 20 gender- and age-matched healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We calculated the whole-brain voxel-wise fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and weighted degree centrality (DC) to characterize the intrinsic functional activities and the local and global functional integration. We found that tsDCS can effectively improve the sleep and RLS symptoms in RLS patients. Moreover, after tsDCS therapy, the RLS patients showed decreased fALFF in the right anterior insula/temporal pole, decreased ReHo in the supplementary motor area, increased weighted DC in the left primary visual cortex, and decreased weighted DC in the right posterior cerebellum. The changed patterns were consistent with that found between RLS patients and healthy controls. The weighted DC in the left primary visual cortex after treatment and the fALFF in the right anterior insula/temporal pole before treatment were significantly and marginally correlated with sleep and RLS symptom scores, respectively. These results revealed that tsDCS can normalize the functional patterns of RLS patients and is an effective way for RLS therapy. Our findings provide the neurophysiological basis for tsDCS treatment and may facilitate understanding the neuropathology of RLS and directing other neuromodulation treatments.</p>

Background<p>Observation of a goal-directed motor action can excite the respective mirror neurons, and this is the theoretical basis for action observation (AO) as a novel tool for functional recovery during stroke rehabilitation. To explore the therapeutic potential of AO for dysphagia, we conducted a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify the brain areas activated during observation and execution of swallowing in healthy participants.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-nine healthy volunteers viewed the following stimuli during fMRI scanning: an action-video of swallowing (condition 1, defined as AO), a neutral image with a Chinese word for “watching” (condition 2), and a neutral image with a Chinese word for “swallowing” (condition 3). Action execution (AE) was defined as condition 3 minus condition 2. One-sample t-tests were performed to define the brain regions activated during AO and AE.</p>Results<p>Many brain regions were activated during AO, including the middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, hippocampus, brainstem, and pons. AE resulted in activation of motor areas as well as other brain areas, including the inferior parietal lobule, vermis, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Two brain areas, BA6 and BA21, were activated with both AO and AE.</p>Conclusion<p>The left supplementary motor area (BA6) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA21), which contains mirror neurons, were activated in both AO and AE of swallowing. In this study, AO activated mirror neurons and the swallowing network in healthy participants, supporting its potential value in the treatment of dysphagia.</p>

<p>This study examines the atrophy patterns in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices of subjects that converted from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment. The regions were manually segmented from 3T MRI, then corrected for variability in boundary definition over time using an automated approach called longitudinal diffeomorphometry. Cortical thickness was calculated by deforming the gray matter-white matter boundary surface to the pial surface using an approach called normal geodesic flow. The surface was parcellated based on four atlases using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping. Average cortical thickness was calculated for (1) manually-defined entorhinal cortex, and (2) manually-defined transentorhinal cortex. Group-wise difference analysis was applied to determine where atrophy occurred, and change point analysis was applied to determine when atrophy started to occur. The results showed that by the time a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is made, the transentorhinal cortex and entorhinal cortex was up to 0.6 mm thinner than a control with normal cognition. A change point in atrophy rate was detected in the transentorhinal cortex 9–14 years prior to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and in the entorhinal cortex 8–11 years prior. The findings are consistent with autopsy findings that demonstrate neuronal changes in the transentorhinal cortex before the entorhinal cortex.</p>

Background<p>Macular degeneration (MD) is one of the most frequent causes of visual deficit, resulting in alterations affecting not only the retina but also the entire visual pathway up to the brain areas. This would seem related not just to signal deprivation but also to a compensatory neuronal reorganization, having significant implications in terms of potential rehabilitation of the patient and therapeutic perspectives.</p>Objective<p>This paper aimed to outline, by analyzing the existing literature, the current understanding of brain structural and functional changes detected with neuroimaging techniques in subjects affected by juvenile and age-related maculopathy.</p>Methods<p>Articles using various typologies of central nervous system (CNS) imaging in at least six patients affected by juvenile or age-related maculopathy were considered. A total of 142 were initially screened. Non-pertinent articles and duplicates were rejected. Finally, 19 articles, including 649 patients, were identified.</p>Results<p>In these sources, both structural and functional modifications were found in MD subjects’ CNS. Changes in visual cortex gray matter volume were observed in both age-related MD (AMD) and juvenile MD (JMD); in particular, an involvement of not only its posterior part but also the anterior one suggests further causes besides an input-deprivation mechanism only. White matter degeneration was also found, more severe in JMD than in AMD. Moreover, functional analysis revealed differences in cortical activation patterns between MD and controls, suggesting neuronal circuit reorganization. Interestingly, attention and oculomotor training allowed better visual performances and correlated to a stronger cortical activation, even of the area normally receiving inputs from lesioned macula.</p>Conclusion<p>In MD, structural and functional changes in cerebral circuits and visual pathway can happen, involving both cerebral volume and activation patterns. These modifications, possibly due to neuronal plasticity (already observed and described for several brain areas), can allow patients to compensate for macular damage and gives therapeutic perspectives which could be achievable through an association between oculomotor training and biochemical stimulation of neuronal plasticity.</p>

<p>With recent technological advances in microscopy and image acquisition of tissue sections, further developments of tools are required for viewing, transforming, and analyzing the ever-increasing amounts of high-resolution data produced. In the field of neuroscience, histological images of whole rodent brain sections are commonly used for investigating brain connections as well as cellular and molecular organization in the normal and diseased brain, but present a problem for the typical neuroscientist with no or limited programming experience in terms of the pre- and post-processing steps needed for analysis. To meet this need we have designed Nutil, an open access and stand-alone executable software that enables automated transformations, post-processing, and analyses of 2D section images using multi-core processing (OpenMP). The software is written in C++ for efficiency, and provides the user with a clean and easy graphical user interface for specifying the input and output parameters. Nutil currently contains four separate tools: (1) A transformation toolchain named “Transform” that allows for rotation, mirroring and scaling, resizing, and renaming of very large tiled tiff images. (2) “TiffCreator” enables the generation of tiled TIFF images from other image formats such as PNG and JPEG. (3) A “Resize” tool completes the preprocessing toolset and allows downscaling of PNG and JPEG images with output in PNG format. (4) The fourth tool is a post-processing method called “Quantifier” that enables the quantification of segmented objects in the context of regions defined by brain atlas maps generated with the QuickNII software based on a 3D reference atlas (mouse or rat). The output consists of a set of report files, point cloud coordinate files for visualization in reference atlas space, and reference atlas images superimposed with color-coded objects. The Nutil software is made available by the Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu) at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nutil/.</p>

<p>Objective: The ability to detect frequency variation is a fundamental skill necessary for speech perception. It is known that musical expertise is associated with a range of auditory perceptual skills, including discriminating frequency change, which suggests the neural encoding of spectral features can be enhanced by musical training. In this study, we measured auditory cortical responses to frequency change in musicians to examine the relationships between N1/P2 responses and behavioral performance/musical training.</p><p>Methods: Behavioral and electrophysiological data were obtained from professional musicians and age-matched non-musician participants. Behavioral data included frequency discrimination detection thresholds for no threshold-equalizing noise (TEN), +5, 0, and −5 signal-to-noise ratio settings. Auditory-evoked responses were measured using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) system in response to frequency changes in ongoing pure tones consisting of 250 and 4,000 Hz, and the magnitudes of frequency change were 10%, 25% or 50% from the base frequencies. N1 and P2 amplitudes and latencies as well as dipole source activation in the left and right hemispheres were measured for each condition.</p><p>Results: Compared to the non-musician group, behavioral thresholds in the musician group were lower for frequency discrimination in quiet conditions only. The scalp-recorded N1 amplitudes were modulated as a function of frequency change. P2 amplitudes in the musician group were larger than in the non-musician group. Dipole source analysis showed that P2 dipole activity to frequency changes was lateralized to the right hemisphere, with greater activity in the musician group regardless of the hemisphere side. Additionally, N1 amplitudes to frequency changes were positively related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination while enhanced P2 amplitudes were associated with a longer duration of musical training.</p><p>Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that auditory cortical potentials evoked by frequency change are related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination in musicians. Larger P2 amplitudes in musicians compared to non-musicians reflects musical training-induced neural plasticity.</p>

<p>Objective: Many pieces of research have focused on pain within individuals, but little attention has been paid to whether pain can change an individual’s empathic ability and affect social relationships. The purpose of this study is to explore how chronic low back pain changes empathy.</p><p>Methods: Twenty-four chronic low back pain patients and 22 healthy controls were recruited. We set up an experimental pain-exposed model for each healthy subject. All subjects received a painful-empathic magnetic resonance scan. After the scan, all subjects rated the pain intensity and multiple empathy-related indicators. The clinical assessment scale was the 20-item Basic Empathy Scale in Adults.</p><p>Result: The chronic low back pain patients reported lower scores on the total scores of BES-A, the subscale scores of emotional disconnection and cognitive empathy, and the discomfort rating. The fMRI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were multiple abnormal brain pathways centered on the anterior insula. The DTI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were reduced fractional anisotropy values in the corpus callosum, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left anterior corona radiate (ACR).</p><p>Conclusion: Our study found that patients with chronic low back pain have impaired empathy ability. The abnormal functional connectivity of multiple brain networks, multiple damaged white matter tracts, and the lower behavioral scores in chronic low back pain patients supported our findings.</p>

<p>Glia, a non-excitable cell type once considered merely as the connective tissue between neurons, is nowadays acknowledged for its essential contribution to multiple physiological processes including learning, memory formation, excitability, synaptic plasticity, ion homeostasis, and energy metabolism. Moreover, as glia are key players in the brain immune system and provide structural and nutritional support for neurons, they are intimately involved in multiple neurological disorders. Recent advances have demonstrated that glial cells, specifically microglia and astroglia, are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While there is compelling evidence for glial modulation of synaptic formation and regulation that affect neuronal signal processing and activity, in this manuscript we will review recent findings on neuronal activity that affect glial function, specifically during neurodegenerative disorders. We will discuss the nature of each glial malfunction, its specificity to each disorder, overall contribution to the disease progression and assess its potential as a future therapeutic target.</p>

<p>Pericytes play a central role in regulating the structure and function of capillaries in the brain. However, molecular mechanisms that drive pericyte proliferation and differentiation are unclear. In our study, we immunostained NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-deficient and wild-type littermate mice and observed that NLRP3 deficiency reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-positive pericytes and collagen type IV immunoreactive vasculature in the brain. In Western blot analysis, PDGFRβ and CD13 proteins in isolated cerebral microvessels from the NLRP3-deficient mouse brain were decreased. We further treated cultured pericytes with NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, and demonstrated that NLRP3 inhibition attenuated cell proliferation but did not induce apoptosis. NLRP3 inhibition also decreased protein levels of PDGFRβ and CD13 in cultured pericytes. On the contrary, treatments with IL-1β, the major product of NLRP3-contained inflammasome, increased protein levels of PDGFRβ, and CD13 in cultured cells. The alteration of PDGFRβ and CD13 protein levels were correlated with the phosphorylation of AKT. Inhibition of AKT reduced both protein markers and abolished the effect of IL-1β activation in cultured pericytes. Thus, NLRP3 activation might be essential to maintain pericytes in the healthy brain through phosphorylating AKT. The potential adverse effects on the cerebral vascular pericytes should be considered in clinical therapies with NLRP3 inhibitors.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00256">Expression and Function of GABA Receptors in Myelinating Cells</a></h4>

<p>Myelin facilitates the fast transmission of nerve impulses and provides metabolic support to axons. Differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and Schwann cell (SC) precursors is critical for myelination during development and myelin repair in demyelinating disorders. Myelination is tightly controlled by neuron-glia communication and requires the participation of a wide repertoire of signals, including neurotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, adenosine, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and it is also present in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The composition and function of GABA receptors (GABARs) are well studied in neurons, while their nature and role in glial cells are still incipient. Recent studies demonstrate that GABA-mediated signaling mechanisms play relevant roles in OPC and SC precursor development and function, and stand out the implication of GABARs in oligodendrocyte (OL) and SC maturation and myelination. In this review, we highlight the evidence supporting the novel role of GABA with an emphasis on the molecular identity of the receptors expressed in these glial cells and the possible signaling pathways involved in their actions. GABAergic signaling in myelinating cells may have potential implications for developing novel reparative therapies in demyelinating diseases.</p>

<p>The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) system plays a role in many physiological processes including reproduction and lactation. However, research regarding the function of MCH on different aspects of the reproductive function lags, due in part to a lack of validated genetic models with which to interrogate the system. This is particularly true in the case of female reproduction, as the anatomy and function of the MCH system is not well-characterized in the female mouse. We set out to determine whether the commercially available Pmch-Cre transgenic mouse line is a viable model to study the role of MCH neurons in distinct female reproductive states. We found that Pmch is transiently expressed in several nuclei of the rostral forebrain at the end of lactation. This includes the medial subdivision of the medial preoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the ventral subdivision of the lateral septum, the anterodorsal preoptic nucleus and the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The Pmch expression in these sites, however, does not reliably induce Cre expression in the Pmch-Cre (BAC) transgenic mouse, making this line an inadequate model with which to study the role of MCH in behavioral and/or neuroendocrine adaptations of lactation. We also contribute to the general knowledge of the anatomy of the murine MCH system by showing that lactation-induced Pmch expression in the rostral forebrain is mostly observed in GABAergic (VGAT) neurons, in contrast to the typical MCH neurons of the tuberal and posterior hypothalamus which are glutamatergic (VGLUT2).</p>

<p>The high synaptic density in the nervous system results from the ability of neurites to branch. Neuronal cell surface molecules play central roles during neurite branch formation. The underlying mechanisms of surface molecule activity have often been elucidated using invertebrates with simple nervous systems. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurite branching in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We discuss how cell surface receptor complexes link to and modulate actin dynamics to regulate dendritic and axonal branch formation. The mechanisms of neurite branching are often coupled with other neural circuit developmental processes, such as synapse formation and axon guidance, via the same cell-cell surface molecular interactions. We also cover ectopic and sex-specific neurite branching in C. elegans in an attempt to illustrate the importance of these studies in contributing to our understanding of conserved cell surface molecule regulation of neurite branch formation.</p>

<p>The evolution of the brain in apes and man followed a joint pathway stemming from common ancestors 5–10 million years ago. However, although apparently sharing similar organization and neurochemical properties, association areas of the isocortex remain one of the cornerstones of what sets humans aside from other primates. Brodmann’s area 44, the area of Broca, is known for its implication in speech, and thus indirectly is a key mark of human uniqueness. This latero-caudal part of the frontal lobe shows a marked functional asymmetry in humans, and takes part in other complex functions, including learning and imitation, tool use, music and contains the mirror neuron system (MNS). Since the main features in the cytoarchitecture of Broca’s area remains relatively constant in hominids, including in our closest relative, the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, investigations on the finer structure, cellular organization, connectivity and eventual asymmetry of area 44 have a direct bearing on the understanding of the neural mechanisms at the base of our language. The semi-automated image analysis technology that we employed in the current study showed that the structure of the cortical layers of the chimpanzee contains elements of asymmetry that are discussed in relation to the corresponding human areas and the putative resulting disparity of function.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00048">The Melanocortin System in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) and Its Role in Appetite Control</a></h4>

<p>The melanocortin system is a key neuroendocrine network involved in the control of food intake and energy homeostasis in vertebrates. Within the hypothalamus, the system comprises two main distinct neuronal cell populations that express the neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin (POMC; anorexigenic) or agouti-related protein (AGRP; orexigenic). Both bind to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in higher order neurons that control both food intake and energy expenditure. This system is relatively well-conserved among vertebrates. However, in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), the salmonid-specific fourth round whole-genome duplication led to the presence of several paralog genes which might result in divergent functions of the duplicated genes. In the current study, we report the first comprehensive comparative identification and characterization of Mc4r and extend the knowledge of Pomc and Agrp in appetite control in Atlantic salmon. In silico analysis revealed multiple paralogs for mc4r (a1, a2, b1, and b2) in the Atlantic salmon genome and confirmed the paralogs previously described for pomc (a1, a2, and b) and agrp (1 and 2). All Mc4r paralogs are relatively well-conserved with the human homolog, sharing at least 63% amino acid sequence identity. We analyzed the mRNA expression of mc4r, pomc, and agrp genes in eight brain regions of Atlantic salmon post-smolt under two feeding states: normally fed and fasted for 4 days. The mc4ra2 and b1 mRNAs were predominantly and equally abundant in the hypothalamus and telencephalon, the mc4rb2 in the hypothalamus, and a1 in the telencephalon. All pomc genes were highly expressed in the pituitary, followed by the hypothalamus and saccus vasculosus. The agrp genes showed a completely different expression pattern from each other, with prevalent expression of the agrp1 in the hypothalamus and agrp2 in the telencephalon. Fasting did not induce any significant changes in the mRNA level of mc4r, agrp, or pomc paralogs in the hypothalamus or in other highly expressed regions between fed and fasted states. The identification and wide distribution of multiple paralogs of mc4r, pomc, and agrp in Atlantic salmon brain provide new insights and give rise to new questions of the melanocortin system in the appetite regulation in Atlantic salmon.</p>

<p>The microtubule-associated protein tau is closely correlated with hypometabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). α-lipoic acid (LA), which is a naturally occurring cofactor in mitochondrial, has been shown to have properties that can inhibit the tau pathology and neuronal damage in our previous research. However, if LA affects glucose metabolism when it reverses tau pathology remains unclear, especially concerning the potential mechanism. Therefore, we make a further study using the P301S mouse model (a tauopathy and AD mouse model which overexpressing fibrillary tau) to gain a clear idea of the aforementioned problems. Here, we found chronic LA administration significantly increased glucose availability by elevating glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), GLUT4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and mRNA level, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein level in P301S mouse brains. Meanwhile, we found that LA also promoted glycolysis by directly upregulating hexokinase (HK) activity, indirectly by increasing proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and DNA repair enzymes (OGG1/2 and MTH1). Further, we found the underlying mechanism of restored glucose metabolism might involve in the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway by LA treatment.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive impairment and later dementia among the elderly. Mounting evidence shows that adverse maternal environments during the fetal development increase the risk of diseases later in life including neurological disorders, and suggests an early origin in the development of AD-related dementia (ADRD) in utero. In the present study, we investigated the impact of antenatal hypoxia and fetal stress on the initiation of AD-related pathology in offspring of 5xFAD mice. We showed that fetal hypoxia significantly reduced brain and body weight in the fetal and the early postnatal period, which recovered in young adult mice. Using spontaneous Y-maze, novel object recognition (NOR), and open field (OF) tasks, we found that antenatal hypoxia exacerbated cognitive decline in offspring of 5xFAD compared with normoxia control. Of interest, fetal hypoxia did not alter intraneuronal soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus in 5xFAD mouse offspring, indicating that antenatal hypoxia increased the vulnerability of the brain to synaptotoxic Aβ in the disease onset later in life. Consistent with the early occurrence of cognitive decline, we found synapse loss but not neuronal death in the cerebral cortex in 5xFAD but not wild-type (WT) offspring exposed to antenatal hypoxia. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that antenatal hypoxia significantly increased microglial number and activation, and reactive astrogliosis in the cerebral cortex in WT offspring. Moreover, antenatal hypoxia resulted in an exacerbated increase of microgliosis and astrogliosis in the early stage of AD in 5xFAD offspring. Together, our study reveals a causative link between fetal stress and the accelerated onset of AD-related pathology, and provides mechanistic insights into the developmental origin of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Increasing evidence indicates Chronic Periodontitis (CP) is a comorbidity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common form of age-related dementia, and for the latter, effective diagnostic and treatment strategies are lacking. Although inflammation is present in both diseases, the exact mechanisms and cross-links between CP and AD are poorly understood; and a direct association between the two has not been reported. This study aimed to identify a direct serum proteins link between AD and CP. Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis was employed to analyze serum samples from 12 CP patients and 12 age-matched controls. Furthermore, to determine the molecular link between CP and AD, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH APPwt cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g-LPS). Ten differentially expressed proteins were identified in CP patients. Among them, nine proteins were up-regulated, and one protein was down-regulated. Of the 10 differentially expressed proteins, five proteins were reportedly involved in the pathology of AD: Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, Clusterin, Triosephosphate isomerase, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITI-H4). Western blotting indicated significantly higher expression of Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, and Clusterin and lower expression of ITI-H4 in the CP group than in the Control group. The serum concentration of Cathepsin B has a good correlation with MMSE scores. Moreover, the protein level of Cathepsin B (but not that of ADAM10 and BACE1) increased significantly along with a prominent increase in Aβ<sub>1–40</sub> and Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> in the cell lysates of P.g-LPS-treated SK-N-SH APPwt cells. Cathepsin B inhibition resulted in a sharp decrease in Aβ<sub>1–40</sub> and Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> in the cell lysates. Furthermore, TNF-α was one of the most important inflammatory cytokines for the P.g-LPS-induced Cathepsin B upregulation in SK-N-SH APPwt cells. These results show that CP and AD share an association, while Cathepsin B could be a key link between the two diseases. The discovery of the identical serum proteins provides a potential mechanism underlying the increased risk of AD in CP patients, which could be critical for elucidating the pathophysiology of AD.</p>

Sensory neurons are activated by physical and chemical stimuli, eliciting sensations such as temperature, touch, pain, and itch. From an evolutionary perspective, sensing danger is essential for organismal survival. Upon infection and injury, immune cells respond to pathogen/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and produce inflammatory mediators that activate sensory neurons through neuro–immune interactions.
