              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-949/v2?src=rss">Indocyanine green based antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in periodontal maintenance patients: a clinico-microbiological study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy for the treatment of periodontitis is being increasingly gaining attention but at present, very limited data are available on the clinical and microbiological outcomes obtained following Indocyanine Green as the photosensitizer in Maintenance patients. The objective was to evaluate the efficiency of Indocyanine(ICG)-green based photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in patients enrolled in maintenance therapy. Methodology: Using a split mouth study design, 24 participants enrolled in the maintenance therapy, having diagnosed as Periodontitis, were randomly subjected to scaling and root planing(SRP). The test group additionally received ICG-based (Aurogreen®, Aurolabs, Madurai, India,1mg/ml) aPDT with an 810nm diode laser. Clinical assessment of Plaque index, modified Sulcus bleeding index, Probing pocket depth, Clinical loss of attachment and microbiological analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and F.nucleatum were performed at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Results: It was observed that although there was no significant difference between the test and control group at baseline and 3 months, there was a statistically significant reduction in the mean values in both the groups at 3 months. Microbiological analysis showed substantial reduction in detection frequency of the bacteria assessed at 3 months in both the groups. Conclusion: Within the limits of the study, ICG-based aPDT did not show additional advantage over SRP alone at 3 months, though it could be a promising treatment modality in maintenance patients in terms of patient comfort and the treatment time taken. More randomised clinical trials should be employed to understand the exact mode of action of ICG based aPDT and its role in treatment of periodontal disease.

                Background Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare neuroinflammatory disease that affects the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure, resulting in symptoms of neuropathy. Case presentation We report a case of a 35-year-old male patient with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a four-day history of progressively increasing headaches associated with right eye pain and double vision. A physical examination showed findings suggestive of abducens nerve palsy. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed subtle asymmetric thickening of the right cavernous sinus, which prompted further investigation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scan showed intensely enhanced soft tissue thickening in the right cavernous sinus region, slightly extending to the right orbital apex, which caused enlargement of the cavernous sinus and appeared isointense to the adjacent muscles on T1 and T2. The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome was made after the exclusion of all other possible pathologies. The patient received prednisolone therapy; his symptoms improved, and he was discharged after three days. Two weeks later, the patient presented again to the ED with the same symptoms and was treated symptomatically. Conclusions This case highlights a very rare etiology for painful ophthalmoplegia, which is Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Thickening of the cavernous sinus on MRI images with a background history of painful ophthalmoplegia and headache should raise clinician’s suspicion towards the disease. In addition, exclusion of other possible causes is very important, as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion.

                Background: The use of information and communication technology such as telemedicine occupies nowadays a huge place in modern medicine practice all over the world, mainly after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its implementation in Tunisia and other developing countries has achieved little success with low utilization and can be challenging for several reasons. In this study, our aim was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practice of Tunisian medical doctors regarding telemedicine. Methods: This was a cross-sectional web survey, administered to medical doctors in Tunisia in October 2022. Respondents’ level of knowledge of telemedicine was assessed by calculating a knowledge score (0 to 12). Attitude subsections were about perceived telemedicine attributes of relative advantage, compatibility, trial ability and complexity. Results: A total of 243 participants were included. The mean age was 45 ± 9.6 years old, and 57.2% were female, with a mean of 14.3 ± 10.3 years of professional experience. The majority (95.9%) had an average or high level of computer skills. More than half (59.3%) had a poor level of telemedicine knowledge. A good level of knowledge was significantly associated with age category over 50 years (p = 0.02) and with years of experience over 10 (p = 0.03). The majority (89.3%) had a moderate or high score about perceived advantages. The majority (88.5%) accepted use of telemedicine in their future practice. Almost half (46.9%) had practiced telemedicine activities before using a mobile phone (91%) or social media (64%). The principal limitations of applying telemedicine were challenges of organization and implementation, and incomplete patient examination. Conclusions: Although Tunisian doctors’ knowledge and practice of telemedicine were unsatisfactory, their positive attitude and willingness to try it in their future practice were encouraging. There is an urgent need for implementing telemedicine in Tunisia to improve health care coverage in some unprivileged areas.

Protocol for a Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The present protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO under de ID code CRD42023476313, and adheres the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. The complete checklist can be consulted in the extended data section. Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is the most common chronic disease in children worldwide. According to many guidelines topical nasal steroids (TNS) are the first-line treatment for moderate/severe AR in children, nevertheless there is no conclusive evidence about which of them is superior in terms of efficacy and safety, including their impact on child’s growth. Methods We will conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating TNS in the treatment of children with moderate/severe AR. The primary outcome is the efficacy measured with the Total Nasal Symptom Severity Score (TNSS). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, adverse events (AE), and growth velocity. We will search Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO trials database and grey literature resources. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias and the confidence in the estimate (with the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation [GRADE] approach). We will conduct a random-effects NMA to combine the pooled direct and indirect treatment effect estimates for each outcome if adequate data is available and transitivity and coherence assumptions are considered justifiable. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses are planned to evaluate the impact of some potential effect modifiers such as doses, co-intervention with oral antihistamines, the type of AR (intermittent or persistent), sponsorship of the study, the time of outcomes measurement and the risk of bias. We will use GRADE approach to draw conclusions from NMA. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to determine the relative efficacy and safety of the TNS for treatment of children with moderate/severe AR. The results will provide valuable information to assist clinicians, guideline developers, patients, and policy makers about the management of these patients, based on the best available evidence. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO number: CRD42023476313.

                Objectives new-onset relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has rarely been communicated as a side effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (SC2V). Here we report a patient with new-onset RRMS shortly after the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose, which was diagnosed only after a relapse after the third vaccine dose. Case report the patient is a 31 year-old male who developed eye problems 48 days after the second dose of BNT162b2. The symptoms were attributed to eye strain and gradually disappeared without treatment. Further workup was negative. Three months after the third BNT162b2 dose, urinary urgency developed. Eleven months after the third BNT162b2 dose, he developed sensory and visual disturbances that were noticeable post-exercise and progressed and worsened with alcohol and heat. MRI showed typical lesions that met the Barkhof/Tintore criteria for RRMS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed elevated kappa free light chains and positive oligoclonal bands. Because the revised McDonalds criteria were met, RRMS was diagnosed and ocrelizumab was started. Conclusions this case shows that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can trigger new-onset RRMS, the clinical presentation of SC2V-induced multiple sclerosis is similar to multiple sclerosis due to other triggers, and the severity of the relapses may increase with the number of boosters given. Although, rare, a neurologist should be aware of the presumably rare event in which SC2V triggers new-onset multiple sclerosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-942/v1?src=rss">University Dropout: A Systematic Review of the Main Determinant Factors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction This research is a systematic review aimed at synthesizing scientific evidence on the causes of university dropout, focusing on the subcategories of vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects between 2020 and June 2024. Methods Only articles addressing university dropout were considered, analyzing dimensions such as vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects. Articles published in indexed scientific journals with double-blind, double-blind peer, or open reviews between 2020 and June 2024 were included. The main databases used were Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. To assess the risk of bias in qualitative studies, the criteria from the article “Validity criteria for qualitative research: three epistemological strands for the same purpose” were used. For quantitative studies, the criteria from the article “Evaluating survey research in articles published in Library Science journals” were followed. For mixed-method studies, both sets of criteria were combined. Results A total of 23 studies were included: 15 quantitative (65.22%), 3 qualitative (13.04%), and 5 mixed-method (21.74%). All studies (100%) addressed the subcategories of socioeconomic status and institutional aspects. Regarding the academic performance subcategory, 86% of the studies addressed it, while the vocational guidance subcategory was covered by 73.91% of the studies. Conclusions Vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects are crucial for reducing university dropout. Providing adequate professional guidance, academic support, financial assistance, and strong institutional support is fundamental to improving student retention and academic success.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-941/v1?src=rss">The potency and safety of platelet-rich plasma and its therapy protocol for erectile dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a novel treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) that is considered to be a cost-effective option. It has demonstrated positive outcomes and minimal adverse effects. By injecting PRP into the intracavernous tissue, it has the potential to promote angiogenesis and neuroregeneration, leading to a potential permanent improvement in erectile performance. The potency and safety as well as the variety of PRP administration protocols in the treatment of ED are the objectives of this paper. Method Using certain terms, a systematic search was done on three different databases: Science Directs, Scielo, and PubMed. Papers about PRP therapy for EDs within the last decade, be randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and be original studies with freely available full-text content were included in this study. This article omitted letters to the editor, reviews, and editorials regarding PRP and ED. Results Three RCT were included in this studies. The improvement is observed at one month, three months, and six months after the treatment, compared to the baseline. PRP group participants met the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) at a higher percentage than those in the placebo group at both one month and six months. Injection of PRP leads to a superior enhancement in the IIEF-EF score, compared to a placebo, in patients suffering from ED at one month, three months, six months. Conclusion PRP is a proven therapeutic technique that has been shown to greatly enhance ED. Yet, to establish uniform guidelines for PRP in treating erectile dysfunction, further investigation into PRP, particularly in protocol development, is imperative.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-940/v1?src=rss">Integration of democratic values in natural sciences education: A Literature Review of the last 50 Years [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1206/v3?src=rss">Case Report: Tropical sprue, diagnostic challenges of an old but unrecognized disease [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Tropical sprue (TS) is a post-infective disease of the small bowel characterized by a malabsorption syndrome affecting tropics inhabitants and visitors. Diagnosis of TS remains challenging since it can be confused with common diarrheal diseases, especially in non-endemic areas. We report a Tunisian case of latent TS. A 58-year-old male with a history of chronic watery diarrhea, was admitted to the intensive care unit for confusion which was related to a severe metabolic acidosis. Despite the neurological improvement after hydro-electrolytic resuscitation and acid-base disorders correction, the patient continued to have three to five loose stools daily. A nutritional assessment showed a malabsorption syndrome: iron, Vitamin B12and folate deficiencies; normochromic normocytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed duodenal villous atrophy and biopsy confirmed subtotal villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a thickened hyalonalized sub-epithelial basal lamina. Celiac disease was evoked, however the patient did not improve on a gluten-free diet and the celiac serology was negative. On re-interviewing, we discovered that the patient had spent two months in India three years prior. Given the travel history, clinico-biological and histological data TS was highly considered and a good response to a five-month antibiotic course combined to nutritional supplementation supported this diagnosis. Clinico-biological, endoscopic and histological findings were overlapping between TS and other malabsorption diseases, explaining diagnosis difficulties. TS should be systematically discussed in tropics visitors presenting with chronic diarrhea. Improvement after micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies replacement combined to a prolonged antibiotic course supports the diagnosis of TS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-939/v1?src=rss">Effectiveness of men in maternity health (MiM) intervention on male involvement in maternal health care to improve maternal health outcomes in Naypyitaw, Myanmar [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Maternal health care (MHC) is critical for safe motherhood and preventing maternal deaths in Myanmar, but the institutional delivery rates are not yet optimal, increasing preventable maternal deaths. To address this issue, involving men in supporting MHC has been recognized as a strategy to improve MHC outcomes. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of men in maternity health (MiM) intervention on male involvement in MHC and its influence on knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to maternal health and institutional delivery rates in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. Methods This study employed a mixed-methods approach with quantitative surveying of the male partners and qualitative interviewing of both male and female partners and health stakeholders. A 6-month MiM education program on pregnancy complications, antenatal care, delivery care, and birth preparedness was provided to the intervention group. Before and after the intervention, comparisons between intervention and control groups were made. Results The socio-demographic characteristics of male partners were comparable between the intervention and control groups during the pre-intervention assessment. Before MiM intervention, notable differences in male partners’ knowledge, attitudes, birth preparedness and complication readiness practices regarding MHC were not evident between these two groups. After completing the MiM, significant score improvement, including higher ID rates compared to the control group (p<0.001), was observed. The acceptability and feasibility of the MiM program were contributed by positive responses from qualitative findings, highlighting remarkable changes in the perspectives of male partners in supporting MHC. However, challenges, including financial limitations, cultural influences and a shortage of trained personnel, were encountered. Conclusion The MiM program effectively promotes male involvement in MHC, leading to improved MHC outcomes. The MiM intervention offers a promising, evidence-based model to enhance ID rates in Myanmar, requiring tailored approaches to address cultural and financial factors.

                Background There are a variety of published standard methods and water chemistry recommendations for zebrafish (Danio rerio) husbandry, but empirical evidence for their justification is often lacking, as is information on some variables that have important biological effects on fish. Importantly, these different recommendations could contribute to variability in results and fish welfare between or within institutions. Methods Here we document the current range of water chemistry used by various research institutions around the world and report initial findings on their effects on the development and growth of zebrafish. Over 40 institutes responded to a survey that revealed a large variation in water chemistry used for zebrafish husbandry including differences in the set-points and acceptable ranges for temperature, pH and conductivity. In subsequent experiments, zebrafish (D. rerio, WIK) embryos/larvae exposed to a large range of salt concentrations (50μM to 10mM Na+ or 30 – 2500 μS/cm) and CO2 levels (400 – 8,000 μatm). Results Larvae exposed to the lowest salt concentration (5 μM Na+ or < 30μS/cm) had a slower response to touch and their swim bladders were not inflated. Larvae exposed to 5-100 μM Na+ were 5 % shorter in total body length than those exposed to higher salt concentrations (>100 μM Na+). Zebrafish embryo/larvae exposed to intermediate pCO2 values (~2000 μatm) were 1 to 3.5% longer than those exposed to either ambient (400 μatm) or higher (4000 μatm) pCO2, but pCO2 did not affect developmental endpoints up to 4 dpf. Conclusions Overall, we highlight the magnitude of variation in water chemistry used within zebrafish research and provide some empirical evidence to show that not all of these water conditions might be optimal for developing zebrafish and reproducibility of research, although further research is necessary to determine longer-term effects of water chemistry on older larvae, juveniles and adults.

                Purpose This study examines the key factors affecting consumers’ purchases of environmentally friendly products in Malaysia. Originality Although the Malaysian government has put in effort and assistance to promote the use of environmentally friendly products, the purchase of environmentally friendly products remains low, as the costs of environmentally friendly products are still more expensive than those of non-energy efficient products. This study is one of the pioneering studies in developing countries that examined the purchase of environmentally friendly products after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology Three hundred participants from four developed states in Malaysia with the highest awareness of environmental protection and environmentally friendly products were approached. The survey was administered to the respondents in public places. Findings Malaysians’ purchase intentions towards environmentally friendly products are affected by confidence, family income, and attitude. In contrast, this study found no significant positive effect of financial subsidies on purchase intention towards environmentally friendly products.

                Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are substantial contributors to the global disease burden and mortality. The ANRIL gene polymorphism rs1333040 has been implicated in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease; however, its role in the Vietnamese population remains unclear. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 185 Vietnamese patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and clinical data, medical history, and biochemical parameters were recorded. ANRIL SNP rs1333040 was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. Genotype frequencies were assessed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and their association with cardiovascular risk factors. Results The ‘Normal’ BMI (Body Mass Index) category was the largest segment, comprising 77.84% of the sample. Key cardiovascular risk factors identified among patients with AMI included hypertension (83.8%), dyslipidemia (80.0%), smoking (50.0%), and diabetes mellitus (33.8%). Clinical presentation showed that 55.0% of patients had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 45.0% had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Lipid profile abnormalities were significant; 60.0% had decreased High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C), 53.8% had elevated triglycerides, 37.5% had elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C), and 36.3% had elevated total cholesterol levels. Genetic analysis focused on the rs1333040 polymorphism of the ANRIL gene, with the most common genotype being TT (58.8%), followed by CT (33.7%) and CC (7.5%). Allele frequencies were 75.6% for T and 24.4% for C. This study is the clinical implications of ANRIL polymorphisms in Vietnamese patients with CAD and AMI. Significant genotype-phenotype associations were observed, underscoring the importance of incorporating genetic screening for enhanced prognostic capabilities and personalized therapeutic decisions. Further research focused on delineating the precise genetic underpinnings of complex cardiovascular diseases in diverse populations is warranted.

                Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60–90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001). Conclusions The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.

                Background The influenza virus is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes seasonal outbreaks and occasionally, unpredictable pandemics with high morbidity and mortality rates. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of drugs with potential antiviral activity against all types of influenza strains, including resistant strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral agents. Methods The synthesis of new oseltamivir carboxamides with amino acids and the subsequent synthesis of hybrid molecules with hydroxamic acid were considered. Two series are presented as series one; oseltamivir carboxamides with L-serine, L-isoleucine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and series two included hydroxamates of series one. This approach may provide promising candidates with potential anti-influenza activity. The in vitro cytotoxic activity against Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), type (NBL-2) - CCL-34 cells using the MTT ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the investigated compounds. The percent inhibition of neuraminidase was plotted against concentrations and the IC50 values were calculated by non-linear logistic curve fitting. Results The compounds were subjected to molecular docking using the GOLD suite (version 5.7.1) to predict the binding affinities for neuraminidase (3CL0). The docking scores are presented as PLP fitness and are comparable to those of oseltamivir. Oseltamivir-Phenylalanine recorded the highest docking score (72.23 kcal/mol), while, oseltamivir acid was recorded (56.24 kcal/mol). The ADMET parameters were generated using the Swiss ADME server to predict successful candidates with reasonable oral absorption and safety margins. All compounds are safer than oseltamivir and their IC50 values for neuraminidase inhibition were variable. The hybrids showed a lower percentage of viable cells. Oseltamivir-phenylalanine had the highest inhibitory activity against neuraminidase (3.03 μM), when compared with oseltamivir (67.22 μM). Conclusion Oseltamivir-phenylalanine showed remarkable and very significant activity, and the hybrid molecules were surprisingly less effective on neuraminidase than oseltamivir carboxamides.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background Auditors during COVID-19 experienced an unprecedented situation where normal audit activities became difficult to conduct. Moreover, COVID-19 forced auditors to introduce a new audit approach, “remote auditing,” which was not common in most audit firms and required the adoption of more advanced technologies. Overall, auditors during COVID-19 needed both cognitive and technical factors to deliver high-quality audits. Despite the challenges, research into how auditors dealt with these issues is limited, presenting an intriguing area of study. Methods This dataset provides insights into the Saudi auditor’s experience and beliefs regarding audit activities during COVID-19. Through an online survey, researchers collected data from 193 out of 417 registered auditors with the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). The survey assessed the auditors’ self-efficacy in conducting audits during the pandemic, exploring its sources and potential moderating factors. Specifically, the dataset includes responses on eight items related to self-efficacy, 19 items covering the four common sources of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological/emotional states), and six items assessing virtual audit competency. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information valuable for researchers analysing the relationship between auditor self-efficacy, its sources, and other influencing factors. Conclusions Overall, the dataset included in this article may serve a broader audience and be useful in improving several stakeholders’ understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on auditors and how auditors assess their ability to adapt to the COVID-19 consequences. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the need for auditors to adapt to new circumstances and adopt innovative approaches during challenging times, thereby ensuring the delivery of high-quality audits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-934/v1?src=rss">Assessment of early neonatal practices to prevent hypothermia ; A comparative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                This research explores the application of quadratic polynomials in Python for advanced data analysis. The study demonstrates how quadratic models can effectively capture nonlinear relationships in complex datasets by leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Pandas. The methodology involves fitting quadratic polynomials to the data using least-squares regression and evaluating the model fit using the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The results highlight the strong performance of the quadratic polynomial fit, as evidenced by high R-squared values, indicating the model’s ability to explain a substantial proportion of the data variability. Comparisons with linear and cubic models further underscore the quadratic model’s balance between simplicity and precision for many practical applications. The study also acknowledges the limitations of quadratic polynomials and proposes future research directions to enhance their accuracy and efficiency for diverse data analysis tasks. This research bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, providing an accessible Python-based tool for leveraging quadratic polynomials in data analysis.

                Background Heat polymerized acrylic (HPA) resins are known to have high porosity that contributes to increased surface roughness and microcrack formation in stress areas. This facilitates the attachment and growth of polymicrobial biofilms contributing to increased antimicrobial resistance. Many research had been carried out on avocado seeds, but no research that studies the effect of avocado seeds on denture-plaque microorganism biofilm on HPA resin has been found. Methods This study used 144 samples (n=144), namely HPA resin discs covered with mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms consisting of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Staphylococcus aureus. The discs were soaked for 8 hours in the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% avocado seed extract, positive control (alkaline peroxide), and negative control (aquadest). Each disc was shaken with a vortex mixer for 1 minute, and 100 μL was added into 96-well microplates with three times repetition and incubated for 24 hours. The inhibition values were determined from the percentage inhibition value formula which required absorption values from a microplate reader (595 nm). Results In this research, it was found that the MBIC50 of avocado seed extract against the mono-species of C. albicans (5%), C. glabrata (5%), A. odontolyticus (15%), S. gordonii (15%), S. aureus (10%), while against the biofilm was 20%. There was a significant effect of soaking HPA resin in avocado seed extract of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% on the inhibition of mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms of denture-plaque microorganisms with a value of p<0.001 (p<0.05). Conclusion The MBIC50 of avocado seed extract in polymicrobial biofilm group was higher than that in the mono-species biofilm groups. Although alkaline peroxide showed higher inhibition value than that of the MBIC50 in polymicrobial biofilm group, 20% avocado seed extract was effective in inhibiting polymicrobial biofilm because it was able to inhibit more than 50% polymicrobial biofilm.

                <p>by Ayush Aggarwal, Ayesha Nasreen, Babita Sharma, Sarthak Sahoo, Keerthic Aswin, Mohammed Faruq, Rajesh Pandey, Mohit K. Jolly, Abhyudai Singh, Rajesh S. Gokhale, Vivek T. Natarajan</p>

The ultraviolet (UV) radiation triggers a pigmentation response in human skin, wherein, melanocytes rapidly activate divergent maturation and proliferation programs. Using single-cell sequencing, we demonstrate that these 2 programs are segregated in distinct subpopulations in melanocytes of human and zebrafish skin. The coexistence of these 2 cell states in cultured melanocytes suggests possible cell autonomy. Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test reveals that the initial establishment of these states is stochastic. Tracking of pigmenting cells ascertains that the stochastically acquired state is faithfully propagated in the progeny. A systemic approach combining single-cell multi-omics (RNA+ATAC) coupled to enhancer mapping with H3K27 acetylation successfully identified state-specific transcriptional networks. This comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a gene regulatory network (GRN) that under the influence of noise, establishes a bistable system of pigmentation and proliferation at the population level. This GRN recapitulates melanocyte behaviour in response to external cues that reinforce either of the states. Our work highlights that inherent stochasticity within melanocytes establishes dedicated states, and the mature state is sustained by selective enhancers mark through histone acetylation. While the initial cue triggers a proliferation response, the continued signal activates and maintains the pigmenting subpopulation via epigenetic imprinting. Thereby our study provides the basis of coexistence of distinct populations which ensures effective pigmentation response while preserving the self-renewal capacity.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002768">Slow-wave sleep drives sleep-dependent renormalization of synaptic AMPA receptor levels in the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianfeng Liu, Niels Niethard, Yu Lun, Stoyan Dimitrov, Ingrid Ehrlich, Jan Born, Manfred Hallschmid</p>

According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), sleep serves to renormalize synaptic connections that have been potentiated during the prior wake phase due to ongoing encoding of information. SHY focuses on glutamatergic synaptic strength and has been supported by numerous studies examining synaptic structure and function in neocortical and hippocampal networks. However, it is unknown whether synaptic down-regulation during sleep occurs in the hypothalamus, i.e., a pivotal center of homeostatic regulation of bodily functions including sleep itself. We show that sleep, in parallel with the synaptic down-regulation in neocortical networks, down-regulates the levels of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the hypothalamus of rats. Most robust decreases after sleep were observed at both sites for AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit. Comparing the effects of selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and total sleep deprivation, we moreover provide experimental evidence that slow-wave sleep (SWS) is the driving force of the down-regulation of AMPARs in hypothalamus and neocortex, with no additional contributions of REM sleep or the circadian rhythm. SWS-dependent synaptic down-regulation was not linked to EEG slow-wave activity. However, spindle density during SWS predicted relatively increased GluA1 subunit levels in hypothalamic synapses, which is consistent with the role of spindles in the consolidation of memory. Our findings identify SWS as the main driver of the renormalization of synaptic strength during sleep and suggest that SWS-dependent synaptic renormalization is also implicated in homeostatic control processes in the hypothalamus.

                <p>by Hao Li, Hongping Yu, Delin Liu, Peng Liao, Chuan Gao, Jian Zhou, Jialun Mei, Yao Zong, Peng Ding, Meng Yao, Bingqi Wang, Yafei Lu, Yigang Huang, Youshui Gao, Changqing Zhang, Minghao Zheng, Junjie Gao</p>

Cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer has recently been shown to play a role in maintaining physiological functions of cell. We previously illustrated that mitochondrial transfer within osteocyte dendritic network regulates bone tissue homeostasis. However, the mechanism of triggering this process has not been explored. Here, we showed that stressed osteocytes in mice release adenosine diphosphate (ADP), resulting in triggering mitochondrial transfer from healthy osteocytes to restore the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and to alleviate reactive oxygen species accumulation. Furthermore, we identified that P2Y2 and P2Y6 transduced the ADP signal to regulate osteocyte mitochondrial transfer. We showed that mitochondrial metabolism is impaired in aged osteocytes, and there were more extracellular nucleotides release into the matrix in aged cortical bone due to compromised membrane integrity. Conditioned medium from aged osteocytes triggered mitochondrial transfer between osteocytes to enhance the energy metabolism. Together, using osteocyte as an example, this study showed new insights into how extracellular ADP triggers healthy cells to rescue energy metabolism crisis in stressed cells via mitochondrial transfer in tissue homeostasis.

                Background- Cervical spondylosis is a disease that is caused by the vitiation of only one bodily humor (dosha) (Vataja nanatmaja). The vata bodily humor (dosa) becomes vitiated and settles in the cervical (manya), creating neck pain and stiffness, which ultimately led to cervical spondylosis. Cervical spondylosis can be examined primarily under the generalization of cervical spondylosis because both conditions have many of the same symptoms. A disorder known as cervical spondylosis, which affects the cervical vertebra, is a degenerative condition of the cervical spine. In addition to having negative effects on a person's health, the disease also significantly lowers the quality of life and daily activities. Ayurveda suggested a treatment for cervical spondylosis to avoid and control the condition. There are numerous therapies in Ayurveda, and Oil administration through the nostrils has been given a significant role in upper clavicular disease (Uurdhvajatrugata roga). Oil administration through nostril therapy has been specifically recommended by Acharya Charka for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. The purpose of certain ayurvedic approaches in the management of cervical spondylosis. Methods: - 60 patients will be split into two groups for this investigation. A tinospora cardifolia and a group of drugs (Mashadi oil) will be given to the group through the nostrils for seven days at a dose of eight drops. The same will be used for the other 30 patients, i.e., group B with Ricinus Communis and a group of drugs (Erandadi oil) administered through the nostrils. Expected result: The result will be assessed on the baseline of objective parameters, and data will be compared after the treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97487">Target-specific requirements for RNA interference can arise through restricted RNA amplification despite the lack of specialized pathways</a></h4>

              
                Since double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference (RNAi). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that (1) changing <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, (2) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and (3) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84955">Neural population dynamics underlying evidence accumulation in multiple rat brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence to make decisions is a core cognitive function. Previous studies have tended to estimate accumulation using either neural or behavioral data alone. Here we develop a unified framework for modeling stimulus-driven behavior and multi-neuron activity simultaneously. We applied our method to choices and neural recordings from three rat brain regions - the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the frontal orienting fields (FOF), and the anterior-dorsal striatum (ADS) - while subjects performed a pulse-based accumulation task. Each region was best described by a distinct accumulation model, which all differed from the model that best described the animal's choices. FOF activity was consistent with an accumulator where early evidence was favored while the ADS reflected near perfect accumulation. Neural responses within an accumulation framework unveiled a distinct association between each brain region and choice. Choices were better predicted from all regions using a comprehensive, accumulation-based framework and different brain regions were found to differentially reflect choice-related accumulation signals: FOF and ADS both reflected choice but ADS showed more instances of decision vacillation. Previous studies relating neural data to behaviorally-inferred accumulation dynamics have implicitly assumed that individual brain regions reflect the whole-animal level accumulator. Our results suggest that different brain regions represent accumulated evidence in dramatically different ways and that accumulation at the whole-animal level may be constructed from a variety of neural-level accumulators.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96678">Released bacterial ATP shapes local and systemic inflammation during abdominal sepsis</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed <i>E. coli</i> bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95555">Discovery of the 1-naphthylamine biodegradation pathway reveals a broad-substrate-spectrum enzyme catalyzing 1-naphthylamine glutamylation</a></h4>

              
                1-Naphthylamine (1NA), which is harmful to human and aquatic animals, has been used widely in the manufacturing of dyes, pesticides, and rubber antioxidants. Nevertheless, little is known about its environmental behavior and no bacteria have been reported to use it as the growth substrate. Herein, we describe a pathway for 1NA degradation in the isolate <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain JS3066, determine the structure and mechanism of the enzyme NpaA1 that catalyzes the initial reaction, and reveal how the pathway evolved. From genetic and enzymatic analysis, a five gene-cluster encoding a dioxygenase system was determined to be responsible for the initial steps in 1NA degradation through glutamylation of 1NA. The γ-glutamylated 1NA was subsequently oxidized to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene which was further degraded by the well-established pathway of naphthalene degradation via catechol. A glutamine synthetase-like (GS-like) enzyme (NpaA1) initiates 1NA glutamylation, and this enzyme exhibits a broad substrate selectivity toward a variety of anilines and naphthylamine derivatives. Structural analysis revealed that the aromatic residues in the 1NA entry tunnel and the V201 site in the large substrate-binding pocket significantly influence NpaA1’s substrate preferences. The findings enhance understanding of degrading polycyclic aromatic amines, and will also enable the application of bioremediation at naphthylamine contaminated sites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91757">Circulating platelets modulate oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation during remyelination</a></h4>

              
                Revealing unknown cues that regulate oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) function in remyelination is important to optimise the development of regenerative therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Platelets are present in chronic non-remyelinated lesions of MS and an increase in circulating platelets has been described in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, an animal model for MS. However, the contribution of platelets to remyelination remains unexplored. Here we show platelet aggregation in proximity to OPCs in areas of experimental demyelination. Partial depletion of circulating platelets impaired OPC differentiation and remyelination, without altering blood-brain barrier stability and neuroinflammation. Transient exposure to platelets enhanced OPC differentiation in vitro, whereas sustained exposure suppressed this effect. In a mouse model of thrombocytosis (<i>Calr<sup>+/-</sup></i>), there was a sustained increase in platelet aggregation together with a reduction of newly-generated oligodendrocytes following toxin-induced demyelination. These findings reveal a complex bimodal contribution of platelet to remyelination and provide insights into remyelination failure in MS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91012">Genetic code expansion, click chemistry, and light-activated PI3K reveal details of membrane protein trafficking downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases</a></h4>

              
                Ligands such as insulin, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and nerve growth factor (NGF) initiate signals at the cell membrane by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Along with G-protein-coupled receptors, RTKs are the main platforms for transducing extracellular signals into intracellular signals. Studying RTK signaling has been a challenge, however, due to the multiple signaling pathways to which RTKs typically are coupled, including MAP/ERK, PLCγ, and Class 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). The multi-pronged RTK signaling has been a barrier to isolating the effects of any one downstream pathway. Here, we used optogenetic activation of PI3K to decouple its activation from other RTK signaling pathways. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the plasma membrane in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92794">FBXO24 deletion causes abnormal accumulation of membraneless electron-dense granules in sperm flagella and male infertility</a></h4>

              
                Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless electron-dense structures rich in RNAs and proteins, and involved in various cellular processes. Two RNP granules in male germ cells, intermitochondrial cement and the chromatoid body (CB), are associated with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and are required for transposon silencing and spermatogenesis. Other RNP granules in male germ cells, the reticulated body and CB remnants, are also essential for spermiogenesis. In this study, we disrupted FBXO24, a testis-enriched F-box protein, in mice and found numerous membraneless electron-dense granules accumulated in sperm flagella. <i>Fbxo24</i> knockout (KO) mice exhibited malformed flagellar structures, impaired sperm motility, and male infertility, likely due to the accumulation of abnormal granules. The amount and localization of known RNP granule-related proteins were not disrupted in <i>Fbxo24</i> KO mice, suggesting that the accumulated granules were distinct from known RNP granules. Further studies revealed that RNAs and two importins, IPO5 and KPNB1, abnormally accumulated in <i>Fbxo24</i> KO spermatozoa and that FBXO24 could ubiquitinate IPO5. In addition, IPO5 and KPNB1 were recruited to stress granules, RNP complexes, when cells were treated with oxidative stress or a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest that FBXO24 is involved in the degradation of IPO5, disruption of which may lead to the accumulation of abnormal RNP granules in sperm flagella.

">Distinct roles of prefrontal cortex neurons in set shifting</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility, the ability to adjust behavioral strategies in response to changing environmental contingencies, requires adaptive processing of internal states and contextual cues to guide goal-oriented behavior, and is dependent on prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions. However, the neurophysiological underpinning of how the PFC supports cognitive flexibility is not well understood and has been under active investigation. We recorded spiking activity from single PFC neurons in mice performing the attentional set-shifting task, where mice learned to associate different contextually relevant sensory stimuli to reward. We identified subgroups of PFC neurons encoding task context, choice and trial outcome. Putative fast-spiking neurons were more involved in representing outcome and choice than putative regular-spiking neurons. Regression model further revealed that task context and trial outcome modulated the activity of choice-encoding neurons in rule-dependent and cell type-dependent manners. Together, our data provide new evidence to elucidate PFC's role in cognitive flexibility, suggesting differential cell type-specific engagement during set shifting, and that both contextual rule representation and trial outcome monitoring underlie PFC's unique capacity to support flexible behavioral switching.

                Adolescence is a critical period for neural changes, including maturation of the brain's cognitive networks, but also a period of increased vulnerability to psychopathology. It is well accepted that the brain is functionally organized into multiple interacting networks and extensive literature has demonstrated that the spatial and functional organization of these networks shows major age-related changes across the lifespan, but particularly during adolescence. Yet, there is limited option for a reference functional brain atlas derived from typically developing adolescents, which is especially problematic as the reliable and reproducible identification of functional brain networks crucially depends on the use of such reference functional atlases. In this context, we utilized resting-state functional MRI data from a total of 1,391 typically developing youth between the ages of 8 and 17 years to create a new adolescent-specific reference atlas of functional brain networks. We further investigated the impact of age and sex on these networks. Using a multiscale individual component clustering algorithm (MICCA), we identified 24 reliable functional brain networks, classified within six domains: Default-Mode (5 networks), Control (4 networks), Salience (3 networks), Attention (4 networks), Somatomotor (5 networks), and Visual (3 networks). We identified reliable and large effects of age on the spatial topography of these majority of networks, as well as on the functional network connectivity (FNC) between networks. The DMN showed reduced FNC with the other networks with older age. Sex effects were not as widespread. No significant sex-by-age interactions were detected. Overall, we created a novel brain atlas, named Dev-Atlas, focused on a typically developing sample, with the hope that this atlas can be used in future independent developmental network neuroscience studies. Dev-Atlas is freely available to the research community.

">Nicotine engages a VTA-NAc feedback loop to inhibit amygdala-projecting dopamine neurons and induce anxiety.</a></h4>

              
                Nicotine activates ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic (DA) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to drive its reinforcing effects. Simultaneously, it inhibits those projecting to the amygdala (Amg) to mediate anxiety through a process that remains unknown. Here we show that NAc- and Amg-projecting DA neurons respond with similar polarities to ethanol and nicotine, suggesting a shared network-based mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of these otherwise pharmacologically-distinct drugs. Selective activation of NAc-projecting DA neurons, using genetic or optogenetic strategies, produced inhibition of Amg-projecting DA neurons, through a GABAergic feedback loop. Furthermore, optogenetically silencing this feedback loop prevented nicotine from inducing both inhibition of DA neurons and anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, nicotine-induced inhibition of the VTA-Amg DA pathway results from a VTA-NAc inhibitory feedback loop, mediating anxiety.

">A neural basis for mutant ATAXIN-1 induced respiratory dysfunction in mouse models of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1) gene, is characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and death from compromised swallowing and respiration. To delineate specific cell types that contribute to respiratory dysfunction, we utilized the floxed conditional knock-in f-ATXN1[146Q/2Q] mouse. Whole body plethysmography during spontaneous respiration and respiratory challenge showed that f-ATXN1[146Q/2Q] mice exhibit a spontaneous respiratory phenotype characterized by elevated respiratory frequency, volumes, and respiratory output. Consequently, the ability of f-ATXN1[146Q/2Q] mice to increase ventilation during the challenge is impaired. To investigate the role of mutant ATXN1 expression in neural and skeletal muscle lineages, f-ATXN1[146Q/2Q] mice were bred to Nestin-Cre and Acta1-Cre mice respectively. These analyses revealed that the abnormal spontaneous respiration in f-ATXN1[146Q/2Q] mice involved two aspects: a behavioral phenotype in which SCA1 mice exhibit increased motor activity during respiratory testing and functional dysregulation of central respiratory control centers. Both aspects of spontaneous respiration were partially ameliorated by removing mutant ATXN1 from neural, but not skeletal muscle, cell lineages.

">Molecular Insights into Neuronal Dysfunction in GM2 Gangliosidoses</a></h4>

              
                Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are important bioactive components of cellular membranes. Complex GSLs, containing one or more sialic acid residues are known as gangliosides and are highly abundant in the brain. Diseases of ganglioside metabolism often result in severe, early-onset neurodegeneration. The ganglioside GM2 is the substrate of the hydrolytic lysosomal {beta}-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme and when subunits of this enzyme are non-functional, GM2 lipid accumulates in cells leading to the GM2 gangliosidoses, Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. We have developed i3Neuron-based models of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, which recapitulate cellular features of these diseases including endolysosomal storage of GM2 and formation of membrane whorls. Using proteomic approaches, we identify the molecular changes occurring within these neurons including accumulation of endolysosomal proteins consistent with disease phenotypes. Importantly, we demonstrate that in addition to lysosomal dysfunction, these diseases also result in significant changes in proteins associated with trafficking, as well as changes in the lipid and protein composition of the plasma membrane (PM). One of the mechanisms driving these changes is the exocytosis of lysosomal material resulting in the aberrant accumulation of lysosomal proteins and lipids on the cell surface. The PM analysis also revealed changes in the abundance of several key synaptic proteins and measurements of neuronal electrical activity reveals a reduced threshold for depolarisation, consistent with neuronal hyperactivity. This work provides deep molecular insights into the mechanisms driving neuronal dysfunction in the GM2 gangliosidoses with potential relevance more broadly to other lysosomal storage diseases and for late-onset diseases with sphingolipid dysregulation.

">Shaping the structural dynamics of motor learning through cueing during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Enhancing the retention of a recent memory trace through its reactivation during sleep is possible via Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR), which involves cueing previously learned material during post-training sleep. Current evidence suggests that changes in the brain's microstructure associated with motor sequence learning are detectable in the short term, within an hour of training. Furthermore, sleep after training is believed to contribute to the consolidation of these motor memories, potentially leading to more enduring microstructural changes. Here, we investigated to what extent TMR during post-training sleep is associated to performance gains and delayed (Day 2 and 5) microstructural remodeling in the brain, using both standard Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and fine-grained, multi-compartment Neurite Orientation Dispersion & Density Imaging (NODDI) analyses methods. In a five-days protocol, 60 young, healthy adults underwent five Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) sessions, pre- and post-two motor sequence training sessions, and after a post-training night of either Regular Sleep (RS) or sleep with TMR. Results show rapid skill acquisition during online practice on Day 1, followed by offline performance stabilization on Day 2 and improvement on Day 5. Widespread microstructural changes took place in motor-related areas following training and retraining, with a delayed shift in subcortical involvement from the hippocampus to the caudate nucleus. Mean Diffusivity (MD) changes were paralleled by increased Neurite Density Index (NDI) in the putamen, suggesting increased neurite density. Conversely, Free Water Fraction (FWF) reduction across other subcortical areas during the learning session suggests glial reorganization processes, rather than mere neurite growth. TMR-related structural differences were found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on the morning at Day 2. At Day 5, variations in Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI) were found in the right cuneus, suggesting unique TMR-related neural reorganization patterns, alternatively from different performance strategies between groups. Persistence of learning-related structural changes, although moderated over time, suggests a widespread and lasting reorganization within the neural networks associated with motor functions, underlying previous functional findings.

">Mitochondrial complex III-derived ROS amplify immunometabolic changes in astrocytes and promote dementia pathology</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disorders alter mitochondrial functions, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial complex III (CIII) generates ROS implicated in redox signaling, but its triggers, targets, and disease relevance are not clear. Using site-selective suppressors and genetic manipulations together with mitochondrial ROS imaging and multiomic profiling, we found that CIII is the dominant source of ROS production in astrocytes exposed to neuropathology-related stimuli. Astrocytic CIII-ROS production was dependent on nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) and the mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger (NCLX) and caused oxidation of select cysteines within immune and metabolism-associated proteins linked to neurological disease. CIII-ROS amplified metabolomic and pathology-associated transcriptional changes in astrocytes, with STAT3 activity as a major mediator, and facilitated neuronal toxicity in a non-cell-autonomous manner. As proof-of-concept, suppression of CIII-ROS in mice decreased dementia-linked tauopathy and neuroimmune cascades and extended lifespan. Our findings establish CIII-ROS as an important immunometabolic signal transducer and tractable therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disease.

">Coping switches stress evoked network disconnection to a new forebrain network state.</a></h4>

              
                Coping with stress is critical to maintaining mental and physical health. Acute stress is associated with changes in neuronal activity across many brain regions and with the reorganization of cross region correlations in neurovascular coupling. How neuronal activity itself is coordinated across regions during stress, and how neuronal networks are modified during coping, are unknown. We recorded in rats local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from five stress responsive regions during stress and stress coping behavior. We characterized network activity by computing cross region coherence, Granger causality, and phase amplitude coupling on bipolar derivatives of LFPs in the lateral habenula, basolateral amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, prelimbic cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. First, we established a stress coping model in rats. We showed that the behavioral response to acute 10 minute restraint stress returned to baseline after a second restraint 3 hours later. The pre stress state was characterized by robust global network interactions in the theta (6 to 9 Hz) and gamma (45 to 65 Hz) bands. Stress exposure led to nearly complete loss of connectivity. During coping, the robust connectivity reemerged, but in a new pattern compared to the pre stress state. Finally, we found that baseline, stressed, and coping states can be predicted with high accuracy (> 90 %) from network activity. Overall, we showed that the acutely stressed brain state was primarily a state of network disconnection, while coping was a new network state rather than a return to baseline.

">Functional Regrowth of Norepinephrine Axons in the Adult Mouse Brain Following Injury</a></h4>

              
                It is widely believed that axons in the central nervous system of adult mammals do not regrow following injury. This failure is thought, at least in part, to underlie the limited recovery of function following injury to the brain or spinal cord. Some studies of fixed tissue have suggested that, counter to dogma, norepinephrine (NE) axons regrow following brain injury. Here, we have used in vivo two-photon microscopy in layer 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex in transgenic mice harboring a fluorophore selectively expressed in NE neurons. This protocol allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of NE axons following injury with the selective NE axon toxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4). Following DSP4 treatment, NE axons were massively depleted and then slowly and partially recovered their density over a period of weeks. This regrowth was dominated by new axons entering the imaged volume. There was almost no contribution from local sprouting from spared NE axons. Regrown axons did not appear to use either the paths of previously lesioned NE axons nor NE axons that were spared and survived DSP4 treatment as a guide. To measure NE release, GCaMP8s was selectively expressed in neocortical astrocytes and startle-evoked, NE receptor-mediated Ca2+ transients were measured. These Ca2+ transients were abolished soon after DSP4 lesion but returned to pre-lesion values after 3-5 weeks, roughly coincident with NE axon regrowth, suggesting that the regrown NE axons are competent to release NE in response to a physiological stimulus in the awake mouse.

">Online movements reflect ongoing deliberation</a></h4>

              
                From navigating a crowded hallway to skiing down a treacherous hill, humans are constantly making decisions while moving. Insightful past work has provided a glimpse of decision deliberation at the moment of movement onset. Yet it is unknown whether ongoing deliberation can be expressed during movement, following movement onset and prior to any decision. Here we tested the idea that an ongoing deliberation continually influences motor processes--prior to a decision--directing online movements. Over three experiments, we manipulated evidence to influence deliberation during movement. The deliberation process was manipulated by having participants observe evidence in the form of tokens that moved into a left or right target. Supporting our hypothesis we found that lateral hand movements reflected deliberation, prior to a decision. We also found that a deliberation urgency signal, which more heavily weighs later evidence, was fundamental to predicting decisions and explains past movement behaviour in a new light. Our paradigm promotes the expression of ongoing deliberation through movement, providing a powerful new window into understanding the interplay between decision and action.

                Theta burst stimulation (TBS), an FDA-cleared treatment for depression, is hypothesized to modulate excitability in the prefrontal cortex, though this has not definitively been shown in vivo. We performed calcium imaging on glutamatergic neurons in awake rodents to understand the effects of theta burst stimulation at a cellular level. Our findings provide the first direct evidence that TBS bidirectionally modulates glutamatergic activity when delivered in vivo and directly links calcium activity changes during stimulation with post-stimulation plasticity.

">Removal of developmentally regulated microexons has a minimal impact on larval zebrafish brain morphology and function</a></h4>

              
                Microexon splicing is a vertebrate-conserved process through which small, often in-frame, exons are differentially included during brain development and across neuron types. Although the protein sequences encoded by these exons are highly conserved and can mediate interactions, the neurobiological functions of only a small number have been characterized. To establish a more generalized understanding of their roles in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to remove 45 microexons in zebrafish and assessed larval brain activity, morphology, and behavior. Most mutants had minimal or no phenotypes at this developmental stage. Among previously studied microexons, we uncovered baseline and stimulus-driven phenotypes for two microexons (meA and meB) in ptprd and reduced activity in the telencephalon in the tenm3 B0 isoform. Although mild, neural phenotypes were discovered for several microexons that have not been previously characterized, including in ppp6r3, sptan1, dop1a, rapgef2, dctn4, vti1a, and meaf6. This study establishes a general approach for investigating conserved alternative splicing events and prioritizes microexons for downstream analysis.

">The Brain Interactome of a Permissive Prion Replication Substrate</a></h4>

              
                Bank voles are susceptible to prion strains from many different species, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of bank vole prion protein (BVPrP) to function as a universal prion acceptor remain unclear. Potential differences in molecular environments and protein interaction networks on the cell surface of brain cells may contribute to BVPrP's unusual behavior. To test this hypothesis, we generated knock-in mice that express physiological levels of BVPrP (M109 isoform) and employed mass spectrometry to compare the interactomes of mouse (Mo) PrP and BVPrP following mild in vivo crosslinking of brain tissue. Substantial overlap was observed between the top interactors for BVPrP and MoPrP, with established PrP-interactors such as neural cell adhesion molecules, subunits of Na+/K+-ATPases, and contactin-1 being equally present in the two interactomes. We conclude that the molecular environments of BVPrP and MoPrP in the brains of mice are very similar. This suggests that the unorthodox properties of BVPrP are unlikely to be mediated by differential interactions with other proteins.

">Confidence over competence: Real-time integration of social information in human continuous perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Human perception is susceptible to social influences. To determine if and how individuals opportunistically integrate real-time social information about noisy stimuli into their judgment, we tracked perceptual accuracy and confidence in social (dyadic) and non-social (solo) settings using a novel continuous perceptual report (CPR) task with peri-decision wagering. In the dyadic setting, most participants showed a higher degree of perceptual confidence. In contrast, average accuracy did not improve compared to solo performance. Underlying these net effects, partners in the dyad exhibit mutual convergence of accuracy and confidence, benefitting less competent or confident individuals, at the expense of the better performing partner. In conclusion, real-time social information asymmetrically shapes human perceptual decision-making, with dyads expressing more confidence without a matching gain in overall competence.

	<p>Brain development from infancy through childhood involves complex structural and functional changes influenced by both internal and external factors. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of event and task-related brain oscillations, focusing on developmental changes across different frequency bands, including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies highlight that these oscillations serve as functional building blocks for sensory and cognitive processes, with significant variations observed across different developmental stages. Delta oscillations, primarily associated with deep sleep and early cognitive demands, gradually diminish as children age. Theta rhythms, crucial for attention and memory, display a distinct pattern in early childhood, evolving with cognitive maturation. Alpha oscillations, reflecting thalamocortical interactions and cognitive performance, increase in complexity with age. Beta rhythms, linked to active thinking and problem-solving, show developmental differences in motor and cognitive tasks. Gamma oscillations, associated with higher cognitive functions, exhibit notable changes in response to sensory stimuli and cognitive tasks. This review underscores the importance of understanding oscillatory dynamics to elucidate brain development and its implications for sensory and cognitive processing in childhood. The findings provide a foundation for future research on developmental neuroscience and potential clinical applications.</p>

	<p>This work proposes an intrinsically explainable, straightforward method to decode P300 waveforms from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, overcoming the black box nature of deep learning techniques. The proposed method allows convolutional neural networks to decode information from images, an area where they have achieved astonishing performance. By plotting the EEG signal as an image, it can be both visually interpreted by physicians and technicians and detected by the network, offering a straightforward way of explaining the decision. The identification of this pattern is used to implement a P300-based speller device, which can serve as an alternative communication channel for persons affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This method is validated by identifying this signal by performing a brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface simulation on a public dataset from ALS patients. Letter identification rates from the speller on the dataset show that this method can identify the P300 signature on the set of 8 patients. The proposed approach achieves similar performance to other state-of-the-art proposals while providing clinically relevant explainability (XAI).</p>

	<p>This study aimed to clarify the differences between the previously reported mechanisms of sports-related concussion (SRC) injuries without a loss of consciousness in contact and collision sports and the mechanisms of SRC injuries in our cases. Based on two videos of SRC injuries occurring during a men&amp;amp;rsquo;s rhythmic gymnastics competition (three people were injured), the risk of SRC occurrence was estimated from various parameters using a multibody analysis and eight brain injury evaluation criteria. In the present study, the three SRC impacts that occurred in men&amp;amp;rsquo;s rhythmic gymnastics showed significant characteristics in duration compared to previously reported cases in the contact sports. This suggests that the occurrence of SRC may have been caused by a different type of impact from that which causes SRC in contact sports (e.g., tackling). In addition, calculation of the strain indicating the rate of brain deformation suggested a risk of nerve swelling in all cases involving type 2 axonal injuries. Therefore, when reexamining sports-related head injuries, it is important to recognize the characteristics and mechanisms of SRC that occur in each different sport, as well as the symptoms and course of SRC after injury.</p>

                <p>by Diogo L. Pires, Mark Broom</p>

Community organisation permeates both social and biological complex systems. To study its interplay with behaviour emergence, we model mobile structured populations with multiplayer interactions. We derive general analytical methods for evolutionary dynamics under high home fidelity when populations self-organise into networks of asymptotically isolated communities. In this limit, community organisation dominates over the network structure and emerging behaviour is independent of network topology. We obtain the rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities for different types of social dilemmas. The success of cooperation is a result of the benefits shared among communal cooperators outperforming the benefits reaped by defectors in mixed communities. Under weak selection, cooperation can evolve and be stable for any size (<i>Q</i>) and number (<i>M</i>) of communities if the reward-to-cost ratio (<i>V</i>/<i>K</i>) of public goods is higher than a critical value. Community organisation is a solid mechanism for sustaining the evolution of cooperation under public goods dilemmas, particularly when populations are organised into a higher number of smaller communities. Contrary to public goods dilemmas relating to production, the multiplayer Hawk-Dove (HD) dilemma is a commons dilemma focusing on the fair consumption of preexisting resources. This game yields mixed results but tends to favour cooperation under larger communities, highlighting that the two types of social dilemmas might lead to solid differences in the behaviour adopted under community structure.

                <p>by Ayooluwa J. Bolaji, Ana T. Duggan</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought molecular biology and genomic sequencing into the public consciousness and lexicon. With an emphasis on rapid turnaround, genomic data informed both diagnostic and surveillance decisions for the current pandemic at a previously unheard-of scale. The surge in the submission of genomic data to publicly available databases proved essential as comparing different genome sequences offers a wealth of knowledge, including phylogenetic links, modes of transmission, rates of evolution, and the impact of mutations on infection and disease severity. However, the scale of the pandemic has meant that sequencing runs are rarely repeated due to limited sample material and/or the availability of sequencing resources, resulting in the upload of some imperfect runs to public repositories. As a result, it is crucial to investigate the data obtained from these imperfect runs to determine whether the results are reliable prior to depositing them in a public database. Numerous studies have identified a variety of sources of contamination in public next-generation sequencing (NGS) data as the number of NGS studies increases along with the diversity of sequencing technologies and procedures. For this study, we conducted an <i>in silico</i> experiment with known SARS-CoV-2 sequences produced from Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing to investigate the effect of contamination on lineage calls and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). A contamination threshold below which runs are expected to generate accurate lineage calls and maintain genome-relatedness and integrity was identified. Together, these findings provide a benchmark below which imperfect runs may be considered robust for reporting results to both stakeholders and public repositories and reduce the need for repeat or wasted runs.

                <p>by Yang Xu, Erez Cohen, Craig N. Johnson, Carole A. Parent, Pierre A. Coulombe</p>

Neutrophils are the first immune cells to reach inflamed sites and contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Yet, little is known about the pattern of neutrophil infiltration in inflamed skin in vivo and the mechanisms mediating their recruitment. Here, we provide insight into the dynamics of neutrophil infiltration in skin in response to acute or repeated inflammatory stress, highlighting a novel keratinocyte- and keratin 17 (K17)-dependent mechanism that regulates neutrophil recruitment to inflamed skin. We used the phorbol ester TPA and UVB, alone or in combination, to induce sterile inflammation in mouse skin. A single TPA treatment results in a neutrophil influx in the dermis that peaks at 12 h and resolves within 24 h. A subsequent TPA treatment or a UVB challenge, when applied 24 h but not 48 h later, accelerates, amplifies, and prolongs neutrophil infiltration. This transient amplification response (TAR) is mediated by local signals in inflamed skin, can be recapitulated in ex vivo culture, and involves the K17-dependent sustainment of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activity and release of chemoattractants by stressed keratinocytes. K17 binds RACK1, a scaffold protein essential for PKCα activity. The N-terminal head domain of K17 is crucial for its association with RACK1 and regulation of PKCα activity. Analysis of RNAseq data reveals a signature consistent with TAR and PKCα activation in inflammatory skin diseases. These findings uncover a novel, keratin-dependent mechanism that amplifies neutrophil recruitment in skin under stress, with direct implications for inflammatory skin disorders.

We report here on the characterisation in mice of a noninvasive bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) skin challenge model for assessing tuberculosis (TB) vaccine efficacy. Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) are valuable tools for assessing the relevant biological activity of vaccine candidates, with the potential to accelerate TB vaccine development into the clinic. TB infection poses significant constraints on the design of a CHIM using the causative agent <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb). A safer alternative is a challenge model using the attenuated vaccine agent <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> BCG as a surrogate for Mtb, and intradermal (skin) challenge as an alternative to pulmonary infection. We have developed a unique noninvasive imaging system based on fluorescent reporters (FluorBCG) to quantitatively measure bacterial load over time, thereby determining a relevant biological vaccine effect. We assessed the utility of this model to measure the effectiveness of 2 TB vaccines: the currently licenced BCG and a novel subunit vaccine candidate. To assess the efficacy of the skin challenge model, a nonlinear mixed effect model was built describing the decline of fluorescence over time. The model-based analysis identified that BCG vaccination reduced the fluorescence readout of both fluorophores compared to unvaccinated mice (<i>p</i> < 0.001). However, vaccination with the novel subunit candidate did not alter the fluorescence decline compared to unvaccinated mice (<i>p</i> > 0.05). BCG-vaccinated mice that showed the reduced fluorescent readout also had a reduced bacterial burden in the lungs when challenged with Mtb. This supports the fluorescence activity in the skin as a reflection of vaccine induced functional pulmonary immune responses. This novel noninvasive approach allows for repeated measurements from the challenge site, providing a dynamic readout of vaccine induced responses over time. This BCG skin challenge model represents an important contribution to the ongoing development of controlled challenge models for TB.

Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are key players in cellular homeostasis and regulation, as they coordinate the exchange of lipids between different cellular organelles. Despite their importance, our mechanistic understanding of how LTPs function at the molecular level is still in its infancy, mostly due to the large number of existing LTPs and to the low degree of conservation at the sequence and structural level. In this work, we use molecular simulations to characterize a representative dataset of lipid transport domains (LTDs) of 12 LTPs that belong to 8 distinct families. We find that despite no sequence homology nor structural conservation, the conformational landscape of LTDs displays common features, characterized by the presence of at least 2 main conformations whose populations are modulated by the presence of the bound lipid. These conformational properties correlate with their mechanistic mode of action, allowing for the interpretation and design of experimental strategies to further dissect their mechanism. Our findings indicate the existence of a conserved, fold-independent mechanism of lipid transfer across LTPs of various families and offer a general framework for understanding their functional mechanism.

Dynamic properties are essential for microtubule (MT) physiology. Current techniques for in vivo imaging of MTs present intrinsic limitations in elucidating the isotype-specific nuances of tubulins, which contribute to their versatile functions. Harnessing the power of the AlphaFold2 pipeline, we engineered a strategy for the minimally invasive fluorescence labeling of endogenous tubulin isotypes or those harboring missense mutations. We demonstrated that a specifically designed 16-amino acid linker, coupled with sfGFP11 from the split-sfGFP system and integration into the H1-S2 loop of tubulin, facilitated tubulin labeling without compromising MT dynamics, embryonic development, or ciliogenesis in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Extending this technique to human cells and murine oocytes, we visualized MTs with the minimal background fluorescence and a pathogenic tubulin isoform with fidelity. The utility of our approach across biological contexts and species set an additional paradigm for studying tubulin dynamics and functional specificity, with implications for understanding tubulin-related diseases known as tubulinopathies.

<p>Disrupted connectivity between the amygdala and the default mode network (DMN) is highlighted in schizophrenia, with significant changes observed in specific amygdala subregions after treatment.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disrupted connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) during resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is well-documented in schizophrenia (SCZ). The amygdala, a key component in the neurobiology of SCZ, comprises distinct subregions that may exert varying effects on the disorder. This study aimed to investigate variations in functional connectivity (FC) between distinct amygdala subregions and the DMN in SCZ individuals and explore the effects of treatment on these connections. Fifty-six SCZ patients and 51 healthy controls underwent FC analysis and questionnaire surveys during resting state. The amygdala was selected as the region of interest (ROI) and subdivided into four parts. Changes in FC were examined, and correlations between questionnaire scores and brain activity were explored. Pre-treatment, SCZ patients exhibited reduced FC between the amygdala and DMN compared to HCs. After treatment, significant differences persisted in the right medial amygdala, while other regions did not differ significantly from controls. In addition, PANSS scores positively correlated with FC between the Right Medial Amygdala and the left SMFC (<i>r</i> = .347, <i>p</i> = .009), while RBANS5A scores showed a positive correlation with FC between the Left Lateral Amygdala and the right MTG (rho = −.347, <i>p</i> = .009). The rsFC between the amygdala and the DMN plays a crucial role in the treatment mechanisms of SCZ. This could provide a promising predictive indicator for understanding the neural mechanisms behind treatment and symptomatic improvement.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resistance exercise training (RET) is considered an excellent tool for preventing diseases with an inflammatory background. Its neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties are responsible for positively modulating cholinergic and oxidative systems, promoting neurogenesis, and improving memory. However, the mechanisms behind these actions are largely unknown. In order to investigate the pathways related to these effects of exercise, we conducted a 12-week long-term exercise training protocol and used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce damage to the cortex and hippocampus of male Wistar rats. The cholinergic system, oxidative stress, and histochemical parameters were analyzed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and memory tests were also performed. It was observed that LPS: (1) caused memory loss in the novel object recognition (NOR) test; (2) increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Iba1 protein density; (3) reduced the protein density of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1); (4) elevated the levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and reactive species (RS); and (5) caused inflammatory damage to the dentate gyrus. RET, on the other hand, was able to prevent all alterations induced by LPS, as well as increase per se the protein density of the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRα7) and Nestin, and the levels of protein thiols (T-SH). Overall, our study elucidates some mechanisms that support resistance physical exercise as a valuable approach against LPS-induced neuroinflammation and memory loss.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) can result from dominant, gain of function variants of neuronal ion channels. More than 450 de novo missense variants of the sodium channel gene <i>SCN8A</i> have been identified in individuals with DEE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied a mouse model carrying the patient <i>Scn8a</i> variant p.Asn1768Asp. An AAV-PHP.eB virus carrying an allele-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. Cas9 was provided by an inherited transgene.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Allele-specific disruption of the reading frame of the pathogenic transcript generated out-of-frame indels in 1/4 to 1/3 of transcripts throughout the brain. This editing efficiency was sufficient to rescue lethality and seizures. Neuronal hyperexcitability was reduced in cells expressing the virus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The data demonstrate efficient allele-specific editing of a dominant missense variant and support the feasibility of allele-specific therapy for DEE epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96216">Artificially inserted strong promoter containing multiple G-quadruplexes induces long-range chromatin modification</a></h4>

              
                Although the role of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures has been suggested in chromosomal looping this was not tested directly. Here, to test causal function, an array of G4s, or control sequence that does not form G4s, were inserted within chromatin in cells. In vivo G4 formation of the inserted G4 sequence array, and not the control sequence, was confirmed using G4-selective antibody. Compared to the control insert, we observed a remarkable increase in the number of 3D chromatin looping interactions from the inserted G4 array. This was evident within the immediate topologically associated domain (TAD) and throughout the genome. Locally, recruitment of enhancer histone marks and the transcriptional coactivator p300/Acetylated-p300 increased in the G4-array, but not in the control insertion. Resulting promoter-enhancer interactions and gene activation were clear up to 5 Mb away from the insertion site. Together, these show the causal role of G4s in enhancer function and long-range chromatin interactions. Mechanisms of 3D topology are primarily based on DNA-bound architectural proteins that induce/stabilize long-range interactions. Involvement of the underlying intrinsic DNA sequence/structure in 3D looping shown here therefore throws new light on how long-range chromosomal interactions might be induced or maintained.

                The protein dynamical transition at ~200 K, where the biomolecule transforms from a harmonic, non-functional form to an anharmonic, functional state, has been thought to be slaved to the thermal activation of dynamics in its surface hydration water. Here, by selectively probing the dynamics of protein and hydration water using elastic neutron scattering and isotopic labeling, we found that the onset of anharmonicity in the two components around 200 K is decoupled. The one in protein is an intrinsic transition, whose characteristic temperature is independent of the instrumental resolution time, but varies with the biomolecular structure and the amount of hydration, while the one of water is merely a resolution effect.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97027">Iron-sulfur cluster loss in mitochondrial CISD1 mediates PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila orthologue of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94109">Multiple guidance mechanisms control axon growth to generate precise T-shaped bifurcation during dorsal funiculus development in the spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal funiculus in the spinal cord relays somatosensory information to the brain. It is made of T-shaped bifurcation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons. Our previous study has shown that Slit signaling is required for proper guidance during bifurcation, but loss of Slit does not affect all DRG axons. Here, we examined the role of the extracellular molecule Netrin-1 (Ntn1). Using wholemount staining with tissue clearing, we showed that mice lacking Ntn1 had axons escaping from the dorsal funiculus at the time of bifurcation. Genetic labeling confirmed that these misprojecting axons come from DRG neurons. Single axon analysis showed that loss of Ntn1 did not affect bifurcation but rather altered turning angles. To distinguish their guidance functions, we examined mice with triple deletion of Ntn1, Slit1, and Slit2 and found a completely disorganized dorsal funiculus. Comparing mice with different genotypes using immunolabeling and single axon tracing revealed additive guidance errors, demonstrating the independent roles of Ntn1 and Slit. Moreover, the same defects were observed in embryos lacking their cognate receptors. These in vivo studies thus demonstrate the presence of multi-factorial guidance mechanisms that ensure proper formation of a common branched axonal structure during spinal cord development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96652">Beyond Haldane’s rule: Sex-biased hybrid dysfunction for all modes of sex determination</a></h4>

              
                Haldane’s rule occupies a special place in biology as one of the few ‘rules’ of speciation, with empirical support from hundreds of species. And yet, its classic purview is restricted taxonomically to the subset of organisms with heteromorphic sex chromosomes. I propose explicit acknowledgement of generalized hypotheses about Haldane’s rule that frame sex bias in hybrid dysfunction broadly and irrespective of the sexual system. The consensus view of classic Haldane’s rule holds that sex-biased hybrid dysfunction across taxa is a composite phenomenon that requires explanations from multiple causes. Testing of the multiple alternative hypotheses for Haldane’s rule is, in many cases, applicable to taxa with homomorphic sex chromosomes, environmental sex determination, haplodiploidy, and hermaphroditism. Integration of a variety of biological phenomena about hybrids across diverse sexual systems, beyond classic Haldane’s rule, will help to derive a more general understanding of the contributing forces and mechanisms that lead to predictable sex biases in evolutionary divergence and speciation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/76940">Fam49b dampens TCR signal strength to regulate survival of positively selected thymocytes and peripheral T cells</a></h4>

              
                The fate of developing T cells is determined by the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signal they receive in the thymus. This process is finely regulated through the tuning of positive and negative regulators in thymocytes. The Family with sequence similarity 49 member B (Fam49b) protein is a newly discovered negative regulator of TCR signaling that has been shown to suppress Rac-1 activity in vitro in cultured T cell lines. However, the contribution of Fam49b to the thymic development of T cells is unknown. To investigate this important issue, we generated a novel mouse line deficient in Fam49b (Fam49b-KO). We observed that Fam49b-KO double positive (DP) thymocytes underwent excessive negative selection, whereas the positive selection stage was unaffected. Fam49b deficiency impaired the survival of single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells. This altered development process resulted in significant reductions in CD4 and CD8 single-positive thymocytes as well as peripheral T cells. Interestingly, a large proportion of the TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> and CD8αα<sup>+</sup>TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> gut intraepithelial T lymphocytes were absent in Fam49b-KO mice. Our results demonstrate that Fam49b dampens thymocytes TCR signaling in order to escape negative selection during development, uncovering the function of Fam49b as a critical regulator of the selection process to ensure normal thymocyte development and peripheral T cells survival.

">The multi-stage plasticity in the aggression circuit underlying the winner effect</a></h4>

              
                Winning increases the readiness to attack and the probability of winning, a widespread phenomenon known as the "winner effect". Here, we reveal a transition from target-specific to generalized aggression enhancement over 10 days of winning in male mice, which is supported by three stages of plasticity in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl), a critical node for aggression. Over 10-day winning, VMHvl cells experience monotonic potentiation of long-range excitatory inputs, a transient local connectivity strengthening, and a delayed excitability increase. These plasticity events are causally linked. Optogenetically coactivating the posterior amygdala (PA) terminals and VMHvl cells potentiates the PA-VMHvl pathway and triggers the cascade of plasticity events as those during repeated winning. Optogenetically blocking PA-VMHvl synaptic potentiation eliminates all winning-induced plasticity. These results reveal the complex Hebbian synaptic and excitability plasticity in the aggression circuit during winning that ultimately leads to an increase in "aggressiveness" in repeated winners.

">Compressed higher-order structures facilitate human knowledge network learning</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge seeking is innate to human nature, yet integrating vast and fragmented information into a unified network is a daunting challenge, especially in the information explosion era. Graph theory describes knowledge as a network characterising relationships (edges) between isolated data (nodes). Accordingly, knowledge learning could be abstracted as network navigation through random walks, where local connections are gradually learned and integrated to form the global picture. To facilitate network learning, we develop a novel "compressive learning" approach that decomposes network structures into substructures based on higher-order inhomogeneity properties and designs pre-learning paths highlighting key substructures. Large-scale behavioural experiments and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings demonstrate its effectiveness and better network formation in human brains. Hypergraph-based computational models reveal that the pre-learning path helps establish the core network skeleton to efficiently accommodate late inputs. Overall, higher-order network structures are crucial to network learning and can be utilised to better "connect the dots".

">The developing hippocampus: Microstructural evolution through childhood and adolescence</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a structure in the medial temporal lobe which serves multiple cognitive functions. While important, the development of the hippocampus in the formative period of childhood and adolescence has not been extensively investigated, with most contemporary research focusing on macrostructural measures of volume. Thus, there has been little research on the development of the micron-scale structures (i.e., microstructure) of the hippocampus, which engender its cognitive functions. The current study examined age-related changes of hippocampal microstructure using diffusion MRI data acquired with an ultra-strong gradient (300 mT/m) MRI scanner in a sample of children and adolescents (N=88; 8-19 years). Surface-based hippocampal modelling was combined with established microstructural approaches, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion Density Imaging (NODDI), and a more advanced gray matter diffusion model Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI). No significant changes in macrostructural measures (volume, gyrification, and thickness) were found between 8-19 years, while significant changes in microstructure measures related to neurites (from NODDI and SANDI), soma (from SANDI), and mean diffusivity (from DTI) were found. In particular, there was a significant increase across age in neurite MR signal fraction and a significant decrease in extracellular MR signal fraction and mean diffusivity across the hippocampal subfields and long-axis. A significant negative correlation between age and MR apparent soma radius was found in the subiculum and CA1 throughout the anterior and body of the hippocampus. Further surface-based analyses uncovered variability in age-related microstructural changes between the subfields and long-axis, which may reflect ostensible developmental differences along these two axes. Finally, correlation of hippocampal surfaces representing age-related changes of microstructure with maps derived from histology allowed for postulation of the potential underlying microstructure that diffusion changes across age may be capturing. Overall, distinct neurite and soma developmental profiles in the human hippocampus during late childhood and adolescence are reported for the first time.

">Feminization of social play behavior depends on microglia</a></h4>

              
                Many sex differences in brain and behavior are established developmentally by the opposing processes of feminization and masculinization, which manifest following differential steroid hormone exposure in early life. The cellular mechanisms underlying masculinization are well-documented, a result of the fact that it is steroid-mediated and can be easily induced in newborn female rodents via exogenous steroid treatment. However, the study of feminization of particular brain regions has largely been relegated to being not masculinization given the absence of an identified initiating trigger. As a result, the mechanisms of this key developmental process remain elusive. Here we describe a novel role for microglia, the brains innate immune cell, in the feminization of the medial amygdala and a complex social behavior, juvenile play. In the developing amygdala, microglia promote proliferation of astrocytes equally in both sexes, with no apparent effect on rates of cell division, but support cell survival selectively in females through the trophic actions of Tumor Necrosis Factor  (TNF). We demonstrate that disrupting TNF signaling, either by depleting microglia or inhibiting the associated signaling pathways, prevents the feminization of astrocyte density and increases juvenile play levels to that seen in males. This data, combined with our previous finding that male-like patterns of astrocyte density are sculpted by developmental microglial phagocytosis, reveals that sexual differentiation of the medial amygdala involves opposing tensions between active masculinization and active feminization, both of which require microglia but are achieved via distinct processes.

">Molecular Visualization of Neuronal TDP43 Pathology In Situ</a></h4>

              
                Nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic accumulation of the RNA-binding protein TDP43 are characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Despite this, the origin and ultrastructure of cytosolic TDP43 deposits remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal RNA homeostasis can drive pathological TDP43 mislocalization, enhancing RNA misprocessing due to loss of nuclear TDP43 and engendering a cycle that ends in cell death. Here, we show that adding small monovalent oligonucleotides successfully recapitulates pathological TDP43 mislocalization and aggregation in iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons). By employing a multimodal in situ cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy pipeline, we examine how RNA influences the localization and aggregation of TDP43 in near-native conditions. We find that mislocalized TDP43 forms ordered fibrils within lysosomes and autophagosomes in iNeurons as well as in patient tissue, and provide the first high-resolution snapshots of TDP43 aggregates in situ. In so doing, we provide a cellular model for studying initial pathogenic events underlying ALS, FTLD, and related TDP43-proteinopathies.

">CA1 ensemble plasticity is coupled to context change and modulated by task familiarity</a></h4>

              
                When should plasticity mechanisms get recruited (stability-plasticity dilemma)? Environments change over time, re/entering a given context increases uncertainty and predicts the need for updating. The hippocampus (HPC) is key to tracking context change but also navigation relative to moving targets. CA1 ensembles expressing immediate-early genes (IEGs) are contextually specific, while the amount of IEG expression correlates with HPC-dependent task demands. However, task effects on the IEG-expressing ensembles per se remain unclear. In three experiments, we tested the effect of context change and HPC task demands on CA1 IEG+ ensembles in rats. Experiment 1 showed that the IEG+ (Arc, Homer1a RNA) ensemble size drops to baseline level during uninterrupted 30 min exploration, reflecting familiarization and decreasing uncertainty, unless context change is present; the ensemble sizes reflect both context identity and context change. Experiment 2 showed no evidence of task-specificity of IEG+ ensembles during highly HPC-dependent mobile robot avoidance nor HPC-independent stationary robot avoidance. Experiment 3 replicated the findings of Experiment 2 for c-Fos protein. Nonetheless, the data suggest that ensembles shrink with task mastery/familiarity and grow with novelty presented by the acquisition of behavioral extinction. Overall, our results shed light on the temporal dynamics, and the context and task control of CA1 IEG+ ensembles. The present results and the relevant literature suggest that context change resets the ensemble of IEG-expressing CA1 neurons and novelty delays the time-dependent ensemble shrinking.

">Uncovering immune characteristics of neurons in the context of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, and substantial characterization of molecular signatures of glial and immune cells in the disease has been conducted. However, comparatively less well characterized is the molecular signature of pathologically inflamed neurons. Here, we accessed multi-omic high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic data to investigate the molecular signature of neurons from progressive MS patients and from mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate a shared and consistent neuronal gene expression signature in MS and EAE samples including a notable upregulation of immune system related genes and processes. Analysis of immune-enriched pathways in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and motor neurons from mice subjected to EAE revealed enrichment for the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway and interferon response genes in both types of neurons, and ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the accessibility of these genes. Parallel analyses of neurons from MS patients identified a signature of 48 commonly upregulated immune genes in neurons. Prediction of transcriptional regulators of these genes identified key upstream regulators including signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon response factor 5 (IRF5), highly involved in immune-related processes, with significant gene expression changes in both RGCs and motor neurons. Protein-protein interaction analyses among the transcriptional regulators unveiled intricate interactions among transcription factors, especially from the IRF and STAT families, suggesting their importance in regulating immune gene expression in inflamed neurons. Small molecule inhibition of IRF5 in inflamed neurons in vitro promoted cell survival and reduced the expression of the immune gene signature, supporting the biological relevance of IRF5 in mediating the neuronal inflammatory response. Together, this study identifies regulated immune processes in neurons from EAE mice and from MS patient samples suggesting potential roles for neuronal immune molecules in disease progression, as revealed by transcriptomic, epigenomic, and experimental approaches. Further, the results strongly implicate active interferon signaling in neurons driving immune related changes in gene expression through IRF5 and STAT1 transcription factor activity, potentially impacting downstream neuronal survival through IRF5 activity.

">Burst Estimation through Atomic Decomposition (BEAD): A Toolbox to find Oscillatory Bursts in Brain Signals</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that brain signals often show oscillatory bursts of short durations, which have been linked to various aspects of computation and behaviour. Traditional methods often use direct spectral estimators to estimate the power of brain signals in spectral and temporal domains, from which bursts are identified. However, direct spectral estimators are known to be noisy, such that even stable oscillations may appear bursty. We have previously shown that the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm, which uses a large overcomplete dictionary of basis functions (called "atoms") to decompose the signal directly in the time domain, partly addresses this concern and robustly finds long bursts in synthetic as well as real data. However, MP is a greedy algorithm that can give non-optimal solutions and requires a large sized dictionary. To address these concerns, we extended two other algorithms - orthogonal MP (OMP) and OMP using Multiscale Adaptive Gabor Expansion (OMP-MAGE), to perform burst duration estimation. We also develop a novel algorithm, called OMP using Gabor Expansion with Atom Reassignment (OMP-GEAR). These algorithms overcome some of the limitations of MP and can work with a significantly smaller dictionary size. We find that, in synthetic data, OMP, OMP-MAGE and OMP-GEAR converge faster than MP. Also, OMP-MAGE and OMP-GEAR outperform both MP and OMP when the dictionary size is small. Finally, OMP-GEAR outperforms OMP-MAGE when the bursts are overlapping. Importantly, the burst durations obtained using MP and OMP with a very large-sized dictionary are comparable to that obtained using OMP-MAGE with a much smaller-sized dictionary in real data obtained from two monkeys passively viewing static gratings which induced gamma bursts in the primary visual cortex. OMP-GEAR yields slightly smaller burst durations, but all the estimated burst durations are still significantly larger than the duration estimated using traditional methods. These results suggest that gamma bursts are longer than previously reported. Raw data from two monkeys, as well as codes for both traditional and new methods, are publicly available as part of this toolbox.

">Peripheral Blood Immune Cells from Individuals with Parkinson's Disease or Inflammatory Bowel Disease Share Deficits in Iron Storage and Transport that are Modulated by Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder in which dysregulated neuroimmune crosstalk and inflammatory relay via the gut-blood-brain axis have been implicated in PD pathogenesis. Although alterations in circulating inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been associated with PD, no biomarkers have been identified that predict clinical progression or disease outcome. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, which involves perturbation of the underlying immune system, is an early and often-overlooked symptom that affects up to 80% of individuals living with PD. Interestingly, 50-70% of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a GI condition that has been epidemiologically linked to PD, display chronic illness-induced anemia - which drives toxic accumulation of iron in the gut. Ferroptotic (or iron loaded) cells have small and dysmorphic mitochondria-suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of iron accumulation. In pro-inflammatory environments, iron accumulates in immune cells, suggesting a possible connection and/or synergy between iron dysregulation and immune cell dysfunction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) recapitulate certain PD-associated neuropathological and inflammatory signatures and can act as communicating messengers in the gut-brain axis. Additionally, this communication can be modulated by several environmental factors; specifically, our data further support existing literature demonstrating a role for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in modulating immune transcriptional states in inflamed individuals. A mechanism linking chronic gut inflammation to iron dysregulation and mitochondrial function within peripheral immune cells has yet to be identified in conferring risk for PD. To that end, we isolated PBMCs and simultaneously evaluated their directed transcriptome and bioenergetic status, to investigate if iron dysregulation and mitochondrial sensitization are linked in individuals living with PD or IBD because of chronic underlying remittent immune activation. We have identified shared features of peripheral inflammation and immunometabolism in individuals living with IBD or PD that may contribute to the epidemiological association reported between IBD and risk for PD.

">Trust or doubt? Neural resonance based on facial expressions in a deception game reflected by frontal EEG activities.</a></h4>

              
                The frontal cortex plays a critical role in the deception. While previous neuroimaging studies have examined the functions of various subregions within the frontal cortex, particularly in relation to truth inhibition and lie production, there is a limited understanding of frontal activities during deception in the context of social interaction. To bridge this gap, we investigated an EEG dataset collected during a deception game involving two participants (one player and one observer) who engaged in social interaction. In the game, the player was instructed or chose spontaneously whether to lie or tell the truth, while the observer decided whether to doubt or trust the player based on the player's facial expressions. Our analyses on the behavioral and EEG data revealed two major findings: (1) The observers' responses were directly impacted by the players' facial expressions. Without being informed about the trial conditions, the observer was more likely to doubt the player in instructed conditions compared to the spontaneous ones, a tendency that was evident in both the behavioral data and the observer's vlPFC activities. (2) Despite a performance at the chance level, the observer's responses seemed to depend on the player's neural activities. As evidence, both the observer's vlPFC and the player's dmPFC-vlPFC activities reflected the observer's responses (trust versus doubt). According to these results and previous research, we propose a neural resonance model driven by facial expressions from the player's emotional regulation system (dmPFC-vlPFC) to the observer's emotion perception system (vlPFC) during the deception game.

">The stretch-shortening cycle effect is not associated with cortical or spinal excitability modulations</a></h4>

              
                It is unclear whether cortical and spinal excitability modulations contribute to enhanced SSC performance. Therefore, this study investigated cortical and spinal excitability modulations during and following shortening of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) contractions compared with pure shortening (SHO) contractions. Participants (N = 18) performed submaximal voluntary plantar flexion contractions while prone on the dynamometer bench. The right foot was strapped onto the dynamometer footplate attachment and the resultant ankle joint torque and crank arm angle were recorded. Cortical and spinal excitability modulations of the soleus muscle were analyzed by eliciting compound muscle actional potentials via electrical nerve stimulation, cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) via electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) via magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex. Mean torque following stretch was significantly increased by 7 plus minus 3% (p=0.029) compared with the fixed-end reference (REF) contraction and mean torque during shortening of SSC compared with SHO was significantly increased by 12 plus minus 24% (p=0.046). Mean steady-state torque was significantly lower by 13 plus minus 3% (p=0.006) and 9 plus minus 12% (p=0.011) following SSC compared with REF and SHO, respectively. Mean steady-state torque was not significantly lower following SHO compared with REF (7 plus minus 8%, p=0.456). CMEPs and MEPs were also not significantly different during shortening of SSC compared with SHO or during the steady state of SSC, SHO, and REF. Therefore, our results indicate that SSC performance was not associated with cortical or spinal excitability modulations during or after shortening, but rather driven by mechanical mechanisms triggered during active stretch.

">Fast implicit and slow explicit learning of temporal context in cortico-cerebellar loops</a></h4>

              
                One is seldom aware of the anticipatory and preemptive feats that the eyeblink systems achieves in daily life but it frequently protects the eye from projectiles gone awry and insects on apparent collision courses. This poor awareness is why predictive eyeblinks are considered a form of implicit learning. In motor neuroscience, implicit learning is considered to be slow and, eyeblink conditioning, in particular, is believed to be a rigid and inflexible cerebellar-dependent behavior. In cognitive neuroscience, however, implicit and automatic processes are thought to be rapidly acquired. Here we show that the eyeblink system is, in fact, capable of remarkable cognitive flexibility and can learn on more rapid timescales than previously expected. In a task where we yoked contextual learning of predictive eyeblinks and manual responses in humans, well-timed eyeblink responses flexibly adjusted to external context on each trial. The temporal precision of the predictive eyeblinks exceeded that of manual response times. Learning of the well-timed eyeblink responses was also more rapid than that for the manual response times. This pattern persevered with the use of a cognitive strategy, which seemed to accelerate both types of learning. These results suggest that behaviors associated with the cerebellar cortex that were previously believed to be inflexible and largely implicit, can demonstrate rapid and precise context-dependent temporal control.

">Cerebellar encoding of prior knowledge of temporal statistics</a></h4>

              
                We possess the ability to anticipate and preempt occurrences under familiar circumstances, which suggests a reliance on prior experience with regularities in our environment, especially when observations become more uncertain. We know little about the neural mechanisms that can learn the probabilities of events in the environment and use this prior experience to guide actions. To examine this, we studied a rudimentary predictive behavior, eyeblink conditioning, and asked whether a simple effector like the eyelid could adapt its movements to varying probabilities of environmental events that reflect different degrees of uncertainty. We found that predictive eyeblink behavior systematically changed almost all its properties according to the temporal statistics of stimulus probability distributions. We also found that the activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells and putative molecular layer interneurons changed concomitantly with temporal statistics of the stimuli and with behavior. Targeted optogenetic perturbation of Purkinje cells during critical time windows severely attenuated the predictive behavior but left reflexive eyeblinks intact. Furthermore, we discovered a novel Purkinje cell complex spike signal coinciding with the onset of the earliest probable time interval in prior distributions with high uncertainty. This signal could not be explained as a motor or sensory correlate and appears to be anticipatory in nature. Theoretical modeling results pointed to a possible synaptic mechanism for how Purkinje cells could encode prior experience of environmental statistics in their activity through the juxtaposition of long-term depression and potentiation dynamics.

">Balancing Selectivity and Generality in Object Recognition through Structured Interconnectivity.</a></h4>

              
                Balancing selectivity and generality in object recognition is a significant challenge, as it requires the ability to discern fine details that set objects apart while simultaneously embracing the common threads that classify them into one single category. Here we investigated how the brain addresses this challenge by examining the relationship between the interconnectivity of neural networks, the dimensionality of neural space, and the balance of selectivity and generality using neurophysiological data and computational modeling. We found that higher interconnectivity in the TEa of macaques IT cortex was associated with lower dimensionality and increased generality, while lower interconnectivity in the TEO correlated with higher dimensionality and enhanced selectivity. To establish the causal link, we developed a brain-inspired computational model formed through Hebbian and anti-Hebbian rules, with wiring length constraints derived from biological brains. The resulting structured interconnectivity created an optimal dimensionality of the neural space, allowing for efficient energy distribution across the representational manifold embedded in the neural space to balance selectivity and generality. Interestingly, this structured interconnectivity placed the network in a critical state that balances adaptability and stability, and fostered a cognitive module with cognitive impenetrability. In summary, our study underscores the importance of structured interconnectivity in achieving a balance between selectivity and generality, providing a unifying view of balancing two extreme demands in object recognition.

">A meta-analysis of sex differences in neonatal rodent ultrasonic vocalizations and the implication for the preclinical maternal immune activation model</a></h4>

              
                As the earliest measure of social communication in rodents, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in response to maternal separation are critical in preclinical research on neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While sex differences in both USV production and behavioral outcomes are reported, many studies overlook sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of NDDs. We aimed to evaluate sex differences in USV call parameters and to determine if USVs are differently impacted based on sex in the preclinical maternal immune activation (MIA) model. Results indicate that sex differences in USVs vary with developmental stage and are more pronounced in MIA offspring. Specifically, control females exhibited longer call durations than males in early development (up to postnatal day [PND] 8), but this pattern reverses after PND8. MIA leads to a reduction in call numbers for females compared to same-sex controls in early development, with a reversal post-PND8. MIA decreased call duration and increased total call duration in males, but unlike females, developmental stage did not influence these differences. In males, MIA effects varied by species, with decreased call numbers in rats but increased call numbers in mice. The timing of MIA (gestational day less than or equal to 12.5 vs. > 12.5) did not significantly affect the results. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex, developmental timing, and species in USVs research. We discuss how analyzing USV call types and incorporating sex as a biological variable can enhance our understanding of neonatal ultrasonic communication and its translational value in NDD research.

">Learning to use landmarks for navigation amplifies their representation in retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual landmarks provide powerful reference signals for efficient navigation by altering the activity of spatially tuned neurons, such as place cells, head direction cells, and grid cells. To understand the neural mechanism by which landmarks exert such strong influence, it is necessary to identify how these visual features gain spatial meaning. In this study, we characterized visual landmark representations in mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) using chronic two-photon imaging of the same neuronal ensembles over the course of spatial learning. We found a pronounced increase in landmark-referenced activity in RSC neurons that, once established, remained stable across days. Changing behavioral context by uncoupling treadmill motion from visual feedback systematically altered neuronal responses associated with the coherence between visual scene flow speed and self-motion. To explore potential underlying mechanisms, we modeled how burst firing, mediated by supralinear somatodendritic interactions, could efficiently mediate context- and coherence-dependent integration of landmark information. Our results show that visual encoding shifts to landmark-referenced and context-dependent codes as these cues take on spatial meaning during learning.

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of overground robot exoskeleton gait training on gait outcomes, balance, and motor function in patients with stroke. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, literature searches were performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Ovid-LWW, and RISS databases. A total of 504 articles were identified, of which 19 were included for analysis after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included literature was qualitatively evaluated using the PEDro scale, while the Egger&amp;amp;rsquo;s regression, funnel plot, and trim-and-fill methods were applied to assess and adjust for publication bias. Results: The averaged PEDro score was 6.21 points, indicating a high level of methodological quality. In the analysis based on dependent variables, higher effect sizes were observed in the following ascending order: gait speed (g = 0.26), motor function (g = 0.21), gait ability (g = 0.18), Timed Up and Go Test (g = &amp;amp;minus;0.15), gait endurance (g = 0.11), and Berg Balance Scale (g = 0.05). Subgroup analyses further revealed significant differences in Asian populations (g = 0.26), sessions lasting longer than 30 min (g = 0.37), training frequency of three times per week or less (g = 0.38), and training duration of four weeks or less (g = 0.25). Overall, the results of this study indicate that overground robot exoskeleton gait training is effective at improving gait speed in patients with stroke, particularly when the sessions exceed 30 min, are conducted three times or less per week, and last for four weeks or less. Conclusion: our results suggest that training is an effective intervention for patients with stroke, provided that appropriate goal-setting and intensity and overground robot exoskeleton gait are applied.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have validated a close association between inflammatory factors and multiple sclerosis (MS), but their causal relationship is not fully profiled yet. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal effect of circulating inflammatory proteins on MS. Data from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) were analyzed using a two-sample MR method to explore the relationship between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and MS. The inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) analysis was employed as the main method for evaluating exposures and outcomes. Furthermore, series of the methods of MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode were used to fortify the final results. The results of the IVW method were corrected with Bonferroni (bon) and false discovery rate (fdr) for validating the robustness of results and ensuring the absence of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. The sensitivity analysis was also performed. The results of the forward MR analysis showed that higher levels of CCL25 were found to be associated with an increased risk of MS according to IVW results, OR: 1.085, 95% CI (1.011, 1.165), p = 2.42 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;2, adjusted p_adj_bon = 1, p_adj_fdr = 0.307. Similarly, higher levels of CXCL10 were found to be associated with an increased risk of MS, OR: 1.231, 95% CI (1.057, 1.433), p = 7.49 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;3, adjusted p_adj_bon = 0.682, p_adj_fdr = 0.227. In contrast, elevated levels of neurturin (NRTN) were associated with a decreased risk of MS, OR: 0.815, 95% CI (0.689, 0.964), p = 1.68 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;2, adjusted p_adj_bon = 1, p_adj_fdr = 0.307. Reverse MR analysis showed no causal relationship between MS and the identified circulating inflammatory cytokines. The effects of heterogeneity and level pleiotropy were further excluded by sensitivity analysis. This study provides new insights into the relationship between circulating inflammatory proteins and MS and brings up a new possibility of using these cytokines as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The data in this study show that there are only weak associations between inflammatory molecules and MS risk, which did not survive bon and fdr correction, and the obtained p-values are quite low. Therefore, further studies on larger samples are needed.</p>

	<p>Motor imagery (MI) requires the mental representation of the body, obtained by integrating exteroceptive and interoceptive information. This study aimed to investigate the role of interoceptive sensitivity (IS) in MI performed through visual and kinesthetic modalities by participants with low (lows, N = 26; SHSS: A, M + SD: 1.00 + 1.52), medium (mediums, N = 11; SHSS: A, 6.00 + 0.77) and high hypnotizability scores (highs, N = 16; SHSS:A, 9.75 + 1.24), as measured by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form A. The three groups displayed different MI abilities and IS levels. The efficacy of MI was measured using the chronometric index and self-reported experience, while IS was measured using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire. Alpha and beta power spectrum densities (PSDs) were extracted from the EEG signals acquired during baseline, actual movement and visually and kinesthetically imagined movements. The chronometric indices do not reveal significant differences between groups and imagery modalities. The self-report MI efficacy indicates better kinesthetic imagery in highs and mediums than in lows, and no modality difference among lows. The MAIA dimensions sustain the differences in subjective experience and almost all the EEG differences. The latter are slightly different in highs, mediums and lows. This is the first report of the major role played by IS in MI and strongly supports the theory of embodied cognition.</p>

	<p>Long COVID (Coronavirus disease), affecting millions globally, presents unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems due to its complex, multifaceted nature and the lack of effective treatments. This perspective review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-guided transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an innovative approach to address the urgent need for effective Long COVID management. The authors examine how AI could optimize tDCS protocols, enhance clinical trial design, and facilitate personalized treatment for the heterogeneous manifestations of Long COVID. Key areas discussed include AI-driven personalization of tDCS parameters based on individual patient characteristics and real-time symptom fluctuations, the use of machine learning for patient stratification, and the development of more sensitive outcome measures in clinical trials. This perspective addresses ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and equitable access to AI-enhanced treatments. It also explores challenges and opportunities for implementing AI-guided tDCS across diverse healthcare settings globally. Future research directions are outlined, including the need for large-scale validation studies and investigations of long-term efficacy and safety. The authors argue that while AI-guided tDCS shows promise for addressing the complex nature of Long COVID, significant technical, ethical, and practical challenges remain. They emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, patient-centered approaches, and a commitment to global health equity in realizing the potential of this technology. This perspective article provides a roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers involved in developing and implementing AI-guided neuromodulation therapies for Long COVID and potentially other neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p>

	<p>Calcium imaging, especially two-photon imaging, has become essential in neuroscience for studying neuronal and astrocytic activity under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Current advances in the development of calcium sensors as well as imaging hardware enable high-frequency measurements of calcium signals in hundreds of cells simultaneously. The analysis of these large datasets requires special tools and usually a certain level of programming experience. Despite advancements in calcium imaging analysis software development, significant gaps remain, particularly for data acquired at a high sampling rate that would allow for the spectral analysis of calcium signals. The FluoAnalysis MATLAB toolbox addresses these gaps by offering a comprehensive solution for analyzing simultaneously measured calcium imaging and electrophysiological data. It features both GUI-based and command-line approaches, emphasizing frequency domain analysis to reveal network-level oscillatory signals linked to single-cell activity. In addition, the toolbox puts special emphasis on differentiating between astrocytes and neurons, revealing the interactions between the network activity of the two major cell types of the brain. It facilitates a streamlined workflow for data loading, ROI identification, cell classification, fluorescence intensity calculation, spectral analysis, and report generation, supporting both manual and automated high-throughput analysis. This versatile platform enables the comprehensive analysis of large imaging datasets. In conclusion, the FluoAnalysis MATLAB toolbox provides a robust and versatile platform for the integrated analysis of calcium imaging and electrophysiological data, supporting diverse neuroscience research applications.</p>

	<p>Current pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are often only partially effective, with many patients experiencing no significant benefit, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Psilocybin, a classical serotonergic psychedelic, has emerged as a notable emerging treatment for such disorders. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize and discuss the most recent evidence about the therapeutic effects of single-dose and two-dose psilocybin administration on the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as compare the efficacy of these interventions among patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD or TRD. Articles were collected from EBSCOhost and PubMed following the PRISMA guidelines, yielding 425 articles with 138 duplicates. After screening 287 records, 12 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. A quantitative analysis of the studies indicates that psilocybin is highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms severity among patients with primary MDD or TRD. Both single-dose and two-dose psilocybin treatments significantly reduced depressive symptoms severity, with two-dose administration sometimes yielding more pronounced and lasting effects. However, it is unclear if this was solely due to dosage or other factors. Future research should include standardized trials comparing these dosing strategies to better inform clinical practice.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

	<p>(1) Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) utilizing multi-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (ME-GE-EPI) has demonstrated higher sensitivity and stability compared to utilizing single-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (SE-GE-EPI). The direct derivation of T2* maps from fitting multi-echo data enables accurate recording of dynamic functional changes in the brain, exhibiting higher sensitivity than echo combination maps. However, the widely employed voxel-wise log-linear fitting is susceptible to inevitable noise accumulation during image acquisition. (2) Methods: This work introduced a synthetic data-driven deep learning (SD-DL) method to obtain T2* maps for multi-echo (ME) fMRI analysis. (3) Results: The experimental results showed the efficient enhancement of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), improved task-based blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) percentage signal change, and enhanced performance in multi-echo independent component analysis (MEICA) using the proposed method. (4) Conclusion: T2* maps derived from ME-fMRI data using the proposed SD-DL method exhibit enhanced BOLD sensitivity in comparison to T2* maps derived from the LLF method.</p>

	<p>In recent years, sports-related concussion (SRC) in soccer has been extensively researched worldwide. However, there have been no reports of large-scale SRC studies among soccer players in Japan. The purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of SRC among university soccer players in Japan. This descriptive epidemiological study collected data on the history of SRC and details of SRC injuries during soccer. The participants were university male soccer players belonging to the Japan University Football Association. SRC rates were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs). A total of 5953 students participated in this study. The SRC rate was 0.10/1000 AE during total activities. The SRC rate during competition (0.42/1000 AE) was higher than in practice (0.04/1000 AE). The most frequent mechanism of SRC was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (26.9%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (24.2%). During competition, the most frequent mechanism was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (30.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (19.3%) followed, while in practice, it was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (34.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (17.2%). Thus, there was a difference in the mechanism of injury between competition and practice. In this study, among Japanese university soccer players, the SRC rate was to be approximately ten times higher in competition than in practice.</p>

	<p>The current descriptive study reports the sleep, diet, and exercise patterns among 114 dementia caregivers, whose mean age was 55.7 (SD: 10.4) years, with 83 (72.8%) being women. The results indicate significant sleep dysfunction: 37.2% of caregivers reported rarely or never feeling rested upon waking, and 46.5% did not get enough sleep, with 45.6% sleeping only 5 to 5.5 h on average. Sleep latency was also prevalent, as 33.3% required 16 to 30 min to fall asleep. Dietary habits showed reliance on coffee, with 69.4% consuming it daily. Meat consumption was reported by 75%, and 60.9% ate pasta, indicating common dietary preferences. While 86.2% had one to three meals per day, 100% of the caregivers supplemented their diets with vitamins. The physical activity level was low, with 62.3% of respondents reporting no exercise in the past week. These findings underscore significant health concerns among dementia caregivers, including sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and physical inactivity. The report emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to promote self-care practices that can enhance caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; health, including better sleep hygiene, balanced nutrition, and regular exercise.</p>

	<p>Fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), one of the 30 available fatigue questionnaires, is commonly applied because it evaluates multidimensional aspects of fatigue. The chief objectives of this study were to validate FIS and evaluate the psychometric properties of MS patients in Serbia. One hundred and twenty-one (121) MS patients and one hundred and twenty-two (122) age-, gender- and education-matched healthy control (HC) subjects completed the FIS and the Beck Depression Inventory. Internal consistency of the FIS subscales was determined using Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha Coefficient. Test/retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for each FIS subscale was performed. The total FIS score and subscale scores showed statistically significant differences between the MS patients and the HC subjects in both FIS sessions. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha was 0.966. All ICCs were statistically significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The Serbian version of this instrument may be useful as a clinical measure for fatigue and functionality in patients with MS.</p>

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection. Several HCMV vaccines are in development, but none have yet been approved. An understanding of the kinetics of CMV replication and transmission may inform the rational design of vaccines to prevent this infection. The salivary glands (SG) are an important site of sustained CMV replication following primary infection and during viral reactivation from latency. As such, the strength of the immune response in the SG likely influences viral dissemination within and between hosts. To study the relationship between the immune response and viral replication in the SG, and viral dissemination from the SG to other tissues, mice were infected with low doses of murine CMV (MCMV). Following intra-SG inoculation, we characterized the viral and immunological dynamics in the SG, blood, and spleen, and identified organ-specific immune correlates of protection. Using these data, we constructed compartmental mathematical models of MCMV infection. Model fitting to data and analysis indicate the importance of cellular immune responses in different organs and point to a threshold of infection within the SG necessary for the establishment and spread of infection.

                <p>by Ao Liu, Andrea Mair, Juliana L. Matos, Macy Vollbrecht, Shou-Ling Xu, Dominique C. Bergmann</p>

The development of multicellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs, and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling—the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knockdown of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together, these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23621?af=R">17β‐Estradiol reduces inhibitory synaptic currents in entorhinal cortex neurons through G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 activation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10 nM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20 days after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20 min did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory oscillations may enhance cognitive processing through coupling with beta (β, 15–30 Hz) and gamma (γ, 30–160 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesize that coupling between olfactory bulb (OB) and HPC oscillations is increased by cholinergic activation in control rats and is reduced in kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. OB γ2 (63–100 Hz) power was higher during walking and immobility-awake (IMM) compared to sleep, while γ1 (30–57 Hz) power was higher during grooming than other behavioral states. Muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg ip) with peripheral muscarinic blockade increased OB power and OB-HPC coherence at β and γ1 frequency bands. A similar effect was found after physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg ip) but not scopolamine (10 mg/kg ip). Pilocarpine increased bicoherence and cross-frequency coherence (CFC) between OB slow waves (SW, 1–5 Hz) and hippocampal β, γ1 and γ2 waves, with stronger coherence at CA1 alveus and CA3c than CA1 stratum radiatum. Bicoherence further revealed a nonlinear interaction of β waves in OB with β waves at the CA1-alveus. Beta and γ1 waves in OB or HPC were segregated at one phase of the OB-SW, opposite to the phase of γ2 and γ3 (100–160 Hz) waves, suggesting independent temporal processing of β/γ1 versus γ2/γ3 waves. At CA1 radiatum, kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats compared to control rats showed decreased theta power, theta-β and theta-γ2 CFC during baseline walking, decreased CFC of HPC SW with γ2 and γ3 waves during baseline IMM, and decreased coupling of OB SW with β and γ2 waves at CA1 alveus after pilocarpine. It is concluded that β and γ waves in the OB and HPC are modulated by a slow respiratory rhythm, in a cholinergic and behavior-dependent manner, and OB-HPC functional connectivity at β and γ frequencies may enhance cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23625?af=R">Nogo‐A‐mediated constraints on activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity and associativity in rat hippocampal CA2 synapses</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23632?af=R">Spatial memory encoding is associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampus: An fMRI activation likelihood estimation meta‐analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that differential processing occurs along the longitudinal (anterior–posterior) axis of the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that spatial memory (during both encoding and retrieval) is associated with the posterior hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis is that memory encoding (either spatial or nonspatial) is associated with the anterior hippocampus and memory retrieval is associated with the posterior hippocampus. Of importance, during spatial memory encoding, the spatial–posterior hypothesis predicts posterior hippocampal involvement, whereas the encoding–retrieval hypothesis predicts anterior hippocampal involvement. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted a coordinate-based fMRI activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 26 studies (with a total of 435 participants) that reported hippocampal activity during spatial memory encoding and/or spatial memory retrieval. Both spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced extensive activity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the contrast of spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced activations in both the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus. That spatial memory encoding produced activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus can be taken to reject strict forms of the spatial–posterior hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of spatial memory produce activity in the posterior hippocampus, and the encoding–retrieval hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of encoding versus retrieval produce activity in only the anterior hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory encoding can involve the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-402/v2?src=rss">Anticancer activities of tocotrienols: A Systematic Scoping Review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The increasing number of cancer cases requires developing newer approaches to treat this disease. One approach uses natural compounds with known anticancer effects, such as tocotrienols. Many cell-based and animal-model studies found that tocotrienols possess potent anticancer activities. However, the exact molecular regulatory mechanism through which tocotrienols exert anticancer actions remains unclear. Methods: This scoping review analysed data from original research articles reporting on the anticancer effects of tocotrienols on human cancer cell lines published in the last seven years (January 2015 and September 2021) using a systematic scoping review approach. From the initial 619 research papers [ProQuest (n= 61), PubMed (n= 84), Embase (n = 148), Ovid Medline (n =53), Scopus (n = 137), Web of Science (n =136)] identified using pre-defined keywords, only 37 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review. Human cancers commonly studied in the 37 research articles include breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines. Results: The analysis showed that exposing human cancer cell lines to tocotrienols triggered common anticancer mechanisms such as activation of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis and cell migration through regulation of key regulatory genes and proteins involved in these pathways. Conclusions: The findings show that tocotrienols regulate a number of biomarkers that induce cell death and regulate cell cycle in various types of human cancer cells. Further targeted studies are required to map the definite pathways by which T3 exerts their action and to better understand the cellular actions and the regulatory pathways.

                Alternative splicing critically regulates brain development. Yang et al. found that spliceosomal factor Eftud2 is essential for Purkinje cell (PC) development, survival, and cerebellar integrity by preventing ferroptosis. Inhibition of ferroptosis efficiently rescues PC death in Eftud2-deficient mice. These findings provide a promising therapeutic strategy for EFTUD2 deficiency-induced diseases.

                Tian et al. demonstrate that the activity of cells in the mouse globus pallidus can predict neurophysiological and behavioral responses to cocaine. This discovery leads to the identification of carnosic acid, derived from the ancient medicinal plant rosemary, as a potential therapeutic that reduces cocaine reward and self-administration.

                Aitken et al. show that the taste of food inhibits hunger-promoting neurons in the hypothalamus and that this gustatory feedback controls the duration of a meal. This reveals how appetitive taste cues, which are traditionally thought to promote food intake, can simultaneously initiate the process of meal termination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81571">Membrane curvature sensing and symmetry breaking of the M2 proton channel from Influenza A</a></h4>

              
                The M2 proton channel aids in the exit of mature influenza viral particles from the host plasma membrane through its ability to stabilize regions of high negative gaussian curvature (NGC) that occur at the neck of budding virions. The channels are homo-tetramers that contain a cytoplasm-facing amphipathic helix (AH) that is necessary and sufficient for NGC generation; however, constructs containing the transmembrane spanning helix, which facilitates tetramerization, exhibit enhanced curvature generation. Here we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of M2 channels in lipid bilayers revealing that the AH is dynamic, quickly breaking the 4-fold symmetry observed in most structures. Next, we carried out MD simulations with the protein restrained in 4-fold and 2-fold symmetric conformations to determine the impact on the membrane shape. While each pattern was distinct, all configurations induced pronounced curvature in the outer leaflet, while conversely, the inner leaflets showed minimal curvature and significant lipid tilt around the AHs. The MD-generated profiles at the protein-membrane interface were then extracted and used as boundary conditions in a continuum elastic membrane model to calculate the membrane bending energy of each conformation embedded in different membrane surfaces characteristic of a budding virus. The calculations show that all three M2 conformations are stabilized in inward-budding, concave spherical caps and destabilized in outward-budding, convex spherical caps, the latter reminiscent of a budding virus. One of the C2-broken symmetry conformations is stabilized by 4 kT in NGC surfaces with the minimum energy conformation occurring at a curvature corresponding to 33 nm radii. In total, our work provides atomistic insight into the curvature sensing capabilities of M2 channels and how enrichment in the nascent viral particle depends on protein shape and membrane geometry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92826">Hyperglycemia induced cathepsin L maturation linked to diabetic comorbidities and COVID-19 mortality</a></h4>

              
                Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with <i>CTSL</i> knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i>mice and <i>Lepr<sup>db/+</sup></i>mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91568">Biocalcification in porcelaneous foraminifera</a></h4>

              
                Living organisms control the formation of mineral skeletons and other structures through biomineralization. Major phylogenetic groups usually consistently follow a single biomineralization pathway. Foraminifera, which are very efficient marine calcifiers, making a substantial contribution to global carbonate production and global carbon sequestration, are regarded as an exception. This phylum has been commonly thought to follow two contrasting models of either <i>in situ</i> ‘mineralization of extracellular matrix’ attributed to hyaline rotaliid shells, or ‘mineralization within intracellular vesicles’ attributed to porcelaneous miliolid shells. Our previous results on rotaliids along with those on miliolids in this paper question such a wide divergence of biomineralization pathways within the same phylum of Foraminifera. We have found under a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that precipitation of high-Mg calcitic mesocrystals in porcelaneous shells takes place <i>in situ</i> and form a dense, chaotic meshwork of needle-like crystallites. We have not observed calcified needles that already precipitated in the transported vesicles, what challenges the previous model of miliolid mineralization. Hence, Foraminifera probably utilize less divergent calcification pathways, following the recently discovered biomineralization principles. Mesocrystalline chamber walls in both models are therefore most likely created by intravesicular accumulation of pre-formed liquid amorphous mineral phase deposited and crystallized within the extracellular organic matrix enclosed in a biologically controlled privileged space by active pseudopodial structures. Both calcification pathways evolved independently in the Paleozoic and are well conserved in two clades that represent different chamber formation modes.

	<p>Objectives: Hypersensitive acupoints in specific body areas are associated with corresponding internal or visceral disorders. Back-shu points are clinically significant for the diagnosis of visceral organ disease, according to the biomechanical characteristics of the acupoints. In this study, we assessed the biomechanical characteristics and pain sensitivities of five back-shu points linked to five visceral organs in healthy participants. Methods: The study included 48 volunteer participants. A myotonometry was used to assess muscle tone and muscle stiffness at five back-shu points associated with visceral organs. Pressure was monitored using a microcontroller and a force sensor. Pain sensitivity was assessed in response to deep pressure pain produced by a constant force. Results: Substantial differences in muscle tone and stiffness were observed at the five back-shu points; muscle tone was highest at BL15, whereas muscle tone and muscle stiffness were lowest at BL23. Moreover, pain sensitivity was significantly different among the acupoints; pain sensitivity was highest at BL23. There was a significant negative correlation between muscle tone and pain sensitivity. Conclusions: We found significant differences in muscle tone, muscle stiffness, and pain sensitivity among five back-shu points associated with visceral organs, which may be attributable to anatomical variations at each point. Our findings suggest that differences at back-shu points should be considered to ensure the accurate diagnosis of visceral disease.</p>

	<p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered one of the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders. ECT has proven effective in the treatment of depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It is presumed that seizures induced during ECT administration cause toxicity and potentially neuronal and glial cell death. A broad range of neurological disorders increase cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100b protein. This study aims to investigate the effect of ECT on NSE and S-100b levels, which, together, serve as a proxy for neuronal cell damage. Serum concentrations of S-100b and NSE of adult patients who received ECT were measured by immunoluminometric analysis before and after treatment. A two-way ANOVA test was used to estimate the statistical differences in marker concentrations between the subgroups of the study population. Results: A total of 55 patients were included in the analysis: 52.73% (n = 29) were diagnosed with depression, 21.82% (n = 12) with schizophrenia or other psychosis, 16.36% (n = 9) with mania and 9.09% (n = 5) with catatonia. There were no statistically significant changes in NSE (p = 0.288) and S-100b (p = 0.243) levels. We found no evidence that ECT induced neuronal damage based on NSE and S-100b protein levels measured in the serum of patients before and after treatment.</p>

	<p>Tracheostomy ventilation (TV) can increase survival time for people living with motor neurone disease (MND); however, the use of TV varies between countries. Concerns regarding anticipated quality of life (QoL) are among the reasons given by healthcare professionals for not recommending this intervention, yet little is known about QoL in this context. This scoping review was conducted to examine the evidence on QoL for those with MND who use TV and family members involved in their care. Using the methodological guidance of the Joanna Briggs Institute, 23 papers were identified for inclusion, and findings were inductively analysed to identify key themes. We found that people living with MND tend to rate QoL post TV more positively than anticipated by healthcare professionals or family members. QoL was found to be related to positive relationships and activities the person could maintain. Feeling able to make a choice and an adequate level of financial resources were also important factors. Family members tended to experience lower QoL, associated with the uncertainty surrounding an emergency procedure and the complexity of subsequently required care. More evidence on QoL from the perspectives of people with MND who use TV is needed to support decision making and inform guidance.</p>

	<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can objectively reflect a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional state and have been widely studied in emotion recognition. However, the effective feature fusion and discriminative feature learning from EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS data is challenging. In order to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition, a graph convolution and capsule attention network model (GCN-CA-CapsNet) is proposed. Firstly, EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS signals are collected from 50 subjects induced by emotional video clips. And then, the features of the EEG and fNIRS are extracted; the EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS features are fused to generate higher-quality primary capsules by graph convolution with the Pearson correlation adjacency matrix. Finally, the capsule attention module is introduced to assign different weights to the primary capsules, and higher-quality primary capsules are selected to generate better classification capsules in the dynamic routing mechanism. We validate the efficacy of the proposed method on our emotional EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS dataset with an ablation study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GCN-CA-CapsNet method achieves a more satisfactory performance against the state-of-the-art methods, and the average accuracy can increase by 3&amp;amp;ndash;11%.</p>

	<p>This study investigated relations between a measure of early-stage visual function and self-reported visual anomalies in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Eleven individuals at CHR identified via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) were recruited from a CHR-P research program in NYC. The sample was ~36% female, ranging from 16 to 33 years old (M = 23.90, SD = 6.14). Participants completed a contrast sensitivity task on an iPad with five spatial frequencies (0.41&amp;amp;ndash;13 cycles/degree) and completed the self-report Audio-Visual Abnormalities Questionnaire. Higher contrast sensitivity (better performance) to low spatial frequencies was associated with higher perceptual (r = 0.616, p = 0.044) and visual disturbances (r = 0.667, p = 0.025); lower contrast sensitivity to a middle spatial frequency was also associated with higher perceptual (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.604, p = 0.049) and visual disturbances (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.606, p = 0.048). This relation between the questionnaire and contrast sensitivity to low spatial frequency may be indicative of a reduction in lateral inhibition and &amp;amp;ldquo;flooding&amp;amp;rdquo; of environmental stimuli. The association with middle spatial frequencies, which play a critical role in face processing, may result in a range of perceptual abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that self-reported perceptual anomalies occur in these individuals and are linked to performance on a measure of early visual processing.</p>

                Background In Australia, we are not meeting our goals in relation to breastfeeding overall, and in particular, promoting and supporting breastfeeding rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies especially breastfeeding to at least six months. The WHO has recognised the importance of exclusively breastfeeding a baby for a minimum of six months to ensure a healthy start to life. Breastfeeding has been shown to be a protective factor against asthma and allergy development, ear disease, infections, respiratory illness and gastrointestinal issues. This study aims to improve predominant breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies in the Perth Metropolitan area (Western Australia, Australia). Methods and analysis We will use an interrupted time series design to determine the effectiveness of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program delivered over 6 months by selected community health staff. The intervention will be delivered at two community health regions and the remaining 17 community health regions will be the control group. The primary outcomes will be predominant breastfeeding rates at two and four months, and secondary outcomes will include any breastfeeding at two and four months, and hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and immunisation data at 6 months. Discussion The study will allow us to determine the breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal babies, identify the barriers and enablers to initiating and maintaining breastfeeding and determine whether a CQI program can achieve improvements in breastfeeding rates.

Reducing spillover of zoonotic pathogens is an appealing approach to preventing human disease and minimizing the risk of future epidemics and pandemics. Although the immediate human health benefit of reducing spillover is clear, over time, spillover reduction could lead to counterintuitive negative consequences for human health. Here, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to explore the conditions under which unanticipated consequences of spillover reduction can occur in systems where the severity of disease increases with age at infection. Our results demonstrate that, because the average age at infection increases as spillover is reduced, programs that reduce spillover can actually increase population-level disease burden if the clinical severity of infection increases sufficiently rapidly with age. If, however, immunity wanes over time and reinfection is possible, our results reveal that negative health impacts of spillover reduction become substantially less likely. When our model is parameterized using published data on Lassa virus in West Africa, it predicts that negative health outcomes are possible, but likely to be restricted to a small subset of populations where spillover is unusually intense. Together, our results suggest that adverse consequences of spillover reduction programs are unlikely but that the public health gains observed immediately after spillover reduction may fade over time as the age structure of immunity gradually re-equilibrates to a reduced force of infection.

                <p>by Rachael Stentiford, James C. Knight, Thomas Nowotny, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

The central complex of insects contains cells, organised as a ring attractor, that encode head direction. The ‘bump’ of activity in the ring can be updated by idiothetic cues and external sensory information. Plasticity at the synapses between these cells and the ring neurons, that are responsible for bringing sensory information into the central complex, has been proposed to form a mapping between visual cues and the heading estimate which allows for more accurate tracking of the current heading, than if only idiothetic information were used. In Drosophila, ring neurons have well characterised non-linear receptive fields. In this work we produce synthetic versions of these visual receptive fields using a combination of excitatory inputs and mutual inhibition between ring neurons. We use these receptive fields to bring visual information into a spiking neural network model of the insect central complex based on the recently published Drosophila connectome. Previous modelling work has focused on how this circuit functions as a ring attractor using the same type of simple visual cues commonly used experimentally. While we initially test the model on these simple stimuli, we then go on to apply the model to complex natural scenes containing multiple conflicting cues. We show that this simple visual filtering provided by the ring neurons is sufficient to form a mapping between heading and visual features and maintain the heading estimate in the absence of angular velocity input. The network is successful at tracking heading even when presented with videos of natural scenes containing conflicting information from environmental changes and translation of the camera.

Enteric pathogens navigate distinct regional microenvironments within the intestine that cue important adaptive behaviors. We investigated the response of <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>, a model of human pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection in mice, to regional gastrointestinal pH. We found that small intestinal pH (4.4–4.8) triggered virulence gene expression and altered cell morphology, supporting initial intestinal attachment, while higher pH, representative of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i>’s replicative niches further along the murine intestine, supported pathogen growth. Gastric pH, a key barrier to intestinal colonization, caused significant accumulation of intra-bacterial reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting growth of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i> and related human pathogens. Within-host adaptation increased gastric acid survival, which may be due to a robust acid tolerance response (ATR) induced at colonic pH. However, the intestinal environment changes throughout the course of infection. We found that murine gastric pH decreases postinfection, corresponding to increased serum gastrin levels and altered host expression of acid secretion-related genes. Similar responses following <i>Salmonella</i> infection may indicate a protective host response to limit further pathogen ingestion. Together, we highlight interlinked bacterial and host adaptive pH responses as an important component of host–pathogen coevolution.

                <p>by Alex E. Yuan, Wenying Shou</p>

In disciplines from biology to climate science, a routine task is to compute a correlation between a pair of time series and determine whether the correlation is statistically significant (i.e., unlikely under the null hypothesis that the time series are independent). This problem is challenging because time series typically exhibit autocorrelation and thus cannot be properly analyzed with the standard iid-oriented statistical tests. Although there are well-known parametric tests for time series, these are designed for linear correlation statistics and thus not suitable for the increasingly popular nonlinear correlation statistics. There are also nonparametric tests that can be used with any correlation statistic, but for these, the conditions that guarantee correct false positive rates are either restrictive or unclear. Here, we describe the truncated time-shift (TTS) test, a nonparametric procedure to test for dependence between 2 time series. We prove that this test correctly controls the false positive rate as long as one of the time series is stationary, a minimally restrictive requirement among current tests. The TTS test is versatile because it can be used with any correlation statistic. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that this test performs correctly even while other tests suffer high false positive rates. In simulation examples, simple guidelines for parameter choices allow high statistical power to be achieved with sufficient data. We apply the test to datasets from climatology, animal behavior, and microbiome science, verifying previously discovered dependence relationships and detecting additional relationships.

A new study in <i>PLOS Biology</i> reports that ADP released by stressed cells is a signal that triggers HMT.

                <p>by Kevin Gross, Carl T. Bergstrom</p>

Scientific research requires taking risks, as the most cautious approaches are unlikely to lead to the most rapid progress. Yet, much funded scientific research plays it safe and funding agencies bemoan the difficulty of attracting high-risk, high-return research projects. Why don’t the incentives for scientific discovery adequately impel researchers toward such projects? Here, we adapt an economic contracting model to explore how the unobservability of risk and effort discourages risky research. The model considers a hidden-action problem, in which the scientific community must reward discoveries in a way that encourages effort and risk-taking while simultaneously protecting researchers’ livelihoods against the vicissitudes of scientific chance. Its challenge when doing so is that incentives to motivate effort clash with incentives to motivate risk-taking, because a failed project may be evidence of a risky undertaking but could also be the result of simple sloth. As a result, the incentives needed to encourage effort actively discourage risk-taking. Scientists respond by working on safe projects that generate evidence of effort but that don’t move science forward as rapidly as riskier projects would. A social planner who prizes scientific productivity above researchers’ well-being could remedy the problem by rewarding major discoveries richly enough to induce high-risk research, but in doing so would expose scientists to a degree of livelihood risk that ultimately leaves them worse off. Because the scientific community is approximately self-governing and constructs its own reward schedule, the incentives that researchers are willing to impose on themselves are inadequate to motivate the scientific risks that would best expedite scientific progress.

                <p>by Jessica E. Buddle, Lucy M. Thompson, Anne S. Williams, Rosanna C. T. Wright, William M. Durham, Claire E. Turner, Roy R. Chaudhuri, Michael A. Brockhurst, Robert P. Fagan</p>

<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> is an important human pathogen, for which there are very limited treatment options, primarily the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. In recent years, vancomycin resistance has emerged as a serious problem in several gram-positive pathogens, but high-level resistance has yet to be reported for <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>, although it is not known if this is due to constraints upon resistance evolution in this species. Here, we show that resistance to vancomycin can evolve rapidly under ramping selection but is accompanied by fitness costs and pleiotropic trade-offs, including sporulation defects that would be expected to severely impact transmission. We identified 2 distinct pathways to resistance, both of which are predicted to result in changes to the muropeptide terminal D-Ala-D-Ala that is the primary target of vancomycin. One of these pathways involves a previously uncharacterised D,D-carboxypeptidase, expression of which is controlled by a dedicated two-component signal transduction system. Our findings suggest that while <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> is capable of evolving high-level vancomycin resistance, this outcome may be limited clinically due to pleiotropic effects on key pathogenicity traits. Moreover, our data identify potential mutational routes to resistance that should be considered in genomic surveillance.

Protein import and genome replication are essential processes for mitochondrial biogenesis and propagation. The J-domain proteins Pam16 and Pam18 regulate the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the protozoan <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, their counterparts are TbPam16 and TbPam18, which are essential for the procyclic form (PCF) of the parasite, though not involved in mitochondrial protein import. Here, we show that during evolution, the 2 proteins have been repurposed to regulate the replication of maxicircles within the intricate kDNA network, the most complex mitochondrial genome known. TbPam18 and TbPam16 have inactive J-domains suggesting a function independent of heat shock proteins. However, their single transmembrane domain is essential for function. Pulldown of TbPam16 identifies a putative client protein, termed MaRF11, the depletion of which causes the selective loss of maxicircles, akin to the effects observed for TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, depletion of the mitochondrial proteasome results in increased levels of MaRF11. Thus, we have discovered a protein complex comprising TbPam18, TbPam16, and MaRF11, that controls maxicircle replication. We propose a working model in which the matrix protein MaRF11 functions downstream of the 2 integral inner membrane proteins TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, we suggest that the levels of MaRF11 are controlled by the mitochondrial proteasome.

                Purpose To explore how principles of social justice and equity are integrated into research concerning accessibility to public buildings for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Utilising a scoping review methodology to assess literature based on the criteria set by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were screened. Studies were selected using the framework: “persons with mobility disabilities” AND “accessibility” AND “public buildings”. A theoretical framework helped to extract codes and develop themes through an inductive-deductive analysis method. The results are presented descriptively. Results The examination of 84 studies uncovered a complex interplay between agencies, systemic challenges, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes perpetuating marginalisation of individuals with mobility disabilities in their access to public buildings. The recommendations emphasize importance of practical measures, research imperatives, and policy developments to promote inclusivity. We present a ‘Ten-step approach’ to integrate social justice and equity into research on accessibility in public buildings for people with mobility disabilities. Conclusion Integrating diversity, active participation, and inclusive methodologies are essential to address systemic issues, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes that hinder accessibility and inclusion. Collaborations with diverse stakeholders are crucial for policy changes, resource allocation, and advancing social justice and equity in accessibility research and practice.

                Background Food security’s multidimensional nature poses challenges in measurement and policy targeting. This comprehensive study explores the nexus between small-scale irrigation and household food security in Raya Kobo Woreda, Ethiopia, in a cross-sectional data. Methods Employing a two-stage sampling technique, the research examines 152 irrigation participants and 196 non-participants. Utilizing descriptive and econometric models, including a binary logit model and propensity score matching. Results The study reveals that 15% of participants and 12% of non-participants are food secure. Descriptive analysis reveals positive correlations between irrigation participation and household food security, dietary diversity, and food consumption scores. Econometric analysis identifies factors influencing participation, such as the age of the household head, family size and tropical livestock units have negative relationship with irrigation participation while the importance of agriculture is found to be positively associated with irrigation participation. Propensity score matching reveals a substantial positive impact on household expenditure, reaffirmed through sensitivity analysis. Conclusion The findings contribute to understanding the complexities of small-scale irrigation in enhancing rural livelihoods and emphasize the importance of targeted interventions for sustained positive outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-928/v1?src=rss">The Impact of Smoking and Hypertension on Cataract Development in Diabetic Patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cataracts are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness globally, with a particularly high incidence in diabetic patients due to the complex interplay of metabolic dysregulation and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Diabetic cataract development is influenced by several modifiable risk factors including smoking and hypertension, which may exacerbate lens opacity through various biological mechanisms. This study aims to determine the effects of smoking and hypertension on cataract development in diabetic patients. Methods Conducted from December 2022 to November 2023, this cross-sectional study at a specialized diabetes and ophthalmology healthcare facility involved 60 diabetic patients. The participants were divided into two groups: those with cataracts (n=32) and those without (n=28). Data collection focused on demographics, smoking history, hypertension status, and cataract presence, using structured interviews and medical record reviews. Logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between cataracts and potential risk factors, adjusting for age, diabetes duration, and glycemic control. Results Age and genderfi were not significantly different between the two groups, with mean ages of 50.21±14.34 years in the cataract group and 49.41±12.15 years in the non-cataract group (P=0.087). The prevalence of smoking was similar between those with cataracts (14.3%) and without (15.6%), showing no significant association (P=0.885). Hypertension was more prevalent in the cataract group (71.4%) compared to the non-cataract group (53.1%), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.146). Logistic regression analysis indicated that smoking had a minimal effect on cataract development (OR=1.187; 95% CI=0.264-5.33; P=0.823), and while hypertension showed a stronger association (OR=2.277; 95% CI=0.749-6.92), it also lacked statistical significance (P=0.147). Conclusion Neither smoking nor hypertension showed significant associations with cataract development. These findings suggest that the influence of these factors on cataract progression may differ in diabetic individuals due to the complex interplay of metabolic and vascular changes associated with the condition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-927/v1?src=rss">Platelet indices as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndrome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute coronary syndromes refer to STEMI, NSTEMI and unstable angina. The preferred biomarkers for assessing myocardial damage are cTnI and cTnT, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are recommended in clinical practice. Other biomarkers such as CK-MB have lower sensitivity and specificity. Platelets play a major role in thrombosis, which is a causative factor for most acute coronary syndromes. In our study, we attempted to analyze the effectiveness of platelet indices (mean platelet volume, platelet count, and platelet distribution width) as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndromes. Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, and plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers. Methods A total of 290 subjects were recruited for the study, including 145 cases and 145 controls matched for sex and age. Cases presented with the first episode of acute coronary syndrome. Controls are those without acute coronary syndrome during present admission or in the past. Results MPV and plateletcrit correlated with both troponin T and pro-BNP, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with troponin T. The only significant correlation was between the plateletcrit and pro-BNP levels. The plateletcrit showed a positive correlation with other parameters (degree of ventricular dysfunction, severity of coronary artery disease, and presence of arrhythmia). On comparing platelet indices with risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, MPV showed a positive correlation with HbA1c and the entire lipid profile, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with HbA1c and triglycerides. The plateletcrit was positively correlated with HbA1c and total cholesterol levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, whereas plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research. Trial registration NCT06239740, February 2, 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov.

                Future viability depends on ensuring a sustainable society because green energy methods may efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, stakeholders, consumers, and developers continue to be notably ignorant of the financial incentives connected to green technology. Moreover, there is still a dearth of studies on the range of financial incentives offered by different authorities in India. Monetary incentives, such as tax breaks, indirect tax exemptions, and refunds, are crucial in encouraging the use of green technology in the modern world. This study explores the importance of financial incentives for green building technologies in India, which also looks at the wide range of incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Furthermore, the study highlights various state government programs such as goods subsidies, exemptions from local taxes, and fee waivers. Notably, several incentives aimed at consumers, developers, and other stakeholders have been implemented by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This review study emphasizes the effectiveness of financial incentives in green construction projects and draws attention to a clear knowledge gap regarding the adoption of green technology. This study also provides insights into potential future directions. Studies and research results emphasize the importance of spreading the word about financial incentives as a key factor in determining the adoption of green technologies. Many parties, including governmental organizations, municipal governments, developers, and clients engaged in green building technology projects, stand to gain increased awareness.

                Background: Conversion therapy practices (CTPs) are discredited efforts that target lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, Two-Spirit, or other (LGBTQ2S+) people and seek to change, deny, or discourage their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of CTPs across Canadian provinces and territories and identify whether CTP bans reduce the prevalence of CTPs. Methods: We collected 119 CTPs from 31 adults (18+) in Canada who have direct experience with CTPs, know people who have gone to CTPs, or know of conversion therapy practitioners using a 2020 anonymous online survey. Mapping analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Online. CTP prevalence was compared between provinces/territories with and without bans using chi-square tests. Results: Three provinces and eleven municipalities had CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories with bans was 2.34 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 1.65, 3.31). The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 4.13 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 3.32, 5.14). Accounting for the underlying population, provinces/territories with the highest prevalence of CTPs per 1,000,000 population were New Brunswick (6.69), Nova Scotia (6.50), and Saskatchewan (6.37). Conclusions: Findings suggest only 55% of Canadians were protected under CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 1.76 times greater than provinces/territories with bans. CTPs are occurring in most provinces/territories, with higher prevalence in the west and the Atlantic. These findings and continued efforts to monitor CTP prevalence can help inform policymakers and legislators as society is increasingly acknowledging CTPs as a threat to the health and well-being of LGBTQ2S+ people.

                Abstract* Background Uncaria nervosa Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of Uncaria nervosa Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects Methods This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. Results The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, Nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.01,14.04,9] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate. The ethanol extract of Uncaria nervosa Elmer leaves contains nine compounds consisting of alkaloids, terpenoids, and fatty acid. The bioactive compounds that were successfully isolated were betulinic acid, and ursolic acid, with IC50 values of ˃100 and 14,70±4,50 μg/ml, respectively. These compounds were reported in this plant for the first time. Conclusion Betulinic acid, and ursolic acid have been successfully isolated from leaves Uncaria nervosa Elmer, and ursolic acid have moderate cytotoxic activity on T47D breast cancer cells.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early life, or juvenility, stands out as the most pivotal phase in neurodevelopment due to its profound impact over the long-term cognition. During this period, significant changes are made in the brain's connections both within and between different areas, particularly in tandem with the development of more intricate behaviors. The hippocampus is among the brain regions that undergo significant postnatal remodeling, including dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, the formation of complex spines and neuron proliferation. Given the crucial role of the hippocampus in spatial memory processing, it has been observed that spatial memory abilities continue to develop as the hippocampus matures, particularly before puberty. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor channel is crucial for the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation in both rodents and humans. Although extensive evidence shows the role of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, the studies addressing the role of NMDAr in spatial memory of juveniles are sparse and mostly limited to adult males. In the present study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMDAr blockade by the MK-801 on spatial memory (novel object location memory, OLM) and hippocampal plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of both male and female juvenile rats. Our results show the sex-dimorphic role of NMDAr in spatial memory and plasticity during juvenility, as systemic NMDAr blockade impairs the OLM and LTP in juvenile males without an effect on juvenile females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity are NMDAr-dependent in juvenile males and NMDAr-independent in juvenile females. These sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of spatial memory and plasticity may imply gender-specific treatment for spatial memory disorders even in children.</p>
