              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Muscle transcriptomics shows overexpression of cadherin 1 in inclusion body myositis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to elucidate the molecular features of inclusion body myositis (IBM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed RNA sequencing analysis of muscle biopsy samples from 67 participants, consisting of 58 patients of myositis with the pathological finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I (43 IBM, 6 polymyositis, and 9 unclassifiable myositis), and 9 controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in IBM and polymyositis were mostly comparable. However, pathways related to cell adhesion molecules were upregulated in IBM as compared with polymyositis and controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Notably, <i>CDH1,</i> which encodes the epidermal cell junction protein cadherin 1, was overexpressed in the muscles of IBM, which was validated by another RNA-sequencing dataset from previous publications. Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature cadherin 1 protein in the muscles of IBM. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positivity for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in the muscles of IBM while there was no muscle fiber positive for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, antisynthetase syndrome, and controls. The fibers stained with anti-cadherin 1 antibody did not have rimmed vacuoles or abnormal protein accumulation. Experimental skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation systems showed that <i>CDH1</i> is expressed during skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CDH1</i> was detected as a differentially expressed gene and immunohistochemistry showed that cadherin 1 exists in the muscles of IBM while it was rarely seen in those of other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Cadherin 1 upregulation in muscle could provide a valuable clue to the pathological mechanisms of IBM.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Going beyond primary motor cortex to improve brain–computer interfaces</a></h4>

              
                Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) for movement restoration typically decode the user’s intent from neural activity in their primary motor cortex (M1) and use this information to enable ‘mental control’ of an external device. Here, we argue that activity in M1 has both too little and too much information for optimal decoding: too little, in that many regions beyond it contribute unique motor outputs and have movement-related information that is absent or otherwise difficult to resolve from M1 activity; and too much, in that motor commands are tangled up with nonmotor processes such as attention and feedback processing, potentially hindering decoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia integration into human midbrain organoids leads to increased neuronal maturation and functionality.</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is a complex, three-dimensional structure. To better recapitulate brain complexity, recent efforts have focused on the development of human specific midbrain organoids. Human iPSC-derived midbrain organoids consist of differentiated and functional neurons, which contain active synapses, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the absence of microglia, with their ability to remodel neuronal networks and phagocytose apoptotic cells and debris, represents a major disadvantage for the current midbrain organoid systems. Additionally, neuro-inflammation related disease modeling is not possible in the absence of microglia. So far, no studies about the effects of human iPSC-derived microglia on midbrain organoid neural cells have been published. Here we describe an approach to derive microglia from human iPSCs and integrate them into iPSC-derived midbrain organoids. Using single nuclear RNA Sequencing, we provide a detailed characterization of microglia in midbrain organoids as well as the influence of their presence on the other cells of the organoids. Furthermore, we describe the effects that microglia have on cell death and oxidative stress-related gene expression. Finally, we show that microglia in midbrain organoids affect synaptic remodeling and increase neuronal excitability. Altogether, we show a more suitable system to further investigate brain development, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and neuro-inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A snapshot of brain and cognition in healthy mid-life and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in memory are seen as a canonical sign of ageing and a prodrome to dementia in older adults. However, the nature of cognitive and brain changes across a wider aperture of adulthood is not well known. We quantify the relationship between cognitive function and brain morphology from mid-life to older adulthood, and the influence of age, sex, amyloid and genetic risk for dementia. We analyzed three observational cohorts (PISA, AIBL, ADNI) with cognitive, genetic and neuroimaging measures comprising a total of 1570 healthy mid-life and older adults (mean age 72, range 49-90 years, 1330 males) and 1365 age- and sex-matched adults with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. Among healthy adults, we find robust modes of co-variation between regional sulcal width and multidomain cognitive function that change from mid-life to the older age range. The most prominent cortical changes in mid-life are predominantly associated with changes in executive functions, whereas they are most strongly associated with poorer memory function in older age. These cognitive changes are accompanied by an age-dependent pattern of sulcal widening. Amyloid exerts a weak, but significant, influence on cognition, but not on sulcal width. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele also exerts a weak influence on cognition, but only significantly in the (larger and older) AIBL cohort. These findings provide new insights into brain and cognition in mid-life and older adults, suggesting that cognitive screening in mid-life cohorts should encompass executive functions as well as memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing Variability of Audiovisual Speech Perception Based on Periodic and Aperiodic Features of Prestimulus Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                Burgeoning pieces of evidence support the idea that differences in the properties of large-scale cortical networks underlie perceptual variability. Here, employing psychophysical experiments in tandem with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we explored the inter-individual and inter-trial differences in McGurk percept to probe the underlying brain dynamics before (prestimulus) and after (poststimulus) the stimulus presentation. Initially, based on our participants' (n = 18) overall susceptibility to the McGurk effect, we categorized them into two groups - 'rare' and 'frequent' groups of perceivers. Subsequently, we investigated the differences in their neuronal dynamics manifested in the oscillatory properties of the prestimulus and compared it with the poststimulus EEG signals during the McGurk perception (audio- /pa/, video- /ka/) and, also during the perception of the congruent audiovisual (AV) stimuli (syllables /pa/, /ta/, and /ka/). We primarily focused on the power spectrum components (periodic oscillations and aperiodic components) and global coherence. At the inter-individual and inter-trial level, we observed that for the prestimulus duration, the 'rare' perceivers' aperiodic (or "background" 1/f) component elicited a lower beta band (15-30 Hz) and gamma band (31-45 Hz) activity than the 'frequent' group of perceivers. Moreover, the periodic oscillations for the 'rare' group showed significance in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta bands during the prestimulus time window. 'Rare' perceivers also showed an increased global coherence in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha, and beta bands but a lower gamma band activity than the 'frequent' perceivers. Finally, 'rare' perceivers elicited higher cross-hemispheric connectivity (imaginary coherence) than the 'frequent' group at the source across different frequency bands, supporting the notion that the fluctuations in the distributed large-scale network underlie the perceptual variability in speech across individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiscale computer modeling of spreading depolarization in brain slices</a></h4>

              
                Spreading depolarization (SD) is a slow-moving wave of neuronal depolarization accompanied by a breakdown of ion concentration homeostasis, followed by long periods of neuronal silence (spreading depression), and associated with several neurological conditions. We developed multiscale (ions to tissue slice) computer models of SD in brain slices using the NEURON simulator: 36,000 neurons (2 voltage-gated ion channels; 3 leak channels; 3 ion exchangers/pumps) in the extracellular space (ECS) of a slice (1 mm sides, varying thickness) with ion (K+ , Cl-, Na+) and O2 diffusion and equilibration with a surrounding bath. Glia and neurons cleared K+ from the ECS via Na+/K+ pumps. SD propagated through the slices at realistic speeds of 2-5 mm/min, which was augmented by 25-30% in models incorporating the effects of hypoxia or of propionate. In both cases, the speedup was mediated principally by ECS shrinkage. Our model allows us to make the following testable predictions: 1. SD can be inhibited by enlarging ECS volume; 2. SD velocity will be greater in areas with greater neuronal density, total neuronal volume, or larger/more dendrites; 3. SD is all-or-none: initiating K+ bolus properties have little impact on SD speed; 4. Slice thickness influences SD due to relative hypoxia in the slice core, exacerbated by SD in a pathological cycle; 5. Higher neuronal spike rates and faster spread will be observed in the core than the periphery of perfused slice during SD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Retinal Basis of Photoaversion in Neonatal Mice</a></h4>

              
                Aversive responses to bright light (photoaversion) require signaling from the eye to the brain. Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) encode absolute light intensity and are thought to provide the light signals for photoaversion. Consistent with this, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion prior to the developmental onset of image vision, and melanopsin deletion abolishes photoaversion in neonates. It is not well understood how the population of ipRGCs, which constitutes multiple physiologically distinct types (denoted M1-M6 in mouse) encodes light stimuli to produce an aversive response. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that M1 ipRGCs that lack the Brn3b transcription factor drive photoaversion in neonatal mice. First, neonatal mice lacking TRPC6 and TRPC7 ion channels failed to turn away from bright light, while two photon Ca2+ imaging of their acutely isolated retinas revealed reduced photosensitivity in M1 ipRGCs, but not other ipRGC types. Second, mice in which all ipRGC types except for Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs are ablated, exhibited normal photoaversion. Third, pharmacological blockade or genetic knockout of gap junction channels expressed by ipRGCs, which reduces the light sensitivity of M2-M6 ipRGCs in the neonatal retina, had small effects on photoaversion only at the brightest light intensities. Finally, M1s were not strongly depolarized by spontaneous retinal waves, a robust source of activity in the developing retina that depolarizes all other ipRGC types. M1s therefore constitute a separate information channel between the neonatal retina and brain that could ensure behavioral responses to light but not spontaneous retinal waves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Core Transcription Programs Controlling Injury-Induced Neurodegeneration of Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuronal death and regenerative failure. However, gene regulatory programs governing how initial neuronal injuries lead to neuronal death remain poorly understood. In adult mice, optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, which severs all axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), results in massive death of axotomized RGCs and regenerative failure of survivors. We performed an in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide screen of 1893 transcription factors (TFs) to seek repressors of RGC survival and axon regeneration following ONC. In parallel, we profiled the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of injured RGCs by ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to identify critical injury responsive TFs and their targets. Remarkably, these independent analyses converged on a set of four ATF/CEBP transcription factors: ATF3, ATF4, C/EBPg; and CHOP (Ddit3), as critical regulators of survival. Further studies indicate that these TFs contribute to two pro-death transcriptional programs: ATF3/CHOP preferentially regulate pathways activated by cytokines and innate immunity, whereas ATF4/C/EBP{gamma} regulate pathways engaged by intrinsic neuronal stressors. Manipulation of these TFs also protects RGCs in an experimental model of glaucoma, a prevalent disease in which RGCs die. Together, our results reveal core transcription programs that transform an initial axonal insult into a degenerative result and suggest novel strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tonic GluD1 channel current is independent of G protein activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Previously, using electrophysiological recordings from adult male and female mouse brain slices containing the dorsal raphe nucleus, we showed that GluD1R channels carry ionic current and are modulated via activation of Gq-coupled a1-adrenergic receptors (a1-AR) in a GTP-dependent manner (Gantz et al., 2020). GluD1R channels also carry a tonic cation current, generally ~-20 pA at subthreshold membrane potentials (Gantz et al., 2020). The origin of tonic GluD1R channel current is unknown. Here, using the same preparation, we show there is no role of on-going G protein-coupled receptor activity in generating or sustaining tonic GluD1R channel current. Neither augmentation nor disruption of G protein activity had an effect on tonic GluD1R current. These results reveal that tonic GluD1R current arises from a mechanism separate from on-going activity of G protein-coupled receptors. Under current clamp, block of GluD1R channels hyperpolarized the membrane by ~10 mV at subthreshold potentials leading to reduced excitability. Thus, GluD1R channels carry a G protein-independent tonic current that contributes to subthreshold drive of action potential firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development and validation of Arc nanobodies: new tools for probing Arc dynamics and function</a></h4>

              
                Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein plays key roles in long-term synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognitive flexibility. However, an integral understanding of Arc mechanisms is lacking. Arc is proposed to function as an interaction hub in neuronal dendrites and the nucleus, yet Arc can also form retrovirus-like capsids with proposed roles in intercellular communication. Here, we sought to develop anti-Arc nanobodies (ArcNbs) as new tools for probing Arc dynamics and function. Six ArcNbs representing different clonal lines were selected from immunized alpaca. Immunoblotting with recombinant ArcNbs fused to a small ALFA-epitope tag demonstrated binding to recombinant Arc as well as endogenous Arc from rat cortical tissue. ALFA-ArcNb also provided efficient immunoprecipitation of stimulus-induced Arc after carbachol-treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and induction of long-term potentiation in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo. Epitope mapping showed that all Nbs recognize the Arc C-terminal region containing the retroviral Gag capsid homology domain, comprised of tandem N- and C-lobes. ArcNbs E5 and H11 selectively bound the N-lobe, which harbors a peptide ligand binding pocket specific to mammals. Four additional ArcNbs bound the region containing the C-lobe and terminal tail. For use as genetically encoded fluorescent intrabodies, we show that ArcNbs fused to mScarlet-I are uniformly expressed, without aggregation, in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HEK293FT cells. Finally, mScarlet-I-ArcNb H11 expressed as intrabody selectively bound the N-lobe and enabled co-immunoprecipitation of full-length intracellular Arc. ArcNbs are versatile tools for live-cell labeling and purification of Arc and analysis of capsid domain specific functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brainstem somatostatin-expressing cells control the emotional regulation of pain behavior</a></h4>

              
                In mammals, threat-related behavior is typically induced by a noxious physical stressor and is associated with a broad range of behavioral responses such as freezing and avoidance. These behavioral responses are associated with the regulation of pain responses allowing individuals to cope with noxious stimuli. Whereas the structures and mechanisms involved in pain behavior are well documented, little is known about the precise neuronal circuits mediating the emotional regulation of pain behavior. Here we used a combination of behavioral, anatomical, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to show that somatostatin-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG SST cells) promote antinociceptive responses during the presentation of conditioned stimuli (CS) predicting footshocks. Whereas the optogenetic inhibition of vlPAG SST cells during CS presentation promoted analgesia, their optogenetic activation reduced analgesia by potentiating pain responses in the spinal cord through a relay in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Together these results identify a brainstem circuit composed of vlPAG SST cells specifically projecting to the RVM and mediating fear conditioned analgesia (FCA) to regulate pain responses during threatful situations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network architecture producing swing to stance transitions in an insect walking system</a></h4>

              
                The walking system of the stick insect is one of the most thoroughly described invertebrate systems. We know a lot about the role of sensory input in the control of stepping of a single leg. However, the neuronal organization and connectivity of the central neural networks underlying the rhythmic activation and coordination of leg muscles still remain elusive. It is assumed that these networks can couple in the absence of phasic sensory input due to the observation of spontaneous recurrent patterns (SRPs) of coordinated motor activity equivalent to fictive stepping-phase transitions. Here we sought to quantify the phase of motor activity within SRPs in the isolated and interconnected meso- and metathoracic ganglia. We show that SRPs occur not only in the meso-, but also in the metathoracic ganglia of the stick insect, discovering a qualitative difference between them. We construct a network based on neurophysiological data capable of reproducing the measured SRP phases to investigate this difference. By comparing network output to the biological measurements we confirm the plausibility of the architecture and provide a hypothesis to account for these qualitative differences. The neural architecture we present couples individual central pattern generators to reproduce the fictive stepping-phase transitions observed in deafferented stick insect preparations after pharmacological activation, providing insights into the neural architecture underlying coordinated locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in predictors and regional patterns of brain-age-gap estimates</a></h4>

              
                Background: The brain-age-gap estimate (brainAGE) quantifies the difference between chronological age and age predicted by applying machine-learning models to neuroimaging data, and is considered a biomarker of brain health. Understanding sex-differences in brainAGE is a significant step toward precision medicine. Methods: Global and local brainAGE (G-brainAGE and L-brainAGE, respectively) were computed by applying machine learning algorithms to brain structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 1113 healthy young adults (54.45% females; age range: 22-37 years) participating in the Human Connectome Project. Sex-differences were determined in G-brainAGE and L-brainAGE. Random forest regression was used to determine sex-specific associations between G-brainAGE and non-imaging measures pertaining to sociodemographic characteristics and mental, physical, and cognitive functions. Results: L-brainAGE showed sex-specific differences in brain ageing. In females, compared to males, L-brainAGE was higher in the cerebellum and brainstem and lower in the prefrontal cortex and insula. Although sex-differences in G-brainAGE were minimal, associations between G-brainAGE and non-imaging measures differed between sexes with the exception for poor sleep quality, which was common to both. The most important predictor of higher G-brainAGE was non-white race in males and systolic blood pressure in females. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the value of applying sex-specific analyses and machine learning methods to advance our understanding of sex-related differences in factors that influence the rate of brain ageing and provide a foundation for targeted interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Population Response Model of Ensemble Coding</a></h4>

              
                Ensemble representations have been considered as one of strategies that the visual system adopts to cope with its limited capacity. Thus, they include various statistical summaries such as mean, variance, and distributional properties and are formed over many stages of visual processing. The current study proposes a population coding model of ensemble perception to provide a theoretical and computational framework for these various facets of ensemble perception. The proposed model consists of a simple feature layer and a pooling layer. We assumed ensemble representations as population responses in the pooling layer and decoded various statistical properties from population responses. Our model successfully predicted averaging performance in orientation, size, color, and motion direction across different tasks. Furthermore, it predicted variance discrimination performance and the priming effects of feature distributions. Finally, it explained the well-known variance and set size effects and has a potential for explaining the adaptation and clustering effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective activation of subthalamic nucleus output quantitatively scales movements</a></h4>

              
                The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a diencephalic nucleus strongly connected with the basal ganglia, is a common target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatments of Parkinsonian motor symptoms. The STN is thought to suppress movement by enhancing inhibitory basal ganglia output via the indirect pathway, and disrupting STN output using DBS can restore movement in Parkinson's disease. However, previous studies on STN DBS usually relied on electrical stimulation, which cannot selectively target STN output neurons. Moreover, most studies did not measure behavior precisely during STN manipulations. Here we selectively stimulated STN projection neurons, by expressing channelrhodopsin in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2)-positive projection neurons in the STN. We also quantified behavior in freely moving male mice with high spatial and temporal resolution using 3D motion capture at 200 frames per second. We found STN stimulation resulted in movements with very short latencies (10-15 ms). Unilateral stimulation quantitatively determines orientation, head yaw, and head roll consistently in the ipsiversive direction, toward thee side of stimulation. On the other hand, head raising (increased head pitch) was observed after stimulation on either side. Strikingly, a single pulse of light was sufficient to generate movement, and there was a highly linear relationship between stimulation frequency and kinematics. These results question the common assumption that STN suppresses movement; instead they suggest that STN output can precisely specific action parameters via direct projections to brainstem regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of second-order mixing effects in reconstructed cross-spectra of random neural fields</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is commonly assessed by using measures that are insensitive to instantaneously interacting sources and as such would not give rise to false positive interactions caused by instantaneous mixing of true source signals (first-order mixing). Recent studies, however, have drawn attention to the fact that such measures are still susceptible to instantaneous mixing from lagged sources (i.e. second-order mixing) and that this can lead to a large number of false positive interactions. In this study we relate first- and second-order mixing effects on the cross-spectra of reconstructed source activity to the properties of the resolution operators that are used for the reconstruction. We derive two identities that relate first- and second-order mixing effects to the transformation properties of measurement and source configurations and exploit them to establish several basic properties of signal mixing. First, we provide a characterization of the configurations that are maximally and minimally sensitive to second-order mixing. It turns out that second-order mixing effects are maximal when the measurement locations are far apart and the sources coincide with the measurement locations. Second, we provide a description of second-order mixing effects in the vicinity of the measurement locations in terms of the local geometry of the point-spread functions of the resolution operator. Third, we derive a version of Lagrange's identity for cross-talk functions that establishes the existence of a trade-off between the magnitude of first- and second-order mixing effects. It also shows that, whereas the magnitude of first-order mixing is determined by the inner product of cross-talk functions, the magnitude of second-order mixing is determined by a generalized cross-product of cross-talk functions (the wedge product) which leads to an intuitive geometric understanding of the trade-off. All results are derived within the general framework of random neural fields on cortical manifolds.

                Ambient light can influence sleep structure and timing. We explored how wearing an eye-mask to block light during overnight sleep impacts on memory and alertness, changes that could benefit everyday tasks like studying or driving. In Experiment 1, ninety-four 18-35-year-olds wore an eye-mask while they slept every night for a week and underwent a control condition in which light was not blocked for another week. Five habituation nights were followed by a cognitive battery on the sixth and seventh days. This revealed superior episodic encoding and an improvement on alertness when using the mask. In Experiment 2, thirty-five 18-35-year-olds used a wearable device to monitor sleep with and without the mask. This replicated the encoding benefit and showed that it was predicted by time spent in slow wave sleep. Our findings suggest that wearing an eye-mask during overnight sleep can improve episodic encoding and alertness the next day.

                {Delta}FosB, an alternative spliced product of FosB, is an essential component of dopamine-induced reward pathways and a master switch for addiction. However, the molecular mechanisms of its generation and regulation by dopamine signaling are unknown. Here we report that dopamine D1 receptor signaling synergizes with the activin/ALK4/Smad3 pathway to potentiate the generation of {Delta}FosB mRNA in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus-accumbens (NAc) through activation of the RNA binding protein PCBP1, a regulator of mRNA splicing. Concurrent activation of PCBP1 and Smad3 by D1 and ALK4 signaling induced their interaction, nuclear translocation, and binding to sequences in exon-4 and intron-4 of FosB mRNA. Ablation of either ALK4 or PCBP1 in MSNs impaired {Delta}FosB mRNA induction and nuclear translocation of {Delta}FosB protein in response to repeated co-stimulation of D1 and ALK4 receptors. Importantly, ALK4 was required in NAc MSNs of adult mice for behavioral sensitization to cocaine. These findings uncover an unexpected mechanism for {Delta}FosB generation and drug-induced sensitization through convergent dopamine and ALK4 signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visualizing Synaptic Dopamine Efflux with a 2D Nanofilm</a></h4>

              
                Chemical neurotransmission constitutes one of the fundamental modalities of communication between neurons. Monitoring release of these chemicals has traditionally been difficult to carry out at spatial and temporal scales relevant to neuron function. To understand chemical neurotransmission more fully, we need to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements for neurotransmitter release. To address this, we engineered a chemi-sensitive, two-dimensional nanofilm that facilitates subcellular visualization of the release and diffusion of the neurochemical dopamine with synaptic resolution, quantal sensitivity, and simultaneously from hundreds of release sites. Using this technology, we were able to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of dopamine release in dendritic processes, a poorly understood phenomenon. We found that dopamine release is broadcast from a subset of dendritic processes as hotspots that have a mean spatial spread of ~3.2 m (full width at half maximum) and are observed with a mean spatial frequency of 1 hotspot per ~7.5 m of dendritic length. Major dendrites of dopamine neurons and fine dendritic processes, as well as dendritic arbors and dendrites with no apparent varicose morphology participated in dopamine release. Remarkably, these release hotspots colocalized with Bassoon, suggesting that Bassoon may contribute to organizing active zones in dendrites, similar to its role in axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imbalance of Neuregulin1-ErbB2/3 signaling underlies altered myelin homeostasis in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H</a></h4>

              
                Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, affecting either axons from the motor and/or sensory neurons or Schwann cells (SC) of the peripheral nervous system, and caused by more than 100 genes. We previously identified mutations in FGD4, as responsible for CMT4H, an autosomal recessive demyelinating form of CMT. FGD4 encodes FRABIN a GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), particularly for the small GTPase cdc42. Remarkably, nerves from patients with CMT4H display excessive redundant myelin called outfoldings that arise from focal hypermyelination, suggesting that FRABIN could play a role in the control of PNS myelination. To gain insights into the role of FGD4/FRABIN in SC myelination, we generated a knock-out mouse model, with conditional ablation of fgd4 in SC. We showed that the specific deletion of FRABIN in SCs leads to aberrant myelination in vitro, in dorsal root ganglion (DRG)/SCs cocultures as well in vivo, in distal sciatic nerves. We observed that those myelination defects are related to an upregulation of some interactors of the NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 signaling pathway, which is known to ensure a proper level of myelination in the PNS. Based on a yeast two- hybrid screen, we identified SNX3 as a new partner of FRABIN, which is involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking. Interestingly, we showed that loss of FRABIN impairs endocytic trafficking which may contribute to the defective NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 signaling and myelination. Finally, we showed that the reestablishment of proper levels of the NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 pathway using Niacin treatment reduces myelin outfoldings in nerves of CMT4H mice. Overall, our work reveals a new role of FRABIN in the regulation of NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 NRG1signaling and myelination and opens future therapeutic strategies based on the modulation of NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 NRG1to reduce CMT4H pathology and more generally others demyelinating CMT.

	<p>Does experience with signed language impact the neurocognitive processes recruited by adults solving arithmetic problems? We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to identify the components that are modulated by operation type and problem size in Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) native signers and in hearing English-speaking participants. Participants were presented with single-digit subtraction and multiplication problems in a delayed verification task. Problem size was manipulated in small and large problems with an additional extra-large subtraction condition to equate the overall magnitude of large multiplication problems. Results show comparable behavioral results and similar ERP dissociations across groups. First, an early operation type effect is observed around 200 ms post-problem onset, suggesting that both groups have a similar attentional differentiation for processing subtraction and multiplication problems. Second, for the posterior-occipital component between 240 ms and 300 ms, subtraction problems show a similar modulation with problem size in both groups, suggesting that only subtraction problems recruit quantity-related processes. Control analyses exclude possible perceptual and cross-operation magnitude-related effects. These results are the first evidence that the two operation types rely on distinct cognitive processes within the ASL native signing population and that they are equivalent to those observed in the English-speaking population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Disinhibition Reduces Contextual and Elemental Fear Conditioning While Sparing the Acquisition of Latent Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hippocampal neural disinhibition, i.e., reduced GABAergic inhibition, is a key feature of schizophrenia pathophysiology. The hippocampus is an important part of the neural circuitry that controls fear conditioning and can also modulate prefrontal and striatal mechanisms, including dopamine signaling, which play a role in salience modulation. Consequently, hippocampal neural disinhibition may contribute to impairments in fear conditioning and salience modulation reported in schizophrenia. Therefore, we examined the effect of ventral hippocampus (VH) disinhibition in male rats on fear conditioning and salience modulation, as reflected by latent inhibition (LI), in a conditioned emotional response (CER) procedure. A flashing light was used as the conditioned stimulus (CS), and conditioned suppression was used to index conditioned fear. In experiment 1, VH disinhibition via infusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin before CS pre-exposure and conditioning markedly reduced fear conditioning to both the CS and context; LI was evident in saline-infused controls but could not be detected in picrotoxin-infused rats because of the low level of fear conditioning to the CS. In experiment 2, VH picrotoxin infusions only before CS pre-exposure did not affect the acquisition of fear conditioning or LI. Together, these findings indicate that VH neural disinhibition disrupts contextual and elemental fear conditioning, without affecting the acquisition of LI. The disruption of fear conditioning resembles aversive conditioning deficits reported in schizophrenia and may reflect a disruption of neural processing both within the hippocampus and in projection sites of the hippocampus.</p>

                Background:  The purpose of this study is to explore the professional and personal experiences of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals during and following diabetes counselling and empowerment education. Methods:   Everyone who had participated in a diabetes counselling and empowerment course between 2008-2016 was invited to respond to an online survey and follow-up telephone interview if willing. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The research team used interpretative phenomenology to identify core themes from both the survey and telephone interviews and which captured the impact of empowerment education. Results:  22 doctors, nurses, dieticians, and psychologists completed an online questionnaire. 10 subsequently took part in telephone interviews. Empowerment education changed them from fixers to facilitators. Their transformation included a sense of becoming authentic, ‘being the way I want to be’ in clinical practice and becoming more self-reflective. This affected them personally as well as reinvigorating them professionally. Conclusions: The participants described a personal and professional journey of transformation that included discovering their person-centred philosophy. They adopted a consultation structure that empowered people with diabetes to care for themselves. It can be speculated that participants’ experience of transformation may also guard against professional burnout.

                Background: Shoulder biomechanics cannot be measured directly in living persons. While different glenohumeral joint simulators have been developed to investigate the role of the glenohumeral muscles in shoulder biomechanics, a standard for these simulators has not been defined. With this scoping review we want to describe available ex-vivo experimental strategies for assessing unconstrained shoulder biomechanics. Objective: The scoping review aims at identifying methodological and/or experimental studies describing or involving ex-vivo simulators that assess unconstrained shoulder biomechanics and synthesizing their strengths and limitations. Inclusion criteria: All unconstrained glenohumeral joint simulators published in connection with ex-vivo or mechanical simulation experiments will be included. Studies on glenohumeral simulators with active components to mimic the muscles will be included. We will exclude studies where the experiment is static or the motion is induced through an external guide, e.g., a robotic device. Methods: We will perform database searching in PubMed, Embase via Elsevier and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently assess full texts of selected abstracts. Direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles will be conducted. We will narratively synthesize the results and derive recommendations for designing ex-vivo simulators for assessing unconstrained shoulder biomechanics.

                From the viewpoint of sustainability, annual soil erosion should be controlled below an erosion level. Palau is an island in the Micronesia region of the western Pacific Ocean. The island receives heavy rainfall and has steep slopes, so 80% of the land is categorized within the most fragile rank (T factor = 1) in soil erosion. We tested several methods of preventing soil erosion on the land, with a slope of 15.4° (13.4°–17.3°), cultivated the land, planted sweet potatoes, and compared the amount of soil erosion. Surprisingly, there was no erosion at all in all plots (including control plots), although 24 rainfall events occurred and the USLE equation predicted 32 tons per ha of soil erosion in the cropping period. For the parameters of the USLE equation used in this study, only the K factor was not measured (cited from a USDA report). Namely, the K factor estimated by soil texture was larger than the actual value. Measuring the K factor in the fields can expand Palau's sustainable agricultural land.

                This paper considers the impact of an acute individual's spontaneous clearance, recovery of a chronic individual with full immunity, and risk factor reduction on a hepatitis B virus (HBV) model. The existence and the positivity solution of the model are established. The model threshold quantity is defined and sensitivity analysis is analyzed to demonstrate the effect of various parameters on the spread of the virus. The global stability analysis of the equilibrium is shown using Lyapunov and comparison theorem methods. Finally, computational simulation is presented to validate the analytical solution. The results show that treatment, spontaneous clearance and reduction of the risk factor are highly successful in transmitting and regulating HBV transmission. The effective measure of these parameters as substantiated by our simulations, providing an excellent control method of the transmissible infection of HBV.

                Background: Because of yellow fever’s serious impact on health, vaccination is the principal strategy to control the disease. Administration of the yellow fever vaccine to breastfeeding women should be before they complete 9 months post-delivery, in order to prevent transmission of the yellow fever vaccine virus to their infants through breast feeding. This study aimed to confirm whether the excretion of yellow fever vaccine virus is in milk of vaccinated breastfeeding mothers and to confirm the probable transmission to their infants through breast milk. Methods: Samples were taken as follows: one serum specimen was taken 3-14 days after the date of the vaccination, and breast milk specimens were taken at four different time points between 3-4 days apart. Specimens were obtained from eight nursing mothers, who received the YVF vaccine (17DD). Mothers were asymptomatic before and after the vaccine administration but their infants developed symptoms after administration. Maternal serum samples were tested for YFV specific IgM antibodies through immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA). RNA was extracted from serum and breast milk specimens and YFV RNA screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In total, five mothers (62.5%) were positive for YFV and two mothers (25%) had YFV RNA in serum. Among milk specimens, YFV RNA was detected during the four different mentioned collection times as follows (positive milk specimens/total milk specimens): 3/8 (37.5 %), 4/6 (66.6%) and 1/4(25%). RNA was completely undetectable in the last collection time. Conclusions: YFV transmission from mothers to their babies through breast-feeding was highly probable indicated by the temporal relationship to mother’s YF vaccination.

                Background: Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) are tumor cells that have been separated from the primary site and enter the blood or lymphatic circulation of cancer patients. CTCs are  known to have tumorigenic properties and are  thought to have a relationship with metastasis. One of the tests that can be used to assess tumorigenesis is the spheroid formation test. This study was conducted to determine CTCs’ ability to form spheroids. Methods: A 1 ml sample of blood was taken from two patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and placed in separate heparin tubes. The CTCs were then isolated using the DirectCTC enrichment kit according to the manufacturer's procedure. A total of 10,000 cells were grown in nuncsphera u plates in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for three days under standard culture conditions. Spheroid or aggregation was then evaluated using an inverted microscope. Results: We identified a CTC culture derived from each of the patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, namely CTC ID001 and CTC 002 respectively. CTC ID001 formed spheroids spontaneously while CTC ID002 did not. CTC ID001 appears to aggregate spontaneously and resembles primary tumor cells in their ability to form spheroids. Conclusions: We observed that CTCs can mimic primary tumors to form spheroids spontaneously, though some CTCs are not able to form spheroids. We suspected that this was related to the tumorigenic nature of CTC in these patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Screening patients with metastatic breast cancer for psychiatric disease: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cancer patients are at risk of developing some level of psychological dysregulation, depending on a series of variables related to the tumor, the environment, and the patient. In this context, it becomes important to define the difference between psychological and psychiatric disorder and to study its prevalence. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a sample of Portuguese patients with metastatic breast cancer and assess the relationship between these disorders and the characteristics of the oncological disease. Methods: Cross-sectional, single-center study with female patients diagnosed with metastatic breast carcinoma and under palliative treatment between November 2020 and May 2021. Psychiatric disorders were screened by applying and filling-out the MMSE, HADS, BSI, and WHOQoL-Bref instruments at the outpatient daycare unit when patients were present for treatmen. Results: A total of 91 female patients were included, median age 59.79 years. None of the patients had cognitive impairment (MMSE). HADS scale: 18.7% of the patients scored for anxiety and 17.6% for depression. The anxiety subscale score of > 8 (HADS) was related to ovarian function suppression (p<0.001), neoadjuvant therapy (p<0.001), and type of second-line of palliative treatment (p=0.024). The depression subscale score >8 (HADS) was related to the type of surgery performed (p= 0.022), molecular subtype of the tumor (p=0.020), and occurrence of grade 3-4 toxicities in the first (p=0.018), and third-line treatments (p=0.031). Conclusion: The screening of psychiatric disorders through the application of these scales by the medical oncology team may be able to aid in diagnosis and potentially lead to psychiatric referral and intervention at an earlier stage.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discovering adaptation-capable biological network structures using control-theoretic approaches</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Priyan Bhattacharya, Karthik Raman, Arun K. Tangirala</p>

Constructing biological networks capable of performing specific biological functionalities has been of sustained interest in synthetic biology. Adaptation is one such ubiquitous functional property, which enables every living organism to sense a change in its surroundings and return to its operating condition prior to the disturbance. In this paper, we present a generic systems theory-driven method for designing adaptive protein networks. First, we translate the necessary qualitative conditions for adaptation to mathematical constraints using the language of systems theory, which we then map back as ‘design requirements’ for the underlying networks. We go on to prove that a protein network with different input–output nodes (proteins) needs to be at least of third-order in order to provide adaptation. Next, we show that the necessary design principles obtained for a three-node network in adaptation consist of negative feedback or a feed-forward realization. We argue that presence of a particular class of negative feedback or feed-forward realization is necessary for a network of any size to provide adaptation. Further, we claim that the necessary structural conditions derived in this work are the strictest among the ones hitherto existed in the literature. Finally, we prove that the capability of producing adaptation is retained for the admissible motifs even when the output node is connected with a downstream system in a feedback fashion. This result explains how complex biological networks achieve robustness while keeping the core motifs unchanged in the context of a particular functionality. We corroborate our theoretical results with detailed and thorough numerical simulations. Overall, our results present a generic, systematic and robust framework for designing various kinds of biological networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constrained brain volume in an efficient coding model explains the fraction of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in sensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arish Alreja, Ilya Nemenman, Christopher J. Rozell</p>

The number of neurons in mammalian cortex varies by multiple orders of magnitude across different species. In contrast, the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons (E:I ratio) varies in a much smaller range, from 3:1 to 9:1 and remains roughly constant for different sensory areas within a species. Despite this structure being important for understanding the function of neural circuits, the reason for this consistency is not yet understood. While recent models of vision based on the efficient coding hypothesis show that increasing the number of both excitatory and inhibitory cells improves stimulus representation, the two cannot increase simultaneously due to constraints on brain volume. In this work, we implement an efficient coding model of vision under a constraint on the volume (using number of neurons as a surrogate) while varying the E:I ratio. We show that the performance of the model is optimal at biologically observed E:I ratios under several metrics. We argue that this happens due to trade-offs between the computational accuracy and the representation capacity for natural stimuli. Further, we make experimentally testable predictions that 1) the optimal E:I ratio should be higher for species with a higher sparsity in the neural activity and 2) the character of inhibitory synaptic distributions and firing rates should change depending on E:I ratio. Our findings, which are supported by our new preliminary analyses of publicly available data, provide the first quantitative and testable hypothesis based on optimal coding models for the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neural types in the mammalian sensory cortices.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A noncanonical chaperone interacts with drug efflux pumps during their assembly into bacterial outer membranes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher J. Stubenrauch, Rebecca S. Bamert, Jiawei Wang, Trevor Lithgow</p>

Bacteria have membrane-spanning efflux pumps to secrete toxic compounds ranging from heavy metal ions to organic chemicals, including antibiotic drugs. The overall architecture of these efflux pumps is highly conserved: with an inner membrane energy-transducing subunit coupled via an adaptor protein to an outer membrane conduit subunit that enables toxic compounds to be expelled into the environment. Here, we map the distribution of efflux pumps across bacterial lineages to show these proteins are more widespread than previously recognised. Complex phylogenetics support the concept that gene cassettes encoding the subunits for these pumps are commonly acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Using TolC as a model protein, we demonstrate that assembly of conduit subunits into the outer membrane uses the chaperone TAM to physically organise the membrane-embedded staves of the conduit subunit of the efflux pump. The characteristics of this assembly pathway have impact for the acquisition of efflux pumps across bacterial species and for the development of new antimicrobial compounds that inhibit efflux pump function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Rab2A regulates the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease downstream of AMPK-TBC1D1 axis by stabilizing PPARγ</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zi-Yue Chen, Ya-Ting Sun, Zi-Ming Wang, Jie Hong, Min Xu, Fu-Ting Zhang, Xian-Qing Zhou, Ping Rong, Qi Wang, Hong Yu Wang, Hua Wang, Shuai Chen, Liang Chen</p>

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects approximately a quarter of the population worldwide, and persistent overnutrition is one of the major causes. However, the underlying molecular basis has not been fully elucidated, and no specific drug has been approved for this disease. Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism that reveals a novel function of Rab2A in the progression of NAFLD based on energy status and PPARγ. The mechanistic analysis shows that nutrition repletion suppresses the phosphorylation of AMPK-TBC1D1 signaling, augments the level of GTP-bound Rab2A, and then increases the protein stability of PPARγ, which ultimately promotes the hepatic accumulation of lipids in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that blocking the AMPK-TBC1D1 pathway in TBC1D1<sup>S231A</sup>-knock-in (KI) mice led to a markedly increased GTP-bound Rab2A and subsequent fatty liver in aged mice. Our studies also showed that inhibition of Rab2A expression alleviated hepatic lipid deposition in western diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice by reducing the protein level of PPARγ and the expression of PPARγ target genes. Our findings not only reveal a new molecular mechanism regulating the progression of NAFLD during persistent overnutrition but also have potential implications for drug discovery to combat this disease.

                Background: Hikikomori is a Japanese social withdrawal phenomenon which, in recent years, is spreading in western developed countries as well. Spending a lot of time secluded indoors, watching and playing with fictional narratives may be relatively common for Hikikomori people and may represent a protective factor for their psychological well-being.   Method: We evaluated the role of enjoying fictional narratives on empathy, relaxation, depression, and anxiety in people with Hikikomori experience, in relation to their daily consumption of fictional narratives and their emotional transportation toward fictional narratives. Hikikomori from one psychiatric clinic and three different support facilities were enrolled in this study. Multidimensional empathy scale, CES-D, STAI questionnaire, and relaxation inventory self-report scale were used as outcome measures.        Results: We found a significant correlation between empathy and emotional transportation toward fictional narratives and between relaxation during watching and reading fictional narratives and consumption frequency of fictional narratives.  We failed, however, to find any significant correlation with depression and anxiety.   Conclusions: These findings suggest a possible correlation between fiction and empathy/relaxation response; however, any causal relationship is not proven, consequently we deem that further investigations with a larger sample size are required for a better understanding.

                Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education sector around the world. In order to control the spread of the virus, eLearning practice has been introduced in Saudi higher education. Such online communication has become an important tool to narrow the teaching practice gap. This study assessed the characteristics of eLearning and distance learning and the inclination of Imam Abdulrahman BinFaisal University (IAU) faculty members in terms of skills, and managing classes and tests using online learning tools. Methods: A QuestionPro questionnaire with 22 questions on eLearning experience, training experience, and skills and knowledge in the educational process of IAU teaching faculty was conducted through the online university e-mail domain. The questionnaire was sent to the IAU’s teaching faculty. The questionnaire’s reliability was studied using Cronbach’s a coefficient. The criterion value was statistically studied using the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) and Bartlett’s test. The variables associated with the present survey model were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results: The study showed positive responses and readiness (skills and abilities) and the effectiveness of IAU’s faculty members to perform e-learning activities during COVID-19. IAU faculty received a strong positive response, and the respondents were also impressed with and agreed on trainer knowledge, session management, communication and expertise on training topics. Conclusions: The positive response indicates the readiness of IAU to provide the necessary support (tools, information and updates) required for a successful online educational process.

                Background: Conducting successful HIV vaccine clinical trials in resource-limited settings is hampered by lack of adequate laboratory capacity at trial sites, poor infrastructure, lack of well-trained technical personnel, and inadequate laboratory quality management Systems. We describe our approach to establishing sustainable laboratory capacity for clinical trials in Africa. Methods: IAVI identified 9 CRCs where a capacity building program that supports immunology and clinical testing was established. Information from the 9 CRCs was collected retrospectively and compiled in Microsoft excel for descriptive statistics. Mapping was done in Quantum Geographic information system. Results: Newly built and refurbished laboratories have been equipped with the required testing laboratory equipment. All CRC laboratories (n=10, 100%) received Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) accreditation between 2004 and 2016, and accreditation maintained annually. A total of 89 audits were done between 2005-2019. KAVI and KEMRI had the highest number of audits (n=11, 12.4%). IAVI successfully trained a total of 1811 individual, of which (n=1130, 62.7%) trained on GCLP, (n=330, 18.3%) Quality Management Systems, (n=311, 17,2%) laboratory techniques and (n=32,1.8%) between 2004 and 2021. All the 13 Assays were registered in either College of American pathologist (CAP) or Royal college of pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) for Proficiency testing. Conclusion: The establishment of GCLP accredited laboratories and well-trained personnel has created centers of excellence and it has enabled them to attract independent competitive research funding. The GCLP accreditation and standardized testing procedures ensured reliable and accurate data, especially important for multi-country and multi-center studies.

                Background: Credit cards remain the preferred payment method by many people nowadays. If not handled carefully, people may face severe consequences such as credit card frauds. Credit card frauds involve the illegal use of credit cards without the owner’s knowledge. Credit card fraud was estimated to exceed a $35.5 billion loss globally in 2020, and results in direct or indirect financial loss to the owners. Hence, a detection system capable of analysing and identifying fraudulent behaviour in credit card activities is highly desirable. Credit card data are not easy to handle due to their inherited problems: (i) unbalanced class distributions and (ii) overlapping classes. General learning algorithms may not be able to address and handle the problems well. Methods: This study addresses these problems using an Enhanced Stacking Classifiers System (ESCS) that comprises two sequential levels. The first level is an excellent classifier for detecting normal credit card transactions (the majority class), while the second level contains stacking classifiers that distinguish credit card frauds (the minority class). The ESCS can improve the fraud detection via the second level, which contains sensitive classifiers to identify the misclassified fraud transactions as normal transactions from the first classifier. The meta-classifier then combines the decisions of the base classifiers from the levels to produce the final detections. Results: We evaluated the ESCS using the benchmark credit card fraud dataset (CCFD) that exhibits the two problems. The highest true positive rate (TPR) for detecting credit card frauds was 0.8841, which outperformed the single classifiers, bagging, boosting, and other researchers’ works. Conclusions: This study proves that the ESCS, with an additional level added to the stacking classifiers, can improve fraud detection on credit card data.

                Our brains have evolved the ability to configure and adapt their processing states to match the unique challenges of acting and learning in diverse environments and behavioral contexts. In biological nervous systems, such state specification and adaptation arise in part from neuromodulators, including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine, whose diffuse release fine-tunes neuronal and synaptic dynamics and plasticity to complement the behavioral context in real-time. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of deep neural networks for specific tasks, they remain relatively inflexible at generalizing across tasks or adapting to ever-changing behavioral demands.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Links between the brain and body during sleep: implications for memory processing</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is intimately related to memory processes. The established view is that the transformation of experiences into long-term memories is linked to sleep-related CNS function. However, there is increasing evidence that the autonomic nervous system (ANS), long recognized to modulate cognition during waking, can impact memory processing during sleep. Here, we review human research that examines the role of autonomic activity and sleep in memory formation. We argue that autonomic activity during sleep may set the stage for the CNS dynamics associated with sleep and memory stability and integration.

                REM sleep is characterized by high brain activity and rapid eye movements, but also muscle atonia. Is it good for animals to engage in REM sleep when a predator is nearby? Tseng et al. exposed mice to predator threats and show increased REM sleep regulated by mSTN-CRH neurons.

                Autophagosome biogenesis occurs near synapses and increases with neuronal activity. The mechanisms that couple synaptic autophagy with synaptic activity remain unknown. Yang et al. provide evidence that ATG-9 is on vesicles that undergo activity-dependent exo-endocytosis at synapses, thus coupling autophagosome biogenesis at presynaptic sites with the activity-dependent synaptic vesicle cycle.

                What is the origin of behaviour? Although typically associated with a nervous system, simple organisms also show complex behaviours. Among them, the slime mold <i>Physarum polycephalum</i>, a giant single cell, is ideally suited to study emergence of behaviour. Here, we show how locomotion and morphological adaptation behaviour emerge from self-organized patterns of rhythmic contractions of the actomyosin lining of the tubes making up the network-shaped organism. We quantify the spatio-temporal contraction dynamics by decomposing experimentally recorded contraction patterns into spatial contraction modes. Notably, we find a continuous spectrum of modes, as opposed to a few dominant modes. Our data suggests that the continuous spectrum of modes allows for dynamic transitions between a plethora of specific behaviours with transitions marked by highly irregular contraction states. By mapping specific behaviours to states of active contractions, we provide the basis to understand behaviour’s complexity as a function of biomechanical dynamics.

                Cryogenic electron microscopy has become an essential tool for structure determination of biological macromolecules. In practice, the difficulty to reliably prepare samples with uniform ice thickness still represents a barrier for routine high-resolution imaging and limits the current throughput of the technique. We show that a nanofluidic sample support with well-defined geometry can be used to prepare cryo-EM specimens with reproducible ice thickness from picoliter sample volumes. The sample solution is contained in electron-transparent nanochannels that provide uniform thickness gradients without further optimisation and eliminate the potentially destructive air-water interface. We demonstrate the possibility to perform high-resolution structure determination with three standard protein specimens. Nanofabricated sample supports bear potential to automate the cryo-EM workflow, and to explore new frontiers for cryo-EM applications such as time-resolved imaging and high-throughput screening.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel processing in speech perception with local and global representations of linguistic context</a></h4>

              
                Speech processing is highly incremental. It is widely accepted that human listeners continuously use the linguistic context to anticipate upcoming concepts, words, and phonemes. However, previous evidence supports two seemingly contradictory models of how a predictive context is integrated with the bottom-up sensory input: Classic psycholinguistic paradigms suggest a two-stage process, in which acoustic input initially leads to local, context-independent representations, which are then quickly integrated with contextual constraints. This contrasts with the view that the brain constructs a single coherent, unified interpretation of the input, which fully integrates available information across representational hierarchies, and thus uses contextual constraints to modulate even the earliest sensory representations. To distinguish these hypotheses, we tested magnetoencephalography responses to continuous narrative speech for signatures of local and unified predictive models. Results provide evidence that listeners employ both types of models in parallel. Two local context models uniquely predict some part of early neural responses, one based on sublexical phoneme sequences, and one based on the phonemes in the current word alone; at the same time, even early responses to phonemes also reflect a unified model that incorporates sentence level constraints to predict upcoming phonemes. Neural source localization places the anatomical origins of the different predictive models in non-identical parts of the superior temporal lobes bilaterally, with the right hemisphere showing a relative preference for more local models. These results suggest that speech processing recruits both local and unified predictive models in parallel, reconciling previous disparate findings. Parallel models might make the perceptual system more robust, facilitate processing of unexpected inputs, and serve a function in language acquisition.

                Restoring damaged b-cells in diabetic patients by harnessing the plasticity of other pancreatic cells raises the questions of the efficiency of the process and of the functionality of the new <i>Insulin</i>-expressing cells. To overcome the weak regenerative capacity of mammals, we used regeneration-prone zebrafish to study b-cells arising following destruction. We show that most new <i>insulin</i> cells differ from the original b-cells as they coexpress Somatostatin and Insulin. These bihormonal cells are abundant, functional and able to normalize glycemia. Their formation in response to b-cell destruction is fast, efficient and age-independent. Bihormonal cells are transcriptionally close to a subset of d-cells that we identified in control islets and which are characterized by the expression of<i> somatostatin 1.1 </i>(<i>sst1.1</i>) and by genes essential for glucose-induced Insulin secretion in β-cells such as <i>pdx1</i>, <i>slc2a2</i> and <i>gck</i>. We observed <i>in vivo</i> the conversion of monohormonal <i>sst1.1-</i>expressing cells to <i>sst1.1+ ins+</i> bihormonal cells following b-cell destruction. Our findings support the conclusion that <i>sst1.1</i> d-cells possess a pro-b identity enabling them to contribute to the neogenesis of Insulin-producing cells during regeneration. This work unveils that abundant and functional bihormonal cells benefit to diabetes recovery in zebrafish.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synaptic connectivity to L2/3 of primary visual cortex measured by two-photon optogenetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding cortical microcircuits requires thorough measurement of physiological properties of synaptic connections formed within and between diverse subclasses of neurons. Towards this goal, we combined spatially precise optogenetic stimulation with multicellular recording to deeply characterize intralaminar and translaminar monosynaptic connections to supragranular (L2/3) neurons in the mouse visual cortex. The reliability and specificity of multiphoton optogenetic stimulation were measured across multiple Cre lines and measurements of connectivity were verified by comparison to paired recordings and targeted patching of optically identified presynaptic cells. With a focus on translaminar pathways, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from genetically defined presynaptic populations were characterized by their relative abundance, spatial profiles, strength, and short-term dynamics. Consistent with the canonical cortical microcircuit, layer 4 excitatory neurons and interneurons within L2/3 represented the most common sources of input to L2/3 pyramidal cells. More surprisingly, we also observed strong excitatory connections from layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons and potent translaminar inhibition from multiple interneuron subclasses. The hybrid approach revealed convergence to and divergence from excitatory and inhibitory neurons within and across cortical layers. Divergent excitatory connections often spanned hundreds of microns of horizontal space. In contrast, divergent inhibitory connections were more frequently measured from postsynaptic targets near each other.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNA binding to human METTL3-METTL14 restricts N6-deoxyadenosine methylation of DNA in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Methyltransferase like-3 (METTL3) and METTL14 complex transfers a methyl group from <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine to <i>N<sup>6</sup></i> amino group of adenosine bases in RNA (m<sup>6</sup>A) and DNA (m<sup>6</sup>dA). Emerging evidence highlights a role of METTL3-METTL14 in the chromatin context, especially in processes where DNA and RNA are held in close proximity. However, a mechanistic framework about specificity for substrate RNA/DNA and their interrelationship remain unclear. By systematically studying methylation activity and binding affinity to a number of DNA and RNA oligos with different propensities to form inter- or intra-molecular duplexes or single-stranded molecules <i>in vitro</i>, we uncover an inverse relationship for substrate binding and methylation and show that METTL3-METTL14 preferentially catalyzes the formation of m<sup>6</sup>dA in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), despite weaker binding affinity to DNA. In contrast, it binds structured RNAs with high affinity, but methylates the target adenosine in RNA (m<sup>6</sup>A) much less efficiently than it does in ssDNA. We also show that METTL3-METTL14-mediated methylation of DNA is largely restricted by structured RNA elements prevalent in long noncoding and other cellular RNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vitro neurogenetics platform for precision disease modeling in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                The mouse is often the model of choice for genetic analysis of neurological disorders, but the introduction of disease mutations into a single inbred strain sometimes fails to yield phenotypes relevant to human disease. Interrogating genetically diverse panels of mice can identify better models of human sensitivity and resistance to candidate disease variants. We developed an in vitro methodology for modeling multiple stages of central nervous system development using a panel of genetically diverse mouse embryonic stem cell lines. Chemical knockdown of the neurodevelopmental gene Dyrk1a demonstrated profound strain differences in the cellular response to the ablation of DYRK1A activity throughout development in vitro. Responsive strains showed in vitro developmental defects consistent with observations in vivo on Dyrk1a knockout mice, and transcriptomic analysis of sensitive and resistant cell strain backgrounds successfully identified key molecular pathways in neural development known to be associated with Dyrk1a haploinsufficiency in vivo. Thus, we demonstrate that high throughput comparative phenotype analysis of differentiated cells from human and genetically diverse mouse pluripotent stem cells bearing disease mutations can provide a facile route to identification of optimal mouse strains for precision disease modeling in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A proxy measure of striatal dopamine predicts individual differences in temporal precision.</a></h4>

              
                The perception of time is characterized by pronounced variability across individuals, with implications for a diverse array of psychological functions. The neurocognitive sources of this variability are poorly understood but accumulating evidence suggests a role for inter-individual differences in striatal dopamine levels. Here we present a pre-registered study that tested the predictions that spontaneous eye blink rates, which provide a proxy measure of striatal dopamine availability, would be associated with aberrant interval timing (lower temporal precision or overestimation bias). Neurotypical adults (N=69) underwent resting state eye tracking and completed visual psychophysical interval timing and control tasks. Elevated spontaneous eye blink rates were associated with poorer temporal precision but not with inter-individual differences in perceived duration or performance on the control task. These results signify a role for striatal dopamine in variability in human time perception and can help explain deficient temporal precision in psychiatric populations characterized by elevated dopamine levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The evolution of BDNF is defined by strict purifying selection and prodomain spatial coevolution, but what does it mean for human brain disease?</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian gene Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is an essential mediator of brain assembly, development, and maturation which has been implicated in a variety of brain disorders such as neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder), neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, PTSD, schizophrenia), and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Parkinsons). Loss of BDNF during early development is embryonic lethal, and depletion of BDNF during adolescence or adulthood can result in disease-related neuropathology across a broad range of model organisms. In order to better understand the role of BDNF in disease, we seek to provide an evolutionary context to BDNFs role within the brain by elucidating the molecular and genetic comparative history of BDNF across species. We conduct sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction of the BDNF gene across a diverse selection of over 160 mammalian species spanning ~177 million years of evolution. Selective evolutionary change was examined via several independent computational models of codon evolution including FEL, MEME, and BGM. We report strict purifying selection in the main functional domain of BDNF (NGF domain, essentially comprising the mature BDNF protein). Specifically, we discover 6 sites in our homologous alignment which are under episodic selection in the early regulatory region of BDNF (i.e. the prodomain) and 23 pairs of coevolving sites that are a part of complex spatial relationships that are distributed across the entire BDNF gene. Thus, we propose that our discovery of both local and distal sites of co-evolution within the pro- and mature-domains of BDNF that likely reflect the evolutionary fine-tuning of BDNFs unique and complex regulatory capacities whilst also retaining its core yet diverse ontogenic functionality within the central nervous system. This discovery consequently supports the idea that the BDNF prodomain is more prone to change than the mature domain, however the fact that this region has also been subject to negative purifying selection also highlights genetic sensitivity and thus partially explains the prodomains disease relevance (e.g. Val66Met and other variants) to numerous neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and connectomic vulnerability shape cross-disorder cortical abnormalities</a></h4>

              
                Numerous brain disorders demonstrate structural brain abnormalities, which are thought to arise from molecular perturbations or connectome miswiring. The unique and shared contributions of these molecular and connectomic vulnerabilities to brain disorders remain unknown, and has yet to be studied in a single multi-disorder framework. Using MRI morphometry from the ENIGMA consortium, we construct maps of cortical abnormalities for thirteen neurodevelopmental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders from N=21,000 patients and N=26,000 controls, collected using a harmonized processing protocol. We systematically compare cortical maps to multiple micro-architectural measures, including gene expression, neurotransmitter density, metabolism, and myelination (molecular vulnerability), as well as global connectomic measures including number of connections, centrality, and connection diversity (connectomic vulnerability). We find that regional molecular vulnerability and macroscale brain network architecture interact to drive the spatial patterning of cortical abnormalities in multiple disorders. Local attributes, particularly neurotransmitter receptor profiles, constitute the best predictors of both disorder-specific cortical morphology and cross-disorder similarity. Finally, we find that cross-disorder abnormalities are consistently subtended by a small subset of network epicentres in bilateral sensory-motor, medial temporal lobe, precuneus, and superior parietal cortex. Collectively, our results highlight how local biological attributes and global connectivity jointly shape cross-disorder cortical abnormalities.

                Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (Pa) are in the position to integrate stress-related information and initiate adaptive neuroendocrine-, autonomic-, metabolic- and behavioral responses. In addition to hypophyseotropic cells, CRH is widely expressed in the CNS, however their involvement in organization of the stress response is not fully understood. In these experiments, we took the advantage of recently available Crh-IRES-Cre; Ai9 mouse line to study the recruitment of hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic CRH neurons in categorically distinct, acute stress reactions. Reporter mice were exposed to restraint, ether, high salt and lipopolisacharide stress. The induced activation of CRH neurons was detected by colocalization of immediate early gene c-Fos in Td tomato expressing cells. We found differential activation of CRH neurons in central amygdaloid nucleus (Ce), bed nucleus stria terminalis lateral division, ventral posterior (BSTLVP), medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), premammillary nucleus (PM) and prepositus hypoglossal nucleus (Pr) in response to physiological (ether, high salt and LPS) and psychological (restraint) stressors. CRH positive cells in Pa became activated, however in the Barringtons nucleus and locus coeruleus no actiovation could be observed due to most tested stressors. Furthermore no CRH neuron activation occured in dorsal (BSTLD) and posterior (BSTLP) region of lateral division of bed nucleus stria terminalis after restraint stress. In the inferior olive only ether exposition resulted in CRH neuron activation. These results confirm activation of CRH neurons in the Pa, reveals new subset of stress-related CRH cells through the mouse brain and disprove the recruitment of CRH cells in the SOL and in the Barringtons nucleus to acute psychological stress in mice.

                Numerical cognition is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. Domestic chicks are a widely used developmental model for studying numerical cognition. Soon after hatching, chicks can perform sophisticated numerical tasks. Nevertheless, the neural basis of their numerical abilities has remained unknown. Here, we describe for the first time number neurons in the caudal nidopallium (functionally equivalent to the mammalian prefrontal cortex) of young domestic chicks. Number neurons that we found in young chicks showed remarkable similarities to those in the prefrontal cortex and caudal nidopallium of adult animals. Thus, our results suggest that numerosity perception based on the labeled-line code provided by number neurons might be an inborn feature of the vertebrate brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic and intrinsic potentiation in O-LM interneurons is induced by theta patterns of stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons display a non-conventional form of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) conferred by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPAR). So far, this form of LTP has been induced in O-LM cells by physiologically unrealistic protocols. We report here the induction of both synaptic and intrinsic potentiation in O-LM interneurons following stimulation of afferent glutamatergic inputs in the theta ({theta}) frequency range. LTP is induced by synaptic activation of CP-AMPAR whereas long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) results from the mGluR1-dependent down-regulation of Kv7 voltage-dependent potassium channel and hyperpolarization activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel through the depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bi-phosphate (PIP2). LTP and LTP-IE are reversible, demonstrating that both synaptic and intrinsic changes are bidirectional in O-LM cells. We conclude that physiological stimuli such as {theta} patterns induce synaptic and intrinsic potentiation in O-LM interneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced feedback barely slows down proprioceptive recalibration</a></h4>

              
                Introducing altered visual feedback of the hand results in quick adaptation of reaching movements. And while this may be partly due to explicit strategies, our lab has shown that implicit changes like reach aftereffects and shift in estimates of the unseen hand, can also emerge and even saturate within a few training trials. The goal of the current study is to determine whether these rapid changes in unseen hand position that occur during classical visuomotor adaptation are diminished or slowed when feedback during training is reduced. We reduced feedback by either providing visual feedback only at the end of the reach (terminal feedback) or constraining hand movements to reduce efferent contribution (exposure). We measured changes as participants completed reaches with a 30{degrees} rotation, a -30{degrees} rotation and clamped visual feedback, with these two impoverished training conditions, along with classical visuomotor adaptation training, while continuously estimating their felt hand position. Classic continuous-cursor training produced exemplary learning curves and rapid and robust shifts in felt hand position. Training with terminal feedback slightly reduced the initial rate of change in overall adaptation and but not the magnitude of shifts in felt hand position. Finally using a robot to constrain and deviate hand movement direction, called exposure training, only delayed saturation of proprioceptive changes by a single trial and these changes were slightly smaller than those during classical training. Taken together, adaptation and shifts in felt hand position are a rapid and robust responses to sensory mismatches and are only slightly modulated when feedback is reduced. This means that, given a visuo-proprioceptive mismatch, the resulting shift in sense of limb position can contribute to movements from the start of adaptation.

                Serotonergic hallucinogenic drugs potently affect human brain and behavior, and have recently emerged as potentially promising agents in psychopharmacotherapy. Complementing rodent studies, zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful animal model for screening neuroactive drugs, including serotonergic agents. Here, we test ten different N-Benzyl-2-phenylethylamine (NBPEA) derivatives with the 2,4- and 3,4-dimethoxy substitutions in the phenethylamine moiety and the -OCH3, -OCF3, -F, -Cl and -Br substitutions in the ortho position of phenyl ring of N-benzyl fragment, assessing their behavioral and neurochemical effects in adult zebrafish. Overall, substitutions in N-benzyl fragment primarily affected zebrafish locomotion, and in phenethylamine moiety - anxiety-like behavior, also modulating brain serotonin and/or dopamine turnover. We also identified several behavioral clusters, including anxiogenic/hypolocomotor (24H-NBF, 24H-NBOMe and 34H-NBF), behaviorally inert (34H-NBBr, 34H-NBCl and 34H-NBOMe), anxiogenic/hallucinogenic-like (24H-NBBr, 24H-NBCl and 24H-NBOMe(F)), and anxiolytic/hallucinogenic-like (34H-NBOMe(F)) agents. The 24H-NBOMe(F) and 34H-NBOMe(F) also reduced despair-like behavior in zebrafish. The artificial intelligence-driven phenotyping supports association of multiple compounds with NMDA antagonists and/or MDMA, supporting their potential hallucinogenic-like properties, as well as other valuable psychoactive effects. In silico functional molecular activity modelling also supports existing of similarities between studied NBOMes drugs, MDMA, and ketamine. Functional analysis implicates potential involvement of serotonin release stimulating activity, calcium channel (voltage-sensitive) activity, some serotonin receptors activity and variety of psychiatric and neurologic disorders treatments activities. Overall, we report potent neuroactive properties of several novel synthetic N-benzylphenylethylamines in an in vivo vertebrate model system (zebrafish), raising the possibility of their potential use in clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking the dynamics of perisaccadic visual signals with magnetoencephalography</a></h4>

              
                Many brain functions are difficult to localize, as they involve distributed networks that reconfigure themselves on short timescales. One example is the integration of oculomotor and visual signals that occurs with each eye movement: The brain must combine motor signals about the eye displacement with retinal signals, to infer the structure of the surrounding environment. Our understanding of this process comes primarily from single-neuron recordings, which are limited in spatial extent, or fMRI measurements, which have poor temporal resolution. We have therefore studied visual processing during eye movements, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), which affords high spatiotemporal resolution. Human subjects performed a task in which they reported the orientation of a visual stimulus while executing a saccade. After removal of eye movement artifacts, time-frequency analysis revealed a signal that propagated in the beta-frequency band from parietal cortex to visual cortex. This signal had the characteristics of perisaccadic 'remapping', a neural signature of the integration of oculomotor and visual signals. These results reveal a novel mechanism of visual perception and demonstrate that MEG can provide a useful window into distributed brain functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Implicit adaptation is modulated by the relevance of feedback</a></h4>

              
                The motor system adapts to changes in the body and the environment by learning from sensory prediction errors, the difference between predicted and actual visual feedback. This process is highly automatic and implicit, with the response to the visual feedback occurring even when the resultant change from the sensory prediction error worsens task performance. Given that informative and relevant feedback in the real world is often intertwined with distracting and irrelevant feedback, we asked how the relevancy of visual feedback impacts implicit adaptation. To tackle this question, we presented multiple cursors as visual feedback in a center-out reaching task and varied the task relevance of these cursors. In other words, participants were instructed to hit a target with a specific task-relevant cursor, while ignoring the other cursors. In Experiment 1, we found that reach aftereffects were attenuated by the mere presence of distracting cursors, compared to reach aftereffects in response to a single task-relevant cursor. The degree of attenuation did not depend on the position of the distracting cursors. In Experiment 2, we examined the interaction between task relevance and attention. Participants were asked to adapt to a task-relevant cursor/target pair, while ignoring the task-irrelevant cursor/target pair. Critically, we jittered the location of the relevant and irrelevant target in an uncorrelated manner, allowing us to index attention via how well participants tracked the position of target. As expected, participants who were better at tracking the task-relevant target/cursor pair showed greater aftereffects, and interestingly, the same correlation applied to the task-irrelevant target/cursor pair. Together, these results highlight the novel role of task relevancy on modulating implicit adaptation, perhaps by giving greater attention to informative sources of feedback, increasing the saliency of the sensory prediction error.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultra-flexible and Stretchable Intrafascicular Peripheral Nerve Recording Device with Axon-dimension, Cuff-less Microneedle Electrode Array</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nerve mapping tools with higher spatial resolution are needed to advance systems neuroscience, and potentially provide a closed-loop biomarker in neuromodulation applications. Two critical challenges of microscale neural interfaces are (i) how to apply them to small peripheral nerves, and (ii) how to minimize chronic reactivity. We developed a flexible microneedle nerve array (MINA), which is the first high-density penetrating electrode array made with axon-sized silicon microneedles embedded in low-modulus thin silicone. We present the design, fabrication, acute recording, and chronic reactivity to an implanted MINA. Distinctive units were identified in the rat peroneal nerve. We also demonstrate a long-term, cuff-free, and suture-free fixation manner using rose bengal as a light-activated adhesive for two timepoints. The tissue response at 1-week included a sham (N=5) and MINA-implanted (N=5) group, and the response at 6-week also included a sham (N=3) and MINA-implanted (N=4) group. These conditions were quantified in the left vagus nerve of rats using histomorphometry. Micro-CT was added to visualize and quantify tissue encapsulation around the implant. MINA demonstrated a reduction in encapsulation thickness over previously quantified interfascicular methods. Future challenges include techniques for precise insertion of the microneedle electrodes and demonstrating long-term recording.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-related changes in aperiodic activity are related to visual working memory capacity independent of event-related potentials and alpha oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in visual working memory capacity are related to slow-wave event-related potentials (ERPs) and suppression of alpha-band oscillatory power measured during the delay period of memory tasks using electroencephalography (EEG). However, recent evidence suggests that changes in the non-oscillatory, aperiodic features of the EEG signal may also contribute to working memory performance. We assessed several features of task-related changes in aperiodic activity including the spatial distribution, the effect of memory load, and the relationship between memory capacity, slow-wave ERPs, and alpha suppression. Eighty-four healthy individuals performed a continuous recall working memory task consisting of 2, 4 or 6 coloured squares while EEG was recorded. Aperiodic activity during a baseline and delay period was quantified by fitting a model to the background of the EEG power spectra using the FOOOF toolbox, which returned parameters describing the slope (exponent) and broadband offset of the spectra. The aperiodic exponent decreased (i.e., slope flattened) over lateral parieto-occipital electrodes but increased (i.e., slope steepened) over fronto-central electrodes during the delay period, whereas the offset decreased over parieto-occipital electrodes. These task-related changes in aperiodic activity were not altered by memory load. Larger increases in the aperiodic exponent were associated with higher working memory capacity measured from both the EEG task and a separate battery of complex span tasks, and this relationship was independent of slow-wave ERPs and alpha suppression. Our findings suggest that task-related changes in aperiodic activity during working memory are region specific and reflect an independent neural mechanism important for general working memory ability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mosquito odorant receptor sensitive to natural spatial repellents and inhibitory compounds</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we have identified an odorant receptor (OR) from the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, CquiOR32, which responded to both odorants (agonists) and inhibitory compounds (antagonists). CquiOR32/CquiOrco-expressing oocytes responded to methyl salicylate and other odorants with inward (regular) currents but gave currents in the reverse direction when challenged with eucalyptol and other inhibitors. To determine whether hitherto unknown ORs show this intrareceptor inhibition, we have now examined two other receptors in the same cluster, CquiOR27 and CquiOR28. We cloned and tested four variants of CquiOR28, but none of the 250 compounds in our panel of odorants, including an Orco ligand candidate (OCL12), elicited inward or outward currents. By contrast, CquiOR27/CquiOrco-expressing oocytes gave robust, dose-dependent inward currents when challenged with {gamma}-octalactone and other odorants. On the other hand, octylamine and other phenolic compounds elicited dose-dependent currents in the reverse direction. When stimulatory and inhibitory compounds were presented in binary mixtures, {gamma}-octalactone-elicited inward currents were attenuated in a dose-dependent manner according to the concentration of octylamine. As part of our chemical ecology approach, we tested the repellency activity of the best ligands in the surface landing and feeding assay and a newly reported hand-in cage assay. Protection elicited by {gamma}-octalactone did not differ significantly from that of DEET at the same dose. In the hand-in cage assay, a cream formulation of {gamma}-octalactone showed 97.0 {+/-} 1.3% protection, with 47.6 {+/-} 8.3% and 1.4 {+/-} 0.7% landings per trial in the hands covered with a control and {gamma}-octalactone cream, respectively (N=8, p=0.0078, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tissue volume estimation and age prediction using rapid structural brain scans</a></h4>

              
                The multicontrast EPImix sequence generates 6 contrasts, including a T1-weighted scan, in ~1 minute. EPImix shows comparable diagnostic performance to conventional scans under qualitative clinical evaluation, and similarities in simple quantitative measures including contrast intensity. However, EPImix scans have not yet been compared to standard MRI scans using established quantitative measures. In this study, we compared conventional and EPImix-derived T1-weighted scans of 64 healthy participants using tissue volume estimates and predicted brain-age. All scans were pre-processed using the SPM12 DARTEL pipeline, generating measures of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volume. Brain-age was predicted using brainageR, a Gaussian process regression model previously trained on a large sample of standard T1-weighted scans. Estimates of both global and voxel-wise tissue volume showed significantly similar results between standard and EPImix-derived T1-weighted scans. Brain-age estimates from both sequences were significantly correlated, although EPImix T1-weighted scans showed a systematic offset in predictions of chronological age. Supplementary analyses suggest that this is likely caused by the reduced field-of-view of EPImix scans, and the use of a brain-age model trained using conventional T1-weighted scans. However, this systematic error can be corrected using additional regression of T1-predicted brain-age onto EPImix-predicted brain-age. Finally, retest EPImix scans acquired for 10 participants demonstrated high test-retest reliability in all evaluated quantitative measurements. Quantitative analysis of EPImix scans holds potential to reduce scanning time, increasing participant comfort and reducing cost, as well as to support automation of scanning, utilising active learning for faster and individually-tailored (neuro)imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide continuous functional ultrasound imaging for real-time monitoring of hemodynamics during ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke occurs with no warning, and therefore, very little is known about hemodynamic perturbations in the brain immediately after stroke onset. In this study, functional ultrasound imaging was used to monitor the hemodynamic changes in relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) compared to baseline. rCBV variations were analyzed brain-wide and continuously at high spatiotemporal resolution (100m, 2Hz) until 70mins after stroke onset in rats. We compared two stroke models, with either a permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) or a tandem occlusion of both the common carotid and middle cerebral arteries (CCAo+MCAo). We observed a typical hemodynamic pattern, including a quick drop of the rCBV after MCAo, followed by spontaneous reperfusion of several brain regions located in the vicinity of the ischemic core. The severity and location of the ischemia were highly variable between animals. Still, both parameters were, on average, in good agreement with the final ischemic lesion volume measured 24hrs after stroke onset for the MCAo but not the CCAo+MCAo model. For the latter, we observed that the infarct was extended to regions that were initially not ischemic and located rostrally of the ischemic core. These regions strongly colocalize with the origin of transient hemodynamic events associated with spreading depolarizations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A horizon for haptic perception</a></h4>

              
                The spatial limits of sensory acquisition (its sensory horizon) is a fundamental property of any sensorimotor system. In the present study, we sought to determine the sensory horizon for the human haptic modality. At first blush, it seems obvious that the haptic system is bounded by the space where the body can interact with the environment (e.g., the arm span). However, the human somatosensory system is exquisitely tuned to sensing with tools; blind-cane navigation being a classic example of this. The horizon of haptic perception therefore extends beyond body space, but to what extent is unknown. We first used neuromechanical modelling to determine the theoretical horizon, which we pinpointed as six meters. We then used a psychophysical localization paradigm to behaviorally confirm that humans can haptically localize objects using a six-meter rod. This finding underscores the incredibly flexibility of the brain's sensorimotor representations, as they can be adapted to sense with an object many times longer than the user's own body.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of electroencephalogram feature-based transcranial alternating current stimulation on working memory and electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can influence cognitive functions by modulating brain oscillations. However, results regarding the effectiveness of tACS in regulating cognitive performance have been inconsistent. In the present study, we aimed to find EEG characteristics associated with the improvements in working memory performance, to select tACS stimulus targets and frequency based on this feature, and to explore effects of selected stimulus on verbal working memory. To achieve this goal, we first investigated the EEG characteristics associated with improvements in working memory performance with the aid of EEG analyses and machine learning techniques. These analyses suggested that 8 Hz activity in the prefrontal region was related to accuracy in the verbal working memory task. The tACS stimulus target and pattern were then selected based on the EEG feature. Finally, the selected tACS frequency (8 Hz tACS in the prefrontal region) was applied to modulate working memory. The performance of working memory was improved significantly using the selected stimulation than using 40 Hz and sham stimulation (Especially for participants with low verbal working memory). In conclusion, using EEG features related to positive behavioral changes to select brain regions and stimulation patterns for tACS is an effective intervention for improving working memory. Our results contribute to the groundwork for future tACS closed-loop interventions for cognitive deterioration.

                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is increasingly used as a noninvasive technique for neuromodulation in research and clinical applications, yet its mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we present the first in-human study evaluating the effects of TMS using intracranial electrocorticography (iEEG) in neurosurgical patients. We first evaluated safety in a gel-based phantom. We then performed TMS-iEEG in 20 neurosurgical participants with no adverse events. Next, we evaluated brain-wide intracranial responses to single pulses of TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (N=10, 1414 electrodes). We demonstrate that TMS preferentially induces neuronal responses locally within the dlPFC at sites with higher electric field strength. Evoked responses were also noted downstream in the anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortex, regions functionally connected to the dlPFC. These findings support the safety and promise of TMS-iEEG in humans to examine local and network-level effects of TMS with higher spatiotemporal resolution than currently available methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The synaptic vesicle protein Mover/TPRG1L is associated with lipid droplets in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Crucial brain functions such as neurotransmission, myelination, and signaling pose a high demand for lipids. Lipid dysregulation is associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Astrocytes protect neurons from lipid induced damage by accumulating and metabolizing toxic lipids in organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). LDs have long been considered as lipid storage compartments in adipocytes, but less is known about their biogenesis and composition in the brain. In particular, proteins covering the LD surface are not yet fully identified. Here, we report that the synaptic vesicle protein Mover/TPRG1L, which regulates the probability of neurotransmitter release in neurons, is a component of the LD coat in astrocytes. Using conventional and super resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that Mover surrounds naive and oleic acid induced astrocytic LDs. We confirm the identity of astrocytic LDs using the neutral lipid stains Bodipy and LipidTox, as well as immunofluorescence for perilipin-2, a known component of the LD coat. In astrocytes, recombinant Mover was sufficient to induce an accumulation of LDs. Furthermore, we identified point mutations that abolish targeting to LDs and show similarities in the required binding sequences for association to the presynapse and LDs. Our results show that Mover is not only a presynaptic protein but also a candidate for LD regulation. This highlights the dual role of Mover in synaptic transmission and regulation of astrocytic LDs, which may be particularly important in the context of lipid-related neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excessive self-grooming of Shank3 mutant mice is associated with gene dysregulation and imbalance between the striosome and matrix compartments in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterised by atypical social communication and stereotyped behaviours. Mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 are detected in 1-2% of patients with ASD and intellectual disability (ID), but the mechanisms underpinning the symptoms remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the behaviour of Shank3 mutant mice deleted for exon 11 (Shank3{Delta}11/{Delta}11) from three to twelve months of age. We observed decreased locomotor activity, increased stereotyped self-grooming and atypical socio-sexual interaction compared to wild-type littermates. We then used RNAseq on four brain regions of the same animals to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG). DEGs were identified mainly in the striatum and were associated with synaptic transmission (e.g. Grm2, Dlgap1), G-protein-signalling pathways (e.g. Gnal, Prkcg1, and Camk2g), as well as excitation/inhibition balance (e.g. Gad2). Downregulated and upregulated genes were respectively enriched in the gene clusters of medium-sized spiny neurons expressing the dopamine 1 (D1-MSN) and the dopamine 2 receptor (D2-MSN). Moreover, expression of DEGs reported as striosome markers within the striatum (Cnr1, Gnal1, Gad2, and Drd4) were positively correlated with excessive self-grooming. Finally, we showed that the striosome compartment of Shank3{Delta}11/{Delta}11 mice was enlarged and displayed higher expression of GAD65 compared to wild-type mice. Altogether, these results shed light on a possible role of the striosomes/matrix imbalance in excessive self-grooming in Shank3{Delta}11/{Delta}11 mice. Such striatal alterations could be present in a subgroup of patients with ASD and ID and could open the way to new therapeutic approaches.

                Analysis and interpretation of neuroimaging datasets has become a multidisciplinary endeavor, relying not only on statistical methods, but increasingly on associations with respect to other brain-derived features such as gene expression, histological data, and functional as well as cognitive architectures. Here we introduce BrainStat - a toolbox for (i) univariate and multivariate general linear models in volumetric and surface-based brain imaging datasets, and (ii) multidomain feature association of results with respect to spatial maps of post-mortem gene expression and histology, as well as task-based fMRI meta-analysis, canonical resting-state fMRI networks, and resting-state derived gradients across several common surface templates. The combination of statistics and feature associations into a turnkey toolbox offers to streamline analytical processes and accelerate cross-modal. The toolbox is implemented in both Python and MATLAB, two widely used programming languages in the neuroimaging and neuroinformatics communities. BrainStat is openly available and complemented by an expandable documentation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Basal amygdala inputs to the medial prefrontal cortex mediate fear memory strengthening</a></h4>

              
                Survival critically depends on the memorization of stimuli recurrently predicting pleasant or aversive experiences. Memory strengthening by additional learning is a critical process allowing the long-term stabilization of learned aversive experience. However, the underlying neuronal circuits and mechanisms are still largely unknown. Using a combination of single unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we observed that strengthened fear responses following successive fear learning episodes led to a remapping in the population of basal amygdala (BA) neurons encoding the conditioned stimulus. Moreover, strengthened fear responses were preferentially carried by BA neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Selective optogenetic inhibition of BA terminals in the mPFC during a second learning episode prevented fear memory strengthening. Together, our findings suggest that fear memory strengthening with additional training critically depends on the selective remapping of a subpopulation of BA neurons projecting to the mPFC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocyte glutamate transport is modulated by motor learning and regulates neuronal correlations and movement encoding by motor cortex neurons</a></h4>

              
                While motor cortex is crucial for learning precise and reliable movements, whether and how astrocytes contribute to its plasticity and function during motor learning is unknown. Here we report that primary motor cortex (M1) astrocytes in mice show in vivo plasticity during learning of a lever push task, as revealed by transcriptomic and functional modifications. In particular, we observe changes in expression of glutamate transporter genes and increased coincidence of intracellular calcium events. Astrocyte-specific manipulations of M1 are sufficient to alter motor learning and execution, and neuronal population coding, in the same task. Mice expressing decreased levels of the astrocyte glutamate transporter GLT1 show impaired and variable movement trajectories. Mice with increased astrocyte Gq signaling show decreased performance rates, delayed response times and impaired trajectories, along with abnormally high levels of GLT1. In both groups of mice, M1 neurons have altered inter-neuronal correlations and impaired population representations of task parameters, including response time and movement trajectories. Thus, astrocytes have a specific role in coordinating M1 neuronal activity during motor learning, and control learned movement execution and dexterity through mechanisms that importantly include fine regulation of glutamate transport.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active Predictive Coding Networks: A Neural Solution to the Problem of Learning Reference Frames and Part-Whole Hierarchies</a></h4>

              
                We introduce Active Predictive Coding Networks (APCNs), a new class of neural networks that solve a major problem posed by Hinton and others in the fields of artificial intelligence and brain modeling: how can neural networks learn intrinsic reference frames for objects and parse visual scenes into part-whole hierarchies by dynamically allocating nodes in a parse tree? APCNs address this problem by using a novel combination of ideas: (1) hypernetworks are used for dynamically generating recurrent neural networks that predict parts and their locations within intrinsic reference frames conditioned on higher object-level embedding vectors, and (2) reinforcement learning is used in conjunction with backpropagation for end-to-end learning of model parameters. The APCN architecture lends itself naturally to multilevel hierarchical learning and is closely related to predictive coding models of cortical function. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Omniglot datasets, we demonstrate that APCNs can (a) learn to parse images into part-whole hierarchies, (b) learn compositional representations, and (c) transfer their knowledge to unseen classes of objects. With their ability to dynamically generate parse trees with part locations for objects, APCNs offer a new framework for explainable AI that leverages advances in deep learning while retaining interpretability and compositionality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterogeneity in Neuronal Dynamics is Learned by Gradient Descent for Temporal Processing Tasks</a></h4>

              
                Individual neurons in the brain have complex intrinsic dynamics that are highly diverse. We hypothesize that the complex dynamics produced by networks of complex and heterogeneous neurons may contribute to the brain's ability to process and respond to temporally complex data. To study the role of complex and heterogeneous neuronal dynamics in network computation, we develop a rate-based neuronal model, the generalized-leaky-integrate-and-firing-rate (GLIFR) model, which is a rate-equivalent of the generalized-leaky-integrate-and-fire model. The GLIFR model has multiple dynamical mechanisms which add to the complexity of its activity while maintaining differentiability. We focus on the role of after-spike currents, currents induced or modulated by neuronal spikes, in producing rich temporal dynamics. We use machine learning techniques to learn both synaptic weights and parameters underlying intrinsic dynamics to solve temporal tasks. The GLIFR model allows us to use standard gradient descent techniques rather than surrogate gradient descent, which has been utilized in spiking neural networks. After establishing the ability to optimize parameters using gradient descent in single neurons, we ask how networks of GLIFR neurons learn and perform on temporally challenging tasks, such as sinusoidal pattern generation and sequential MNIST. We find that these networks learn a diversity of parameters, which gives rise to diversity in neuronal dynamics. We also observe that training networks on the sequential MNIST task leads to formation of cell classes based on the clustering of neuronal parameters. GLIFR networks have mixed performance when compared to vanilla recurrent neural networks but appear to be more robust to random silencing. When we explore these performance gains further, we find that both the ability to learn heterogeneity and the presence of after-spike currents contribute. Our work both demonstrates the computational robustness of neuronal complexity and diversity in networks and demonstrates a feasible method of training such models using exact gradients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A genetically-defined population in the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray selectively promotes flight to safety</a></h4>

              
                When encountering external threats, survival depends on the engagement of appropriate defensive reactions to minimize harm. There are major clinical implications for identifying the neural circuitry and activation patterns that produce such defensive reactions, as maladaptive overactivation of these circuits underlies pathological human anxiety and fear responses. A compelling body of work has linked activation of large glutamatergic neuronal populations in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) to defensive reactions such as freezing, flight and threat-induced analgesia. These pioneering data have firmly established that the overarching functional organization axis of the PAG is along anatomically-defined columnar boundaries. Accordingly, broad activation of the dorsolateral column induces flight, while activation of the lateral or ventrolateral (l and vl) columns induces freezing. However, the PAG contains a diverse arrangement of cell types that vary in neurochemical profile and location. How these cell types contribute to defensive responses remains largely unknown, indicating that targeting sparse, genetically-defined populations can lead to a deeper understanding of how the PAG generates a wide array of behaviors. Though several prior works showed that broad excitation of the lPAG or vlPAG causes freezing, we found that activation of lateral and ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG) cholecystokinin-expressing (cck) cells selectively causes flight to safer regions within an environment. Furthermore, inhibition of l/vlPAG-cck cells reduces avoidance of a predatory threat without altering other defensive behaviors like freezing. Lastly, l/vlPAG-cck activity increases away from threat and during movements towards safer locations. In contrast, activating l/vlPAG cells pan-neuronally promoted freezing and these cells were activated near threat. These data underscore the importance of investigating genetically-identified PAG cells. Using this approach, we found a sparse population of cck-expressing l/vlPAG cells that have distinct and opposing function and neural activation motifs compared to the broader local ensemble defined solely by columnar anatomical boundaries. Thus, in addition to the anatomical columnar architecture of the APG, the molecular identity of PAG cells may confer an additional axis of functional organization, revealing unexplored functional heterogeneity.

                Humans' extraordinary ability to understand speech in noise relies on multiple processes that develop with age. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we characterize the underlying neuromaturational basis by quantifying how cortical oscillations in 144 participants (aged 5 to 27 years) track phrasal and syllabic structures in connected speech mixed with different types of noise. While the extraction of prosodic cues from clear speech was stable during development, its maintenance in a multi-talker background matured rapidly up to age 9 and was associated with speech comprehension. Furthermore, while the extraction of subtler information provided by syllables matured at age 9, its maintenance in noisy backgrounds progressively matured until adulthood. Altogether, these results highlight distinct behaviorally relevant maturational trajectories for the neuronal signatures of speech perception. In accordance with grain-size proposals, neuromaturational milestones are reached increasingly late for linguistic units of decreasing size, with further delays incurred by noise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A mixed generative model of auditory word repetition</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we introduce a word repetition generative model (WORM), which when combined with an appropriate belief updating scheme is capable of inferring the word that should be spoken when presented with an auditory cue. Our generative model takes a deep temporal form, combining both discrete and continuous states. This allows a (synthetic) WORM agent to perform categorical inference on continuous acoustic signals, and based on the same model to repeat heard words at the appropriate time. From the perspective of word production, the model simulates how high-level beliefs about discrete lexical, prosodic and context attributes give rise to continuous acoustic signals at the sensory level. From the perspective of word recognition, it simulates how continuous acoustic signals are recognised as words and, how (and when) they should be repeated. We establish the face validity of our generative model by simulating a word repetition paradigm in which a synthetic agent or a human subject hears a target word and subsequently reproduces that word. The repeated word should be the target word but differs acoustically. The results of these simulations reveal how the generative model correctly infers what must be repeated, to the extent it can successfully interact with a human subject. This provides a formal process theory of auditory perception and production that can be deployed in health and disease. We conclude with a discussion of how the generative model could be scaled-up to include a larger phonetic and phonotactic repertoire, complex higher-level attributes (e.g., semantic, concepts, etc.), and produce more elaborate exchanges.

	<p>Introduction: The role of increased oxidative stress and alterations to the nitric oxide (NO) pathway have been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). The two pathways interact closely with each other but have not been studied simultaneously in MDD. This study aimed to assess and compare the levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress in the neutrophils (PMNs) of drug-naive MDD patients and their first-degree relatives. Methods: 29 drug-naive MDD patients and 27 healthy first-degree relatives and healthy controls aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;45 years were included in this study. An assessment of the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrites, neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), and myeloperoxidase in PMNs, and cortisol in serum was carried out. Results: Compared to healthy controls, the generation of free radicals PMNs, myeloperoxidase activity, nNOS mRNA expression in PMNs, and cortisol level in serum were significantly higher in drug-naive depression patients. Indeed, increased levels of myeloperoxidase and serum cortisol were also noted in first-degree relatives. The total nitrite content in the PMNs and plasma however was significantly lower in both patients and first-degree relatives. Interestingly, a positive correlation was established in the ROS levels in the PMNs, plasma and neutrophil nitrite, and the serum cortisol level between MDD patients and their first-degree relatives. Conclusion: The results of this study contribute towards a better understanding of the familial association of depressive disorder, and demonstrate for the first time that neutrophil ROS/RNS, plasma nitrite, and serum cortisol levels are positively correlated between MDD patients and their first-degree relatives. However, further studies in larger, more diverse samples are needed to extend these pathways as potential biomarkers to identify persons at high risk for psychopathology at an early stage.</p>

	<p>Animal studies have discovered that noise, even at levels that produce no permanent threshold shift, may cause cochlear damage and selective nerve degeneration. A hallmark of such damage, or synaptopathy, is recovered threshold but reduced suprathreshold amplitude for the auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I. The objective of the present study is to evaluate whether the ABR wave I amplitude or slope can be used to diagnose tinnitus in humans. A total of 43 human subjects, consisting of 21 with tinnitus and 22 without tinnitus, participated in the study. The subjects were on average 44 &amp;amp;plusmn; 24 (standard deviation) years old and 16 were female; a subgroup of 19 were young adults with normal audiograms from 125 to 8000 Hz. The ABR was measured using ear canal recording tiptrodes for clicks, 1000, 4000 and 8000 Hz tone bursts at 30, 50, and 70 dB nHL. Compared with control subjects, tinnitus subjects did not show reduced ABR wave I amplitude or slope in either the entire group of 21 tinnitus subjects or a subset of tinnitus subjects with normal audiograms. Despite the small sample size and diverse tinnitus population, the present result suggests that low signal-to-noise ratios in non-invasive measurement of the ABR limit its clinical utility in diagnosing tinnitus in humans.</p>

	<p>In this review we attempt to collate the existing scientific evidence regarding the possible role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the pathophysiology of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), as well as to investigate the impact of PD/parkinsonism on the clinical course of the viral infection itself. Since etiology of PD is not completely understood, various studies suggest different potential links between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and PD. Suggested connections include, among others, similar prodromal symptoms, renin&amp;amp;ndash;angiotensin&amp;amp;ndash;aldosterone system involvement, or gut microbiome dysbiosis participation. Despite the initial assumptions that, as a mainly elderly population suffering from rigidity of respiratory muscles, impairment of cough reflex, and dyspnea, PD patients would be more susceptible to viral infection, and would experience a more aggressive course of COVID-19, the published scientific reports contain mutually exclusive data that require further investigation and meta-analysis.</p>

	<p>Students&amp;amp;rsquo; use of working memory (WM) is a key to academic success, as many subject areas and various tasks school-aged children encounter require the ability to attend to, work with, and recall information. Children with poor WM ability typically struggle with academic work compared to similar-aged peers without WM deficits. Further, WM has been shown to be significantly correlated with inattention and disorganization in those with ADHD, and WM deficits have also been identified as a potential underpinning of specific learning disorder (SLD). As an intervention technique, the use of computerized cognitive training has demonstrated improved attention and working memory skills in children with WM deficits, and children that have completed cognitive training protocols have demonstrated performance improvements in reading and math. The current study aimed to examine the effectiveness of cognitive training (conducted in a clinical setting) for students diagnosed with ADHD and SLD. Using paired-samples t-tests and a psychometric network modeling technique, results from data obtained from a sample of 43 school-aged children showed (1) that attention and working memory improved following cognitive training and (2) that cognitive training might be related to cognitive structural changes found pre- to post-training among the variables being measured. Implications for clinical practice and school-based interventions are discussed.</p>

	<p>Small sample learning ability is one of the most significant characteristics of the human brain. However, its mechanism is yet to be fully unveiled. In recent years, brain-inspired artificial intelligence has become a very hot research domain. Researchers explored brain-inspired technologies or architectures to construct neural networks that could achieve human-alike intelligence. In this work, we presented our effort at evaluation of the effect of dynamic behavior and topology co-learning of neurons and synapses on the small sample learning ability of spiking neural network. Results show that the dynamic behavior and topology co-learning mechanism of neurons and synapses presented in our work could significantly reduce the number of required samples, while maintaining a reasonable performance on the MNIST data-set, resulting in a very lightweight neural network structure.</p>

	<p>Brain synchronizations are orchestrated from neuronal oscillations through frequency interactions, such as the alpha rhythm during relaxation. Nevertheless, how the intrinsic interaction forges functional integrity across brain segregations remains elusive, thereby motivating recent studies to localize frequency interactions of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). To this point, we aim to unveil the fMRI-based spectral interactions using the time-frequency (TF) analysis; however, Fourier-based TF analyses impose restrictions on revealing frequency interactions given the limited time points in fMRI signals. Instead of using the Fourier-based wavelet analysis to identify the fMRI frequency of interests, we employed the Hilbert&amp;amp;ndash;Huang transform (HHT) for probing the specific frequency contribution to the functional integration, called ensemble spectral interaction (ESI). By simulating data with time-variant frequency changes, we demonstrated the Hilbert TF maps with high spectro-temporal resolution and full accessibility in comparison with the wavelet TF maps. By detecting amplitude-to-amplitude frequency couplings (AAC) across brain regions, we elucidated the ESI disparity between the eye-closed (EC) and eye-open (EO) conditions in rs-fMRI. In the visual network, the strength of the spectral interaction within 0.03&amp;amp;ndash;0.04 Hz was amplified in EC compared with that in EO condition, whereas a canonical connectivity analysis did not present differences between conditions. Collectively, leveraging from the instantaneous frequency of HHT, we firstly addressed the ESI technique to map the fMRI-based functional connectivity in a brand-new AAC perspective. The ESI possesses potential in elucidating the functional connectivity at specific frequency bins, thereby providing additional diagnostic merits for future clinical neuroscience.</p>

<p>We induced chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) by laser photocoagulation and then characterized the survival of general retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) subtypes. We found that ipRGCs suffer significant loss, similar to the general RGC population, but ipRGC subtypes are differentially affected following chronic OHT. M4 ipRGCs are susceptible to chronic OHT, while M1 ipRGCs exhibit almost no cell loss following chronic OHT. Accordingly, we induced OHT bilaterally and observed that circadian re-entrainment and circadian rhythmicity are largely not disrupted in these mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve damage. Studies, including this study, support that RGCs degenerate and die in a type-specific manner following the disease insult. Here we specifically examined one RGC type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC), and its associated functional deficits in a mouse model of experimental glaucoma. We induced chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) by laser photocoagulation and then characterized the survival of ipRGC subtypes. We found that ipRGCs suffer significant loss, similar to the general RGC population, but ipRGC subtypes are differentially affected following chronic OHT. M4 ipRGCs, which are involved in pattern vision, are susceptible to chronic OHT. Correspondingly, mice with chronic OHT experience reduced contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. By comparison, M1 ipRGCs, which project to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to regulate circadian rhythmicity, exhibit almost no cell loss following chronic OHT. Accordingly, we observed that circadian re-entrainment and circadian rhythmicity are largely not disrupted in OHT mice. Our study demonstrates the link between subtype-specific ipRGC survival and behavioral deficits in glaucomatous mice. These findings provide insight into glaucoma-induced visual behavioral deficits and their underlying mechanisms.</p>

     alt="The lateral posterior clock neurons of Drosophila melanogaster express three neuropeptides and have multiple connections within the circadian clock network and beyond"/>
<p>The authors characterized <i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) that belong to the circadian clock neurons. They demonstrate that the LPNs are well connected to the other clock neurons (s-LN<sub>v</sub>, LN<sub>d</sub>, DN<sub>2</sub>, DN<sub>1p</sub>) and to putative wake and sleep centers as well as centers that control temperature preference, metabolism, feeding, and oviposition (e.g., the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> (PI), the mushroom body (MB), and the dorsal fan-shaped body(dFB)). The LPNs get input from the small ventrolateral clock neurons (s-LN<sub>v</sub>) and may signal to the downstream neurons and centers via direct synapses and/or via three neuropeptides (AstA, AstC, and DH31), which they express rhythmically. Furthermore, the authors show that the LPNs are heterogeneous (LPN-Type 1 and LPN-Type 2) and appear to have opposing roles on activity and sleep.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) belong to a small group of circadian clock neurons that is so far not characterized in detail. Thanks to a new highly specific split-Gal4 line, here we describe LPNs’ morphology in fine detail, their synaptic connections, daily bimodal expression of neuropeptides, and propose a putative role of this cluster in controlling daily activity and sleep patterns. We found that the three LPNs are heterogeneous. Two of the neurons with similar morphology arborize in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum and most likely promote sleep. One unique, possibly wakefulness-promoting, neuron with wider arborizations extends from the superior lateral protocerebrum toward the anterior optic tubercle. Both LPN types exhibit manifold connections with the other circadian clock neurons, especially with those that control the flies’ morning and evening activity (M- and E-neurons, respectively). In addition, they form synaptic connections with neurons of the mushroom bodies, the fan-shaped body, and with many additional still unidentified neurons. We found that both LPN types rhythmically express three neuropeptides, Allostatin A, Allostatin C, and Diuretic Hormone 31 with maxima in the morning and the evening. The three LPN neuropeptides may, furthermore, signal to the insect hormonal center in the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> and contribute to rhythmic modulation of metabolism, feeding, and reproduction. We discuss our findings in the light of anatomical details gained by the recently published hemibrain of a single female fly on the electron microscopic level and of previous functional studies concerning the LPN.</p>

     alt="Regional expression of neuropeptides in the retina of the terrestrial slug Limax valentianus (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Limacidae)"/>
<p>Generally, retinal photoreceptors in the retina are thought to be uniform with respect to the neurotransmitters they contain. In the study of Matsuo and Matsuo, at least 12 different neuropeptide genes are found to be expressed in a region-specific manner in the lens-bearing eye of the terrestrial slug <i>Limax</i>.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastropods use lens-bearing eyes to detect ambient light. The retina contains photoreceptors that directly project to the brain. Here, we identified the neurotransmitters that the retinal cells use for projection to the brain in the terrestrial slug <i>Limax</i>. We identified 12 genes encoding neuropeptides as well as a novel vesicular glutamate transporter, a marker of glutamatergic neuron, expressed in the retinal cells. Spatial expression profiles of the neuropeptide genes were determined by in situ hybridization. WWamide/MIP1/Pedal peptide2 were coexpressed in the neurons of the accessory retina. In the main retina, prohormone-4 was expressed in the ventrolateral region. Clionin was expressed in the ventromedial region. Pedal peptide was expressed in the anterior region of the main retina and in the accessory retina. Enterin was expressed in many neurons, including the accessory retina, but not in the dorsal region. FxRIamide1 and 2 were coexpressed in the posterior region. Prohormone-4 variant was uniformly expressed in many neurons but scarcely in the accessory retina. MIP2 was widely expressed throughout the dorsoventral axis in the posteriolateral region of the main retina. Myo1 was expressed in many neurons of the main retina but predominantly in the dorsal region. These expression patterns were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against the neuropeptides. Projections of these peptidergic retinal neurons were confirmed by immunostaining of the optic nerve. Our present study revealed regional differentiation of the retina with respect to the neurotransmitters that the retinal cells use.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Automated Detection and Localization of Synaptic Vesicles in Electron Microscopy Images</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Information transfer and integration in the brain occurs at chemical synapses and is mediated by the fusion of synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter. Synaptic vesicle dynamic spatial organization regulates synaptic transmission as well as synaptic plasticity. Because of their small size, synaptic vesicles require electron microscopy (EM) for their imaging, and their analysis is conducted manually. The manual annotation and segmentation of the hundreds to thousands of synaptic vesicles, is highly time consuming and limits the throughput of data collection. To overcome this limitation, we built an algorithm, mainly relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), capable of automatically detecting and localizing synaptic vesicles in electron micrographs. The algorithm was trained on murine synapses but we show that it works well on synapses from different species, ranging from zebrafish to human, and from different preparations. As output, we provide the vesicle count and coordinates, the nearest neighbor distance (nnd) and the estimate of the vesicles area. We also provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through image analysis, result visualization, and manual proof-reading. The application of our algorithm is especially recommended for images produced by transmission EM. Since this type of imaging is used routinely to investigate presynaptic terminals, our solution will likely be of interest for numerous research groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Arcuate Angiotensin II Increases Arterial Pressure via Coordinated Increases in Sympathetic Nerve Activity and Vasopressin Secretion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The arcuate nucleus (ArcN) is an integrative hub for the regulation of energy balance, reproduction, and arterial pressure (AP), all of which are influenced by Angiotensin II (AngII); however, the cellular mechanisms and downstream neurocircuitry are unclear. Here, we show that ArcN AngII increases AP in female rats via two phases, both of which are mediated via activation of AngII type 1 receptors (AT1aRs): initial vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction, followed by slowly developing increases in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and heart rate (HR). In male rats, ArcN AngII evoked a similarly slow increase in SNA, but the initial pressor response was variable. In females, the effects of ArcN AngII varied during the estrous cycle, with significant increases in SNA, HR, and AP occurring during diestrus and estrus, but only increased AP during proestrus. Pregnancy markedly increased the expression of AT1aR in the ArcN with parallel substantial AngII-induced increases in SNA and MAP. In both sexes, the sympathoexcitation relied on suppression of tonic ArcN sympathoinhibitory neuropeptide Y (NPY) inputs, and activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) projections, to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Few or no NPY or POMC neurons expressed the AT1aR, suggesting that AngII increases AP and SNA at least in part indirectly via local interneurons, which express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and VGat (i.e., GABAergic). ArcN TH neurons release GABA locally, and central AT1aR and TH neurons mediate stress responses; therefore, we propose that TH AT1aR neurons are well situated to locally coordinate the regulation of multiple modalities within the ArcN in response to stress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Some implications of postnatal hippocampal development</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is well established that in most species, the hippocampus shows extensive postnatal development. This delayed maturation has a number of implications, which can be thought of in three categories. First, the late maturation has the direct effect of depriving the developing organism of at least some of the functions of the hippocampus, in particular place learning, context coding and in humans, episodic memory. Second, such learning that does occur very early in life, prior to hippocampal maturation, will largely bear the imprint and properties of those brain systems that, unlike the hippocampus, are fully functional early in life. Third, the active state of development of hippocampus in the first weeks and months of life render this structure susceptible to disruption by environmental and/or chromosomal factors. In this article, I discuss my efforts, with many colleagues over the past 40 years, to understand each of these implications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Sleep as a window on the sensorimotor foundations of the developing hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampal formation plays established roles in learning, memory, and related cognitive functions. Recent findings also suggest that the hippocampus integrates sensory feedback from self-generated movements to modulate ongoing motor responses in a changing environment. Such findings support the view of Bland and Oddie (Behavioural Brain Research, 2001, 127, 119–136) that the hippocampus is a site of sensorimotor integration. In further support of this view, we review neurophysiological evidence in developing rats that hippocampal function is built on a sensorimotor foundation and that this foundation is especially evident early in development. Moreover, at those ages when the hippocampus is first establishing functional connectivity with distant sensory and motor structures, that connectivity is preferentially expressed during periods of active (or REM) sleep. These findings reinforce the notion that sleep, as the predominant state of early infancy, provides a critical context for sensorimotor development, including development of the hippocampus and its associated network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Behind the scenes: Are latent memories supported by calcium independent plasticity?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) can be considered to be the de facto “plasticity” receptors in the brain due to their central role in the activity-dependent modification of neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission. Since the 1980s, research on NMDARs has focused on the second messenger properties of calcium and the downstream signaling pathways that mediate alterations in neural form and function. Recently, NMDARs were shown to drive activity-dependent synaptic plasticity without calcium influx. How this “nonionotropic” plasticity occurs in vitro is becoming clearer, but research on its involvement in behavior and cognition is in its infancy. There is a partial overlap in the downstream signaling molecules that are involved in ionotropic and nonionotropic NMDAR-dependent plasticity. Given this, and prior studies of the cognitive impacts of ionotropic NMDAR plasticity, a preliminary model explaining how NMDAR nonionotropic plasticity affects learning and memory can be established. We hypothesize that nonionotropic NMDAR plasticity takes part in latent memory encoding in immature rodents through nonassociative depression of synaptic efficacy, and possibly shrinking of dendritic spines. Further, the late postnatal alteration in NMDAR composition in the hippocampus appears to reduce nonionotropic signaling and remove a restriction on memory retrieval. This framework substantially alters the canonical model of NMDAR involvement in spatial cognition and hippocampal maturation and provides novel and exciting inroads for future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Interactions between the hippocampus and fronto‐parietal regions during memory encoding in early childhood</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding have received much attention in the literature. Research in adults and school-age children suggest that the hippocampus and cortical regions in both frontal and parietal areas are involved in successful formation of memories. Overall, the hippocampus has been shown to interact with fronto-parietal regions to collaboratively support successful memory encoding for both individual items as well as item details (such as the source or color in which the item was originally encountered). To date, only one study has investigated neural regions engaged during memory encoding in children younger than 8 years of age, which is unfortunate since early childhood is a period of dramatic improvement in memory. This previous study indicated that both the hippocampus and cortical regions are involved during the encoding of subsequently remembered item details (i.e., sources). However, this study reported few interactions between these regions, and it did not explore item memory at a more general level. To fill these gaps, this article reanalyzed data from the previous report, aiming to examine the neural correlates of item memory during encoding in early childhood (4–8 years) and interactions between the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions during encoding. Consistent with research in older individuals, both the hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions were found to participate in item memory encoding. Additionally, functional connectivity between hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions was significantly related to both subsequent item memory and subsequent source memory. Taken together, these findings suggest that not only the activation of individual brain regions (hippocampus and fronto-parietal regions) but also the functional connections between these regions are important for memory encoding. These data add to the growing literature providing insight into how the hippocampus and cortical regions interact to support memory during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Unfolding of spatial representation at systems level in infant rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spatial representations enable navigation from early life on. However, the brain regions essential to form spatial representations, like the hippocampus, are considered functionally immature before weaning. Here, we examined the formation of representations of space in rat pups on postnatal day (PD) 16, using a simple habituation paradigm where the pups were exposed to an arena on three occasions, separated by ~140 min. Whereas on the first two occasions the arena was the same, on the third “test” occasion either proximal cues (Prox group), or distal cues (Dist group), or proximal and distal cues (Prox-Dist group), or no cues (No-change group) were rearranged. Locomotion (distance traveled) was used as behavioral measure of habituation, and c-Fos expression to measure regional brain activity at test. Locomotion generally decreased across the first two occasions. At test, it reached a minimum in the No-change group, indicating familiarity with the spatial conditions. By contrast, the Prox-Dist group displayed a significant increase in locomotion which was less robust in the Prox group and absent in the Dist group, a pattern suggesting that the pups relied more on proximal than distal cues during spatial exploration. c-Fos activity in the No-change group was significantly suppressed in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus) but simultaneously enhanced in the prelimbic area (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex, compared with untreated Home-cage controls, pointing to a possible involvement of the PL in regulating locomotion in familiar spaces. By contrast, in both Prox-Dist and Prox groups c-Fos activity was enhanced in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, suggesting these regions might be particularly involved in regulating exploration of spatial novelty. Our findings show that functional representations of space at a systems level are formed already in pre-weanling rats.</p>

                Introduction: Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) is rare but a potentially lethal adverse event. The pathophysiologic mechanism is still unknown. Patient concerns: A 22-year-old man was admitted for the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome. On day six, he required mechanical ventilation due to progressive muscle weakness; propofol (3.5 mg/kg/hour) was administered for five days for sedation. On day 13, he had hypotension with abnormal electrocardiogram findings, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia and severe rhabdomyolysis. Diagnosis and interventions: The patient was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) on suspicion of PRIS. Administration of noradrenaline and renal replacement therapy and fasciotomy for compartment syndrome of lower legs due to PRIS-rhabdomyolysis were performed. Outcomes: The patient gradually recovered and was discharged from the ICU on day 30. On day 37, he had repeated sinus bradycardia with pericardial effusion in echocardiography. Cardiac 18F-FDG PET on day 67 demonstrated heterogeneous 18F-FDG uptake in the left ventricle. Electron microscopic investigation of endomyocardial biopsy on day 75 revealed mitochondrial myelinization of the cristae, which indicated mitochondrial damage of cardiomyocytes. He was discharged without cardiac abnormality on day 192. Conclusions: Mitochondrial damage in both morphological and functional aspects was observed in the present case. Sustained mitochondrial damage may be a therapeutic target beyond the initial therapy of discontinuing propofol administration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CRBPDL: Identification of circRNA-RBP interaction sites using an ensemble neural network approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mengting Niu, Quan Zou, Chen Lin</p>

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with a special circular structure produced formed by the reverse splicing mechanism. Increasing evidence shows that circular RNAs can directly bind to RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and play an important role in a variety of biological activities. The interactions between circRNAs and RBPs are key to comprehending the mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation. Accurately identifying binding sites is very useful for analyzing interactions. In past research, some predictors on the basis of machine learning (ML) have been presented, but prediction accuracy still needs to be ameliorated. Therefore, we present a novel calculation model, CRBPDL, which uses an Adaboost integrated deep hierarchical network to identify the binding sites of circular RNA-RBP. CRBPDL combines five different feature encoding schemes to encode the original RNA sequence, uses deep multiscale residual networks (MSRN) and bidirectional gating recurrent units (BiGRUs) to effectively learn high-level feature representations, it is sufficient to extract local and global context information at the same time. Additionally, a self-attention mechanism is employed to train the robustness of the CRBPDL. Ultimately, the Adaboost algorithm is applied to integrate deep learning (DL) model to improve prediction performance and reliability of the model. To verify the usefulness of CRBPDL, we compared the efficiency with state-of-the-art methods on 37 circular RNA data sets and 31 linear RNA data sets. Moreover, results display that CRBPDL is capable of performing universal, reliable, and robust. The code and data sets are obtainable at https://github.com/nmt315320/CRBPDL.git.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine-scale estimation of effective reproduction numbers for dengue surveillance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Janet Ong, Stacy Soh, Soon Hoe Ho, Annabel Seah, Borame Sue Dickens, Ken Wei Tan, Joel Ruihan Koo, Alex R. Cook, Daniel R. Richards, Leon Yan-Feng Gaw, Lee Ching Ng, Jue Tao Lim</p>

The effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> is an epidemiological quantity that provides an instantaneous measure of transmission potential of an infectious disease. While dengue is an increasingly important vector-borne disease, few have used <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> as a measure to inform public health operations and policy for dengue. This study demonstrates the utility of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> for real time dengue surveillance. Using nationally representative, geo-located dengue case data from Singapore over 2010–2020, we estimated <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> by modifying methods from Bayesian (EpiEstim) and filtering (EpiFilter) approaches, at both the national and local levels. We conducted model assessment of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> from each proposed method and determined exogenous temporal and spatial drivers for <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> in relation to a wide range of environmental and anthropogenic factors. At the national level, both methods achieved satisfactory model performance (R<sup>2</sup><sub>EpiEstim</sub> = 0.95, R<sup>2</sup><sub>EpiFilter</sub> = 0.97), but disparities in performance were large at finer spatial scales when case counts are low (MASE <sub>EpiEstim</sub> = 1.23, MASE<sub>EpiFilter</sub> = 0.59). Impervious surfaces and vegetation with structure dominated by human management (without tree canopy) were positively associated with increased transmission intensity. Vegetation with structure dominated by human management (with tree canopy), on the other hand, was associated with lower dengue transmission intensity. We showed that dengue outbreaks were preceded by sustained periods of high transmissibility, demonstrating the potential of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> as a dengue surveillance tool for detecting large rises in dengue cases. Real time estimation of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> at the fine scale can assist public health agencies in identifying high transmission risk areas and facilitating localised outbreak preparedness and response.

Over the last few decades, the nature of life sciences research has changed enormously, generating a need for a workforce with a variety of computational skills such as those required to store, manage, and analyse the large biological datasets produced by next-generation sequencing. Those with such expertise are increasingly in demand for employment in both research and industry. Despite this, bioinformatics education has failed to keep pace with advances in research. At secondary school level, computing is often taught in isolation from other sciences, and its importance in biological research is not fully realised, leaving pupils unprepared for the computational component of Higher Education and, subsequently, research in the life sciences. The 4273pi Bioinformatics at School project (https://4273pi.org) aims to address this issue by designing and delivering curriculum-linked, hands-on bioinformatics workshops for secondary school biology pupils, with an emphasis on equitable access. So far, we have reached over 180 schools across Scotland through visits or teacher events, and our open education resources are used internationally. Here, we describe our project, our aims and motivations, and the practical lessons we have learned from implementing a successful bioinformatics education project over the last 5 years.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Use of Raman and Raman optical activity to extract atomistic details of saccharides in aqueous solution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vladimír Palivec, Christian Johannessen, Jakub Kaminský, Hector Martinez-Seara</p>

Sugars are crucial components in biosystems and industrial applications. In aqueous environments, the natural state of short saccharides or charged glycosaminoglycans is floating and wiggling in solution. Therefore, tools to characterize their structure in a native aqueous environment are crucial but not always available. Here, we show that a combination of Raman/ROA and, on occasions, NMR experiments with Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) is a viable method to gain insights into structural features of sugars in solutions. Combining these methods provides information about accessible ring puckering conformers and their proportions. It also provides information about the conformation of the linkage between the sugar monomers, i.e., glycosidic bonds, allowing for identifying significantly accessible conformers and their relative abundance. For mixtures of sugar moieties, this method enables the deconvolution of the Raman/ROA spectra to find the actual amounts of its molecular constituents, serving as an effective analytical technique. For example, it allows calculating anomeric ratios for reducing sugars and analyzing more complex sugar mixtures to elucidate their real content. Altogether, we show that combining Raman/ROA spectroscopies with simulations is a versatile method applicable to saccharides. It allows for accessing many features with precision comparable to other methods routinely used for this task, making it a viable alternative. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed technique can scale up by studying the complicated Raffinose trisaccharide, and therefore, we expect its wide adoption to characterize sugar structural features in solution.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>ATP synthase (ATPase) is responsible for the majority of ATP production. Nevertheless, disease phenotypes associated with mutations in ATPase subunits are extremely rare. We aimed at expanding the spectrum of ATPase-related diseases.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing in cohorts with 2,962 patients diagnosed with mitochondrial disease and/or dystonia and international collaboration were used to identify deleterious variants in ATPase-encoding genes. Findings were complemented by transcriptional and proteomic profiling of patient fibroblasts. ATPase integrity and activity were assayed using cells and tissues from 5 patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We present 10 total individuals with biallelic or de novo monoallelic variants in nuclear ATPase subunit genes. Three unrelated patients showed the same homozygous missense <i>ATP5F1E</i> mutation (including one published case). An intronic splice-disrupting alteration in compound heterozygosity with a nonsense variant in <i>ATP5PO</i> was found in one patient. Three patients had de novo heterozygous missense variants in <i>ATP5F1A</i>, whereas another 3 were heterozygous for <i>ATP5MC3</i> de novo missense changes. Bioinformatics methods and populational data supported the variants’ pathogenicity. Immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and/or immunoblotting revealed significantly reduced ATPase amounts in association to <i>ATP5F1E</i> and <i>ATP5PO</i> mutations. Diminished activity and/or defective assembly of ATPase was demonstrated by enzymatic assays and/or immunoblotting in patient samples bearing <i>ATP5F1A</i>-p.Arg207His, <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Gly79Val, and <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Asn106Lys. The associated clinical profiles were heterogeneous, ranging from hypotonia with spontaneous resolution (1/10) to epilepsy with early death (1/10) or variable persistent abnormalities, including movement disorders, developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperlactatemia, and other neurologic and systemic features. Although potentially reflecting an ascertainment bias, dystonia was common (7/10).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results establish evidence for a previously unrecognized role of ATPase nuclear-gene defects in phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: For years now, cancer treatments have entailed tried-and-true methods. Yet, oncologists and clinicians recommend a series of surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Yet, even amidst these treatments, the number of deaths due to cancer increases at an alarming rate. The prognosis of cancer patients is influenced by mutations, age, and various cancer stages. However, the association between these variables is unclear. Methods: The present work adopts a machine learning technique—k-nearest neighbor; for both regression and classification tasks, regression for predicting the survival time of oral cancer patients, and classification for classifying the patients into one of the predefined oral cancer stages. Two cross-validation approaches—hold-out and k-fold methods—have been used to examine the prediction results.   Results: The experimental results show that the k-fold method performs better than the hold-out method, providing the least mean absolute error score of 0.015. Additionally, the model classifies patients into a valid group. Of the 429 records, 97 (out of 106), 99 (out of 119), 95 (out of 113), and 77 (out of 91) were classified to its correct label as stages – 1, 2, 3, and 4. The accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure for each classification group obtained are 0.84, 0.85, 0.85, and 0.84.   Conclusions: The study showed that aged patients with a higher number of mutations than young patients have a higher risk of short survival. Senior patients with a more significant number of mutations have an increased risk of getting into the last cancer stage

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What can we experience and report on a rapidly presented image? Intersubjective measures of specificity of freely reported contents of consciousness [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A majority of previous studies appear to support a view that human observers can only perceive coarse information from a natural scene image when it is presented rapidly (<100ms, masked). In these studies, participants were often forced to choose an answer from options that experimenters preselected. These options can underestimate what participants experience and can report on it. The current study aims to introduce a novel methodology to investigate how detailed information participants can report after briefly seeing a natural scene image.     Methods: We used a novel free-report paradigm to examine what people can freely report following a rapidly presented natural scene image (67/133/267ms, masked). N = 670 online participants typed up to five words to report what they saw in the image together with confidence of the respective responses. We developed a novel index, Intersubjective Agreement (IA). IA quantifies how specifically the response words were used to describe the target image, with a high value meaning the word is not often reported for other images. Importantly, IA eliminates the need for experimenters to preselect response options. Results: The words with high IA values are often something detailed (e.g., a small object) in a particular image. With IA, unlike commonly believed, we demonstrated that participants reported highly specific and detailed aspects of the briefly (even at 67ms, masked) shown image. Further, IA is positively correlated with confidence, indicating metacognitive conscious access to the reported aspects of the image. Conclusion: These new findings challenge the dominant view that the content of rapid scene experience is limited to global and coarse gist. Our novel paradigm opens a door to investigate various contents of consciousness with a free-report paradigm.

                Background: Chronic health conditions, secondary conditions, and decreasing functional ability related to aging and/or changes in underlying impairment may influence participation for persons aging with long-term physical disability (AwD). Objective: To examine sample integrity and baseline findings through exploration of associations of sociodemographic, health, and disability factors with social participation for persons AwD. Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort study following persons AwD over three years, reporting baseline cohort study data. A convenience sample of 474 persons AwD aged 45–65 reporting physical disability of ≥5 years’ duration was recruited through community organizations and social media. The cohort was majority female (66.7%) and single (62.0%), and over one-third (38.6%) was non-White. Pain, fatigue, depression, ability to participate in, and satisfaction with, social roles and activities were measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Results: Participants aged 55–60 and 61–65 had significantly lower rates of employment and marriage and higher rates of living alone than participants aged 45–54. Participants reported higher rates of fatigue, pain, and depression and lower ability to participate in, and satisfaction with, participation in, social roles and activities than the general population. Ability to participate and satisfaction with participation were highest among Black/African American participants. Conclusions: Participants reported higher rates of common AwD symptoms and lower ability to participate and satisfaction with participation than the general population, consistent with prior studies of AwD samples. This cohort reflects the AwD population and can be considered an AwD sample, comparable to those found in existing literature. The focus of future analyses will be to gain a greater understanding of chronic health conditions, incidence of falls, engagement in everyday life activities, and the impact of the environment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synthetic time series data generation for edge analytics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Internet of Things (IoT) edge analytics enables data computation and  storage to be available adjacent to the source of data generation at the IoT system. This method improves sensor data handling and speeds up analysis, prediction, and action. Using machine learning for analytics and task offloading in edge servers could minimise latency and energy usage. However, one of the key challenges in using machine learning in edge analytics is to find a real-world dataset to implement a more representative predictive model. This challenge has undeniably slowed down the adoption of machine learning methods in IoT edge analytics. Thus, the generation of realistic synthetic datasets can leverage the need to speed up methodological use of machine learning in edge analytics. Methods: We create synthetic data with features that are like data from IoT devices. We use an existing air quality dataset that includes temperature and gas sensor measurements. This real-time dataset includes component values for the Air Quality Index (AQI) and ppm concentrations for various polluting gases. We build a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) model to capture the distribution of variables and the structure of this real dataset to generate the synthetic data. Based on the synthetic dataset and original dataset, we create a comparative predictive model. Results: Analysis of synthetic dataset predictive model shows that it can be successfully used for edge analytics purposes, replacing real-world datasets. There is no significant difference between the real-world dataset compared the synthetic dataset. The generated synthetic data requires no modification to suit the edge computing requirements. Conclusions: The framework can generate representative synthetic datasets based on JSON schema attributes. The accuracy, precision, and recall values for the real and synthetic datasets indicate that the logistic regression model is capable of successfully classifying data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of substance abuse and its associated factors among medical students: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Substance abuse by medical students poses a significant risk not only on their personal life but also on their professional life by putting their patients at risk. Our study aims to find out the prevalence of substance abuse and factors associated with it among medical students. Methods: An online-questionnaire based, cross-sectional, analytical study was carried out at Gandaki Medical College, a medical school in Gandaki Province of Nepal. Whole sampling technique was used. SPSS-25.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for analyzing demographic and substance abuse related variables. Chi square and Fishers exact test was used to find out if any differences existed in substance abuse by demographic characteristics. Results: Among 420 eligible participants, 219 participated in the survey (response rate: 52.2%). Alcohol was the most commonly used substance with overall lifetime prevalence of 58% followed by cigarette smoking and illegal drug abuse at 21.9% and 13.7%, respectively. The abuse of substances was significantly higher (p<0.05) in males, who were offered substances by friends, and amongst study participants who worked with an intoxicated colleague. The most common reason for substance abuse was “For pleasure, curiosity or to go along with friends” (23%, n=18). Major and minor dysfunction due to alcohol abuse was reported by 8(3.7%) and 33(15.1%) participants, while the same dysfunctions due to drug abuse were reported by 1(0.5%) and 14(6.4%) participants, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of substance abuse was high among medical students and was found to be associated with male gender, if offer of substances were made by friends, and amongst those who worked with an intoxicated colleague. This problem of substance abuse among medical students should be addressed timely as failing to do so might have serious consequences on the healthcare system of the country.

                Background: This study aimed to propose an experiential approach for understanding color vision variation using virtual reality technology. Methods: The study design was adapted from the phase 1 clinical trial for medical apps. A virtual classroom was developed in a three-dimensional space, and ten healthy university students were tested to understand color vision variations. Results: No participant interrupted the experience due to VR sickness. Most participants noted that the virtual classroom was an excellent educational tool, which could help teachers understand the problems associated with [visual analog scale (VAS): mean ± standard deviation (SD), 9.6 ± 0.6] and obtain a better understanding of (VAS: mean ± SD, 9.0 ± 1.0) color vision deficiencies. Conclusions: A pilot study was conducted on the impact of immersive virtual classroom experiences as an educational tool for color barrier-free presentations. This approach may help the participants to respond appropriately to children who suffer from this disorder. It is necessary to evaluate the impact of this approach on new teachers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Disease burden and adverse pregnancy outcomes due to cardiovascular conditions complicating pregnancy in Sri Lanka: a protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the commonest indirect medical cause of maternal deaths worldwide, both in high-income and low and middle-income countries. To minimize the effects of CVD in pregnancy, proper risk assessment and appropriate referral is required. In Sri Lanka, cardiovascular disease complicating pregnancy is a significant cause of maternal mortality, second only to postpartum hemorrhage. Screening for CVD in pregnancy in Sri Lanka is limited to a routine clinical assessment. Evidence-based guidelines are yet to be developed, and this deficit may have resulted in a substantial underestimation of the CVD burden. This study aims to determine the burden of CVD in early pregnancy and develop a risk prediction model to be used in field pregnancy clinics in Sri Lanka to reduce CVD effects in pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out in the Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Following registration to the antenatal care, pregnant women fulfilling the eligibility criteria were invited to attend a special clinic at their relevant Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area. Risk assessment was done through history and a clinical examination, and suspected/probable cases were referred for an echocardiogram by a consultant cardiologist. All the recruited participants in the first trimester were prospectively followed up and screened again between 24–28 weeks of the period of amenorrhoea (POA). Antenatal ward admissions with CVD complicating pregnancy will be extracted, and a telephone interview will be carried out between 6–12 weeks after the expected delivery date to cover postpartum morbidities.  Discussion This proposed study will be the largest of its kind carried out in the local setting. The study's findings will be beneficial for policymakers to develop guidelines to reduce maternal cardiovascular disease morbidities and mortalities in Sri Lanka.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Narcolepsy in Parkinson's disease with insulin resistance [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by its progression of motor-related symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking and balance. Comorbid conditions in PD individuals include insulin resistance (IR) and narcolepsy-like sleep patterns. The intersecting sleep symptoms of both conditions include excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, insomnia, and falling into REM sleep more quickly than an average person. Understanding of the biological basis and relationship of these comorbid disorders with PD may help with early detection and intervention strategies to improve quality of life. Methods: In this study, an integrative genomics and systems biology approach was used to analyze gene expression patterns associated with PD, IR, and narcolepsy in order to identify genes and pathways that may shed light on how these disorders are interrelated. A correlation analysis with known genes associated with these disorders (LRRK2, HLA-DQB1, and HCRT) was used to query microarray data corresponding to brain regions known to be involved in PD and narcolepsy. This includes the hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, pons, and subcoeruleus nucleus. Risk factor genes for PD, IR, and narcolepsy were also incorporated into the analysis. Results: The PD and narcolepsy signaling networks are connected through insulin and immune system pathways. Important genes and pathways that link PD, narcolepsy, and IR are CACNA1C, CAMK1D, BHLHE41, HMGB1, and AGE-RAGE. Conclusions: We have identified the genetic signatures that link PD with its comorbid disorders, narcolepsy and insulin resistance, from the convergence and intersection of dopaminergic, insulin, and immune system related signaling pathways. These findings may aid in the design of early intervention strategies and treatment regimes for non-motor symptoms in PD patients as well as individuals with diabetes and narcolepsy.

                Background: Plant products, including seeds are an important source of vitamins, minerals, proteins, and energy. This study aimed to assess parasitic contaminations in roasted groundnuts, nabag, and tasali (watermelon seeds) sold by street vendors in Khartoum State, Sudan. Methods: The frequency of parasitic contaminations among all crop products was detected by washing the plants with saline, and then conducting an examination using a formal ether concentration technique (FECT), followed by a saturated sugar floatation technique. Results: The detected parasites belonged to two species: Entamoeba histolytica (33.3%) and Giardia lamblia (15.6%). No helminthic parasites were detected. Mixed contamination of the mentioned parasites was also observed (11.1%). The most contaminated crop was nabag, followed by groundnut, and finally tasali. Conclusion: No relation was established between the positivity of samples for parasites and crop type, Khartoum State city, or  seller sex. FECT was more sensitive than the saturated sugar floatation technique as a detection method.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Randomized clinical trials have shown that aerobic exercise attenuates motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated how aerobic exercise influences disease-related functional and structural changes in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network, which is involved in the emergence of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we explored effects of aerobic exercise on tissue integrity of the substantia nigra, and on behavioral and cerebral indices of cognitive control.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Park-in-Shape trial is a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial in 130 Parkinson's disease patients who were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to aerobic exercise (stationary home trainer) or stretching (active control) interventions (duration = 6 months). An unselected subset from this trial (exercise, n = 25; stretching, n = 31) underwent resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an oculomotor cognitive control task (pro- and antisaccades), at baseline and at 6-month follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Aerobic exercise, but not stretching, led to increased functional connectivity of the anterior putamen with the sensorimotor cortex relative to the posterior putamen. Behaviorally, aerobic exercise also improved cognitive control. Furthermore, aerobic exercise increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, proportionally to fitness improvements, and it reduced global brain atrophy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MRI, clinical, and behavioral results converge toward the conclusion that aerobic exercise stabilizes disease progression in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network and enhances cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic sleep disorder correlated with loss of hypocretin(orexin). In NT1 post-mortem brains, we observed 88% reduction in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and significantly less CRH-positive fibers in the median eminence, whereas CRH-neurons in the locus coeruleus and thalamus, and other PVN neuronal populations were spared: that is, vasopressin, oxytocin, tyrosine hydroxylase, and thyrotropin releasing hormone-expressing neurons. Other hypothalamic cell groups, that is, the suprachiasmatic, ventrolateral preoptic, infundibular, and supraoptic nuclei and nucleus basalis of Meynert, were unaffected. The surprising selective decrease in CRH-neurons provide novel targets for diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Judgments of agency are affected by sensory noise without recruiting metacognitive processing</a></h4>

              
                Acting in the world is accompanied by a sense of agency, or experience of control over our actions and their outcomes. As humans, we can report on this experience through judgments of agency. These judgments often occur under noisy conditions. We examined the computations underlying judgments of agency, in particular under the influence of sensory noise. Building on previous literature, we studied whether judgments of agency incorporate uncertainty in the same way that confidence judgments do, which would imply that the former share computational mechanisms with metacognitive judgments. In two tasks, participants rated agency, or confidence in a decision about their agency, over a virtual hand that tracked their movements, either synchronously or with a delay and either under high or low noise. We compared the predictions of two computational models to participants' ratings and found that agency ratings, unlike confidence, were best explained by a model involving no estimates of sensory noise. We propose that agency judgments reflect first-order measures of the internal signal, without involving metacognitive computations, challenging the assumed link between the two cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The imprinted Zdbf2 gene finely tunes control of feeding and growth in neonates</a></h4>

              
                Genomic imprinting refers to the mono-allelic and parent-specific expression of a subset of genes. While long recognized for their role in embryonic development, imprinted genes have recently emerged as important modulators of postnatal physiology, notably through hypothalamus-driven functions. Here, using mouse models of loss, gain and parental inversion of expression, we report that the paternally expressed <i>Zdbf2</i> gene controls neonatal growth in mice, in a dose-sensitive but parent-of-origin-independent manner. We further found that <i>Zdbf2</i>-KO neonates failed to fully activate hypothalamic circuits that stimulate appetite, and suffered milk deprivation and diminished circulating Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1). Consequently, only half of <i>Zdbf2</i>-KO pups survived the first days after birth and those surviving were smaller. This study demonstrates that precise imprinted gene dosage is essential for vital physiological functions at the transition from intra- to extra-uterine life, here the adaptation to oral feeding and optimized body weight gain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Absolute quantitation of individual SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules provides a new paradigm for infection dynamics and variant differences</a></h4>

              
                Despite an unprecedented global research effort on SARS-CoV-2, early replication events remain poorly understood. Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with increased transmission, there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral replication and transcription. We used single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95% detection efficiency, while simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes, subgenomic RNAs, and viral proteins. Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases. Moreover, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between cells, with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly, the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to its higher transmissibility with important clinical implications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human interictal epileptiform discharges are bidirectional traveling waves echoing ictal discharges</a></h4>

              
                Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), also known as interictal spikes, are large intermittent electrophysiological events observed between seizures in patients with epilepsy. Though they occur far more often than seizures, IEDs are less studied, and their relationship to seizures remains unclear. To better understand this relationship, we examined multi-day recordings of microelectrode arrays implanted in human epilepsy patients, allowing us to precisely observe the spatiotemporal propagation of IEDs, spontaneous seizures, and how they relate. These recordings showed that the majority of IEDs are traveling waves, traversing the same path as ictal discharges during seizures, and with a fixed direction relative to seizure propagation. Moreover, the majority of IEDs, like ictal discharges, were bidirectional, with one predominant and a second, less frequent antipodal direction. These results reveal a fundamental spatiotemporal similarity between IEDs and ictal discharges. These results also imply that most IEDs arise in brain tissue outside the site of seizure onset and propagate toward it, indicating that the propagation of IEDs provides useful information for localizing the seizure focus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SNX9-induced membrane tubulation regulates CD28 cluster stability and signalling</a></h4>

              
                T cell activation requires engagement of a cognate antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) and the co-stimulatory signal of CD28. Both TCR and CD28 aggregate into clusters at the plasma membrane of activated T cells. While the role of TCR clustering in T cell activation has been extensively investigated, little is known about how CD28 clustering contributes to CD28 signalling. Here, we report that upon CD28 triggering, the BAR-domain protein sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is recruited to CD28 clusters at the immunological synapse. Using three-dimensional correlative light and electron microscopy, we show that SNX9 generates membrane tubulation out of CD28 clusters. Our data further reveal that CD28 clusters are in fact dynamic structures and that SNX9 regulates their stability as well as CD28 phosphorylation and the resulting production of the cytokine IL-2. In summary, our work suggests a model in which SNX9-mediated tubulation generates a membrane environment that promotes CD28 triggering and downstream signalling events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic analysis of naturally occurring insertions and deletions that alter transcription factor spacing identifies tolerant and sensitive transcription factor pairs</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of gene expression requires the combinatorial binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) at promoters and enhancers. Prior studies showed that alterations in the spacing between TF binding sites can influence promoter and enhancer activity. However, the relative importance of TF spacing alterations resulting from naturally occurring insertions and deletions (InDels) has not been systematically analyzed. To address this question, we first characterized the genome-wide spacing relationships of 73 TFs in human K562 cells as determined by ChIP-seq. We found a dominant pattern of a relaxed range of spacing between collaborative factors, including 45 TFs exclusively exhibiting relaxed spacing with their binding partners. Next, we exploited millions of InDels provided by genetically diverse mouse strains and human individuals to investigate the effects of altered spacing on TF binding and local histone acetylation. These analyses suggested that spacing alterations resulting from naturally occurring InDels are generally tolerated in comparison to genetic variants directly affecting TF binding sites. To experimentally validate this prediction, we introduced synthetic spacing alterations between PU.1 and C/EBPβ binding sites at six endogenous genomic loci in a macrophage cell line. Remarkably, collaborative binding of PU.1 and C/EBPβ at these locations tolerated changes in spacing ranging from 5-bp increase to &gt;30-bp decrease. Collectively, these findings have implications for understanding mechanisms underlying enhancer selection and for the interpretation of non-coding genetic variation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An open-source tool for automated analysis of breathing behaviors in common marmosets and rodents</a></h4>

              
                The respiratory system maintains homeostatic levels of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the body through rapid and efficient regulation of breathing frequency and depth (tidal volume). The commonly used methods of analysing breathing data in behaving experimental animals are usually subjective, laborious, and time-consuming. To overcome these hurdles, we optimized an analysis toolkit for the unsupervised study of respiratory activities in animal subjects. Using this tool, we analyzed breathing behaviors of the common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), a New World non-human primate model. Using Whole-body Plethysmography in room air as well as acute hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypercapnic (6% CO<sub>2</sub>) conditions, we describe breathing behaviors in awake, freely behaving marmosets. Our data indicate that marmosets' exposure to acute hypoxia decreased metabolic rate and increased sigh rate. However, the hypoxic condition did not augment ventilation. Hypercapnia, on the other hand, increased both the frequency and depth (i.e., tidal volume) of breathing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global organization of neuronal activity only requires unstructured local connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Modern electrophysiological recordings simultaneously capture single-unit spiking activities of hundreds of neurons spread across large cortical distances. Yet, this parallel activity is often confined to relatively low-dimensional manifolds. This implies strong coordination also among neurons that are most likely not even connected. Here, we combine in vivo recordings with network models and theory to characterize the nature of mesoscopic coordination patterns in macaque motor cortex and to expose their origin: We find that heterogeneity in local connectivity supports network states with complex long-range cooperation between neurons that arises from multi-synaptic, short-range connections. Our theory explains the experimentally observed spatial organization of covariances in resting state recordings as well as the behaviorally related modulation of covariance patterns during a reach-to-grasp task. The ubiquity of heterogeneity in local cortical circuits suggests that the brain uses the described mechanism to flexibly adapt neuronal coordination to momentary demands.

                Integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) are integrin-based plasma membrane-associated compartments where cells sense environmental cues. The physical mechanisms and molecular interactions that mediate initial IAC formation are unclear. We found that both p130Cas ('Cas') and Focal adhesion kinase ('FAK') undergo liquid-liquid phase separation <i>in vitro</i> under physiologic conditions. Cas- and FAK- driven phase separation is sufficient to reconstitute kindlin-dependent integrin clustering <i>in vitro </i>with recombinant mammalian proteins. <i>In vitro</i> condensates and IACs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit similar sensitivities to environmental perturbations including changes in temperature and pH. Furthermore, mutations that inhibit or enhance phase separation <i>in vitro</i> reduce or increase the number of IACs in MEFs, respectively. Finally, we find that the Cas and FAK pathways act synergistically to promote phase separation, integrin clustering, IAC formation and partitioning of key components <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. We propose that Cas- and FAK- driven phase separation provides an intracellular trigger for integrin clustering and nascent IAC formation.

                Gene regulatory networks coordinate the formation of organs and structures that compose the evolving body plans of different organisms. We are using a simple chordate model, the <i>Ciona</i> embryo, to investigate the essential gene regulatory network that orchestrates morphogenesis of the notochord, a structure necessary for the proper development of all chordate embryos. Although numerous transcription factors expressed in the notochord have been identified in different chordates, several of them remain to be positioned within a regulatory framework. Here we focus on Xbp1, a transcription factor expressed during notochord formation in <i>Ciona</i> and other chordates. Through the identification of Xbp1-downstream notochord genes in <i>Ciona</i>, we found evidence of the early co-option of genes involved in the unfolded protein response to the notochord developmental program. We report the regulatory interplay between Xbp1 and Brachyury, and by extending these results to <i>Xenopus</i>, we show that Brachyury and Xbp1 form a cross-regulatory subcircuit of the notochord gene regulatory network that has been consolidated during chordate evolution.

                The ring-like ATPase complexes in the AAA+ family perform diverse cellular functions that require coordination between the conformational transitions of their individual ATPase subunits<sup>1,2</sup>. How the energy from ATP hydrolysis is captured to perform mechanical work by these coordinated movements is unknown. In this study, we developed a novel approach for delineating the nucleotide-dependent free-energy landscape (FEL) of the proteasome's heterohexameric ATPase complex based on complementary structural and kinetic measurements. We used the FEL to simulate the dynamics of the proteasome and quantitatively evaluated the predicted structural and kinetic properties. The FEL model predictions are consistent with a wide range of experimental observations in this and previous studies and suggested novel mechanistic features of the proteasomal ATPases. We find that the cooperative movements of the ATPase subunits result from the design of the ATPase hexamer entailing a unique free-energy minimum for each nucleotide-binding status. ATP hydrolysis dictates the direction of substrate translocation by triggering an energy-dissipating conformational transition of the ATPase complex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automated annotation of birdsong with a neural network that segments spectrograms</a></h4>

              
                Songbirds provide a powerful model system for studying sensory-motor learning. However, many analyses of birdsong require time-consuming, manual annotation of its elements, called syllables. Automated methods for annotation have been proposed, but these methods assume that audio can be cleanly segmented into syllables, or they require carefully tuning multiple statistical models. Here we present TweetyNet: a single neural network model that learns how to segment spectrograms of birdsong into annotated syllables. We show that TweetyNet mitigates limitations of methods that rely on segmented audio. We also show that TweetyNet performs well across multiple individuals from two species of songbirds, Bengalese finches and canaries. Lastly, we demonstrate that using TweetyNet we can accurately annotate very large datasets containing multiple days of song, and that these predicted annotations replicate key findings from behavioral studies. In addition, we provide open-source software to assist other researchers, and a large dataset of annotated canary song that can serve as a benchmark. We conclude that TweetyNet makes it possible to address a wide range of new questions about birdsong.
