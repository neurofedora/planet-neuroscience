	<p>Mindfulness training (MT) reduces self-referential processing and promotes interoception, the perception of sensations from inside the body, by increasing one’s awareness of and regulating responses to them. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the insular cortex (INS) are considered hubs for self-referential processing and interoception, respectively. Although MT has been consistently found to decrease PCC, little is known about how MT relates to INS activity. Understanding links between mindfulness and interoception may be particularly important for informing mental health in adolescence, when neuroplasticity and emergence of psychopathology are heightened. We examined INS activity during real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback-augmented mindfulness training (NAMT) targeting the PCC. Healthy adolescents (N = 37; 16 female) completed the NAMT task, including Focus-on-Breath (MT), Describe (self-referential processing), and Rest conditions, across three neurofeedback runs and two non-neurofeedback runs (Observe, Transfer). Regression coefficients estimated from the generalized linear model were extracted from three INS subregions: anterior (aINS), mid (mINS), and posterior (pINS). Mixed model analyses revealed the main effect of run for Focus-on-Breath vs. Describe contrast in aINS [R2 = 0.39] and pINS [R2 = 0.33], but not mINS [R2 = 0.34]. Post hoc analyses revealed greater aINS activity and reduced pINS activity during neurofeedback runs, and such activities were related to lower self-reported life satisfaction and less pain behavior, respectively. These findings revealed the specific involvement of insula subregions in rtfMRI-nf MT.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cognitive flexibility, attributed to frontal cortex, is vital for navigating the complexities of everyday life. The mediodorsal thalamus (MD), interconnected to frontal cortex, may influence cognitive flexibility. Here, male rats performed an attentional set-shifting task measuring intradimensional (ID) and extradimensional (ED) shifts in sensory discriminations. MD lesion rats needed more trials to learn the rewarded sensory dimension. However, once the choice response strategy was established, learning further two-choice discriminations in the same sensory dimension, and reversals of the reward contingencies in the same dimension, were unimpaired. Critically though, MD lesion rats were impaired during the ED shift, when they must rapidly update the optimal choice response strategy. Behavioral analyses showed MD lesion rats had significantly reduced correct within-trial second choice responses. This evidence shows that transfer of information via the MD is critical when rapid within-trial updates in established choice response strategies are required after a rule change.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Heterozygous Dcc Mutant Mice Have a Subtle Locomotor Phenotype</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Axon guidance receptors such as deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) contribute to the normal formation of neural circuits, and their mutations can be associated with neural defects. In humans, heterozygous mutations in <I>DCC</I> have been linked to congenital mirror movements, which are involuntary movements on one side of the body that mirror voluntary movements of the opposite side. In mice, obvious hopping phenotypes have been reported for bi-allelic <I>Dcc</I> mutations, while heterozygous mutants have not been closely examined. We hypothesized that a detailed characterization of <I>Dcc</I> heterozygous mice may reveal impaired corticospinal and spinal functions. Anterograde tracing of the <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> motor cortex revealed a normally projecting corticospinal tract, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) evoked normal contralateral motor responses, and behavioral tests showed normal skilled forelimb coordination. Gait analyses also showed a normal locomotor pattern and rhythm in adult <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice during treadmill locomotion, except for a decreased occurrence of out-of-phase walk and an increased duty cycle of the stance phase at slow walking speed. Neonatal isolated <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> spinal cords had normal left-right and flexor-extensor coupling, along with normal locomotor pattern and rhythm, except for an increase in the flexor-related motoneuronal output. Although <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice do not exhibit any obvious bilateral impairments like those in humans, they exhibit subtle motor deficits during neonatal and adult locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial Binding Impairments in Visual Working Memory following Temporal Lobectomy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Disorders of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) adversely affect visual working memory (vWM) performance, including feature binding. It is unclear whether these impairments generalize across visual dimensions or are specifically spatial. To address this issue, we compared performance in two tasks of 13 epilepsy patients, who had undergone a temporal lobectomy, and 15 healthy controls. In the vWM task, participants recalled the color of one of two polygons, previously displayed side by side. At recall, a location or shape probe identified the target. In the perceptual task, participants estimated the centroid of three visible disks. Patients recalled the target color less accurately than healthy controls because they frequently swapped the nontarget with the target color. Moreover, healthy controls and right temporal lobectomy patients made more swap errors following shape than space probes. Left temporal lobectomy patients, showed the opposite pattern of errors instead. Patients and controls performed similarly in the perceptual task. We conclude that left MTL damage impairs spatial binding in vWM, and that this impairment does not reflect a perceptual or attentional deficit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence for yeast artificial synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 genomic sequences [version 4; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from SARS-CoV-1 are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for host cell invasion, virus replication, and host immune response. For SARS-CoV-1, we identify two sites: one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain; for SARS-CoV-2, one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other toward the end of the spike gene past its domain junction. At this junction, we detect a highly specific stretch of yeast DNA origin covering the critical furin cleavage site insert PRRA, which has not been seen in other lineage b betacoronaviruses. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a passage model for viral constructs in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that among SARS-like coronaviruses only the genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain information that points to a synthetic passage in genetically modified yeast cells. Our data specifically allow the identification of the yeast S. cerevisiae as a potential recombination donor for the critical furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ameliorative effect of gel combination of Centella asiatica extract transfersomes and rosemary essential oil nanoemulsion against UVB-induced skin aging in Balb/c mice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation induces physiological and morphological photoaging of the skin resulting in wrinkles, and loss of elasticity. This study analyzed nanoencapsulation of a gel combination of Centella asiatica (CA) transfersomes and rosemary essential oil (REO) nanoemulsion with lipid-based nanocarriers for the ability of both biological compounds to synergistically prevent UVB radiation, along with ameliorative and anti-aging effects. Methods: To ensure the quality, lipid-based nanocarriers of transfersomes and nanoemulsion were characterized based on physicochemical properties such as particle size distribution, polydispersity index, zeta potential. In vivo studies were used to determine the biological effects of a gel combination of CA transfersomes, and REO nanoemulsion applied topically two weeks before UVB radiation (840 mJ/cm2) in BALB/c hairless mice. Results: Results showed that the optimum lipid-based nanocarriers had a particle size of 43.97 ± 5.6 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.64 ± 0.01, and a zeta potential of -10.91 ± 1.99 mV. In vivo experiments revealed that topical application of a gel combination of CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion significantly ameliorated wrinkle formation, epidermal hyperplasia, and collagen fiber arrangement caused by UVB exposure. Further, the gel combining CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion suppressed lipid peroxidation by decreasing the expression of malondialdehyde (MDA) and collagen destruction by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression. Moreover, the gel combination of CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion upregulated type I collagen through activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad pathway, thereby recovering the density of collagen fiber reduced by UVB radiation. Conclusions: Overall, these data indicate that topical application of a gel combination of CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion could act synergistically and potentially prevents oxidative stress and collagen degradation in the skin from UVB-induced photoaging.

                Background: Shoulder biomechanics cannot be measured directly in living persons. While different glenohumeral joint simulators have been developed to investigate the role of the glenohumeral muscles in shoulder biomechanics, a standard for these simulators has not been defined. With this scoping review we want to describe available ex-vivo experimental strategies for assessing unconstrained shoulder biomechanics. Objective: The scoping review aims at identifying methodological and/or experimental studies describing or involving ex-vivo simulators that assess unconstrained shoulder biomechanics and synthesizing their strengths and limitations. Inclusion criteria: All unconstrained glenohumeral joint simulators published in connection with ex-vivo or mechanical simulation experiments will be included. Studies on glenohumeral simulators with active components to mimic the muscles will be included. We will exclude studies where the experiment is static or the motion is induced through an external guide, e.g., a robotic device. Methods: We will perform database searching in PubMed, Embase via Elsevier and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently assess full texts of selected abstracts. Direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles will be conducted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Influenza Altmetric Attention Score and its association with the influenza season in the USA [version 3; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Altmetrics measure the impact of journal articles by tracking social media, Wikipedia, public policy documents, blogs, and mainstream news activity, after which an overall Altmetric attention score (AAS) is calculated for every journal article. In this study, we aim to assess the AAS for influenza related articles and its relation to the influenza season in the USA. Methods: This study used the openly available Altmetric data from Altmetric.com. First, we retrieved all influenza-related articles using an advanced PubMed search query, then we inputted the resulted query into Altmetric explorer. We then calculated the average AAS for each month during the years 2012-2018. Results: A total of 24,964 PubMed documents were extracted, among them, 12,395 documents had at least one attention. We found a significant difference in mean AAS between February and each of January and March (p< 0.001, mean difference of 117.4 and 460.7, respectively). We found a significant difference between June and each of May and July (p< 0.001, mean difference of 1221.4 and 162.7, respectively). We also found a significant difference between October and each of September and November (p< 0.001, mean difference of 88.8 and 154.8, respectively). Conclusion: We observed a seasonal trend in the attention toward influenza-related research, with three annual peaks that correlated with the beginning, peak, and end of influenza seasons in the USA, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of AYUSH interventions on COVID-19: a protocol for a living systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a great burden on governments and the medical fraternity globally. Many clinical studies from the Indian system of Traditional Medicines [Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)] have been carried out to find appropriate solutions. Through a living systematic review and meta-analysis, this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Traditional System of Indian Medicine (AYUSH system) in lowering the incidence, duration, and severity of COVID-19. Methods: We will search the following databases: Pubmed; the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL); the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI); Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA); AYUSH research portal; Google scholar and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. Clinical improvement, WHO ordinal scale, viral clearance, incidences of COVID-19 infection, and mortality will be considered as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will be use of O2 therapy or mechanical ventilator, admission to high dependency unit or emergency unit, duration of hospitalization, the time to symptom resolution, and adverse events. Data will be synthesized, with RevMan 5.4 tool and the risk of bias will be assessed with RoB 2 (for RCTs) and ROBINS I (for NRSIs). Certainty of evidence will be assessed through the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) tool. The review will be updated bi-monthly with two updates. Conclusion: This living systematic review will be the first to address AYUSH interventions in COVID-19, synthesizing the full spectrum of Indian Traditional System of Medicine against COVID-19. It will facilitate professionals, guideline developers, and authorities with up to date synthesis on interventions periodically to make health-care decisions on AYUSH therapies in the management of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The improvement of inflammatory markers and disease progression among moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients: a cross-sectional study from two second referral hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To date, coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has no definitive treatment. Thrombosis and hypercoagulation may occur in the advanced stage. Further study on how to use anticoagulants is still required to promote the best prognosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 110 moderate, 140 severe, and 81 critical patients receiving unfractioned heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux was conducted. Data were collected from March 15th to August 31st 2020 at Universitas Airlangga and Husada Utama Hospital. A comparative study of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, all-cause mortality rate, length of stay, and days of death among three severities of COVID-19 was done. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine the correlation between inflammatory state after anti-coagulant with patients’ mortality. Results: Two deaths occurred in moderate cases, 36 deaths in severe cases, and 70 deaths in critical cases on ventilators. On day 13, moderate and severe groups showed decreased WBC, neutrophils, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p < 0.05). NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p<0.05) in critically ill and ventilated patients decreased. Day-13 evaluation revealed 32.73% decrease of inflammatory markers in moderate group; 32.86% in severe patients; and 16.05% in critically ill, ventilated patients. A significant correlation between day 13 inflammatory status with mortality was seen in moderate and critical cases with a ventilator (r=0.337; p< 0.05 and r=0.25; p 0.05). Inflammatory profile on day 6 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; p < 0.05) and day 13 ([aOR] = 4.15; p < 0.05) was associated with patients’ mortality. Conclusions: Anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients lower inflammation markers. Evaluating inflammatory status is essential to predict the mortality. Inflammatory markers on day 13, based on the severity of COVID-19 and comorbidities, were associated with mortality in moderate and critical cases.

                Background: The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and additional single-cell omics technologies have provided scientists with unprecedented tools to explore biology at cellular resolution. However, reaching an appropriate number of good quality reads per cell and reasonable numbers of cells within each of the populations of interest are key to infer relevant conclusions about the underlying biology of the dataset. For these reasons, scRNAseq studies are constantly increasing the number of cells analysed and the granularity of the resultant transcriptomics analyses. Methods: We aimed to identify previously described fibroblast subpopulations in healthy adult human skin by using the largest dataset published to date (528,253 sequenced cells) and an unsupervised population-matching algorithm. Results: Our reanalysis of this landmark resource demonstrates that a substantial proportion of cell transcriptomic signatures may be biased by cellular stress and response to hypoxic conditions. Conclusions: We postulate that careful design of experimental conditions is needed to avoid long processing times of biological samples. Additionally, computation of large datasets might undermine the extent of the analysis, possibly due to long processing times.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comprehensive mouse microbiota genome catalog reveals major difference to its human counterpart</a></h4>

Mouse is the most used model for studying the impact of microbiota on its host, but the repertoire of species from the mouse gut microbiome remains largely unknown. Accordingly, the similarity between human and mouse microbiomes at a low taxonomic level is not clear. We construct a comprehensive mouse microbiota genome (CMMG) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published reference and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 41’798 genomes cluster into 1’573 species, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, seven new families, and one new order. CMMG enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 86%, increases the mapping rate over four-fold, and allows functional microbiota analyses of human and mouse linking them to the driver species. Comparing CMMG to microbiota from the unified human gastrointestinal genomes shows an overlap of 62% at the genus but only 10% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct. CMMG contains the most comprehensive collection of consistently functionally annotated species of the mouse and human microbiome to date, setting the ground for the analysis of new and reanalysis of existing datasets at an unprecedented depth.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A bio-mimetic miniature drone for real-time audio based short-range tracking</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roei Zigelman, Ofri Eitan, Omer Mazar, Anthony Weiss, Yossi Yovel</p>

One of the most difficult sensorimotor behaviors exhibited by flying animals is the ability to track another flying animal based on its sound emissions. From insects to mammals, animals display this ability in order to localize and track conspecifics, mate or prey. The pursuing individual must overcome multiple non-trivial challenges including the detection of the sounds emitted by the target, matching the input received by its (mostly) two sensors, localizing the direction of the sound target in real time and then pursuing it. All this has to be done rapidly as the target is constantly moving. In this project, we set to mimic this ability using a physical bio-mimetic autonomous drone. We equipped a miniature commercial drone with our in-house 2D sound localization electronic circuit which uses two microphones (mimicking biological ears) to localize sound signals in real-time and steer the drone in the horizontal plane accordingly. We focus on bat signals because bats are known to eavesdrop on conspecifics and follow them, but our approach could be generalized to other biological signals and other man-made signals. Using two different experiments, we show that our fully autonomous aviator can track the position of a moving sound emitting target and pursue it in real-time. Building an actual robotic-agent, forced us to deal with real-life difficulties which also challenge animals. We thus discuss the similarities and differences between our and the biological approach.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simple model for encoding natural images by retinal ganglion cells with nonlinear spatial integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jian K. Liu, Dimokratis Karamanlis, Tim Gollisch</p>

A central goal in sensory neuroscience is to understand the neuronal signal processing involved in the encoding of natural stimuli. A critical step towards this goal is the development of successful computational encoding models. For ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina, the development of satisfactory models for responses to natural visual scenes is an ongoing challenge. Standard models typically apply linear integration of visual stimuli over space, yet many ganglion cells are known to show nonlinear spatial integration, in particular when stimulated with contrast-reversing gratings. We here study the influence of spatial nonlinearities in the encoding of natural images by ganglion cells, using multielectrode-array recordings from isolated salamander and mouse retinas. We assess how responses to natural images depend on first- and second-order statistics of spatial patterns inside the receptive field. This leads us to a simple extension of current standard ganglion cell models. We show that taking not only the weighted average of light intensity inside the receptive field into account but also its variance over space can partly account for nonlinear integration and substantially improve response predictions of responses to novel images. For salamander ganglion cells, we find that response predictions for cell classes with large receptive fields profit most from including spatial contrast information. Finally, we demonstrate how this model framework can be used to assess the spatial scale of nonlinear integration. Our results underscore that nonlinear spatial stimulus integration translates to stimulation with natural images. Furthermore, the introduced model framework provides a simple, yet powerful extension of standard models and may serve as a benchmark for the development of more detailed models of the nonlinear structure of receptive fields.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Task-induced neural covariability as a signature of approximate Bayesian learning and inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard D. Lange, Ralf M. Haefner</p>

Perception is often characterized computationally as an inference process in which uncertain or ambiguous sensory inputs are combined with prior expectations. Although behavioral studies have shown that observers can change their prior expectations in the context of a task, robust neural signatures of task-specific priors have been elusive. Here, we analytically derive such signatures under the general assumption that the responses of sensory neurons encode posterior beliefs that combine sensory inputs with task-specific expectations. Specifically, we derive predictions for the task-dependence of correlated neural variability and decision-related signals in sensory neurons. The qualitative aspects of our results are parameter-free and specific to the statistics of each task. The predictions for correlated variability also differ from predictions of classic feedforward models of sensory processing and are therefore a strong test of theories of hierarchical Bayesian inference in the brain. Importantly, we find that Bayesian learning predicts an increase in so-called “differential correlations” as the observer’s internal model learns the stimulus distribution, and the observer’s behavioral performance improves. This stands in contrast to classic feedforward encoding/decoding models of sensory processing, since such correlations are fundamentally information-limiting. We find support for our predictions in data from existing neurophysiological studies across a variety of tasks and brain areas. Finally, we show in simulation how measurements of sensory neural responses can reveal information about a subject’s internal beliefs about the task. Taken together, our results reinterpret task-dependent sources of neural covariability as signatures of Bayesian inference and provide new insights into their cause and their function.

                Background: Whitening toothpastes exert a whitening effect on teeth through higher surface cleaning effectiveness resulting from the abrasive properties of the paste or specific chemical components. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conceptualized to examine the relationship between whitening toothpastes and surface roughness as well as microhardness of human teeth and to clarify the evidence base available around this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in this topic area, looking at in vitro randomized control trials. Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence® was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness. More evidence and further research are needed to identify the type of whitening agent which will whiten the tooth effectively while maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Axonal Excitability Does Not Differ between Painful and Painless Diabetic or Chemotherapy‐Induced Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy in a Multicenter Observational Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability reflects ion channel function, and it is proposed that this may be a biomarker in painful (vs painless) polyneuropathy. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between axonal excitability parameters and chronic neuropathic pain in deeply phenotyped cohorts with diabetic or chemotherapy-induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two hundred thirty-nine participants with diabetic polyneuropathy were recruited from sites in the UK and Denmark, and 39 participants who developed chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy were recruited from Denmark. Participants were separated into those with probable or definite neuropathic pain and those without neuropathic pain. Axonal excitability of large myelinated fibers was measured with the threshold tracking technique. The stimulus site was the median nerve, and the recording sites were the index finger (sensory studies) and abductor pollicis brevis muscle (motor studies).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants with painless and painful polyneuropathy were well matched across clinical variables. Sensory and motor axonal excitability measures, including recovery cycle, threshold electrotonus, strength–duration time constant, and current–threshold relationship, did not show differences between participants with painful and painless diabetic polyneuropathy, and there were only minor changes for chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability did not significantly differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy in a multicenter observational study. Threshold tracking assesses the excitability of myelinated axons; the majority of nociceptors are unmyelinated, and although there is some overlap of the "channelome" between these axonal populations, our results suggest that alternative measures such as microneurography are required to understand the relationship between sensory neuron excitability and neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">On the origin of metastases: Induction of pro-metastatic states after impending cell death via ER stress, reprogramming, and a cytokine storm</a></h4>

              
                How pro-metastatic states appear in primary tumors is unclear. Conod et al. show that impending cell death drives tumor cells to acquire such states. These cells, PAMEs, orchestrate a pro-metastatic tumoral ecosystem where ER stress, metastatic reprogramming, and stemness are critical. PAMEs thus appear as potential therapeutic and prevention targets.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">CRISPR-Cas9 screen identifies oxidative phosphorylation as essential for cancer cell survival at low extracellular pH</a></h4>

              
                Alongside hypoxia, acidosis is a chemical signature of many solid tumors. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, Michl et al. find that cancer cells require NDUFS1 and other OXPHOS genes for survival in acidic environments. OXPHOS inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells at acidic pH, but permit survival at physiological pH, which defines a strategy for targeting acidic tumor regions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">In vivo imaging of mammary epithelial cell dynamics in response to lineage-biased Wnt/β-catenin activation</a></h4>

              
                Combining longitudinal intravital imaging with lineage tracing, Lloyd-Lewis et al. examine the early impact of sustained Wnt signaling on the dynamic behavior of specific luminal or basal mammary cells. They find that, irrespective of the lineage targeted, β-catenin stabilization invariably drives epidermal transdifferentiation of mammary cells, resulting in squamous metaplasia.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Biotin controls intestinal stem cell mitosis and host-microbiome interactions</a></h4>

              
                Biotin is an essential vitamin that humans and flies acquire from their food and microbiota. Neophytou and Pitsouli show that, in flies, biotin and its transporter, Smvt, function in intestinal stem cells to control mitosis, infection-induced regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Upon dietary biotin scarcity, biotin-producing microbiota can rescue reduced intestinal mitosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental evidence that uniformly white sclera enhances the visibility of eye-gaze direction in humans and chimpanzees</a></h4>

              
                Hallmark social activities of humans, such as cooperation and cultural learning, involve eye-gaze signaling through joint attentional interaction and ostensive communication. The gaze-signaling and related cooperative-eye hypotheses posit that humans evolved unique external eye morphologies, including uniformly white sclera (the whites of the eye), to enhance the visibility of eye-gaze for conspecifics. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This study tested the ability of human and chimpanzee participants to discriminate the eye-gaze directions of human and chimpanzee images in computerized tasks. We varied the level of brightness and size in the stimulus images to examine the robustness of the eye-gaze directional signal against simulated shading and distancing. We found that both humans and chimpanzees discriminated eye-gaze directions of humans better than those of chimpanzees, particularly in visually challenging conditions. Also, participants of both species discriminated the eye-gaze directions of chimpanzees better when the contrast polarity of the chimpanzee eye was reversed compared to when it was normal; namely, when the chimpanzee eye has human-like white sclera and a darker iris. Uniform whiteness in the sclera thus facilitates the visibility of eye-gaze direction even across species. Our findings thus support but also critically update the central premises of the gaze-signaling hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temperature evolution following joint loading promotes chondrogenesis by synergistic cues via calcium signaling</a></h4>

              
                During loading of viscoelastic tissues, part of the mechanical energy is transformed into heat that can locally increase the tissue temperature, a phenomenon known as self-heating. In the framework of mechanobiology, it has been accepted that cells react and adapt to mechanical stimuli. However, the cellular effect of temperature increase as a by-product of loading has been widely neglected. In this work, we focused on cartilage self-heating to present a ‘thermo-mechanobiological’ paradigm, and demonstrate how the coupling of a biomimetic temperature evolution and mechanical loading could influence cell behavior. We thereby developed a customized in vitro system allowing to recapitulate pertinent in vivo physical cues and determined the cells chondrogenic response to thermal and/or mechanical stimuli. Cellular mechanisms of action and potential signaling pathways of thermo-mechanotransduction process were also investigated. We found that co-existence of thermo-mechanical cues had a superior effect on chondrogenic gene expression compared to either signal alone. Specifically, the expression of Sox9 was significantly upregulated by application of the physiological thermo-mechanical stimulus. Multimodal transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels were identified as key mediators of thermo-mechanotransduction process, which becomes ineffective without external calcium sources. We also observed that the isolated temperature evolution, as a by-product of loading, is a contributing factor to the cell response and this could be considered as important as the conventional mechanical loading. Providing an optimal thermo-mechanical environment by synergy of heat and loading portrays new opportunity for development of novel treatments for cartilage regeneration and can furthermore signal key elements for emerging cell-based therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Placental uptake and metabolism of 25(OH)vitamin D determine its activity within the fetoplacental unit</a></h4>

              
                Pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with maternal and fetal health outcomes. Using physiological human placental perfusion and villous explants, we investigate the role of the placenta in regulating the relationships between maternal 25(OH)D and fetal physiology. We demonstrate active placental uptake of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> by endocytosis, placental metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> and active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>], with subsequent release of these metabolites into both the maternal and fetal circulations. Active placental transport of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> demonstrate that fetal supply is dependent on placental function rather than simply the availability of maternal 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> exposure induces rapid effects on the placental transcriptome and proteome. These map to multiple pathways central to placental function and thereby fetal development, independent of vitamin D transfer. Our data suggest that the underlying epigenetic landscape helps dictate the transcriptional response to vitamin D treatment. This is the first quantitative study demonstrating vitamin D transfer and metabolism by the human placenta, with widespread effects on the placenta itself. These data demonstrate a complex interplay between vitamin D and the placenta and will inform future interventions using vitamin D to support fetal development and maternal adaptations to pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Confined migration promotes cancer metastasis through resistance to anoikis and increased invasiveness</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical stress is known to fuel several hallmarks of cancer, ranging from genome instability to uncontrolled proliferation or invasion. Cancer cells are constantly challenged by mechanical stresses not only in the primary tumour but also during metastasis. However, this latter has seldom been studied with regards to mechanobiology, in particular resistance to anoikis, a cell death programme triggered by loss of cell adhesion. Here, we show in vitro that migrating breast cancer cells develop resistance to anoikis following their passage through microporous membranes mimicking confined migration (CM), a mechanical constriction that cancer cells encounter during metastasis. This CM-induced resistance was mediated by Inhibitory of Apoptosis Proteins, and sensitivity to anoikis could be restored after their inhibition using second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetics. Anoikis-resistant mechanically stressed cancer cells displayed enhanced cell motility and evasion from natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance, as well as a marked advantage to form lung metastatic lesions in mice. Our findings reveal that CM increases the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chemotactic smoothing of collective migration</a></h4>

              
                Collective migration—the directed, coordinated motion of many self-propelled agents—is a fascinating emergent behavior exhibited by active matter with functional implications for biological systems. However, how migration can persist when a population is confronted with perturbations is poorly understood. Here, we address this gap in knowledge through studies of bacteria that migrate via directed motion, or chemotaxis, in response to a self-generated nutrient gradient. We find that bacterial populations autonomously smooth out large-scale perturbations in their overall morphology, enabling the cells to continue to migrate together. This smoothing process arises from spatial variations in the ability of cells to sense and respond to the local nutrient gradient—revealing a population-scale consequence of the manner in which individual cells transduce external signals. Altogether, our work provides insights to predict, and potentially control, the collective migration and morphology of cellular populations and diverse other forms of active matter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Co-aggregation and secondary nucleation in the life cycle of human prolactin/galanin functional amyloids</a></h4>

              
                Synergistic-aggregation and cross-seeding by two different proteins/peptides in the amyloid aggregation are well evident in various neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we show co-storage of human Prolactin (PRL), which is associated with lactation in mammals, and neuropeptide galanin (GAL) as functional amyloids in secretory granules (SGs) of the female rat. Using a wide variety of biophysical studies, we show that irrespective of the difference in sequence and structure, both hormones facilitate their synergic aggregation to amyloid fibrils. Although each hormone possesses homotypic seeding ability, a unidirectional cross-seeding of GAL aggregation by PRL seeds and the inability of cross seeding by mixed fibrils suggest tight regulation of functional amyloid formation by these hormones for their efficient storage in SGs. Further, the faster release of functional hormones from mixed fibrils compared to the corresponding individual amyloid, suggests a novel mechanism of heterologous amyloid formation in functional amyloids of SGs in the pituitary.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of higher order thalamus during learning and correct performance in goal-directed behavior</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is a gateway to the cortex. Cortical encoding of complex behavior can therefore only be understood by considering the thalamic processing of sensory and internally-generated information. Here, we use two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and optogenetics to investigate the role of axonal projections from the posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (POm) to the forepaw area of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex (forepaw S1). By recording the activity of POm axonal projections within forepaw S1 during expert and chance performance in two tactile goal-directed tasks, we demonstrate that POm axons increase activity in the response and, to a lesser extent, reward epochs specifically during correct HIT performance. When performing at chance level during learning of a new behavior, POm axonal activity was decreased to naïve rates and did not correlate with task performance. However, once evoked, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were larger than during expert performance, suggesting POm input to S1 differentially encodes chance and expert performance. Furthermore, the POm influences goal-directed behavior, as photo-inactivation of archaerhodopsin-expressing neurons in the POm decreased the learning rate and overall success in the behavioral task. Taken together, these findings expand the known roles of the higher-thalamic nuclei, illustrating the POm encodes and influences correct action during learning and performance in a sensory-based goal-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical microtubule pulling forces contribute to the union of the parental genomes in the C. elegans zygote</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we reported that the Polo-like kinase PLK-1 phosphorylates the single <i>C. elegans </i>lamin (LMN-1) to trigger lamina depolymerization during mitosis. We showed that this event is required to form a pronuclear envelopes scission event that removes membranes on the juxtaposed oocyte and sperm pronuclear envelopes in the zygote, allowing the parental chromosomes to merge in a single nucleus after segregation (Velez-Aguilera et al., 2020). Here we show that cortical microtubule pulling forces contribute to pronuclear envelopes scission by promoting mitotic spindle elongation, and conversely, nuclear envelope remodeling facilitates spindle elongation. We also demonstrate that weakening the pronuclear envelopes via PLK-1-mediated lamina depolymerization, is a prerequisite for the astral microtubule pulling forces to trigger pronuclear membranes scission. Finally, we provide evidence that PLK-1 mainly acts via lamina depolymerization in this process. These observations thus indicate that temporal coordination between lamina depolymerization and mitotic spindle elongation facilitates pronuclear envelopes scission and parental genomes unification.

                Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in immunity, killing virally infected and cancerous cells. The balance of signals initiated upon engagement of activating and inhibitory NK receptors with cognate ligands determines killing or tolerance. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms regulating rapid NK cell discrimination between healthy and malignant cells in a heterogeneous tissue environment are incompletely understood. The SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase is the central negative NK cell regulator that dephosphorylates key activating signaling proteins. Though the mechanism by which SHP-1 mediates NK cell inhibition has been partially elucidated, the pathways by which SHP-1 is itself regulated remain unclear. Here, we show that phosphorylation of SHP-1 in NK cells on the S591 residue by PKC-θ promotes the inhibited SHP-1 ‘folded’ state. Silencing PKC-θ maintains SHP-1 in the active conformation, reduces NK cell activation and cytotoxicity, and promotes tumor progression in vivo. This study reveals a molecular pathway that sustains the NK cell activation threshold through suppression of SHP-1 activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell-surface tethered promiscuous biotinylators enable comparative small-scale surface proteomic analysis of human extracellular vesicles and cells</a></h4>

              
                Characterization of cell surface proteome differences between cancer and healthy cells is a valuable approach for the identification of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. However, selective sampling of surface proteins for proteomics requires large samples (&gt;10e6 cells) and long labeling times. These limitations preclude analysis of material-limited biological samples or the capture of rapid surface proteomic changes. Here, we present two labeling approaches to tether exogenous peroxidases (APEX2 and HRP) directly to cells, enabling rapid, small-scale cell surface biotinylation without the need to engineer cells. We used a novel lipidated DNA-tethered APEX2 (DNA-APEX2), which upon addition to cells promoted cell agnostic membrane-proximal labeling. Alternatively, we employed horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fused to the glycan binding domain of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP). This approach yielded a rapid and commercially inexpensive means to directly label cells containing common N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid glycans on their surface. The facile WGA-HRP method permitted high surface coverage of cellular samples and enabled the first comparative surface proteome characterization of cells and cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (EV), leading to the robust quantification of 953 cell and EV surface annotated proteins. We identified a newly-recognized subset of EV-enriched markers, as well as proteins that are uniquely upregulated on Myc oncogene-transformed prostate cancer EVs. These two cell-tethered enzyme surface biotinylation approaches are highly advantageous for rapidly and directly labeling surface proteins across a range of material-limited sample types.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Critical role for isoprenoids in apicoplast biogenesis by malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is an essential metabolic output of the apicoplast organelle in <i>Plasmodium falciparum </i>malaria parasites and is required for prenylation-dependent vesicular trafficking and other cellular processes. We have elucidated a critical and previously uncharacterized role for IPP in apicoplast biogenesis. Inhibiting IPP synthesis blocks apicoplast elongation and inheritance by daughter merozoites, and apicoplast biogenesis is rescued by exogenous IPP and polyprenols. Knockout of the only known isoprenoid-dependent apicoplast pathway, tRNA prenylation by MiaA, has no effect on blood-stage parasites and thus cannot explain apicoplast reliance on IPP. However, we have localized an annotated polyprenyl synthase (PPS) to the apicoplast. PPS knockdown is lethal to parasites, rescued by IPP and long- (C<sub>50</sub>) but not short-chain (≤C<sub>20</sub>) prenyl alcohols, and blocks apicoplast biogenesis, thus explaining apicoplast dependence on isoprenoid synthesis. We hypothesize that PPS synthesizes long-chain polyprenols critical for apicoplast membrane fluidity and biogenesis. This work critically expands the paradigm for isoprenoid utilization in malaria parasites and identifies a novel essential branch of apicoplast metabolism suitable for therapeutic targeting.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The ACF chromatin remodeling complex is essential for Polycomb repression</a></h4>

              
                Establishing and maintaining appropriate gene repression is critical for the health and development of multicellular organisms. Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation is a chromatin modification associated with repressed facultative heterochromatin, but the mechanism of this repression remains unclear. We used a forward genetic approach to identify genes involved in transcriptional silencing of H3K27-methylated chromatin in the filamentous fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>. We found that the <i>N. crassa</i> homologs of ISWI (NCU03875) and ACF1 (NCU00164) are required for repression of a subset of H3K27- methylated genes and that they form an ACF chromatin remodeling complex. This ACF complex interacts with chromatin throughout the genome, yet association with facultative heterochromatin is specifically promoted by the H3K27 methyltransferase, SET-7. H3K27-methylated genes that are upregulated when <i>iswi</i> or <i>acf1</i> are deleted show a downstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, suggesting that proper nucleosome positioning is critical for repression of facultative heterochromatin. Our findings support a direct role for the ACF complex in Polycomb repression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole promotes the synchrony of sexual maturation in female locusts</a></h4>

              
                Reproductive synchrony generally occurs in various group-living animals. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. The migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>, a worldwide agricultural pest species, displays synchronous maturation and oviposition when forms huge swarm. The reproductive synchrony among group members is critical for the maintenance of locust swarms and population density of next generation. Here, we showed that gregarious female locusts displayed more synchronous sexual maturation and oviposition than solitarious females and olfactory deficiency mutants. Only the presence of gregarious male adults can stimulate sexual maturation synchrony of female adults. Of the volatiles emitted abundantly by gregarious male adults, the aggregation pheromone, 4-vinylanisole, was identified to play key role in inducing female sexual maturation synchrony. This maturation-accelerating effect of 4-vinylanisole disappeared in the females of Or35<sup>-/-</sup> lines, the mutants of 4-vinylanisole receptor. Interestingly, 4-vinylanisole displayed a time window action by which mainly accelerates oocyte maturation of young females aged at middle developmental stages (3–4 days post adult eclosion). We further revealed that juvenile hormone/vitellogenin pathway mediated female sexual maturation triggered by 4-vinylanisole. Our results highlight a ‘catch-up’ strategy by which gregarious females synchronize their oocyte maturation and oviposition by time-dependent endocrinal response to 4-vinylanisole, and provide insight into reproductive synchrony induced by olfactory signal released by heterosexual conspecifics in a given group.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct and diverse chromatin-proteomes of ageing mouse organs reveal protein signatures that correlate with physiological functions</a></h4>

              
                Temporal molecular changes in ageing mammalian organs are of relevance to disease etiology because many age-related diseases are linked to changes in the transcriptional and epigenetic machinery that regulate gene expression. We performed quantitative proteome analysis of chromatin-enriched protein extracts to investigate the dynamics of the chromatin-proteomes of the mouse brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen at 3, 5, 10, and 15 months of age. Each organ exhibited a distinct chromatin-proteome and sets of unique proteins. The brain and spleen chromatin-proteomes were the most extensive, diverse, and heterogenous among the six organs. The spleen chromatin proteome appeared static during the lifespan, presenting a young phenotype that reflects the permanent alertness state and important role of this organ in physiological defense and immunity. We identified a total of 5928 proteins, including 2472 nuclear or chromatin associated proteins across the six mouse organs. Up to 3125 proteins were quantified in each organ demonstrating distinct and organ-specific temporal protein expression timelines and regulation at the post-translational level. Bioinformatics meta-analysis of these chromatin proteomes revealed distinct physiological and ageing-related features for each organ. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of organelle specific proteomics for <i>in vivo</i> studies of a model organism and consolidate the hypothesis that chromatin-associated proteins are involved in distinct and specific physiological functions in ageing organs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative transportomics identifies Kif5a as a major regulator of neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Many neurons in the adult central nervous system, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), degenerate and die after injury. Early axon protein and organelle trafficking failure is a key component in many neurodegenerative disorders yet changes to axoplasmic transport in disease models have not been quantified. We analyzed early changes in the protein 'transportome' from (RGC somas to their axons after optic nerve injury and identified transport failure of an anterograde motor protein Kif5a early in RGC degeneration. We demonstrated that manipulating Kif5a expression affects anterograde mitochondrial trafficking in RGCs and characterized axon transport in Kif5a knockout mice to identify proteins whose axon localization was Kif5a-dependent. Finally, we found that knockout of Kif5a in RGCs resulted in progressive RGC degeneration in the absence of injury. Together with expression data localizing Kif5a to human RGCs, these data identify Kif5a transport failure as a cause of RGC neurodegeneration and point to a mechanism for future therapeutics.

                Activation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel ryanodine receptor (RyR) triggers a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>surge, while elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>inhibits the channel in a negative feedback mechanism. Cryo-EM of rabbit RyR1 embedded in nanodiscs under partially inactivating Ca<sup>2+ </sup>conditions revealed an open and a closed-inactivated conformation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the high affinity site engages the central and C-terminal domains into a block, which pries the S6 four-helix bundle open. Further rotation of this block pushes S6 toward the central axis, closing (inactivating) the channel. Main characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated conformation are downward conformation of the cytoplasmic assembly and tightly-knit subunit interface contributed by a fully occupied Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation site, two inter-subunit resolved lipids, and two salt bridges between the EF hand domain and the S2-S3 loop validated by disease-causing mutations. The structural insight illustrates the prior Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation prerequisite for Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivation and provides for seamless transition from inactivated to closed conformations.

                Inhibition of irrelevant information is a crucial process within the working memory (WM) system. In the present study, we explored how inhibition of distractors is learned within a Sternberg-like WM task and how this learning process affects readout performance. We introduced distractors of varying strength as well as novel stimuli to a classic Sternberg task. Our findings show that the length of the training period affected obstructiveness of distractors as well as differences between WM loads. Significant differences between conditions observed early on in accuracy became void after general ceiling performance was reached. Moreover, accuracy and reaction times, which are commonly used as readouts of WM performance, were affected differently by training. While both improved significantly, only accuracy exhibited differential dependency of experimental conditions on training. It is essential to consider these dynamics when introducing a WM task which requires a long training period.

                Thirst emerges from a range of cellular changes that ultimately motivate an animal to consume water. Although thirst-responsive neuronal signals have been reported, the full complement of brain responses is unclear. Here we identify molecular and cellular adaptations in the brain using single-cell sequencing of water deprived Drosophila. Water deficiency primarily altered the glial transcriptome. Screening the regulated genes revealed astrocytic expression of the astray-encoded phosphoserine phosphatase to bi-directionally regulate water consumption. Astray synthesizes the gliotransmitter D-serine and vesicular release from astrocytes is required for drinking. Moreover, dietary D-serine rescues aay-dependent drinking deficits while facilitating water consumption and expression of water-seeking memory. D-serine action requires binding to neuronal NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Fly astrocytes contribute processes to tripartite synapses and the proportion of astrocytes that are themselves activated by glutamate increases with water deprivation. We propose that thirst elevates astrocytic D-serine release, which awakens quiescent glutamatergic circuits to enhance water procurement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Organ- and function-specific organization and bioelectronic modulation of vagus fascicles and fibers</a></h4>

              
                Afferent and efferent fibers in the vagus travel inside nerve fascicles and form branches to innervate organs and regulate organ functions. The organization of fibers and fascicles, with respect to the functions they mediate and the organs they innervate, is unknown. Accordingly, it is unknown whether the anatomical organization of the vagus can be leveraged by bioelectronic devices for function- and organ-specific neuromodulation. To characterize the microscopic functional anatomy of the vagus we developed a pipeline consisting of micro-computed tomography-based morphometry of fascicles and quantitative immunohistochemistry of single fibers. We found that, in the swine vagus, fascicles form clusters specific to afferent and efferent functions, increasingly separated in the rostral direction, and other clusters specific to the innervated organs, including larynx, lungs and heart, increasingly separated in the caudal direction. Large myelinated and small unmyelinated efferents have small counts, cover large area of the nerve, and are limited to specific fascicles; small unmyelinated afferents have large counts, cover small area, and are uniformly distributed. To test whether fiber populations can be selectively modulated, we developed a multi-contact cuff electrode specific to the fascicular vagus anatomy. Targeting of different nerve sub-sections evokes compound action potentials from different fiber types and elicits differential organ responses, including laryngeal muscle contraction, cough reflex, and changes in breathing and heart rate. Our results indicate that fibers in the vagus are spatially clustered according to the functions they mediate and the organs they innervate and can be differentially modulated by spatially selective VNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circuit-Specific Targeting of Astrocytes for Genetic Control</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are integral functional components of brain circuits. They ensheath the connections between neurons to form tripartite synapses. They react to local neuronal activities and release signaling molecules to regulate synaptic transmission. Their dysfunctions impair synaptic functions and are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence indicates that astrocytes are diverse and they have distinct features and functions in different circuits. However, selectively targeting and controlling astrocytes in a circuit-specific manner is technically challenging. Recently we constructed a series of anterograde transneuronal viral vectors based on the yellow fever vaccine YFV-17D. These YFV-17D derivatives express fluorescent proteins almost exclusively in neurons. However, we find that YFV-17D carrying DNA recombinase Cre infect astrocytes associated with the traced neuronal pathways and express Cre to turn on reporter genes. The targeting of astrocytes is at a whole-brain level but specific to the neuronal circuits traced. Therefore, YFV-17D vectors carrying DNA recombinases provide tools for selectively and genetically targeting pathway-specific astrocytes. This new technology will also allow us to reveal the roles of astrocytes in specific neuronal circuits in normal brain functions and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A descending inhibitory mechanism of nociception mediated by an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide system in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Nociception is a neural process that animals have developed to avoid potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. While nociception is triggered in the peripheral nervous system, its modulation by the central nervous system is a critical process in mammals, whose dysfunction has been extensively implicated in chronic pain pathogenesis. The peripheral mechanisms of nociception are largely conserved across the animal kingdom. However, it is unclear whether the brain-mediated modulation is also conserved in non-mammalian species. Here, we show that Drosophila has a descending inhibitory mechanism of nociception from the brain, mediated by the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) that plays an important role in the descending control of nociception in mammals. We found that mutants lacking dsk or its receptors are hypersensitive to noxious heat. Through a combination of genetic, behavioral, histological, and Ca2+ imaging analyses, we subsequently revealed neurons involved in DSK-mediated nociceptive regulation at a single-cell resolution and identified a DSKergic descending pathway that inhibits nociception. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system, raising the possibility that the descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bio-inspired neural networks implement different recurrent visual processing strategies than task-trained ones do</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral studies suggest that recurrence in the visual system is important for processing degraded stimuli. There are two broad anatomical forms this recurrence can take, lateral or feedback, each with different assumed functions. Here we add four different kinds of recurrence -- two of each anatomical form -- to a feedforward convolutional neural network and find all forms capable of increasing the ability of the network to classify noisy digit images. Specifically, we take inspiration from findings in biology by adding predictive feedback and lateral surround suppression. To compare these forms of recurrence to anatomically-matched counterparts we also train feedback and lateral connections directly to classify degraded images. Counter-intuitively, we find that the anatomy of the recurrence is not related to its function: both forms of task-trained recurrence change neural activity and behavior similarly to each other and differently from their bio-inspired anatomical counterparts. By using several analysis tools frequently applied to neural data, we identified the distinct strategies used by the predictive versus task-trained networks. Specifically, predictive feedback de-noises the representation of noisy images at the first layer of the network and decreases its dimensionality, leading to an expected increase in classification performance. Surprisingly, in the task-trained networks, representations are not de-noised over time at the first layer (in fact, they become `noiser' and dimensionality increases) yet these dynamics do lead to de-noising at later layers. The analyses used here can be applied to real neural recordings to identify the strategies at play in the brain. Our analysis of an fMRI dataset weakly supports the predictive feedback model but points to a need for higher-resolution cross-regional data to understand recurrent visual processing.

                Cannabidiol (CBD) has gained attention as a therapeutic agent and is purported to have immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and anti-seizure effects. Here, we determined the effects of chronic CBD administration in a mouse model of CLN1 disease (Cln1-/-) that simultaneously exhibits neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and spontaneous seizures. Proteomic analysis showed that putative CBD receptors are expressed at similar levels in the brains of Cln1-/- mice compared to normal animals. Cln1-/- mice received an oral dose (100mg/kg/day) of CBD for six months and were evaluated for changes in pathological markers of disease and seizures. Chronic cannabidiol administration was well-tolerated, high levels of CBD were detected in the brain, and markers of astrocytosis and microgliosis were reduced. However, CBD had no apparent effect on seizure frequency or neuron survival. These data are consistent with CBD having immunomodulatory effects. It is possible that a higher dose of CBD could also reduce neurodegeneration and seizure frequency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Locus coeruleus neuromelanin predicts ease of attaining and maintaining neural states of arousal</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC), a small subcortical structure in the brainstem, is the brain's principal source of norepinephrine. It plays a primary role in regulating stress, the sleep-wake cycle, and attention, and its degradation is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive deficits (e.g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's). Yet precisely how norepinephrine drives brain networks to support healthy cognitive function remains poorly understood -- partly because LC's small size makes it difficult to study noninvasively in humans. Here, we characterized LC's influence on brain dynamics using a hidden Markov model fitted to functional neuroimaging data from healthy young adults across four attention-related brain networks and LC. We modulated LC activity using a behavioral paradigm, and also measured individual differences in LC neuromelanin. The model revealed five hidden states, including a stable 'arousal' state that occurred when subjects actively engaged with the task. LC neuromelanin correlated with this state's stability across experimental manipulations, and with subjects' propensity to enter into and remain in this state. These results provide new insight into LC's role in driving spatiotemporal neural patterns associated with attention and arousal, and demonstrate that neuromelanin variation can explain individual differences in these patterns even in healthy young adults.

                Molecular and functional abnormalities of astrocytes have been implicated in the etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ). In this study, we examined the proteome, inflammatory responses, and secretome effects on vascularization of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes from patients with SCZ. Proteomic analysis revealed alterations in proteins related to immune function and vascularization. Reduced expression of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) p65 subunit was observed in these astrocytes, with no incremental secretion of cytokines after tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) stimulation. Among inflammatory cytokines, secretion of interleukin (IL)-8 was found particularly elevated in SCZ-patient-derived-astrocyte conditioned medium (ASCZCM). In a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, ASCZCM reduced the diameter of newly grown vessels, and this effect could be mimicked with exogenous addition of IL-8. Taken together, our results suggest that SCZ astrocytes are immunologically dysfunctional and may consequently affect vascularization through secreted factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of integrated information at macro timescales in real neural recordings</a></h4>

              
                How a system generates conscious experience remains an elusive question. One approach towards answering this is to consider the information available in the system from the perspective of the system itself. Integrated information theory (IIT) proposes a measure to capture this, integrated information ({Phi}). While {Phi} can be computed at any spatiotemporal scale, IIT posits that it be applied at the scale at which the measure is maximised. Importantly, {Phi} should emerge to be maximal not at the smallest spatiotemporal scale, but at some macro scale where system elements or timesteps are grouped into larger elements or timesteps. Emergence in this sense has been demonstrated in artificial binary systems, but it remains unclear whether it occurs in real neural recordings which are generally continuous and noisy. Here we first utilise a computational model to confirm that {Phi} becomes maximal at the temporal scales underlying its generative mechanisms. Second, we search for emergence in local field potentials from the fly brain recorded during wakefulness and anaesthesia, finding that normalised {Phi} (wake/anaesthesia), but not raw {Phi} values, peaks at 5 ms. Lastly, we extend our model to investigate why raw {Phi} values themselves did not peak. This work extends the application of {Phi} to simple artificial systems consisting of logic gates towards searching for emergence of a macro spatiotemporal scale in real neural systems.

                In order to accurately parse the visual scene into distinct surfaces, it is essential to determine whether a local luminance edge is caused by a boundary between two surfaces or a shadow cast across a single surface. Previous studies have demonstrated that local chromatic cues may help to distinguish edges caused by shadows from those caused by surface boundaries, but the information potentially available in local achromatic cues like contrast, texture, and penumbral blur remains poorly understood. In this study, we develop and analyze a large database of hand-labeled achromatic shadow edges to better understand what image properties distinguish them from occlusion edges. We find that both the highest contrast as well as the lowest contrast edges are more likely to be occlusions than shadows, extending previous observations based on a more limited image set. We also find that contrast and spatial frequency content can reliably distinguish the two edge categories with roughly 70% accuracy at 40x40 resolution. Logistic regression on a Gabor Filter bank (GFB) modeling a population of V1 simple cells separates the categories with roughly 80% accuracy, and furthermore exhibits tuning to penumbral blur. A Filter-Rectify Filter (FRF) style neural network extending the GFB model performed at roughly 90% accuracy and exhibited sensitivity to texture differences as well as penumbral blur. Comparing the performance of humans performing the same occlusion/shadow classification task as the models using the same stimuli reveals better agreement on an image-by-image basis between human performance and the FRF model than the GFB model. Taken as a whole, the present results suggest that in addition to color, local contrast, penumbral blur, texture cues may also play an important role in distinguishing edges caused by shadows from those caused by surface boundaries.

                Real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NF) is a novel noninvasive technique that permits individuals to voluntarily control brain activity or connectivity, with demonstrated feasibility in experimental and therapeutic applications. The crucial role of the insula in emotional and salience processing makes it a popular target in rtfMRI studies although there is no systematic review of their efficacy. To promote our understanding of mechanisms underlying insula regulation and thereby facilitate therapeutic translation, the present review identified 22 preclinical and clinical studies and found that rtfMRI-based NF training is efficient for modulating insula activity (> 86%) and its associated behavioral and neural changes. Based on findings, continuous feedback for multiple training sessions, specific strategies validated before application, inclusion of a practice session, and choosing appropriate localization strategies are suggested as guidelines. We also recommend standardization of training protocol design, statistical analyses and results reports for future studies. In summary, the present review informs both fundamental research and therapeutic translation of NF training as an intervention in mental disorders, particularly those with insula dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dentate gyrus mossy cells exhibit sparse coding via adaptive spike threshold dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Hilar mossy cells (hMCs) are glutamatergic neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) that receive inputs primarily from DG granule cells (GCs), CA3 pyramidal cells and local inhibitory interneurons. The hMCs then provide direct excitatory and disynaptic inhibitory feedback input to GCs. Behavioral and in vivo single unit recording experiments have implicated hMCs in pattern separation as well as is in spatial navigation and learning. It has, however, been difficult to mechanistically link the in vivo physiological behavior of hMCs with their intrinsic excitability properties that convert their synaptic inputs into spiking output. Here, we carried out electrophysiological recordings from the main cell types in the DG and found that hMCs displayed a highly adaptive threshold acting over a remarkably protracted time-scale. The hMC spike threshold increased linearly with increasing current stimulation and saturated at high current intensities. This threshold also increased in response to spiking and this effect also decayed over a long timescale, allowing for activity-dependent summation that limited hMC firing rates. This mechanism operates in parallel with a prominent medium after-hyperpolarizing potential (AHP) generated by the small conductance K+ channel. Based on experimentally derived parameters, we developed a phenomenological exponential integrate-and-fire model that closely mimics the hMC adaptive threshold. This lightweight model is amenable to its incorporation into large network models of the DG that will be conducive to deepen our understanding of the neural bases of pattern separation, spatial learning and navigation in the hippocampus.

                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a well-established brain stimulation tech-nique to modulate human brain oscillations. However, due to the strong electro-magnetic artifacts induced by the stimulation current, the simultaneous measurement of tACS effects during neurophysiological recordings in humans is challenging. Recently, transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) has been introduced to stimulate neurons at depth non-invasively. During tTIS, two high-frequency sine waves are applied, that interfere inside the brain, resulting in amplitude modulated waveforms at the target frequency. Given appropriate hardware, we show that neurophysiological data during tTIS may be acquired without stimulation artifacts at low-frequencies. However, data must be inspected carefully for possible low-frequency artifacts. Our results may help to design experimental setups to record brain activity during tTIS, which may foster our understanding of its underlying mechanisms.

                Pain after surgery is common, and its management remains a clinical challenge. Severe acute and prolonged post-surgical pain impairs immediate recovery and leads to long-term consequences like chronic pain, opioid dependency, and reduced quality of life. Even though rodent pain incision models exist, translation to patients is still hampered. To bridge this gap, we combined sensory phenotyping with quantitative proteomics and protein networks in humans and mice after skin incision representing an established model for surgical pain. Initially, we revealed, for the first time, similarities and differences of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks across both species. Next, we comprehensively phenotyped humans for pain-related symptoms and observed phenotypes with incision-induced proteome changes. Remarkably, post-incision PPI-networks differed between volunteers with small incision-related hyperalgesic areas ("Low responder") versus those with large areas ("High responder"). The latter exhibited a pronounced proteolytic environment associated with persistent inflammation, while an anti-inflammatory protein signature was observed in Low responders. Taken together, we provide unprecedented insights into peripheral processes relevant for developing hyperalgesia and pain after incision. This knowledge will immensely facilitate bidirectional translational pain studies and guide future research on the pathophysiology of pain after surgery and the discovery of novel targets for its treatment and prevention.

                Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has gained increased interest in research and therapy of associative memory (AM) and its impairments. However, the one-size-fits-all approach yields inconsistent findings, thus putting forward the need for the development of personalized frequency-modulated NIBS protocols to increase the focality and the effectiveness of the interventions. There have been only a few attempts to deliver theta frequency-personalized tES. The current study explores the feasibility of determining dominant individual theta-band frequency (ITF) based on AM task-evoked EEG activity. In a sample of 42 healthy young adults, we extracted the frequencies (2-15 Hz, in 0.5 Hz steps) with the highest event-related spectral perturbation from the EEG recorded during successful encoding in the AM task. The developed method for extraction of the dominant theta-band frequency based on the AM-evoked EEG changes is able to reliably determine the AM-related ITF and can be used for personalization of the oscillatory NIBS techniques.

                In the vestibular periphery, transmission via conventional synaptic boutons is supplemented by postsynaptic calyceal endings surrounding Type I hair cells. This review focusses on the multiple modes of communication between these receptors and their enveloping calyces as revealed by simultaneous dual electrode recordings. Classic orthodromic transmission is facilitated and supplemented by two forms of bidirectional communication enabled by the extensive cleft between the Type I hair cell and its calyx. The slowest mode of transmission occurs over tens of milliseconds: potassium ions accumulate in the synaptic cleft, depolarizing both the hair cell and afferent to potentials allowing rapid vesicle fusion in the receptor and large excitatory postsynaptic potentials that trigger action potentials in the afferent. On the millisecond timescale, conventional glutamatergic quantal transmission occurs when hair cells are depolarized to potentials sufficient for calcium influx and vesicle fusion. A third form of transmission occurs over tens of microseconds, resulting from the large voltage- and ion sensitive cleft facing conductances in both the hair cell and the calyx that are open at their resting potentials. Current flowing out of either the hair cell or the afferent divides into the fraction flowing across the cleft into its cellular partner, and the remainder flowing out of the cleft and into the surrounding fluid compartment. These findings suggest multiple biophysical bases for the extensive repertoire of response dynamics seen in the population of primary vestibular afferent fibers. The results further suggest that evolutionary pressures drive selection for the calyx afferent.

                Uncovering molecular mechanisms regulating dendritic diversification is essential to understanding the formation and modulation of functional neural circuitry. Transcription factors play critical roles in promoting dendritic diversity and here, we identify PP2A phosphatase function as a downstream effector of Cut-mediated transcriptional regulation of dendrite development. Mutant analyses of the PP2A catalytic subunit (mts) or the scaffolding subunit (PP2A-29B) reveal cell-type specific regulatory effects with the PP2A complex required to promote dendritic growth and branching in Drosophila Class IV (CIV) multidendritic (md) neurons, whereas in Class I (CI) md neurons, PP2A functions in restricting dendritic arborization. Cytoskeletal analyses reveal requirements for Mts in regulating microtubule stability/polarity and F-actin organization/dynamics. In CIV neurons, mts knockdown leads to reductions in dendritic localization of organelles including mitochondria and satellite Golgi outposts, while CI neurons show increased Golgi outpost trafficking along the dendritic arbor. Further, mts mutant neurons exhibit defects in neuronal polarity/compartmentalization. Finally, genetic interaction analyses suggest {beta}-tubulin subunit 85D is a common PP2A target in CI and CIV neurons, while FoxO is a putative target in CI neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Co-targeting B-RAF and PTEN enables sensory axons to regenerate across and beyond the spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory axons in adult mammals fail to regenerate after spinal cord injury (SCI), in part due to insufficient intrinsic growth potential. Robustly boosting their growth potential continues to be a challenge. Previously, we showed that constitutive activation of B-RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase) markedly promotes axon regeneration after dorsal root and optic nerve injuries. The regrowth is further augmented by supplemental deletion of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog). Here, we examined whether concurrent B-RAF activation and PTEN deletion promotes dorsal column axon regeneration after SCI. Remarkably, genetically targeting B-RAF and PTEN selectively in DRG neurons of adult mice enables many DC axons to enter, cross, and grow beyond the lesion site after SCI; some axons reach ~2 mm rostral to the lesion by 3 weeks post-injury. Co-targeting B-RAF and PTEN promotes more robust DC regeneration than a pre-conditioning lesion, which additively enhances the regeneration triggered by B-RAF/PTEN. We also found that post-injury targeting of B-RAF and PTEN enhances DC axon regeneration. These results demonstrate that co-targeting B-RAF and PTEN effectively enhances the intrinsic growth potential of DC axons after SCI and therefore may help to develop a novel strategy to promote robust long-distance regeneration of primary sensory axons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of brain activity by psycholinguistic information during naturalistic speech comprehension and production</a></h4>

              
                Language processing requires the integration of diverse sources of information across multiple levels of processing. A range of psycholinguistic properties have been documented in previous studies as having influence on brain activation during language processing. However, most of those studies have used factorial designs to probe the effect of one or two individual properties using highly controlled stimuli and experimental paradigms. Little is known about the neural correlates of psycholinguistic properties in more naturalistic discourse, especially during language production. The aim of our study is to explore the above issues in a rich fMRI dataset in which participants both listened to recorded passages of discourse and produced their own narrative discourse in response to prompts. Specifically, we measured 13 psycholinguistic properties of the discourse comprehended or produced by the participants, and we used principal components analysis (PCA) to address covariation in these properties and extract a smaller set of latent language characteristics. These latent components indexed vocabulary complexity, sensory-motor and emotional language content, discourse coherence and speech quantity. A parametric approach was adopted to study the effects of these psycholinguistic variables on brain activation during comprehension and production. We found that the pattern of effects across the cortex was somewhat convergent across comprehension and production. However, the degree of convergence varied across language properties, being strongest for the component indexing sensory-motor language content. We report the full, unthresholded effect maps for each psycholinguistic variable, as well as mapping how these effects change along a large-scale cortical gradient of brain function. We believe that our findings provide a valuable starting point for future, confirmatory studies of discourse processing.

                It remains to be understood how biological motion is hierarchically computed, from discrimination of local 'life motion' animacy to global dynamic body perception. Here, we addressed this functional separation of the correlates of the perception of life motion, defined as characteristic for the local motion of parts of living beings, from perception of global motion of a body. We hypothesized that life motion processing can be isolated, by using a single dot motion perceptual decision paradigm featuring the biomechanical details of local realistic motion of a single joint. To ensure that we were indeed tackling processing of biological motion properties we used a discrimination instead of detection task. We discovered using representation similarity analysis that two key early dorsal and two ventral stream regions (visual motion selective hMT+ and V3A, extrastriate body area EBA and a region within fusiform gyrus FFG) showed robust and separable signals related to encoding of life motion and global motion. These signals reflected two independent processing stages, as revealed by representation dissimilarity analysis and deconvolution of fMRI responses to each motion pattern. This study showed that higher level pSTS encodes both classes of biological motion in a similar way, revealing a higher-level integrative stage, reflecting scale independent biological motion perception. Our results reveal a two-stage framework for neural computation of biological motion, with an independent contribution of dorsal and ventral regions for the initial stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Erbb4 deletion from fast-spiking interneurons causes psychosis-relevant neuroimaging phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Converging lines of evidence suggest that dysfunction of cortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic interneurons is a core feature of psychosis. This dysfunction is thought to underlie neuroimaging abnormalities commonly found in patients with psychosis, particularly in the hippocampus. These include increases in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and levels of glutamatergic metabolites, and decreases in binding of GABAA 5 receptors and the synaptic density marker synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). However, direct links between PV+ interneuron dysfunction and these neuroimaging readouts have yet to be established. Conditional deletion of a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, the tyrosine kinase receptor Erbb4, from cortical and hippocampal PV+ interneurons leads to several synaptic, behavioral and cognitive phenotypes relevant to psychosis in mice. Here, we investigated how this PV+ interneuron disruption affects the hippocampal in vivo neuroimaging readouts in the Erbb4 model. Adult Erbb4 conditional mutant mice (Lhx6-Cre;Erbb4F/F, n=12) and their wild-type littermates (Erbb4F/F, n=12) were scanned in a 9.4T magnetic resonance scanner to quantify CBF and glutamatergic metabolite levels (glutamine, glutamate, GABA). Subsequently, we assessed GABAA receptors and SV2A density using quantitative autoradiography. Erbb4 mutant mice showed significantly elevated CBF and glutamine levels, as well as decreased SV2A density compared to wild-type littermates. No significant GABAA receptor density differences were identified. These findings demonstrate that specific disruption of cortical PV+ interneurons in mice recapitulate some of the key neuroimaging findings in psychosis patients, and link PV+ interneuron deficits to non-invasive, translational measures of brain function and neurochemistry that can be used across species.

                Skeletal muscle has recently arisen as a novel regulators of Central Nervous System (CNS) function and aging, secreting bioactive molecules known as myokines with proteostasis and metabolism-modifying functions in targeted tissues, including the CNS. Here we report the generation of a novel transgenic mouse with enhanced muscle proteostasis via moderate overexpression of TFEB. We have discovered that the resulting enhanced skeletal muscle proteostasis function can significantly ameliorate proteotoxicity, reduce neuroinflammation and promotes transcriptional remodeling of the aging CNS, preserving cognition/memory in aging mice. Enhancing skeletal muscle proteostasis also reduced neuroinflammation and accumulation of tau-associated pathological hallmarks in a mouse model of tau pathology and was accompanied by increased secretion of CNS-targeting circulating factors from skeletal muscle. Our results implicate maintenance of skeletal muscle proteostasis throughout aging to direct regulations of the aging CNS metabolism and function, and suggest that skeletal-muscle originating factors may act as novel therapeutic targets against age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated reconstruction of dendritic and axonal arbors reveals molecular correlates of neuroanatomy</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal anatomy is central to the organization and function of brain cell types. However, anatomical variability within apparently homogeneous populations of cells can obscure such insights. Here, we report large-scale automation of arbor reconstruction on a dataset of 802 inhibitory neurons characterized using the Patch-seq method, which enables measurement of multiple properties from individual neurons, including local morphology and transcriptional signature. We demonstrate that these automated reconstructions can be used in the same manner as manual reconstructions to understand the relationship between many cellular properties used to define cell types. We uncover molecular correlates of laminar innervation on multiple molecularly defined neuronal subclasses and types. In particular, our results reveal molecular correlates of the variability in Layer 1 (L1) innervation even in a transcriptomically defined subpopulation of Martinotti cells in the adult mouse neocortex.

	<p>The morphology of the hippocampus and amygdala can be significantly affected by a long-term hypoxia-induced inflammatory response. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has a significant effect on the neuroplasticity of the hippocampus and amygdala by countering inflammation. However, the role of CRF is still largely unclear at high altitudes. Here, we investigated brain limbic volumes in participants who had experienced long-term hypoxia exposure in Tibet (3680 m), utilizing high-resolution structural images to allow the segmentation of the hippocampus and amygdala into their constituent substructures. We recruited a total of 48 participants (48 males; aged = 20.92 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.03 years) to undergo a structural 3T MRI, and the levels of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were measured using a cardiorespiratory function test. Inflammatory biomarkers were also collected. The participants were divided into two groups according to the levels of median VO2max, and the analysis showed that the morphological indexes of subfields of the hippocampus and amygdala of the lower CRF group were decreased when compared with the higher CRF group. Furthermore, the multiple linear regression analysis showed that there was a higher association with inflammatory factors in the lower CRF group than that in the higher CRF group. This study suggested a significant association of CRF with hippocampus and amygdala volume, which may be related to hypoxic stress in high-altitude environments. A better CRF reduced physiological stress and a decrease in the inflammatory response was observed, which may be related to the increased oxygen transport capacity of the body.</p>

	<p>The present study aims to investigate effect of early caffeine exposure on epileptogenesis and occurrence of absence seizures and comorbid depression in adulthood. For this purpose, Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats were enrolled in a control and two experimental groups on the 7th day after the delivery. The rats in experimental groups received either 10 or 20 mg/kg caffeine subcutaneously while animals in control group had subcutaneous injections of 0.9% saline. The injections started at postnatal day 7 (PND7) and were continued each day for 5 days. At 6&amp;amp;ndash;7 months of age, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and behavioral recordings in the forced swimming test, sucrose consumption/preference test and locomotor activity test were carried out. At 6 months of age, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg caffeine-treated WAG/Rij rats showed increased immobility latency and active swimming duration in forced swimming test when compared with the untreated controls. In addition, 20 mg/kg caffeine treatment decreased immobility time. In sucrose preference/consumption tests, WAG/Rij rats in 10 mg/kg caffeine group demonstrated higher sucrose consumption and preference compared to untreated controls. The rats treated with 20 mg/kg caffeine showed higher sucrose preference compared to control rats. The exploratory activity of rats in the 10 mg/kg caffeine-treated group was found to be higher than in the 20 mg/kg caffeine-treated and control groups in the locomotor activity test. At 7 months of age, caffeine-treated animals showed a decreased spike-wave discharge (SWD) number compared to the control animals. These results indicate that postnatal caffeine treatment may decrease the number of seizure and depression-like behaviors in WAG/Rij rats in later life. Caffeine blockade of adenosine receptors during the early developmental period may have beneficial effects in reducing seizure frequency and depression-like behaviors in WAG/Rij rat model.</p>

	<p>The prevalence of dementia is increasing globally and is linked to obesity and unfavorable dietary habits. The present study analyses the association of alcohol intake from wine and non-wine alcoholic beverages (non-wine) in g/d, as well as coffee and tea in cups/d, with incident dementia. Over 4.2 million person-years, 4270 dementia cases occurred in 351,436 UK Biobank participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident dementia were defined with Cox proportional hazard regression models in which beverage intake was fitted as penalized cubic splines. Wine intake showed a significant U-shaped association with the lowest risk for incident dementia (nadir) ranging from 21 to 23 g alcohol/d in all participants and in males. In contrast, non-wine consumption was significantly and dose-dependently associated with incident dementia, and the nadir was found at 0 g alcohol/d. Coffee consumption was not related to dementia risk, while moderate-to-high tea intake was negatively associated with incident dementia. Taken together, the current study shows on a population level that moderate consumption of wine and moderate-to-high tea intake is associated with a decreased risk of incident dementia. In contrast, non-wine is positively related to dementia risk in a linear fashion, and no clear association is found for coffee.</p>

                Integrative drug safety research in translational health informatics has rapidly evolved and included data that are drawn in from many resources, combining diverse data that are either reused from (curated) repositories, or newly generated at source. Each resource is mandated by different sets of metadata rules that are imposed on the incoming data. Combination of the data cannot be readily achieved without interference of data stewardship and the top-down policy guidelines that supervise and inform the process for data combination to aid meaningful interpretation and analysis of such data. The eTRANSAFE Consortium's effort to drive integrative drug safety research at a large scale hereby present the lessons learnt and the proposal of solution at the guidelines in practice at this Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project. Recommendations in these guidelines were compiled from feedback received from key stakeholders in regulatory agencies, EFPIA companies, and academic partners. The research reproducibility guidelines presented in this study lay the foundation for a comprehensive data sharing and knowledge management plans accounting for research data management in the drug safety space - FAIR data sharing guidelines, and the model verification guidelines as generic deliverables that best practices that can be reused by other scientific community members at large. FAIR data sharing is a dynamic landscape that rapidly evolves with fast-paced technology advancements. The research reproducibility in drug safety guidelines introduced in this study provides a reusable framework that can be adopted by other research communities that aim to integrate public and private data in biomedical research space.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of Remote Ischemic Conditioning on Hand Engagement in individuals with Spinal cord Injury (RICHES): protocol for a pilot crossover study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                ​​​​​​Background: Most spinal cord injuries (SCI) are not full transections, indicating that residual nerve circuits are retained. Rehabilitation interventions have been shown to beneficially reorganize motor pathways in the brain, corticospinal tract, and at the spinal level. However, rehabilitation training require a large number of repetitions, and intervention effects may be absent or show transient retention. Therefore, the need remains for an effective approach to synergistically improve the amount and duration of neuroplasticity in combination with other interventions. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) demonstrates several potential advantages as a candidate for such an approach. Therefore, we propose a protocol to investigate RIC coupled with physical training to promote neuroplasticity in hand muscles. Methods: This will be a prospective randomized-order crossover trial to be performed in eight able-bodied participants and eight participants with chronic cervical SCI. Patients will participate in two experimental sessions consisting of either active or sham RIC preceding a bout of pinch movement exercise. Serial evaluations will be conducted at baseline, after RIC, immediately after pinch exercise, and follow up 15-minutes later. The primary outcome is the change in corticospinal excitability (primarily measured by the motor evoked potential of abductor pollicis brevis muscle). Secondary outcomes will include maximal volitional pinch force, and inflammatory biomarkers. To ensure safety, we will monitor tolerability and hemodynamic responses during RIC. Discussion: This protocol will be the first to test RIC in people with cervical SCI and to investigate whether RIC alters corticospinal excitability. By sharing the details of our protocol, we hope other interested researchers will seek to investigate similar approaches – depending on overlap with the current study and mutual sharing of participant-level data, this could increase the sample size, power, and generalizability of the analysis and results.

                Background: Autonomous vehicles are important in smart transportation. Although exciting progress has been made, it remains challenging to design a safety mechanism for autonomous vehicles despite uncertainties and obstacles that occur dynamically on the road. Collision detection and avoidance are indispensable for a reliable decision-making module in autonomous driving. Methods: This study presents a robust approach for forward collision warning using vision data for autonomous vehicles on Malaysian public roads. The proposed architecture combines environment perception and lane localization to define a safe driving region for the ego vehicle. If potential risks are detected in the safe driving region, a warning will be triggered. The early warning is important to help avoid rear-end collision. Besides, an adaptive lane localization method that considers geometrical structure of the road is presented to deal with different road types. Results: Precision scores of mean average precision (mAP) 0.5, mAP 0.95 and recall of 0.14, 0.06979 and 0.6356 were found in this study. Conclusions: Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach under different lighting and environmental conditions.

                Background: The Mbeere South community of Embu County consume leaves of Catha edulis for its stimulant and euphoretic actions. Other indigenous uses of the plant are undocumented. Information on the pharmacology and safety of this plant is also scanty. This study aimed to document the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial properties, and toxicity of C. edulis leaves collected from the Mbeere South community in Kenya. Methods: Ethnopharmacological data was collected from 35 informants using semi-structured questionnaires. Leaf extracts of C. edulis were prepared using acetone, water, and methanol. The antimicrobial properties of these extracts were evaluated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The toxicity of the aqueous extract was determined using hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg doses over 28 days. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: All informants were male, married, >50 years old, with >10 years of experience. The sources, local names, preparation, storage conditions, indications, frequency of use, dosage, and side effects of C. edulis were documented. All extracts were ineffective against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. They had limited efficacy against B. cereus and S. aureus. Significant differences were observed in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats at the tested doses. Low, intermediate, and high doses of the aqueous extract of C. edulis produced local congestion of the cardiac and hepatic vessels. Localized interstitial connective tissue proliferation, multifocal kidney interstitial hemorrhage, and localized tubular epithelium necrosis were also observed in female rats. Conclusions: The ethnobotanical uses of C. edulis among the Mbeere South community were documented for the first time. Limited antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity at high doses limit the use of leaves of C. edulis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance of the T cell senescence markers in predicting the active disease of systemic lupus erythematosus [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Accelerated immunosenescence has been observed in several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). T cell senescence plays an essential role in the destruction of organs in SLE patients. This study aimed to identify the ability of immunosenescence markers to predict SLE disease activity. Methods: Overall, 61 SLE patients and 60 healthy subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score assessed disease activity. Senescence surface markers of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry (CD4/CD8 ratio, CD28null, CD57, CD45 isoforms [CD45RA and CD45RO], and KLRG1). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the serum cytokines (IFNγ and IL-2) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology. Complement and anti-dsDNA levels were also evaluated as the comparator for predicting active disease in SLE. Logistic regression models were used to identify the independent predictive factors for active SLE status. Performance of the senescence markers in predicting active disease in SLE was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as the area under curve (AUC). Results: SLE patients with active disease had significantly higher CD8+CD28null, CD8+CD57+, CD8+CD45RA+, CD8+CD45RO+, and CD8+KLRG1+ percentages with lower CD4/CD8 ratio than healthy subjects and SLE patients with inactive disease. The highest AUC and sensitivity were seen in CD8+CD28null (AUC 0.801 [0.662-0.940], sensitivity 91.9%, cut off >6.85%) with comparable results to serum complement and anti-dsDNA in predicting active disease. Multivariate analysis showed that CD4/CD8 ratio, CD8+CD28null, and C3 had significantly increased OR for active SLE. Combination models of CD4/CD8 ratio, CD8+CD28null, and C3 yielded the best results for predicting the active SLE (AUC 0.923 [0.848-0.997], sensitivity 81.2%, specificity 84.0%, LR+ 5.08 and LR- 0.22). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that combining immunosenescence markers, including CD4/CD8 ratio and CD8+CD28null with C3 levels could increase the odds of predicting active disease in SLE.

                Abstract: Large-scale studies combining hundreds of cancer cell lines and many cancer drugs, with their promises and challenges, represent a new development in the in vitro screening of cancer drugs. However, drugs sensitivity results of the same cancer cell lines exposed to the same cancer drugs generated different IC50s by these studies as noticed by Haibe-Kains B et al (1). These inconsistencies are due to many factors: the experimental conditions and the use of the Four Parameter Logistic (4PL) regression model to analyze drugs sensitivity results. A new model based on the Levasseur LM et al model, the Gompertzian growth model of in vitro monolayer culture, and the IC-50 time course evolution is more appropriate to improve the accuracy of these large scale studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In-air Hand Gesture Signature Recognition: An iHGS Database Acquisition Protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background With the advances in current technology, hand gesture recognition has gained considerable attention. It has been extended to recognize more distinctive movements, such as a signature, in human-computer interaction (HCI) which enables the computer to identify a person in a non-contact acquisition environment. This application is known as in-air hand gesture signature recognition. To our knowledge, there are no publicly accessible databases and no detailed descriptions of the acquisitional protocol in this domain. Methods This paper aims to demonstrate the procedure for collecting the in-air hand gesture signature’s database. This database is disseminated as a reference database in the relevant field for evaluation purposes. The database is constructed from the signatures of 100 volunteer participants, who contributed their signatures in two different sessions. Each session provided 10 genuine samples enrolled using a Microsoft Kinect sensor camera to generate a genuine dataset. In addition, a forgery dataset was also collected by imitating the genuine samples. For evaluation, each sample was preprocessed with hand localization and predictive hand segmentation algorithms to extract the hand region. Then, several vector-based features were extracted. Results In this work, classification performance analysis and system robustness analysis were carried out. In the classification analysis, a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to classify the samples and 97.43% accuracy was achieved; while the system robustness analysis demonstrated low error rates of 2.41% and 5.07% in random forgery and skilled forgery attacks, respectively. Conclusions These findings indicate that hand gesture signature is not only feasible for human classification, but its properties are also robust against forgery attacks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of Preclinical Task Based Learning program in Medical Education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The conventional curriculum in preclinical medical education has a need for early clinical exposure programs that help in correlation of basic science data with clinical skills. This is helpful to develop clinical reasoning skills, problem-solving abilities, team work, communication skills and overall attitudes and behaviour relevant for a healthcare provider. Preclinical task based learning (TskBL) is an active learning strategy in which the focus for the first year medical student is a real task done by a doctor. In this strategy the student-doctors undergo a standardized patient encounter and discuss the learning issues related to the task in the first year of medical school. The current study is focussed on the student perception of the effectiveness of task based learning module.The TskBL was conducted among first year medical students for nine topics that are commonly encountered in the clinics. After TskBL was planned and implemented the evaluation of the modules was done using focus group discussions. The students highlighted the importance of standardized patients in the TskBL strategy in providing early clinical exposure in preclinical medical education. They reported its usefulness gaining essential knowledge, skills and attitudes for medical learning. They reported positive outcomes of module design and processes and activities in TskBL. Based on the negative aspects of the modules, future improvement was suggested in improving the usefulness of standardized patient encounter. This study showed the novice learners’ outlook of the potency of TskBL for several other topics of clinical relevance to provide early clinical exposure in medical schools.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Estimate time to recovery of command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of command-following</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multi-center, retrospective, cohort study during the initial surge of the United States’ pandemic (March-July 2020) we estimate the time from intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were included if admitted to one of three hospitals with severe COVID-19, endotracheal intubation for at least seven days, and impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score &lt;6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>571 patients of the 795 patients recovered command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days (95%-confidence interval [CI]:27-32). Median time to recovery of command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) value ≤55mmHg (p&lt;0.001), and 25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to recovery of consciousness was associated with hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55mmHg hazard ratio (HR):0.56; 95%-CI:0.46-0.68; PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤70 HR:0.88; 95%-CI:0.85-0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain injury (n=199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N=427, October-April 2021).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform decisions about life-sustaining therapies.</p>

Emerging clinical evidence suggests that thrombosis in the microvasculature of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) plays an essential role in dictating the disease progression. Because of the infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, patients’ fresh blood samples are limited to access for <i>in vitro</i> experimental investigations. Herein, we employ a novel multiscale and multiphysics computational framework to perform predictive modeling of the pathological thrombus formation in the microvasculature using data from patients with COVID-19. This framework seamlessly integrates the key components in the process of blood clotting, including hemodynamics, transport of coagulation factors and coagulation kinetics, blood cell mechanics and adhesive dynamics, and thus allows us to quantify the contributions of many prothrombotic factors reported in the literature, such as stasis, the derangement in blood coagulation factor levels and activities, inflammatory responses of endothelial cells and leukocytes to the microthrombus formation in COVID-19. Our simulation results show that among the coagulation factors considered, antithrombin and factor V play more prominent roles in promoting thrombosis. Our simulations also suggest that recruitment of WBCs to the endothelial cells exacerbates thrombogenesis and contributes to the blockage of the blood flow. Additionally, we show that the recent identification of flowing blood cell clusters could be a result of detachment of WBCs from thrombogenic sites, which may serve as a nidus for new clot formation. These findings point to potential targets that should be further evaluated, and prioritized in the anti-thrombotic treatment of patients with COVID-19. Altogether, our computational framework provides a powerful tool for quantitative understanding of the mechanism of pathological thrombus formation and offers insights into new therapeutic approaches for treating COVID-19 associated thrombosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructing benchmark test sets for biological sequence analysis using independent set algorithms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samantha Petti, Sean R. Eddy</p>

Biological sequence families contain many sequences that are very similar to each other because they are related by evolution, so the strategy for splitting data into separate training and test sets is a nontrivial choice in benchmarking sequence analysis methods. A random split is insufficient because it will yield test sequences that are closely related or even identical to training sequences. Adapting ideas from independent set graph algorithms, we describe two new methods for splitting sequence data into dissimilar training and test sets. These algorithms input a sequence family and produce a split in which each test sequence is less than <i>p</i>% identical to any individual training sequence. These algorithms successfully split more families than a previous approach, enabling construction of more diverse benchmark datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-based identification of conditionally-essential genes from transposon-insertion sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vishal Sarsani, Berent Aldikacti, Shai He, Rilee Zeinert, Peter Chien, Patrick Flaherty</p>

The understanding of bacterial gene function has been greatly enhanced by recent advancements in the deep sequencing of microbial genomes. Transposon insertion sequencing methods combines next-generation sequencing techniques with transposon mutagenesis for the exploration of the essentiality of genes under different environmental conditions. We propose a model-based method that uses regularized negative binomial regression to estimate the change in transposon insertions attributable to gene-environment changes in this genetic interaction study without transformations or uniform normalization. An empirical Bayes model for estimating the local false discovery rate combines unique and total count information to test for genes that show a statistically significant change in transposon counts. When applied to RB-TnSeq (randomized barcode transposon sequencing) and Tn-seq (transposon sequencing) libraries made in strains of <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> using both total and unique count data the model was able to identify a set of conditionally beneficial or conditionally detrimental genes for each target condition that shed light on their functions and roles during various stress conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multimeric structure enables the acceleration of KaiB-KaiC complex formation induced by ADP/ATP exchange inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shin-ichi Koda, Shinji Saito</p>

Circadian clocks tick a rhythm with a nearly 24-hour period in a variety of organisms. In the clock proteins of cyanobacteria, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, known as a minimum circadian clock, the slow KaiB-KaiC complex formation is essential in determining the clock period. This complex formation, occurring when the C1 domain of KaiC hexamer binds ADP molecules produced by the ATPase activity of C1, is considered to be promoted by accumulating ADP molecules in C1 through inhibiting the ADP/ATP exchange (ADP release) rather than activating the ATP hydrolysis (ADP production). Significantly, this ADP/ATP exchange inhibition accelerates the complex formation together with its promotion, implying a potential role in the period robustness under environmental perturbations. However, the molecular mechanism of this simultaneous promotion and acceleration remains elusive because inhibition of a backward process generally slows down the whole process. In this article, to investigate the mechanism, we build several reaction models of the complex formation with the pre-binding process concerning the ATPase activity. In these models, six KaiB monomers cooperatively and rapidly bind to C1 when C1 binds ADP molecules more than a given threshold while stabilizing the binding-competent conformation of C1. Through comparison among the models proposed here, we then extract three requirements for the simultaneous promotion and acceleration: the stabilization of the binding-competent C1 by KaiB binding, slow ADP/ATP exchange in the binding-competent C1, and relatively fast ADP/ATP exchange occurring in the binding-incompetent C1 in the presence of KaiB. The last two requirements oblige KaiC to form a multimer. Moreover, as a natural consequence, the present models can also explain why the binding of KaiB to C1 reduces the ATPase activity of C1.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian calibration, process modeling and uncertainty quantification in biotechnology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Marie Helleckes, Michael Osthege, Wolfgang Wiechert, Eric von Lieres, Marco Oldiges</p>

High-throughput experimentation has revolutionized data-driven experimental sciences and opened the door to the application of machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the quality of any data analysis strongly depends on the quality of the data and specifically the degree to which random effects in the experimental data-generating process are quantified and accounted for. Accordingly calibration, i.e. the quantitative association between observed quantities and measurement responses, is a core element of many workflows in experimental sciences.
Particularly in life sciences, univariate calibration, often involving non-linear saturation effects, must be performed to extract quantitative information from measured data. At the same time, the estimation of uncertainty is inseparably connected to quantitative experimentation. Adequate calibration models that describe not only the input/output relationship in a measurement system but also its inherent measurement noise are required. Due to its mathematical nature, statistically robust calibration modeling remains a challenge for many practitioners, at the same time being extremely beneficial for machine learning applications.
In this work, we present a bottom-up conceptual and computational approach that solves many problems of understanding and implementing non-linear, empirical calibration modeling for quantification of analytes and process modeling. The methodology is first applied to the optical measurement of biomass concentrations in a high-throughput cultivation system, then to the quantification of glucose by an automated enzymatic assay. We implemented the conceptual framework in two Python packages, calibr8 and murefi, with which we demonstrate how to make uncertainty quantification for various calibration tasks more accessible. Our software packages enable more reproducible and automatable data analysis routines compared to commonly observed workflows in life sciences.
Subsequently, we combine the previously established calibration models with a hierarchical Monod-like ordinary differential equation model of microbial growth to describe multiple replicates of <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> batch cultures. Key process model parameters are learned by both maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference, highlighting the flexibility of the statistical and computational framework.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>With a growing appreciation for interindividual anatomical variability and patient-specific brain connectivity, advanced imaging sequences offer the opportunity to directly visualize anatomical targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS). The lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating their clinical utility, however, has hindered their broad implementation in clinical practice.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences, the present study identified a thalamic hypointensity that holds promise as a visual marker in DBS. To validate the clinical utility of the identified hypointensity, we retrospectively analyzed 65 patients (26 female, mean age = 69.1 ± 12.7 years) who underwent DBS in the treatment of essential tremor. We characterized its neuroanatomical substrates and evaluated the hypointensity's ability to predict clinical outcome using stimulation volume modeling and voxelwise mapping. Finally, we determined whether the hypointensity marker could predict symptom improvement on a patient-specific level.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Anatomical characterization suggested that the identified hypointensity constituted the terminal part of the dentatorubrothalamic tract. Overlap between DBS stimulation volumes and the hypointensity in standard space significantly correlated with tremor improvement (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and distance to hotspots previously reported in the literature (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, <i>p</i> = 7.9e-4). In contrast, the amount of variance explained by other anatomical atlas structures was reduced. When accounting for interindividual neuroanatomical variability, the predictive power of the hypointensity increased further (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings introduce and validate a novel imaging-based marker attainable from FGATIR sequences that has the potential to personalize and inform targeting and programming in DBS for essential tremor. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Human CASPR2 antibodies reversibly alter memory and the CASPR2 protein complex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The encephalitis associated with antibodies against contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) is presumably antibody-mediated but the antibody effects and whether they cause behavioral alterations are not well-known. Here, we used a mouse model of patients’ IgG transfer and super-resolution microscopy to demonstrate the antibody pathogenicity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis or healthy controls were infused into the cerebroventricular system of mice. The levels and colocalization of CASPR2 with transient axonal glycoprotein-1 (TAG1) were determined with Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy (40-70μm lateral resolution). Hippocampal clusters of Kv1.1 voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC) and GluA1-containing AMPA receptors were quantified with confocal microscopy. Behavioral alterations were assessed with standard behavioral paradigms. Cultured neurons were used to determine the levels of intracellular CASPR2 and TAG1 after exposure to patients’ IgG.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Infusion of patients’ IgG, but not control IgG, caused memory impairment along with hippocampal reduction of surface CASPR2 clusters and decreased CASPR2/TAG1 colocalization. In cultured neurons, patients’ IgG led to an increase of intracellular CASPR2 without affecting TAG1, suggesting selective CASPR2 internalization. Additionally, mice infused with patients’ IgG showed decreased levels of Kv1.1 and GluA1 (two CASPR2 regulated proteins). All these alterations and the memory deficit reverted to normal after removing patients’ IgG.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis cause reversible memory impairment, inhibit the interaction of CASPR2/TAG1, and decrease the levels of CASPR2 and related proteins (VGKC, AMPAR). These findings fulfill the postulates of antibody-mediated disease and provide a biological basis for antibody-removing treatment approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quality improvement of saliva by chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks: a randomized experimental trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bubble tea drinks contain tea and tapioca pearls. Chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks may increase salivary components. Because of its proteins, inorganic components, and enzymes, saliva plays an important role in the body’s defense against bacteria and viruses. This study aims to analyze the effect of chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks on salivary C-reactive protein (CRP) and calcium (Ca) levels. Methods: The inclusion criterion was 18–25 years of age. The exclusion criteria were receiving medication, using dentures, a history of dry mouth, smoking and systemic disease. In the first week of the experiment, subjects drank bubble tea with tapioca pearls for three days (intervention week). In the second week, the same subjects drank tea without pearls for three days (control week). Each subject drank the bubble tea for 5 minutes per day over 3 days. Saliva samples were collected on the first day before bubble tea consumption (pretest) and on the third day after tea consumption (posttest). Saliva collection was performed in the morning (09:00 am–12:00 pm) for 1 minute. Sixty saliva samples were collected from 15 subjects. Salivary CRP levels were measured using a commercial ELISA kit, and Ca levels were determined using semi-quantitative test strips. Results: Salivary CRP decreased significantly on the third day in the intervention group but showed no significant difference with the control group. Calcium levels increased significantly on the third day in both groups. Conclusion: Bubble tea drinks could improve the quality of saliva by decreasing salivary CRP and increasing Ca levels. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04670341 (17th December 2020).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An adaptive calibration technique for thermistor with varying temperature coefficient and reference resistance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A thermistor is a nonlinear sensor requiring a precise calibration technique to achieve accurate temperature measurements. This paper attempts to design a calibration technique employing artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The present work fulfills the following objectives: (i) to cover 100% input range in the linearity range measurement; (ii) to make the measurement technique adaptive to variations in reference resistance and thermistor temperature coefficient using a calibration technique. Methods: An ANN-based calibration circuit is cascaded to the data conversion circuit. Optimized ANN is trained with linear data independent of reference resistance and temperature coefficient effects on thermistor output. ANN optimization is performed by comparing various schemes, algorithms, and numbers of hidden layers to achieve a minimum mean square error and a regression close to 1. Results: The proposed technique provides a linear relationship for the system over the entire input range and avoids the requirement of repeated calibrations each time the thermistor is replaced. Practical data are used to validate the proposed measurement technique. Conclusions: The objectives and proposed technique have been demonstrated by results with a root mean square percentage error of 1.8%.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Leigh Syndrome: A Study of 209 Patients at the Beijing Children's Hospital</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leigh syndrome (LS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. In the largest patient collection to date, this study aimed to provide new insights into the clinical and genetic spectrum of LS, defect-specific associations, and predictors of disease course and survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, metabolic, neuroimaging, onset, and survival data were collected from the medical records of 209 patients referred to the Beijing Children's Hospital with symmetrical basal ganglia and/or brainstem neuroimaging changes indicative of LS by 30 centers from the Chinese network of mitochondrial disease (mitoC-NET) between January 2013 and July 2021 for exploratory analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants were identified in 52 genes, most frequently <i>MT-ATP6</i>, <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>PDHA1</i>. Maternally inherited variants accounted for 42% (heteroplasmy level ≥90% in 64%). Phenotypes spanned 92 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Elevated serum lactate (144/195), global developmental delay (142/209), and developmental regression (103/209) were most frequent. Discriminating neuroimaging and/or clinical features were identified for <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.9176T&gt;C), <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>PDHA1</i>, <i>SUCLG1</i>, and <i>SURF1</i>. Poorest survival was associated with <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.8993T&gt;C and m.9176T&gt;C), <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>ALDH5A1</i> (≤50% 3 year's survival), in contrast to milder defects with specific treatment (<i>ECHS1</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i>, 100% 3 year's survival).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data define phenotype, onset, and survival of LS in a defect-specific manner, identifying features discriminating between genetic defects and predictive of disease outcome. These findings are essential to early diagnosis, in optimizing family counseling, and to the design and monitoring of future clinical trials, the next frontier of LS research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">State-dependent representations of mixtures by the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems are often tasked to analyse complex signals from the environment, separating relevant from irrelevant parts. This process of decomposing signals is challenging when a mixture of signals does not equal the sum of its parts, leading to an unpredictable corruption of signal patterns. In olfaction, nonlinear summation is prevalent at various stages of sensory processing. Here, we investigate how the olfactory system deals with binary mixtures of odours under different brain states, using two-photon imaging of olfactory bulb (OB) output neurons. Unlike previous studies using anaesthetised animals, we found that mixture summation is more linear in the early phase of evoked responses in awake, head-fixed mice performing an odour detection task, due to dampened responses. Despite this, and responses being more variable, decoding analyses indicated that the data from behaving mice was well discriminable. Curiously, the time course of decoding accuracy did not correlate strictly with the linearity of summation. Further, a comparison with naïve mice indicated that learning to accurately perform the mixture detection task is not accompanied by more linear mixture summation. Finally, using a simulation, we demonstrate that, while saturating sublinearity tends to degrade the discriminability, the extent of the impairment may depend on other factors, including pattern decorrelation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the mixture representation in the primary olfactory area is state-dependent, but the analytical perception may not strictly correlate with linearity in summation.

                Cholinergic and sympathetic counter-regulatory networks control numerous physiologic functions including learning/memory/cognition, stress responsiveness, blood pressure, heart rate and energy balance. As neurons primarily utilize glucose as their primary metabolic energy source, we generated mice with increased glycolysis in cholinergic neurons by specific deletion of the fructose-2,6-phosphatase protein TIGAR. Steady-state and stable isotope flux analyses demonstrated increased rates of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA production, acetylcholine levels and density of neuromuscular synaptic junction clusters with enhanced acetylcholine release. The increase in cholinergic signaling reduced blood pressure and heart rate with a remarkable resistance to cold-induced hypothermia. These data directly demonstrate that increased cholinergic signaling through the modulation of glycolysis has several metabolic benefits particularly to increase energy expenditure and heat production upon cold exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Large-scale orientational order in bacterial colonies during inward growth</a></h4>

              
                During colony growth, complex interactions regulate the bacterial orientation, leading to the formation of large-scale ordered structures, including topological defects, microdomains, and branches. These structures may benefit bacterial strains, providing invasive advantages during colonization. Active matter dynamics of growing colonies drives the emergence of these ordered structures. However, additional biomechanical factors also play a significant role during this process. Here we show that the velocity profile of growing colonies creates strong radial orientation during inward growth when crowded populations invade a closed area. During this process, growth geometry sets virtual confinement and dictates the velocity profile. Herein, flow-induced alignment and torque balance on the rod-shaped bacteria result in a new stable orientational equilibrium in the radial direction. Our analysis revealed that the dynamics of these radially oriented structures also known as aster defects, depend on bacterial length and can promote the survival of the longest bacteria around localized nutritional hot spots. The present results indicate a new mechanism underlying structural order and provide mechanistic insights into the dynamics of bacterial growth on complex surfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How clustered protocadherin binding specificity is tuned for neuronal self-/nonself-recognition</a></h4>

              
                The stochastic expression of fewer than 60 clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) isoforms provides diverse identities to individual vertebrate neurons and a molecular basis for self-/nonself-discrimination. cPcdhs form chains mediated by alternating <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions between apposed membranes, which has been suggested to signal self-recognition. Such a mechanism requires that cPcdh <i>cis</i> dimers form promiscuously to generate diverse recognition units, and that <i>trans</i> interactions have precise specificity so that isoform mismatches terminate chain growth. However, the extent to which cPcdh interactions fulfill these requirements has not been definitively demonstrated. Here, we report biophysical experiments showing that cPcdh <i>cis</i> interactions are promiscuous, but with preferences favoring formation of heterologous <i>cis</i> dimers. <i>Trans</i> homophilic interactions are remarkably precise, with no evidence for heterophilic interactions between different isoforms. A new C-type cPcdh crystal structure and mutagenesis data help to explain these observations. Overall, the interaction characteristics we report for cPcdhs help explain their function in neuronal self-/nonself-discrimination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crystal structures of bacterial small multidrug resistance transporter EmrE in complex with structurally diverse substrates</a></h4>

              
                Proteins from the bacterial small multidrug resistance (SMR) family are proton-coupled exporters of diverse antiseptics and antimicrobials, including polyaromatic cations and quaternary ammonium compounds. The transport mechanism of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> transporter, EmrE, has been studied extensively, but a lack of high-resolution structural information has impeded a structural description of its molecular mechanism. Here we apply a novel approach, multipurpose crystallization chaperones, to solve several structures of EmrE, including a 2.9 Å structure at low pH without substrate. We report five additional structures in complex with structurally diverse transported substrates, including quaternary phosphonium, quaternary ammonium, and planar polyaromatic compounds. These structures show that binding site tryptophan and glutamate residues adopt different rotamers to conform to disparate structures without requiring major rearrangements of the backbone structure. Structural and functional comparison to Gdx-Clo, an SMR protein that transports a much narrower spectrum of substrates, suggests that in EmrE, a relatively sparse hydrogen bond network among binding site residues permits increased sidechain flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural progenitor mitotic wave is required for asynchronous axon outgrowth and morphology</a></h4>

              
                Spatiotemporal mechanisms generating neural diversity are fundamental for understanding neural processes. Here, we investigated how neural diversity arises from neurons coming from identical progenitors. In the dorsal thorax of <i>Drosophila</i>, rows of mechanosensory organs originate from the division of sensory organ progenitor (SOPs). We show that in each row of the notum, an anteromedial located central SOP divides first, then neighbouring SOPs divide, and so on. This centrifugal wave of mitoses depends on cell-cell inhibitory interactions mediated by SOP cytoplasmic protrusions and Scabrous, a secreted protein interacting with the Delta/Notch complex. Furthermore, when this mitotic wave was reduced, axonal growth was more synchronous, axonal terminals had a complex branching pattern and fly behaviour was impaired. We show that the temporal order of progenitor divisions influences the birth order of sensory neurons, axon branching and impact on grooming behaviour. These data support the idea that developmental timing controls axon wiring neural diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mendelian randomization suggests a bidirectional, causal relationship between physical inactivity and adiposity</a></h4>

              
                Physical inactivity and increased sedentary time are associated with excess weight gain in observational studies. However, some longitudinal studies indicate reverse causality where weight gain leads to physical inactivity and increased sedentary time. As observational studies suffer from reverse causality, it is challenging to assess the true causal directions. Here, we assess the bidirectional causality between physical inactivity, sedentary time and adiposity by bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis. We assessed genetic liability using results from genome-wide association studies for accelerometer-based physical activity and sedentary time in 91,105 individuals and for body mass index (BMI) in 806,834 individuals. We implemented Mendelian randomization using CAUSE method that accounts for pleiotropy and sample overlap using full genome-wide data. We also applied inverse variance-weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods using genome-wide significant variants only. We found evidence of bidirectional causality between sedentary time and BMI: longer sedentary time was causal for higher BMI [beta (95%CI) from CAUSE method: 0.11 (0.02, 0.2), P=0.02], and higher BMI was causal for longer sedentary time (0.13 (0.08, 0.17), P=6.3.x10<sup>-4</sup>). Our analyses suggest that higher moderate and vigorous physical activity are causal for lower BMI (moderate: -0.18 (-0.3,-0.05), P=0.006; vigorous: -0.16 (-0.24,-0.08), P=3.8x10<sup>-4</sup>), but indicate that the association between higher BMI and lower levels of physical activity is due to horizontal pleiotropy. The bidirectional, causal relationship between sedentary time and BMI suggests that decreasing sedentary time is beneficial for weight management, but also that targeting adiposity may lead to additional health benefits by reducing sedentary time.

                Grey matter damage has been established as a key contributor to disability progression in multiple sclerosis. Aside from neuronal loss and axonal transections, which predominate in cortical demyelinated lesions, synaptic alterations have been detected in both demyelinated plaques and normal-appearing grey matter, resulting in functional neuronal damage. The axon initial segment is a key element of neuronal function, responsible for action potential initiation and maintenance of neuronal polarity. Despite several reports of profound axon initial segment alterations in different pathological models, among which experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis, whether the axon initial segment is affected in multiple sclerosis is still unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed axon initial segments from control and multiple sclerosis tissue, focusing on layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons in the neocortex and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and performed analysis on the parameters known to control neuronal excitability, i.e., axon initial segment length and position. We found that the axon initial segment length was unchanged among the different multiple sclerosis samples, and not different from controls. In contrast, in both cell types, the axon initial segment position was altered, with an increased soma-axon initial segment gap, in both active and inactive demyelinated lesions. In addition, using a computational model, we show that this increased gap between soma and axon initial segment might increase neuronal excitability. Taken together, these results show for the first time changes of axon initial segments in multiple sclerosis, in active as well as inactive grey matter lesions in both neocortex and cerebellum, which might alter neuronal function.

                Manipulating neuronal homeostasis, which enables neurons to regulate their intrinsic excitability, offers an attractive opportunity to prevent seizures. However, no anticonvulsant compounds have yet been reported that directly manipulate neuronal homeostasis. Here, we describe a novel class of anticonvulsant compounds, based on 4-tert-butyl-benzaldehyde (4-TBB), with a mode-of-action that includes increased expression of the homeostatic regulator Pumilio (Pum). In Drosophila and mouse we use a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced seizure model, and an electrically induced seizure model for refractory seizures to evaluate anticonvulsant efficacy. The pyrazole analogue (RAB216) demonstrates best efficacy, protecting 50% of mice from PTZ-induced seizure. Knock-down of Pum, in Drosophila, blocks anticonvulsive effects, whilst analysis of validated Pum targets show significant reductions following exposure of mouse brain to 4-TBB. This study provides proof-of-principle that anticonvulsant effects can be achieved through regulation of neuronal homeostasis and identifies a chemical lead compound for future development.

                Human brain demonstrates amazing readiness for speech and language learning at birth, but the auditory development preceding such readiness remains unknown. Cochlear implanted (CI) children with prelingual deafness provide a unique opportunity to study this developmental stage. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, we revealed that the brain of CI children was nearly irresponsive to sounds at CI hearing onset. With increasing CI experiences up to 32 months, the brain demonstrated function, region and hemisphere specific development. Most strikingly, the left anterior temporal lobe showed an oscillatory trajectory, changing in opposite phases for speech and noise. In addition, speech responses increased linearly in left sylvian parieto-temporal area and right inferior frontal gyrus, and noise responses changed in U shape in right supramarginal gyrus. Such cortical development predicted behavioral improvement. The study provides the first longitudinal brain imaging evidence for early auditory development preceding speech acquisition in the human brain.
