              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05252">Competition, stability, and functionality in excitatory-inhibitory neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based models have become a central paradigm for understanding computation and stability in both theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. However, the energetic framework typically relies on symmetry in synaptic or weight matrices - a constraint that excludes biologically realistic systems such as excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) networks. When symmetry is relaxed, the classical notion of a global energy landscape fails, leaving the dynamics of asymmetric neural systems conceptually unanchored. In this work, we extend the energetic framework to asymmetric firing rate networks, revealing an underlying game-theoretic structure for the neural dynamics in which each neuron is an agent that seeks to minimize its own energy. In addition, we exploit rigorous stability principles from network theory to study regulation and balancing of neural activity in E-I networks. We combine the novel game-energetic interpretation and the stability results to revisit standard frameworks in theoretical neuroscience, such as the Wilson-Cowan and lateral inhibition models. These insights allow us to study cortical columns of lateral inhibition microcircuits as contrast enhancer - with the ability to selectively sharpen subtle differences in the environment through hierarchical excitation-inhibition interplay. Our results bridge energetic and game-theoretic views of neural computation, offering a pathway toward the systematic engineering of biologically grounded, dynamically stable neural architectures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05500">SSDLabeler: Realistic semi-synthetic data generation for multi-label artifact classification in EEG</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG recordings are inherently contaminated by artifacts such as ocular, muscular, and environmental noise, which obscure neural activity and complicate preprocessing. Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05528">Decoding Selective Auditory Attention to Musical Elements in Ecologically Valid Music Listening</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Art has long played a profound role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and behavior. While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05718">Emergence of Language in the Developing Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few million words suffice for children to acquire language. Yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this unique ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigate neural activity recorded from over 7,400 electrodes implanted in the brains of 46 children, teenagers, and adults for epilepsy monitoring, as they listened to an audiobook version of "The Little Prince". We then train neural encoding and decoding models using representations, derived either from linguistic theory or from large language models, to map the location, dynamics and development of the language hierarchy in the brain. We find that a broad range of linguistic features is robustly represented across the cortex, even in 2-5-year-olds. Crucially, these representations evolve with age: while fast phonetic features are already present in the superior temporal gyrus of the youngest individuals, slower word-level representations only emerge in the associative cortices of older individuals. Remarkably, this neuro-developmental trajectory is spontaneously captured by large language models: with training, these AI models learned representations that can only be identified in the adult human brain. Together, these findings reveal the maturation of language representations in the developing brain and show that modern AI systems provide a promising tool to model the neural bases of language acquisition.

                arXiv:2512.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNN)-based receiver for 5G-NR OFDM system, called neuromorphic receiver (NeuromorphicRx), replacing the channel estimation, equalization and symbol demapping blocks. We leverage domain knowledge to design the input with spiking encoding and propose a deep convolutional SNN with spike-element-wise residual connections. We integrate an SNN with artificial neural network (ANN) hybrid architecture to obtain soft outputs and employ surrogate gradient descent for training. We focus on generalization across diverse scenarios and robustness through quantized aware training. We focus on interpretability of NeuromorphicRx for 5G-NR signals and perform detailed ablation study for 5G-NR signals. Our extensive numerical simulations show that NeuromorphicRx is capable of achieving significant block error rate performance gain compared to 5G-NR receivers and similar performance compared to its ANN-based counterparts with 7.6x less energy consumption.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05472">Unleashing Temporal Capacity of Spiking Neural Networks through Spatiotemporal Separation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered naturally suited for temporal processing, with membrane potential propagation widely regarded as the core temporal modeling mechanism. However, existing research lack analysis of its actual contributions in complex temporal tasks. We design Non-Stateful (NS) models progressively removing membrane propagation to quantify its stage-wise role. Experiments reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: moderate removal in shallow or deep layers improves performance, while excessive removal causes collapse. We attribute this to spatio-temporal resource competition where neurons encode both semantics and dynamics within limited range, with temporal state consuming capacity for spatial learning. Based on this, we propose Spatial-Temporal Separable Network (STSep), decoupling residual blocks into independent spatial and temporal branches. The spatial branch focuses on semantic extraction while the temporal branch captures motion through explicit temporal differences. Experiments on Something-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51 show STSep achieves superior performance, with retrieval task and attention analysis confirming focus on motion rather than static appearance. This work provides new perspectives on SNNs' temporal mechanisms and an effective solution for spatiotemporal modeling in video understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05837">Wasserstein Evolution : Evolutionary Optimization as Phase Transition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel connection between evolutionary computation and statistical physics by formalizing evolutionary optimization as a phase transition process. We introduce Wasserstein Evolution (WE), a principled optimization framework that implements the Wasserstein gradient flow of a free energy functional, mathematically bridging evolutionary dynamics with thermodynamics. WE directly translates the physical competition between potential gradient forces (exploitation) and entropic forces (exploration) into algorithmic dynamics, providing an adaptive, theoretically grounded mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. Experiments on challenging benchmark functions demonstrate that WE achieves competitive convergence performance while maintaining dramatically higher population diversity than classical methods (GA, DE, CMA-ES).This superior entropy preservation enables effective navigation of multi-modal landscapes without premature convergence, validating the physical interpretation of optimization as a disorder-to-order transition. Our work provides not only an effective optimization algorithm but also a new paradigm for understanding evolutionary computation through statistical physics.

                arXiv:2512.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), central to computational neuroscience and neuromorphic machine learning (ML), require efficient simulation and gradient-based training. While AI accelerators offer promising speedups, gradient-based SNNs typically implement sparse spike events using dense, memory-heavy data-structures. Existing exact gradient methods lack generality, and current simulators often omit or inefficiently handle delayed spikes. We address this by deriving gradient computation through spike event queues, including delays, and implementing memory-efficient, gradient-enabled event queue structures. These are benchmarked across CPU, GPU, TPU, and LPU platforms. We find that queue design strongly shapes performance. CPUs, as expected, perform well with traditional tree-based or FIFO implementations, while GPUs excel with ring buffers for smaller simulations, yet under higher memory pressure prefer more sparse data-structures. TPUs seem to favor an implementation based on sorting intrinsics. Selective spike dropping provides a simple performance-accuracy trade-off, which could be enhanced by future autograd frameworks adapting diverging primal/tangent data-structures.

                arXiv:2512.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order optimization methods, which leverage curvature information, offer faster and more stable convergence than first-order methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam. However, their practical adoption is hindered by the prohibitively high cost of inverting the second-order information matrix, particularly in large-scale neural network training. Here, we present the first demonstration of a second-order optimizer powered by in-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) using resistive random-access memory (RRAM), which performs matrix inversion (INV) in a single step. We validate the optimizer by training a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten letter classification, achieving 26% and 61% fewer training epochs than SGD with momentum and Adam, respectively. On a larger task using the same second-order method, our system delivers a 5.88x improvement in throughput and a 6.9x gain in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art digital processors. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of AMC circuits for second-order neural network training, opening a new path toward energy-efficient AI acceleration.

Abstract: Bitcoin mining hardware acquisition requires strategic timing due to volatile markets, rapid technological obsolescence, and protocol-driven revenue cycles. Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations. The model is available through: https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/MineROI-Net.

Abstract: The interpretation of the origin of observed exoplanets is usually done only qualitatively due to uncertainties of key parameters in planet formation models. To allow a quantitative methodology which traces back in time to the planet birth locations, we train recently developed conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on synthetic data from a global planet formation model which tracks growth from dust grains to evolved final giant planets. In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data. Extension to planetary systems will require more training data due to the higher dimensionality of the problem.

                arXiv:2512.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new neural network model based on attribute-specific representations (e.g., color, shape, size), a classic example of associative memory. The proposed model is based on a previous study on memory and recall of multiple images using the Cue Ball and Recall Net (referred to as the CB-RN system, or simply CB-RN) [1]. The system consists of three components, which are C.CB-RN for processing color, S.CB-RN for processing shape, and V.CB-RN for processing size. When an attribute data pattern is presented to the CB-RN system, the corresponding attribute pattern of the cue neurons within the Cue Balls is associatively recalled in the Recall Net. Each image pattern presented to these CB-RN systems is represented using a two-dimensional code, specifically a QR code [2].

                arXiv:2505.13078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many crucial tasks of image processing and computer vision are formulated as inverse problems. Thus, it is of great importance to design fast and robust algorithms to solve these problems. In this paper, we focus on generalized projected gradient descent (GPGD) algorithms where generalized projections are realized with learned neural networks and provide state-of-the-art results for imaging inverse problems. Indeed, neural networks allow for projections onto unknown low-dimensional sets that model complex data, such as images. We call these projections deep projective priors. In generic settings, when the orthogonal projection onto a lowdimensional model set is used, it has been shown, under a restricted isometry assumption, that the corresponding orthogonal PGD converges with a linear rate, yielding near-optimal convergence (within the class of GPGD methods) in the classical case of sparse recovery. However, for deep projective priors trained with classical mean squared error losses, there is little guarantee that the hypotheses for linear convergence are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a stochastic orthogonal regularization of the training loss for deep projective priors. This regularization is motivated by our theoretical results: a sufficiently good approximation of the orthogonal projection guarantees linear stable recovery with performance close to orthogonal PGD. We show experimentally, using two different deep projective priors (based on autoencoders and on denoising networks), that our stochastic orthogonal regularization yields projections that improve convergence speed and robustness of GPGD in challenging inverse problem settings, in accordance with our theoretical findings.

                Background Bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has emerged as an effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity. Despite its benefits, howver, it may result in severe complications. One rare but serious postoperative issue is the development of a gastrobronchial fistula (GBF), a condition with a challenging diagnosis and management pathway due to its insidious nature. Case Presentation We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in 2015. The early postoperative course was complicated by a gastric fistula that was managed with double pigtail stents. Subsequently, the patient developed recurrent bronchopulmonary infections, and imaging in 2017 revealed a GBF connecting the gastric remnant to the bronchial tree. Initial endoscopic management with stenting failed because of migration. Definitive surgical management involved complex adhesiolysis and creation of tension-free fistula-jejunal anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Discussion Gastrothoracic fistula post-bariatric surgery is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Their development is often linked to the insufficient treatment of early gastric leaks or collections. Diagnosis is frequently delayed owing to nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Endoscopic approaches have show limited success, and surgical management, often complex, is frequently necessary. Multidisciplinary strategies, including endoscopic and surgical options, are vital for achieving favorable outcomes. Conclusion Gastrobronchial fistulas represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge following sleeve gastrectomy. A high index of suspicion, long-term follow-up, and tailored multidisciplinary approach are essential for effective management and resolution. Awareness of this rare complication should prompt early detection and intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality.

                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban consumption, agricultural irrigation, and several local industrial operations in the Huancavelica region; however, increasing anthropogenic pressures including untreated municipal wastewater, mining effluents, agricultural runoff, and expanding urbanization have significantly deteriorated its water quality. These combined stressors highlight the need for an integrated assessment to understand the extent of contamination and associated human health risks. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

                Background Sea cucumbers can be explored as alternative raw materials by the pharmaceutical and fishery industries as anticancer agents because they contain potential bioactive compounds. Methods This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of Paracaudina australis extract against breast cancer cells (T47D) using an MTT assay. The secondary metabolites found in P.australis are steroids, terpenoids, saponins, and phenolics. The Thin-Layer Chromatography test results are indicated by Rf values, and steroid compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction are included in the standard Rf values. The isolates obtained were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, High-performance liquid chromatography, and UV-Visual spectrophotometry. Results The isolated compounds were Dihydrocholesterol and Cholestan-3-ol, with a molecular formula (C27H48O). The ion weight and molecular mass of the compound were m/z 388,7. Conclusions These compounds may be responsible for the anticancer activity of P.australis. The IC50 of Isolate F4 was 25,3 μg/ml, and IC50 of Isolate F7,8 was 13,76 μg/ml.

">Inner-ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labels lateral olivocochlear efferents but results in off-target transfection in the contralateral cochlea and the brain</a></h4>

              
                Gene delivery via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) is a valuable tool for understanding the organization and function of auditory neuronal circuitry. In this study, we explored the use of AAVs injected into the inner ear to transfect the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) pathway, a poorly understood ipsilateral component of the auditory efferent feedback system. AAV serotypes exhibit a wide range of properties, including cell type selectivity and the capacity for retrograde transport, but none of the AAV serotypes used for inner ear delivery have been reported to successfully transfect the LOC pathway. Here, we show that unilateral inner ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labeled the LOC pathway. However, the ability of AAV2-retro to diffuse via the cochlear aqueduct from the perilymph into the cerebrospinal fluid resulted in off-target transfection in the brain and the labeling of LOC projections in the contralateral cochlea. The extent of contralateral transfection of LOC neurons depended on the age of the animal and the amount of virus delivered to the inner ear. These findings highlight the importance of considering the dosage and properties of AAV serotype when interpreting experimental results.

">S100A8/A9 Inhibition Reduces Splenic Myelopoiesis and Improves Outcomes After Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neutrophils are among the earliest immune cells to infiltrate the ischemic brain and contribute to secondary neuronal damage. The alarmin S100 calcium-binding protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), predominantly released by neutrophils, is upregulated during this process. Although the bone marrow is recognised as the principal site of neutrophil production via myelopoiesis, the role of the spleen as an immune-responsive organ remains incompletely understood. Methods: In this study, we employed a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in male C57Bl/6 mice and examined immune responses 24 hours post-stroke in the blood, bone marrow and spleen using flow cytometry. To understand the role of S100A8/A9 in modulating stroke-induced myelopoiesis, we administered a small molecule inhibitor of S100A8/A9, ABR-215757, before and after stroke. Results: Neutrophils and S100A8/A9 were found in the infarcted brain tissue. Interestingly, we observed a marked increase in splenic neutrophils, accompanied by an expansion of myeloid progenitors, indicating activation of extramedullary myelopoiesis. Given our previous work showing that S100A8/A9 promotes myelopoiesis, we pharmacologically inhibited S100A8/A9 to determine if this would modulate stroke-induced myelopoiesis. Treatment with ABR-215757 at 24 hours post-stroke led to reduced splenic myelopoiesis, reversed neutrophilia, enhanced forelimb grip strength, and a one-third reduction in infarct size. Conclusion: These findings identify the spleen as a key contributor to neutrophil production following stroke and suggest that targeting S100A8/A9 may attenuate post-stroke inflammation and improve neurological recovery.

<p>I outline my personal journey in hippocampal research from joining the O'Keefe lab in 1991 to the present, with a focus on earlier experimental and computational investigations of spatial cognition and neural representations in rodents, with some reference to extensions to humans and to other aspects of cognition. These recollections are organized around place cells and the role of theta rhythmicity, the importance of environmental boundaries, the operation of a wider system for spatial memory and imagery, grid cells, and the neural mechanisms of navigation in humans. I conclude with some reflections on the collaborative and exciting ecosystem that supported all of these endeavors.</p>

                Microglia are the brain's primary innate immune cells, which maintain neural homeostasis through surveillance, debris clearance, and synaptic remodeling. Dark microglia represent a distinct state of microglia that came into recent focus due to their excessive physical contact with synapses in contexts of pathological synapse loss, predominantly in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. Dark microglia are identified by their unique ultrastructural features, exhibiting a dark, condensed appearance under electron microscopy. They display signs of cellular stress and appear to be engaged in synaptic pruning. Here, we review recent advances in understanding these intriguing cells in the mammalian brain, from new molecular insights into their origin to their emerging functional roles across the lifespan, in both health and disease.

">Serotonin Engages Divergent 5-HT Receptor Pathways for Cell Type-Resolved Modulation of Prefrontal Layer 5 Microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: Serotonin (5-HT) is a key neuromodulator in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), yet its cell type-specific effects across excitatory and inhibitory microcircuits remain incompletely understood. We aimed to determine how 5-HT shapes intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission in defined neuronal populations of the medial PFC (mPFC). Experimental Approach: We performed whole-cell recordings from morphologically and electrophysiologically characterised layer 5 (L5) neurons in rat mPFC. Pyramidal neurons were classified into adaptive-spiking high input resistance (ASH), adaptive-spiking low input resistance (ASL), and regular-spiking (RS) types; interneurons were categorised as non-fast-spiking (nFS), regular-fast-spiking (rFS), and stuttering-fast-spiking (sFS) interneurons. These cell types exhibited distinct membrane properties, firing patterns, and axonal projections. We assessed serotonergic modulation using bath-applied 5-HT and subtype-specific receptor mechanisms. Key Results: 5-HT produced divergent postsynaptic responses across pyramidal neuron subtypes: ASH and RS neurons depolarised via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) activation, whereas ASL neurons exhibited 5-HT1AR-mediated hyperpolarisation. Among interneurons, rFS and sFS cells depolarised through ionotropic 5-HT3ARs, while nFS interneurons were largely unaffected. At the synaptic level, 5-HT suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission between pyramidal neurons via presynaptic 5-HT1BRs, and conversely enhanced GABAergic transmission from FS interneurons via presynaptic 5-HT3ARs. Conclusions & Implications: Serotonin exerts bidirectional, cell type-specific serotonergic modulation of local microcircuits that acts to suppress excitation while facilitating inhibition. This balanced and targeted regulation, arising from distinct distributions of somatodendritic and presynaptic 5-HT receptors, provides a mechanistic basis for serotonergic influence on attention, cognitive flexibility, and emotional regulation.

">mTORC1-Dependent Signaling in Layer 5b Neurons Is Required for Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation relies on activity-dependent neuronal plasticity, particularly in deep-layer cortical neurons that integrate long-range inputs from medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. In the neocortex, apical tuft dendrites of layer 5b pyramidal neurons receive direct input from the MTL within cortical layer 1, and their activation is critical for associative learning. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable learning-induced plasticity in these neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that activity-dependent, mTORC1-regulated translation in layer 5b neurons contributes to learning and memory. Using in vivo paradigms such as exposure to an enriched environment (EE) and in vitro models of network activation by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), combined with cell type-specific translational profiling (RiboTag), we identify candidate mRNAs associated with experience-dependent plasticity. We further show that pharmacological inhibition of canonical mTORC1 signaling during memory-relevant tasks abrogated memory consolidation. Our findings identify the mTORC1 pathway as a central regulator of learning-induced protein translation and cortical plasticity.

">Pairing extinction training with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces drug-seeking by altering activity in afferents to the medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Relapse triggered by drug-associated cues or stress remains a major challenge in treating substance use disorders (SUDs), as re-exposure reliably provokes craving and reinstatement of drug seeking. Extinction-based interventions can reduce cue reactivity, yet extinction learning is often weak or context-dependent, limiting its clinical impact. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) enhances learning-related plasticity via widespread engagement of neuromodulatory systems and cortical circuits. Recent preclinical work shows that pairing extinction with VNS facilitates extinction learning and reduces cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, suggesting translational potential as an adjunct to exposure-based therapies. However, the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. To address this gap, we examined how VNS paired with extinction alters activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) networks that regulate drug seeking, focusing specifically on afferent projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Male rats received retrograde AAV-eGFP infusions into either the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) cortex to label upstream projections, followed by cocaine self-administration, extinction training with VNS or sham stimulation, and cue-induced reinstatement. cFos immunolabeling in the BLA and vHPC revealed pathway-specific modulation: VNS decreased overall BLA activity and reduced activation of BLA to IL projections, but increased activation of BLA to PL projections. In the vHPC, VNS selectively decreased activation of vHPC to IL projections without affecting PL-projecting neurons. Because these pathways synapse onto parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs) in the mPFC, we quantified PVI activation and found that VNS decreased overall prefrontal cFos expression, but increased PVI activity in the PL, and decreased PVI activity in the IL. Together, these results demonstrate that VNS paired with extinction reshapes prefrontal-amygdala-hippocampal circuits in a pathway-specific manner, potentially modulating feed-forward inhibition to reduce relapse-like behavior. These findings support VNS as a promising strategy to strengthen extinction learning and improve treatment outcomes in SUD.

                <p>Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is classically linked to associative learning, signaling relationships between predictive cues and outcomes. Yet, dopamine is also strongly modulated by novelty, a nonassociative factor that has received comparatively little attention. Here, we used optical dopamine sensors in awake, behaving male and female mice to define how novelty alters the temporal dynamics of dopamine release during aversive learning. We manipulated novelty in three ways: (1) omitting expected footshocks, (2) introducing novel neutral cues concurrently with shock-predictive stimuli, and (3) presenting novel stimuli in an unpaired fashion within a context. Across all conditions, manipulations robustly increased dopamine release and in some cases altered the directionality of cue-evoked dopamine responses. Notably, these effects extended beyond the immediate stimulus window, altering subsequent responses to both conditioned cues and footshocks. Together, these findings demonstrate that changes in the environment that extend beyond prediction-based learning can exert a powerful and sustained influence on dopamine signaling, reshaping how aversive cues and outcomes are represented in the brain.</p>

                <p>by Madeleine Ammar, Laurel Fogarty, Anne Kandler</p>

One of the most controversial and actively debated questions about both human and non-human animal culture concerns its relationship with adaptation – under what circumstances might we expect culture, and the ability to learn socially from others, to be beneficial, and favored by natural selection? Existing theory posits that the benefit of social learning depends on the rate at which the environment changes, and recent work has shown that this relationship is mediated by how much information an individual can retain over time - by memory. Based on extensive ethnographic research, vertical learning—social learning from parent to offspring—appears to be an extremely salient and important type of social learning. Here we develop large-scale agent-based simulation models to investigate the evolutionary relationship between vertical social learning in particular and the memory and retention of cultural information.
We show that the benefit of vertical learning depends on how quickly those information is forgotten and on the exact way in which individuals innovate. This work points to the importance of a complex interplay between the size of cultural repertoires, the benefits of cultural preservation, changing selective environments, and the mechanism of innovation - none of which can be fully understood in isolation.

                <p>by Justin Reynolds, Chongle Pan</p>

Deep neural networks can model the nonlinear architecture of polygenic traits, yet the reliability of attribution methods to identify the genetic variants driving model predictions remains uncertain. We introduce a benchmarking framework that quantifies three aspects of interpretability: attribution recall, attribution precision, and stability, and apply it to deep learning models trained on UK Biobank genotypes for standing height prediction. After quality control, feed-forward neural networks were trained on more than half a million autosomal variants from approximately 300 thousand participants and evaluated using four attribution algorithms (Saliency, Gradient SHAP, DeepLIFT, Integrated Gradients) with and without SmoothGrad noise averaging. Attribution recall was assessed using synthetic spike-in variants with known additive, dominant, recessive, and epistatic effects, enabling direct measurement of sensitivity to diverse genetic architectures. Attribution precision estimated specificity using an equal number of null decoy variants that preserved allele structure while disrupting genotype-phenotype correspondence. Stability was measured by the consistency of variant-level attributions across an ensemble of independently trained models. SmoothGrad increased average recall across effect types by approximately 0.16 at the top 1% of the most highly attributed variants and improved average precision by about 0.06 at the same threshold, while stability remained comparable with median relative standard deviations of 0.4 to 0.5 across methods. Among the evaluated attribution methods, Saliency achieved the highest composite score, indicating that its simple gradient formulation provided the best overall balance of recall, precision, and stability.

                <p>by Gaston Sivori, Tomoki Fukai</p>

One of the remarkable properties of cortical neurons is their innate ability to detect spike patterns in continuous but noisy information streams. As animals learn behaviorally relevant information quickly, pattern detection by neurons should also be rapid. However, how pattern-selective neuronal responses rapidly develop, tune, and remain robust has not been fully understood. Here, we propose a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule to learn patterned synaptic inputs rapidly. Our rule facilitates intracellular “self-supervised” learning of intermittently and repeatedly co-activated presynaptic-neuron communities, as in a machine-learning-based rule derived previously for temporal pattern segmentation. Importantly, this model proposes that a spike-triggered transient increase in somatodendritic coupling dramatically boosts the crediting of synapses responsible for the learned response. This boosting effect is essential for rapid pattern learning of single neurons at a high signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, we demonstrate in recurrent networks how the rule recruits pre-configured cell assemblies for even faster, few-shot learning of multiple patterns. Our results illuminate the self-supervisory role of backpropagating action potentials for rapid pattern learning.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision impairment, which significantly impacts working-class populations, necessitating accurate and early diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional DR classification relies on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models and extensive preprocessing. In this work, we propose a novel approach leveraging pre-trained models for feature extraction, followed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for refined embedding representation. The extracted feature vectors are structured as a graph, where GCN enhances embeddings before classification. The proposed model incorporates quality assessment by predicting a confidence score through a dedicated fully connected layer, trained to align with ground truth quality using binary cross-entropy loss. Uncertainty estimation is achieved by calculating the variance across multiple stochastic passes, providing a measure of the model’s prediction reliability. We evaluate the proposed DR detection approach on APTOS2019, Messidor-2, and EyePACS datasets, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Using MobileViT as the main feature extractor, we reached a remarkable 98.45% accuracy, 98.45% F1-Score, and 98.06% Kappa on the APTOS2019 dataset. The DenseNet-169 proved to be the best backbone of the pipeline for the Messidor-2 dataset, with an accuracy of 94.90%, F1-Score of 94.87%, and Kappa of 93.63%. Additionally, for external validation, the model demonstrated strong generalization capability on the EyePACS dataset, where DenseNet-169 achieved 97.38% accuracy, 97.37% F1-Score, and 96.72% Kappa, while MobileViT obtained 96.02% accuracy, 96.02% F1-Score, and 95.03% Kappa. Our innovative architecture incorporates uncertainty estimation and quality assessment techniques, enabling accurate confidence scores and enhancing the model’s reliability in clinical environments. Furthermore, to strengthen interpretability and facilitate clinical validation, Grad-CAM heatmaps were employed to demonstrate the significance of different input regions on the model’s predictions.

Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) are a significant source of adverse drug events and pose critical challenges to patient safety and clinical decision-making. Extracting DDIs from biomedical literature plays an essential role in pharmacovigilance, yet remains difficult due to data sparsity and high annotation costs. This study presents BioMCL-DDI, a novel few-shot learning framework that integrates meta-learning with contrastive embedding strategies to enable efficient DDI extraction under limited supervision. BioMCL-DDI jointly optimizes prototype-based classification and supervised contrastive representation learning within a unified architecture. The model captures both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, enhancing its generalization in sparse biomedical settings. We evaluate BioMCL-DDI on three benchmark datasets: DDI-2013, DrugBank, and the more recent TAC 2018 DDI Extraction corpus. The model achieves F1 scores of 87.80% on DDI-2013, 86.00% on DrugBank, and 74.85%/74.82% on the two official test sets of TAC 2018, consistently outperforming competitive baselines. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource scenarios. BioMCL-DDI provides a scalable and effective solution for DDI extraction from biomedical texts, with strong potential for integration into clinical decision support systems and biomedical knowledge bases. All our code and data have been publicly released at: https://github.com/Hero-Legend/BioMCL-DDI.

Cardiac fibrosis is a pathological condition associated with many cardiovascular diseases. Atrial fibrosis leads to reduced atrial function, resulting in diminished blood flow and an increased risk of stroke. This reduced function arises from altered myocardial electrophysiological and mechanical properties. Identifying the relative importance of these fibrosis-associated properties can reveal the most significant determinants of left atrial function impairment. In this study, we used a computational framework to investigate the relative importance of various fibrosis-associated properties. Our model, a 3D electromechanical framework coupled with a 0D circulatory model, incorporated patient-specific geometries and fibrosis distributions from clinical imaging data. Nine parameters related to fibrotic remodeling (conduction velocity, ion channel expression levels, cell- and tissue-scale contractility, and stiffness) were analyzed using two sensitivity analysis schemes: a one-factor-at-a-time setup, allowing for analysis of isolated effects, and a fractional factorial design, enabling examination of combined effects. As output, we tracked various metrics derived from model-predicted pressure-volume loops. Impairment of L-type calcium current (I<sub>CaL</sub>) was most detrimental (up to 64% reduction in A-loop area of the left atrial pressure-volume relationship, quantifying work performed during atrial contraction). Conversely, reduced inward rectifier current (I<sub>K1</sub>) led to improved atrial function (up to 27% increase in A-loop area). Detailed analysis of spatiotemporal distributions linked these effects to changes in intracellular calcium handling. Fractional factorial design analysis revealed that combination with other parameter changes blunted the impact of reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> but amplified the impact of reduced I<sub>K1</sub>. Future research focusing on I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub> could be highly significant for clinical and scientific advances. Modeling work can help evaluate left atrial function among larger patient cohorts, focusing on strain analysis. Our work could also be extended to spatiotemporal simulations of blood flow and thrombosis, shedding light onto the mechanisms underlying atriogenic stroke.

                <p>by Xinyu Wang, Huimin Liu, Xiaoman Wang, Ben Zhou, Haiqing Tang, Shanshan Pang</p>

Lysosomes are critical hubs for both cellular degradation and signal transduction, yet their function declines with age. Aging is also associated with significant changes in lysosomal morphology, but the physiological significance of these alterations remains poorly understood. Here, we find that a subset of aged lysosomes undergo enlargement resulting from lysosomal dysfunction in <i>C. elegans</i>. Importantly, this enlargement is not merely a passive consequence of functional decline but represents an active adaptive response to preserve lysosomal degradation capacity. Blocking lysosomal enlargement exacerbates the impaired degradation of dysfunctional lysosomes. Mechanistically, lysosomal enlargement is a transcriptionally regulated process governed by the longevity transcription factor SKN-1, which responds to lysosomal dysfunction by restricting fission and thereby induces lysosomal enlargement. Furthermore, in long-lived germline-deficient animals, SKN-1 activation induces lysosomal enlargement, thereby promoting lysosomal degradation and contributing to longevity. These findings unveil a morphological adaptation that safeguards lysosomal homeostasis, with potential relevance for lysosomal aging and life span.

                <p>by Marco N. Pompili, Ralitsa Todorova, Céline J. Boucly, Eulalie M. Leroux, Sidney I. Wiener, Michaël Zugaro</p>

Cell assemblies are considered fundamental units of brain activity, underlying diverse functions ranging from perception to memory and decision-making. Cell assemblies have generally been studied in relation to specific stimuli or actions, but this approach does not readily extend to more abstract constructs. An alternative approach is to assess cell assemblies without making reference to external variables, and instead focus on internal brain processes—by assessing assemblies by their endogenous ability to effectively elicit specific responses in downstream (“reader”) neurons. However, this compelling idea currently lacks experimental support. Here, we provide evidence for assembly–reader communication. Large-scale cross-structural recordings in rats revealed that reader activation was genuinely collective, functionally selective, yet flexible, implementing both pattern separation and completion. These processes occurred at the time scale of membrane integration, synaptic plasticity, and gamma oscillations. Finally, assembly–reader couplings were selectively modified upon associative learning, indicating that they were plastic and could become bound to behaviorally relevant variables. These results support cell assemblies as an endogenous mechanism for brain function.

                Background The ambitions to gain national rejuvenation and global power in 2049 are evident in the national strategy of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which was developed based on the vision of the Chinese dream and Chinese modernization. This approach combines economic growth, technological advancement, and military technology modernization in redefining the role of China in the international system. The dynamics are essential in assessing the emerging position of China in the global power systems and its effects on regional security, specifically in its association with the West and NATO. Methods The current research is a qualitative, theoretically-based study that relies on the power-transition theory, literature related to the security dilemma, and the notion of normative contestation. By tracing the process over four critical junctures (2008, 2013, 2017, 2019, and 2022) and comparatively systematizing information between current official PRC Defense White Papers and CCP policy documents, the role of NATO Strategic Concepts, and secondary academic literature, the study triangulates and analyzes information. Pattern matching and trend analysis are also supported by descriptive statistics of SIPRI (2023). Results The results indicate that the policy of China is a kind of selective revisionism that is aimed at attaining an influence on the world by integrating economically and institutionally, and confronting Western domination in governing rules. The combination of economic modernization, technological self-sufficiency, and military development in China changes the macro-level of power in the Indo-Pacific. The Taiwan issue comes out as the main security flash point, which increases the strategic competition between the West but also helps China to strengthen its deterrence posture. Empirical trends show that unequal interdependence remains at the moderating level of the risk of the direct clash between China and the states allied to NATO. Conclusions The multidimensional national strategy of China highlights the pragmatic strike between reform and revisionism. Its long-term prosperity requires that it can continue to be economically resilient, further its domestic reforms, and attain technological independence as it is able to cope with external threat perceptions. The changing politics surrounding the emergence of China also pose threats and opportunities to global stability, and cooperative mechanisms between China and the West can help alleviate security dilemmas and deliver a more inclusive global order.

                Background We aimed to assess perception of clinical learning (CL) Environment, measure motivation for CL among FMS (Faculty of Medicine of Sousse) students’ and to find its associated factors. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in the FMS, among undergraduate medical students from October to November 2022 using a self-administered questionnaire. We determined the students’ perception of CLE and used the Motivation section of the French version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), to measure motivation for CL. Results We gathered 169 students’ responses with mean age:22.34 ± 1.2 years. Motivation global score was medium (4.66±0.9). The subscale "self-efficacy for learning and performance" had the highest score of 4.95± 1.17. Higher scores of ‘intrinsic goal orientation’, ‘task value’, and ‘self-efficacy for learning and performance’ are significantly associated with excellent clinical learning evaluation. Students who perceived that supervisors are always for them, had higher motivation scores on the task value (p<10−3), control beliefs (p=0.005), and self-efficacy for learning subscales. Conclusions Additional research involving all four Tunisian medical faculties, multiple centers, and a larger sample size is necessary to thoroughly explore medical student motivation at a national level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1364/v1?src=rss">A Comparative Analysis of Press Freedom in India and Adjacent Democracies: Special Focus on Norway, India and North Korea [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Press freedom has been used worldwide as a foundation for a healthy democracy that enables citizens to access information, hold leaders accountable and participate meaningfully in public life. However, reality of media independence varies country wise depending upon various external factors and shaped by legal protections, political systems and the broader social environment to a great extent. This comparative view at India, Norway and North Korea highlights spectrum of press freedom throughout the world. Government transparency, strong legal protections and a diverse media landscape has helped create Norway one of the worlds most open environments for journalism whereas India faces growing challenges while being rooted in democratic ideals and constitutional guarantee for free speech. A noticeable decline in press freedom raises concerns about future of accountability and open debate, majorly due to factors like restrictive laws, Increased government oversight and threats to journalists. Representing an extremely opposite side is North Korea, where the state controls all information and independent journalism is nonexistence. Thus, this research adopts a comparative research approach, examining the political and institutional factors alongside other factors that impact press conditions in these three nations. Free media play a crucial role in exposing corruption and ensuring that governments remain answerable to its citizens. On the other hand, when governments interfere with the press or use subtle and overt means to limit its independence, democratic values and public trust suffer. For countries like India, the path forward involves reducing political interference, strengthening legal protections for journalists and promoting transparency. These steps are essential for aligning country’s democratic aspirations with reality of media independence. Ultimately, the health of a democracy can often be measured by freedom of its press which is a reminder that protecting journalists and supporting independent media is vital for any society that values openness and accountability.

                Background The Banach fixed point theory stated that a mapping T: X→X always has a unique fixed point in X. After witnessing the implementations of this theory in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were carried out. Therefore, fixed point theory has been developed and diversified to encompass various extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics, and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Various vital concepts such as ( D d ∗ -Symmetric and weakly compatible maps) that are needed in the sequel, which will help us in the outcomes that follow and play a major role in verifying our major outcomes. The major objective of the present study is to investigate and verify the uniqueness of some common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced categories of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. Our first main outcomes were established by applying the concepts of weak compatibility and common limit in the range property, whereas we obtained our second major results by utilizing the notion of occasionally weakly compatible (Concisely, O.W.C) maps that are more general than weakly compatible. Additionally, various common fixed point outcomes for the two pairs of self-maps were determined. Conclusion Our main results in this manuscript have been explored novel various outcomes related to the uniqueness of various common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced types of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. We anticipate that the discoveries in this manuscript will aid scientists in enhancing the authors on popularized extended symmetric-spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementation in each advanced branches of science.

                Advancements in the biological sciences have made it possible to manipulate life forms in unprecedented ways.. This activity, like working with pathogenic natural organisms is intrinsically dangerous. For this reason, countries have promoted the building of High Safety and High Containment Laboratories, classified as Biological Safety Levels 3 and 4. In this article I briefly summarize the major features of these laboratories, and exemplify some of the research that they host. I then highlight the possible dangers, and argue for the opportunity of a reduction of possibly dangerous research. I argue for more transparency and openness about activities that imply risks not only for those involved, but for human and environmental health as well.

                Background The aging population worldwide has led to increased attention toward ensuring a good quality of life (QoL) among the elderly, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities. This study aims to identify the determinants of quality of life among elderly residents in a social care center in West Jakarta. Method This quantitative study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design involving 288 elderly residents from a social care center. Data were collected using structured questionnaires measuring sleep behavior, medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, physical activity, and QoL. Results The results indicated that sleep behavior was significantly associated with QoL (p = 0.002), whereas no statistically significant associations were found between QoL and other variables, including medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, and physical activity. Conclusion Sleep quality is a significant determinant of QoL among institutionalized elderly individuals. These findings suggest that sleep behavior should be prioritized in care strategies to improve the quality of life of elderly residents in long-term care.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70053?af=R">The Visual Umwelt of primates and Hippocampal Representations of Space</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evolution sculpts the brain's sensory adaptations. Because these adaptations differ markedly across species, it is challenging for humans to fully comprehend how other animals perceive the world. For a nocturnal mouse, the subjective sensory world—its <i>Umwelt</i>—is dominated by odors, sounds, and textures, with visual input playing a secondary role. In contrast, the Umwelt of a diurnal primate is primarily visual, composed of colors, shapes, and hues, with less emphasis on olfaction, audition, or tactile cues. In mice and rats, hippocampal place cells are activated when the animal occupies specific locations in allocentric space. In contrast, studies in primates have identified hippocampal view cells, which respond when head-gaze is directed toward certain regions of visual space. The source of this divergence can be traced back to the evolution of mammalian species. Early mammals adapted to nocturnal environments to avoid predation by dinosaurs, becoming heavily dependent on olfaction, audition, touch, proprioception, and vestibular signals for perceiving changes in the environment, while regressing vision. However, one group of mammals started evolving stereoscopic foveal vision to capture insects and fruit in the arboreal environment. Following the mass extinction of dinosaurs, these primate ancestors transitioned to a diurnal niche, re-inventing color vision, which became their superpower. Stereo high-resolution color vision enabled primates to locate distant objects and landmarks efficiently, optimizing foraging while minimizing energy expenditure during navigation. The primate hippocampus then evolved to prioritize representations of visual scenes that support landmark-based navigation.</p>

                Background Research comparing inclusive education implementation in non-Western contexts, such as Indonesia and Oman, remains limited. Both countries share cultural similarities yet differ significantly in their education governance. Understanding these differences is crucial for improving inclusive education policies and practices. Methods This study employed qualitative document analysis, reviewing 33 policy and implementation documents from Indonesia and Oman. The analysis focused on five dimensions: service models, teacher training, curriculum adaptation, community involvement, and cultural attitudes. Results and Conclusions Findings reveal that Oman’s centralized system provides consistent policy coordination but limits community participation and school flexibility. Indonesia’s decentralized system allows greater local innovation and community involvement but leads to disparities in implementation quality. Both countries struggle with teacher training, curriculum adaptation, and cultural stigma against disabilities. Effective inclusive education requires a balanced approach combining adaptive centralization and equitable decentralization, ongoing teacher development, flexible curricula, active community engagement, and cultural transformation. These insights offer practical recommendations to strengthen inclusive education in diverse socio-political contexts.

                The digital revolution is transforming the face of medical education as Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become major factors in driving innovation. The use of digital platforms and immersive simulation systems trained with AI have been on the rise making learning more accessible, efficient and personalized. This review presents the current literature on the integration of IT/AI and medical education based on reviews, empirical investigations, and the opinions of the experts. Key areas of focus are e-learning and blended learning platforms, virtual and augmented reality simulations, intelligent tutoring systems, AI-based curriculum development, and AI-based assessment generation and grading. Evidence shows that these tools increase knowledge retention, encourage clinical reasoning, and provide safe environments for skills acquisition. The use of AI applications such as adaptive learning and automated testing helps to develop individualized learning which can be customized to the needs of individual learners. Using deep learning models to synthesize realistic virtual patients can foster communication skills and streamline feedback. Challenges for the widespread adoption of AI applications exist such as high implementation costs, faculty preparedness, data privacy, learner misuse, algorithm biases and unequal access. At the same time, there is growing appreciation for the importance of curriculum changes that incorporate AI literacy and digital skills in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical training. Future directions are also highlighted, such as teaching AI literacy as part of medical curricula, using AI-driven mixed reality simulations, developing an interdisciplinary collaboration to support responsible AI adoption, and developing standards to support the seamless integration between IT and AI systems. By providing a synthesis of evidence around currently available technologies, this review offers an understanding of the nature and impact of IT/AI on medical education, which may guide those preparing the next generation of healthcare professionals for an increasingly digital clinical world.

<p>Using projection- and layer-specific rabies tracing, we mapped brain-wide inputs to multiple feedforward and feedback neuron types in VISl (LM), the mouse secondary visual cortex. Although input patterns were broadly similar across neuron types, we observed differences in the relative contributions of visual, retrosplenial, and auditory cortices.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) cortico-cortical neurons are distinct yet spatially intermingled subtypes distributed across cortical layers, playing specialized roles in sensory and cognitive processing. However, whether their presynaptic inputs differ to support these functions remains unknown. Using projection- and layer-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing, we mapped brain-wide long-distance inputs to multiple FF and FB neuron types in VISl (also known as LM), the mouse secondary visual cortex. Overall, long-distance input patterns for these FF and FB neurons were largely similar, as all received the majority of their inputs from VISp, the primary visual cortex, along with substantial inputs from various other cortical and visual thalamic regions. Despite their similarities, these FF and FB types differed in the proportion of long-distance cortical inputs originating from specific visual, retrosplenial, and auditory cortices. These findings reveal the input connectivity patterns of cortico-cortical neurons based on FF and FB projections, providing an anatomical framework for future studies on their functions and circuit integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107947">Characterisation of cell-scale signalling by the core planar polarity pathway during Drosophila wing development</a></h4>

              
                In developing epithelia, cells become planar polarised through asymmetric localisation of the core planar polarity proteins to opposite cell membranes, where they form stable intercellular complexes. Current models differ regarding the signalling mechanisms required for core protein polarisation. Here, we investigate the existence of cell-intrinsic cell-scale signalling in vivo in the <i>Drosophila</i> pupal wing. We use conditional and restrictive expression tools to spatiotemporally manipulate core protein activity, combined with quantitative measurement of core protein distribution, polarity, and stability. Our results provide evidence for a robust cell-scale signal, while arguing against mechanisms that depend on depletion of a limited pool of a core protein or polarised transport of core proteins on microtubules. Furthermore, we show that polarity propagation across a tissue is hard, highlighting the strong intrinsic capacity of individual cells to establish and maintain planar polarity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89908">Neural correlates and reinstatement of recent and remote memory in children and young adults</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation tends to be less robust in childhood than adulthood. However, little is known about the corresponding functional differences in the developing brain that may underlie age-related differences in retention of memories over time. This study examined system-level memory consolidation of object-scene associations after learning (immediate delay), one night of sleep (short delay), as well as 2 weeks (long delay) in 5- to 7-year-old children (n=49) and in young adults (n=39), as a reference group with mature consolidation systems. Particularly, we characterized how functional neural activation and reinstatement of neural patterns change over time, assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with representational similarity analysis (RSA). Our results showed that memory consolidation in children was less robust and strong (i.e. more forgetting) compared to young adults. Contrasting correctly retained remote vs. recent memories across time delay, children showed less upregulation in posterior parahippocampal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum than adults. In addition, both children and adults showed a decrease in scene-specific neural reinstatement over time, indicating time-related decay of detailed differentiated memories. At the same time, we observed the emergence of generic gist-like neural representations in prefrontal brain regions uniquely in children, indicating qualitative difference in memory trace in children. Taken together, 5- to 7-year-old children, compared to young adults, show less robust memory consolidation, possibly due to difficulties in engaging in differentiated neural representations in neocortical mnemonic regions during retrieval of remote memories, coupled with relying more on gist-like generic neural representations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89189">Sex differences in BNST signaling and BNST CRF in fear processing</a></h4>

              
                Fear responses to perceived danger are critical for survival, as they prompt the individual to respond to threats and avoid harm. However, excessive fear can impede normal biological processes and become harmful. This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying two distinct forms of fear—phasic and sustained—in male and female mice, with a focus on the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling. Phasic fear is characterized by immediate responses to clear threats, while sustained fear is driven by ambiguous or uncertain cues and persists longer. Using rodent models, we found that sustained fear, modeled by partial fear conditioning, induced greater arousal and BNST activity in males, especially during ambiguous threat cues. In contrast, females exhibited reduced BNST and BNST<sup>CRF</sup> activity, highlighting significant sex differences in fear learning and expression. Additionally, CRF is crucial for appropriate fear response in females, as CRF knockdown led to increased fear responses, but had no effect in males. These sex-specific differences could help inform the development of targeted treatments for anxiety and trauma-related disorders, which disproportionately affect women.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106597">Trained immunity and immune priming in plants and invertebrates</a></h4>

              
                Immune memory has long been thought to be restricted to the adaptive immune system of vertebrates. However, several lines of evidence have changed our understanding of immune memory and have shattered the strict separation between innate and adaptive immunity. In vertebrates, a form of innate immunity that is called ‘trained immunity’ has been intensively studied for over a decade. For more than two decades, studies in plants and an increasing number of invertebrate taxa have clearly demonstrated that these organisms also possess immune memory, despite the absence of an adaptive immune system. These phenomena are mostly known as ‘immune priming’. The mechanistic underpinnings of immune priming vary across taxa and may or may not partially include the epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms involved in trained immunity. Here, we offer an evolutionary perspective on immune priming, uniquely integrating key aspects across plants and invertebrates for the first time. As a basis, we provide a conceptual clarification regarding the terms trained immunity and immune priming and give a brief overview of these phenomena across taxa. We then analyze which processes of immune priming share potentially evolutionary conserved epigenetic and metabolic processes with trained immunity and explore signaling processes involved in immune priming. We discuss the aspect of specificity as one of the key defining criteria for immune memory and incorporate the potential role of soil and gut microbiota for acquiring innate immune memory in plants and invertebrates. Finally, we argue that immune priming has enormous potential for application beyond the medical field when involving the protection against parasites and pathogens in agriculture and aquaculture.

">Microglia-astrocyte interaction underlies aquaporin-4 dysregulation in the mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Brain water homeostasis relies on the coordinated actions of glial cells. In particular, astrocytes play an essential role in facilitating perivascular water exchange between cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid through aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel highly concentrated at astrocytic endfeet. Dysregulation of AQP4 localization is implicated in various neuropathologies, but its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Although astrocytes and microglia both express {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-AdRs), whether {beta}-AdR signaling modulates astrocytic AQP4 polarization through microglial activation has not yet been investigated. Here, we hypothesized that microglial activation mediates the {beta}-AdR-induced loss of astrocytic AQP4 polarization. To test this hypothesis, we topically applied the {beta}-AdR agonist, isoproterenol, to the primary visual cortex of anesthetized mice and evaluated AQP4 polarization using double immunohistochemistry. Acute {beta}-AdR activation (3 h) significantly reduced perivascular AQP4 polarization and enhanced local microglial reactivity. Both pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity with minocycline and microglial depletion via dietary administration of the CSF1R antagonist, PLX5622, prevented AQP4 dysregulation induced by isoproterenol. These findings demonstrate that microglial activation is required for {beta}-AdR agonist-induced AQP4 dysregulation in the mouse cortex, revealing a previously unrecognized microglia-astrocyte interaction linking adrenergic signaling to glial water homeostasis.

">Astrocytic FKBP5 Regulates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Outcomes in Excitotoxic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51, encoded by FKBP5) is a multisignaling cochaperone that regulates cellular responses to stress. FKBP51 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes; however, the role of FKBP51 in excitotoxic brain injury remains unknown. Here, we investigated how both global and astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 deletion influence seizure susceptibility, astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and cognition in male mice subjected to a kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy mouse model. Global Fkbp5 knockout (Fkbp5-KO) presented lower seizure activity along with decreased neuronal loss and astrogliosis in the hippocampus compared with the wild-type mice. Astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 conditional knockout (aFkbp5-cKO) mice similarly attenuated seizure severity, decreased astrogliosis, improved novel object recognition, and preserved glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression in hippocampal CA3. Glia-neuron mixed cultures derived from Fkbp5-KO brains showed reduction of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, astrogliosis, accompanied by decreased NF-{kappa}B p65 phosphorylation. Notably, overexpression of an Fkbp5 quadruple mutant that disrupts the FKBP51-NF-{kappa}B interaction inhibited proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced astrogliosis and NF-{kappa}B activation. The hippocampal transcriptome of the LPS-treated Fkbp5-KO mice revealed suppression of NF-{kappa}B signaling. In summary, this study highlights FKBP51 as a key mediator of excitotoxin-induced neuroinflammation and GLT-1 dysfunction and underlines NF-{kappa}B-mediated inflammatory astrogliosis as a potential intervention target for excitotoxic brain injury.

">Functional Connectivity Graph Theory Analysis of Spoken Word Processing Efficiency in Prefrontal Cortical Activation</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and graph theory analysis of functional connectivity measures derived from hemodynamic changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can characterize spoken word processing efficiency in neurotypical listeners. Individual differences were assessed by identifying a low performing (Low-P) and a high performing (High-P) individual. Network science and psycholinguistic models of spoken word recognition predict that word frequency and sublexical phonotactic probability of the word form affects the cognitive processing effort. This novel study assesses predictors of processing efficiency directly using functional connectivity measures of global efficiency, local efficiency, modularity, and hubness, derived from listener's frontal lobe hemodynamic response function during a verbal working memory task. Method: A total of 20 neurologically typical participants (ages 18-21) completed an auditory working memory task where participants were required to hold words differing word frequency and sub lexical phonotactic probability in memory. Changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin concentration were recorded with a continuous-wave, multi-channel fNIRS system (TechEn, Inc., Milford, MA) using a 20-channel optode montage across the prefrontal cortex. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between each channel pair to produce 20x20 functional connectivity matrices. Frontal networks were constructed as a graph where nodes in the graph are the light source and edges are connections (e.g., channels) between nodes. Functional connectivity strength and graph theory measures were examined. Results: LF and HF words were not processed differently at the behavioral or brain level. Task performance regardless of word frequency was related to brain measures, with higher strength of prefrontal FC relating of worse accuracy (d-prime) regardless of task block, and with high modularity correlating with slow response times on the LF task, measured by HbR signal. Higher efficiencies tended to correspond to better accuracy but none of the tests were significant. High-P showed low FC strength and high efficiency relative to others, while Low-P had high modularity and low efficiency, in line with the direction of the brain-behavior correlations. Lastly, we characterized the centrally important regions (hubs). These tended to be located in the left inferior area. High-P's hubs overlapped with those showing consistent hubs behavior at the group level, while Low-P's hubs were uncommon. Conclusions: We identified network properties related to efficient and inefficient language processing in typical participants, which can be used to assess language function of atypical populations in future studies.

">Therapeutic Potential of Flavonoids and Rutin Against Inflammation on a Huntington Animal Model</a></h4>

              
                This study tested the hypothesis that flavonoids (diosmine, hesperidin and rutin(R)) play a protective role in the brain and duodenum against 3-NPA's free radical induced inflammation. This was achieved by measuring the levels of GABA, 5-HIAA, dopamine and some inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Male young Wistar rats (weight 60g) received Salmonella thyphimurium ATCC14028 1x106 CFU/g every week, for two consecutive weeks, plus the following treatments: group A, 9% NaCl 0. (Control); group B, diomine (300mg) + hesperidin (33.3g) + rutin (150mg/kg); group C, 3-NPA; group D, 3-NPA + mix of flavonoids with 1ml of rutin(R) per rat. 3-NPA administration was at 24mg/kgW by intraperitoneal route and the flavonoids were orally administered at every 48 hours for 15 days. At the moment of euthanasia, the blood was obtained to assess Interleukine-6, glucose, triglycerides and hemoglobin levels. Brain and duodenum were obtained to measure GABA, dopamine, 5-HIAA, lipoperoxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), total ATPase concentrations and catalase activity using validated methods. The brains, stomach and duodenum were dissected for histological analysis. In group A, there is a decrease in interleukine-6 levels (p=0.009). In the cortex region of animals in group C, dopamine experienced a significant decrease (p=0.012). GABA increased (p=0.001) in cerebellum regions of animals in the groups A, B and C. ATPase activity increased (p = 0.013) in cerebellum regions in animals of groups C and D. Lipoperoxidation diminished (p=0.043) in cerebellum region of group D. Catalase activity diminished (p=0.043) in Cortex region of animals in groups B and D, and (p=0.002) in cerebellum region of animals in groups A and B. Besides, histological changes revealed marked lesions of neuronal cells in experimental animals treated with nitro propionic acid. The protective role of flavonoids and rutin compounds on inhibition of the inflammatory response and correction of the fundamental oxidant/antioxidant imbalance in animals suffering from Huntington diseases are important vistas for further research.

                We generated a multi-region, subcellular-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the human basal ganglia by integrating MERFISH+ and Stereo-seq across four neurotypical donors. These datasets profiled ~7 million cells spanning the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus, resolving 60 transcriptionally distinct cell types. We show region-selective, molecular and spatial diversification of medium-spiny-neuron cell types and multiple non-neuronal populations with distinct molecular identities and spatial localizations. Subcellular RNA localization captures somatic size and projection-inferred signatures that reflect direct and indirect pathway topology. Cellular community analyses reveal the enrichment of sub-clusters of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes at striosome-matrix borders, while primate-expanded interneurons are confined to matrix territories. Cross-species mapping uncovers orthologous striosome-matrix organization and conserved dorsolateral-ventromedial gene expression gradients. This atlas provides a foundational molecular and spatial framework for studying human basal ganglia architecture, offering a multi-centimeter scale resource that links cell types, spatial architecture, and subcellular transcript topography across multiple nuclei.

">Synthetic modulation of brain-wide anesthesia-activated neural ensembles using a transgenic mouse system</a></h4>

              
                Anesthetics are commonly used to produce unconsciousness, but the neural substrates of unconsciousness remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that general anesthesia works by targeting discrete cell types and neural circuits distributed brain-wide, rather than non-specific binding, using a mouse transgenic system. We take advantage of a mouse that expresses chemogenetic designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADDs) in an inducible Cre-dependent manner driven by Fos immediate early gene expression. Since Fos expression peaks with metabolic activity, we use this system to insert synthetic DREADDs into brain-wide neurons that are active under isoflurane anesthesia. We then test the behavioral consequences of chemogenetic stimulation of anesthesia-activated neural ensembles. We observe immobility, discoordination, anti-nociception, and significantly increased anesthetic sensitivity, but not a loss of consciousness as measured by the righting reflex. We next describe brain-wide expression of the captured neurons across the intact mouse brain using iDisco+ whole brain clearing and light sheet microscopy, revealing unique morphological characteristics of sparse, spatially distributed cells. This provides a brain-wide morphologic map with detailed neurite labeling of anesthesia-activated neurons at cellular resolution as a technical resource for the field.

                Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 (CLN7) is a devastating paediatric neurodegenerative disorder with no cure and limited natural history data to guide therapeutic development. Here, we present the first multimodal characterization of prodromal and early-stage CLN7 disease in Japanese macaques carrying a spontaneous CLN7-/- mutation. Using structural T2-weighted MRI for volumetry, [18F]FDG PET for glucose metabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET for neuroinflammation, we observed region-dependent patterns in volumetric, molecular, and metabolic alterations. MRI confirmed the presence of disease-associated atrophy in many cortical and subcortical brain regions, consistent with human pathology, [18F]FDG PET revealed early cortical and subcortical widespread hypometabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET imaging detected progressive neuroinflammation in the same brain areas. CSF analyses further showed age-dependent increases in neurofilament light (NfL), providing convergent evidence for neurodegeneration. Together, these results define a prodromal trajectory in CLN7 disease , establish sensitive imaging and fluid biomarkers, and validate the macaque model as a powerful platform for testing interventions.

">Cognitive impairment and progressive neuroinflammation in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice expressing the R245H Sgsh variant</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome) is an inherited childhood-onset dementia caused by insufficient SGSH enzymatic activity and subsequent accumulation of partially degraded heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. One of the most prevalent mutations is the Arg245His variant, representing up to 58% of mutations in some populations. Whilst other mouse models exist, their applicability to, and translational delivery of, clinically relevant pharmacological chaperones is limited. We therefore aimed to generate and characterise a novel SgshR245H knock-in mouse model of MPS IIIA. Methods: CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing introduced the SgshR245H mutation, and a breeding colony was established. Mouse behaviour was evaluated in a test battery; SGSH activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured using fluorometric and mass spectrometric assays, respectively; and histological staining was undertaken to characterise brain pathology. Results: Spatial memory and learning deficits were apparent in the Morris Water Maze probe and Y-maze tests. Elevated Plus Maze exploration revealed reduced anxiety-like behaviours. SgshR245H mice exhibited progressive accumulation of brain heparan sulfate and elevated levels of GFAP-reactive astroglial staining and activated microglia. Conclusion: SgshR245H MPS IIIA mice recapitulate key characteristics of the human disorder, representing a useful tool for studying disease pathogenesis and evaluating novel therapies.

">Lemborexant Reduces Infarct Volume and Improves Long-Term Functional Recovery in a Murine Model of Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Recovery following ischemic stroke is highly variable and often incomplete, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel targeted poststroke treatments. While the mechanisms underlying poststroke recovery remain incompletely understood, sleep fragmentation, a common consequence of stroke, has been linked to worse patient outcomes. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by suppressing wakefulness and enhancing sleep continuity. We hypothesized that lemborexant would reduce poststroke sleep disturbances and promote recovery in a rodent model of stroke. Methods: We examined the effects of lemborexant (10mg/kg and 30mg/kg) and zolpidem (30 mg/kg) on sleep macrostructure, fragmentation, and EEG spectra in both healthy mice and in stroke model mice, which underwent photothrombotic ischemia of the forelimb somatosensory cortex. We also evaluated whether 12 days of drug administration altered infarct volume and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice. Results: Lemborexant treatment (30mg/kg) increased the percentage of NREM sleep, while preserving sleep continuity, in both healthy and stroke model mice. In contrast, zolpidem increased NREM sleep after stroke, but also increased sleep fragmentation in both groups. Lemborexant treatment at 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg significantly reduced infarct volume eight weeks after the induction of stroke. In addition, lemborexant-treated mice showed greater use of the impaired limb four weeks after stroke. Interpretation: These preclinical findings suggest that lemborexant stabilizes sleep and promotes structural and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention following ischemic stroke.

">Attention modulates hippocampal sharp-wave ripples in humans</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are high-frequency events critical for memory consolidation, typically studied during sleep and quiet wakefulness. Emerging evidence suggests that SWRs also occur during active behavior, yet their role in awake cognition remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that changes in sustained attention modulate both the occurrence of SWRs and their temporal alignment to ongoing hippocampal oscillations. Using intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients performing a sustained attention to response task (SART), we first identified attentional states based on behavioral variability and subjective reports. Next, we observed that SWRs were more frequent during high-attention periods, despite the absence of memory demands. Importantly, SWRs during low-attention periods showed higher phase synchrony with low-frequency oscillations (theta to lower beta) indicating increased endogenous coordination of SWRs under low attentional focus. These findings show that SWRs are dynamically regulated by attentional engagement, supporting a broader role for ripples in active cognitive processing.

">A dataset of differentiable biologically-derived single neuron models</a></h4>

              
                Biological neural networks contain diverse cell types with heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) model computational aspects of biology but use homogeneous neurons, limiting realism. A key obstacle to building bio-inspired ANNs is the absence of a database of neuron models that both fit biological data and remain differentiable for gradient-based learning. We present such a database: over 1,000 differentiable single-neuron firing-rate models with accompanying PyTorch code for integration with machine learning. The models belong to the linear-nonlinear (LN) class, which, for ease of reference, we term Generalized Firing Rate (GFR) neurons. Each GFR neuron uses input and firing-rate history filters across multiple timescales, followed by a nonlinearity to generate firing rates. Models are fit to patch-clamp recordings from mouse and human central nervous system slices. Parameter clustering reflects electrophysiological diversity and partially aligns with transgenic lines. This resource will enable development of bio-inspired ANNs built from biologically grounded, differentiable single-neuron models.

">The language network responds robustly to sentences across diverse tasks</a></h4>

              
                A network of left frontal and temporal brain areas supports language comprehension and production, implementing computations related to word retrieval and combinatorial linguistic processing. Here, we ask: are computations over linguistic input driven in a bottom-up way, by the input, or in a top-down way, by task demands? Participants (n=52) read sentences and nonword lists under six task conditions, including passive reading, reading with a memory probe at the end, and tasks that require deep semantic engagement. The sentences>nonwords contrast isolated the same set of language-responsive voxels across all tasks; the locations of those voxels were participant-specific, highlighting the value of individual-specific functional localization. We therefore conclude that language localization is robust to task variation. We then examined responses to each task in these language-responsive voxels (the language network) and in the domain-general multiple demand (MD) network, known to respond to task demands. The language network responded robustly to sentences across all tasks, with somewhat higher responses to semantically engaging tasks. In contrast, the MD network responded to both sentences and nonwords in the presence of a demanding task, which warrants caution when examining brain responses to language tasks accompanied by task demands, as such tasks engage two independent systems. A multivariate analysis revealed that stimulus information is more easily decodable in the language network, whereas task information is more decodable in the MD network. These results suggest that the language and MD networks perform complementary functions during task-driven language comprehension, with the language network primarily extracting information from linguistic input and the MD network determining the appropriate response to the task.

">Vagal volume receptors in the heart compensate for blood loss and posture change</a></h4>

              
                Cranial nerves densely innervate the heart and vasculature, with sensory neurons reporting on blood pressure, respiratory gases, and tissue damage. The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here, we use genetic tools for isolated study of vagal mechanoreceptors in the heart, finding that they are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and play key roles in compensating for decreased filling of the heart that occurs in an upright posture and during hemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart and display blood volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout eliminates heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, and compromises carotid blood pressure when mice on a tilt-table are rotated to an upright position. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout mice also display a lethal failure to sustain blood pressure during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate an essential function for vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors in sustaining the constancy of blood circulation.

">Cannabidiol Reduces D1 and D2 Medium Spiny Neuron Excitability in the Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid constituent of the cannabis plant that shows promise for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region in the etiologies of these disorders and is actively modulated by CBD. Prior research has established that CBD alters the molecular composition of the NAc, but none have assessed how CBD affects NAc neuronal function. In this study, we demonstrate that CBD significantly decreases D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron membrane excitability, broadens action potentials, and has no effect on spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAc core. These data enhance our understanding of CBDs physiological effects and provide mechanistic insight into its therapeutic potential.

">FDTest: Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a Test for Memory Effects in Brain Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A central challenge in neuroscience is to understand how the brain flexibly balances local and distributed information processing to support diverse cognitive and conscious states. We hypothesize that a key signature of this balance is the presence of memory effects, which arise when a brain region's future activity depends not only on its current state, but also on past information fed back from the wider network. Here we introduce the FDTest, a method for assessing local memory effects in multidimensional systems by measuring violations of a generalized Fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We first apply this framework to whole-brain models fitted to human neuroimaging data, showing that the brain's memory structure reflects its underlying connectivity. We then extend the analysis to individualized models of subjects during wakefulness and deep sleep. Memory effects are consistently stronger in wakefulness, indicating richer inter-regional dependencies and more integrated dynamics. These findings establish local memory as a dynamical marker of brain state and position the FDTest as a principled tool for probing the hidden structure of neural dynamics in both models and experiments.

">Long-lasting structural and functional maturation in transplanted human neurons reprogrammed from glial progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Direct reprogramming of brain-resident glial progenitor cells (GPCs) into induced neurons (iN) shows great promise for future regenerative therapies for brain diseases. This type of cell conversion is facilitated by introducing lineage-specific transcription factors or small molecules to somatic cells, and can even be achieve in vivo, targeting resident glia cells in the brain for in vivo conversion. While this have shown promising results in animal models, a crucial step is to show the long-term survival and maturation of human reprogrammed cells in vivo. However, this remains largely unexplored partly due to the inaccessible cell source of GPC and difficulty in transplanting converted neurons. In this study, we assessed human GPCs derived iNs for their long-term structural and functional neuronal maturation after transplantation to the immunodeficient mouse brain. GPCs were transduced with established transcription factor cocktail and transplanted to the medial prefrontal cortex as three-dimensional cultures to improve survival and integration upon transplantation. Our results reveal survival of hiNs, for up to 10 months post-transplantation (MPT) and wide distribution across local and proximal functionally connected brain regions. Morphological analysis revealed a gradual neuronal maturation over time, characterized by increase in cellular complexity and expression of neuronal markers. Supporting these findings, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated progressive functional maturation up to 5 MPT with increase in sodium and potassium currents, and the ability to generate multiple evoked and spontaneous action potentials, validating a neuronal phenotype. Importantly, these changes were absent in control grafts of non-converted hGPCs that retained their glia identity. Our findings indicate that hGPCs derived iNs maintain a stable neuronal phenotype that persist in the mouse brain for extended periods. These cells exhibit survival and remarkable adaptability to the host environment, enabling both structural and functional maturation over time. These results highlight their potential as a promising strategy for neural replacement therapies aimed at restoring damaged circuits and promoting brain repair.

">Novel Cln8 p.R24G mouse line replicates major clinical features of Northern epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Rationale. Northern epilepsy belongs to a group of genetically diverse lysosomal storage diseases, the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). A characteristic feature of NCL pathology is the accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin in the central nervous system. Northern epilepsy is a late-infantile -onset disease. Patients develop normally until 5-10 years old when they first present with general tonic-clonic seizures, followed by progressive cognitive impairment and a decline in motor skills. Northern epilepsy is caused by a missense variant in CLN8, causing a p.R24G amino acid substitution. CLN8 deficiency has been studied traditionally using motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice, which carry a spontaneous frame shift variant in the murine orthologue Cln8, which is not known to exist in humans. Methods. We have generated the first Cln8 p.R24G mouse model (Cln8R24G) using CRISPR/Cas9. Phenotyping analysis of the mice was conducted using behavioral and histopathological studies focusing on the brain and retina. Results. At birth, Cln8R24G KI mice were viable and asymptomatic. As the mice aged, a progressive accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin containing the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit C was evident in different brain regions and retinal layers. Health monitoring revealed that mutant mice developed progressive but mild motor symptoms around 7 months of age. Spontaneous epileptic seizures, like those observed in Northern epilepsy patients, were detected and recorded. An increase in FosB staining intensity, reflecting neuronal hyperactivity, was observed in hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule cells and correlated well with the intensity of seizure activity. Neuroinflammation was evident at 4 months and increased dramatically with age, mainly in the thalamic VPN/VPL nuclei and moderately in the cortex. Neurodegeneration was most prominent in the VPN/VPL thalamic nuclei. Conclusions. We have generated the Cln8R24G mouse model that genocopies, for the first time, the pathogenic CLN8 variant present in patients with Northern epilepsy. These mice phenocopy major clinical features of the human disease, including mild motor impairment and, unlike the mnd mice, spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We hypothesize that our mouse model will open new possibilities for developing and testing targeted treatment options for Northern epilepsy and, more broadly, for early-onset neurodegenerative disorders associated with epilepsy.

">Locus coeruleus degeneration is associated with cortical tau deposition and cognitive decline in older adults at familial risk of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION The locus coeruleus (LC) is among the first sites of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may seed neocortical tau. METHODS We used longitudinal neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to assess LC integrity in vivo in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired older adults with familial risk of AD in relation to tau and amyloid PET and long-term cognitive trajectories. RESULTS We showed that both LC integrity at baseline and its rate of degeneration over time independently predicted a neocortical pattern of tau deposition. In keeping with the known function of the LC, neuropsychological tests showed that LC integrity at baseline predicted changes in attention. Finally, we found that longitudinal LC degeneration correlated with memory decline in people with elevated neocortical amyloid burden. DISCUSSION Our findings underscore the importance of LC in AD pathogenesis. Longitudinal measurement of LC degeneration may help distinguish trajectories of age-related cognitive decline and early AD.

">Distinct Cortical and Oculomotor Dynamics During Endogenous and Exogenous Competition in Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) enables the temporary maintenance of information for guiding thought and action, but its limited capacity requires internal selective attention mechanisms to prioritize goal-relevant representations. Like external attention, internal selection can be shaped by both endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (stimulus-driven) factors. Classic work by Charles Folk and Roger Remington demonstrated that such factors interact competitively during external attention, producing stimulus-driven capture under certain conditions. Whether similar competitive dynamics govern internal selection remains unclear. Here, we combined EEG and eye-tracking to examine how endogenous and exogenous influences interact during the selection of information held in working memory. Participants remembered two oriented bars and used either a pro-cue or an anti-cue to guide recall. Behavioral responses and lateralized alpha-band activity revealed robust delays in selecting task-relevant WM content under competition. In contrast, oculomotor biases toward memorized locations emerged with similar timing across pro- and anti-cue conditions, providing no evidence for retro-capture or delayed selection. These findings indicate that internal selection does not resolve competition via rapid capture, as in external attention, but through time-extended cortical processes. Our results highlight functional dissociations between cortical and oculomotor systems and offer new insight into how internal attention implements selection under competitive demands.

">Precise, individualized foraging flights in honey bees revealed by multicopter drone-based tracking</a></h4>

              
                Honey bees routinely fly hundreds or thousands of meters between their hive and established foraging locations. To navigate these long distances, they are known to combine both landmark use and path integration and have been hypothesized to build a cognitive map. Due to technical challenges inherent in tracking these small insects, obtaining three-dimensional, high-resolution measurements of individual navigational precision, and thus a detailed understanding of their strategies, has been difficult. Here, we utilize a novel multicopter drone-based tracking system to measure the individual flight paths of honey bees in a structured agricultural landscape at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Although bees could choose from multiple routes, we discovered that individual bees follow idiosyncratic paths with striking and repeatable precision. Flight path variability was highest over visually sparse regions and lowest near prominent proximal landmarks. Furthermore, individual strategies differed: some bees flew directly toward the hive before maneuvering around a specific tree, while others flew directly to a gap between a hedgerow and the tree. Thus, each animal varies in how it uses visual information and selects between behavioral strategies. The level of precision exhibited by their flight paths exceeds that reported in the waggle dance, implying that dance variability does not reflect a limit in the bee's underlying spatial representation. Our results demonstrate the remarkable precision of individual bee navigation and illustrate the potential of this new drone-based tracking method to illuminate fine-scale behavioral mechanisms across a spectrum of honey bee ecology and cognition.

">Shifts in attentional demand are accompanied by sex-specific patterns of insula-frontal cortical interactions in mice</a></h4>

              
                The insula is a brain region that is correlated with the cognitive process of attention in humans. Aberrant insula function is also implicated in attentional impairments in several psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia. Although the insulas role in attention has been well-studied in humans, we do not yet have an understanding of how the insula communicates with other brain areas to promote attentional processing. Here, we show that neurons in the mouse insula send direct axonal projections to the frontal cortex, and that these two brain areas functionally interact in different ways between male and female mice performing a touchscreen-based attention task. Specifically, we recorded and analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) from the insula and frontal cortex while mice performed variants of a rodent analogue of the continuous performance test of attention, or rCPT. In male mice, we found that activity in the frontal cortex preceded insular activity when the task was well-learned, but that insula-frontal cortex synchrony decreased when the need to inhibit responding was high. In female mice, synchrony between the insula and frontal cortex was largely bidirectional, but was high during all session types. We further demonstrate that patterns of theta-gamma coupling between the frontal cortex and insula distinguish between correct choices and errors during the rCPT, and that these patterns diverge between sexes. Our results suggest that functional differences in insula-frontal cortical circuitry at least partially underlie sex differences in attention-guided behavior in mice.

">Identification of TREK channels in mouse intracardiac ganglion neurons</a></h4>

              
                The intracardiac nervous system is a complex neural network formed by a diffuse plexus, the so called intracardiac ganglion (ICG). These ganglia locally innervate and control heart function, but little is known about how ICG neuronal activity is regulated. While various ionic currents have been characterized in cardiac tissue, the expression and role of TREK channels in ICG neurons remain unexplored. TWIK-related K+ (TREK) channels, members of the two-pore domain potassium channel family, are essential regulators of neuronal membrane resting potential and excitability, with recognized neuroprotective functions. In this study, we have characterized different ionic currents present in mouse ICG neurons, including tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na currents, delayed K+ rectifiers, Ca+2-dependent K currents and A, H and M currents. Notably, we provide the first evidence of functional TREK channel expression in these neurons. Our findings suggest that TREK channels contribute to excitability control and cellular homeostasis in ICG neurons, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets for cardiac disorders.

">The 5-HT1A receptor selective agonist NLX-204 displays analgesic activity in the knee osteoarthritis and plantar incisional post-operative pain models in rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: NLX-204 is a highly selective, high efficacy biased agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, which are well-established modulators of pain processing. Objective: To evaluate the analgesic activity of NLX-204 in two rat models of nociceptive/inflammatory pain: the monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and the Brennan's plantar incision model, using morphine as an active comparator, in both male and female rats. Methods: KOA was induced by left intra-articular MIA injection. Analgesic effects of NLX-204 (0.1-3 mg/kg p.o.) or morphine (6 mg/kg s.c.) were assessed on days 5 and 8 by measuring withdrawal threshold (WT) using von Frey filaments and dynamic weight bearing (DWB) on injured and contralateral limbs. In the Brennan's model, the plantar surface of the left hind limb was incised with elevation and incision of the plantaris muscle. Mechanical allodynia (WT) and guarding behavior (GB) were assessed 24 h post-surgery. Results: In the MIA-KOA model, NLX-204 significantly attenuated DWB imbalance in males at 1-3 mg/kg (acute) and 0.1-3 mg/kg (repeated dosing), and in females at 3 mg/kg (repeated dosing only). NLX-204 demonstrated anti-allodynic activity (VF filaments) from 0.3 mg/kg in males (acute and repeated) and from 1 mg/kg in females. In the Brennan's model, NLX-204 reduced GB scores at 1 mg/kg (males) and 0.3-1 mg/kg (females), and showed anti-allodynic effects from 0.3 mg/kg in both sexes. Morphine was effective in both models under acute and repeated administration. Conclusions: Oral NLX-204 demonstrates dose-dependent analgesic and anti-allodynic activity in two rat models of nociceptive/inflammatory pain, supporting the therapeutic potential of selective, high-efficacy 5-HT1A receptor agonists as a novel non-opioid strategy for pain management.

">Glucose and Oxygen Metabolism Coordinate Human Cortical Developmental Decisions</a></h4>

              
                Defining metabolic regulation of neurodevelopmental programs is essential to approach developmental disorders and injuries driven by alterations in metabolism. In vitro cultures are the only available method to temporally perturb and study living human brain cells throughout neurogenesis, however most culture systems use supraphysiologic conditions of essential nutrients, glucose and oxygen. We probed how environmental exposure to endogenous-like concentrations impact metabolic state and developmental progression of cortical cell types using organoids. Nutrient accessibility globally impacted metabolic state, yet developmental responses to metabolic changes were cell type-specific. Metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets reveal increased TCA metabolites and amino acids and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, under physiologic glucose conditions. Oxygen level had a modest, yet specific, molecular impact on deep layer excitatory neurons. We assessed consequences of metabolic changes on fate and observed that physiologic glucose expanded the human-enriched population of cortical stem cells, outer radial glia, and their progeny, upper layer excitatory neurons. Alterations in oxygen, instead, affected production of neurogenic progenitors and neuronal differentiation, with higher oxygen availability supporting shifts toward mitochondrial metabolism necessary for maturing cell types. We functionally tested this transition by inhibiting glycolysis; total inhibition promoted neuronal differentiation, whereas inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis/lactate production led to oRG expansion. Lactate signaling was sufficient to suppress oRG development and promote self-renewal of neurogenic progenitors. These data suggest that refined metabolic switches and decreased reliance on glucose are required for transition from stem cell self-renewal to more mature, diversified progenitor subtypes, where switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism discretely impacts progenitor diversification.

">Assessment of Motoneuronal Regeneration and Wallerian Degeneration Following Axotomy in Postnatal Mice</a></h4>

              
                Nerve injuries during early postnatal stages results in markedly different outcomes compared to adult injury, with significant motoneuronal death masking potential regenerative capacity. This study systematically evaluated motoneuronal survival, axonal regeneration, and Wallerian degeneration following peripheral nerve injury at distinct postnatal stages (P4, P10, and P30) in mice. Using ChAT-Cre/Ai9(RCL-tdT) and ChAT-Cre/RiboTag transgenic models, we assessed both histological and transcriptomic responses after sciatic nerve lesions. Injury at P4 induced substantial motoneuron death ([~]50%), whilst P10 and P30 animals showed minimal neuronal loss. However, when correcting for neuronal survival, P4 mice demonstrated the highest regenerative capacity, with surviving neurons achieving 100% axonal regeneration. Motoneuron-specific translatome analysis revealed that P30 animals activated a robust regeneration-associated gene (RAG) programme, including classical markers such as Atf3, Gap43, and Ngfr. In contrast, P4 neurons showed minimal RAG upregulation, suggesting they retain an intrinsic growth state that facilitates regeneration without requiring transcriptional reprogramming. P10 animals exhibited a transitional phenotype with impaired RAG activation and reduced regenerative capacity. Wallerian degeneration proceeded efficiently across all developmental stages, with age-specific differences in myelin clearance kinetics and macrophage recruitment. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed consistent downregulation of myelination programmes and upregulation of pro-regenerative markers following injury, regardless of age. These findings indicate that regenerative capacity is primarily determined by the intrinsic growth state of motoneurons rather than extrinsic factors.

                <p>by Mengxiang Lin, Rongqi Fan, Saisai Zhu, Xiaoqiang Yan, Quan Zou, Zhen Tian</p>

Cancer’s heterogeneity necessitates precise subtype identification for effective diagnosis and treatment, which can be achieved by integrating multi-omics data to reveal distinct molecular characteristics and enable personalized therapies. Recently, significant efforts have been made through contrastive clustering methods to efficiently identify cancer subtypes. However, existing approaches remain limited in effectively capturing inter- and intra-view relationships in multi-omics data. Additionally, most cancer subtyping methods often rely on random sampling to construct negative pairs, which may inadvertently engender false negatives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning model named Decoupled Contrastive Multi-view Clustering with adaptive false negative elimination (DCMC). Specifically, DCMC adopts a multi-view clustering architecture that facilitates intra- and inter-view contrastive learning across distinct embedding spaces, allowing view-specific information to be preserved while maintaining cross-view consistency. We further introduce an adaptive false negative elimination framework to progressively screen potential false negatives. Finally, pseudo-label rectification is applied to enhance the quality of the learned representations and further refine the clustering process. DCMC is evaluated on 10 commonly used cancer datasets against 19 state-of-the-art methods, with experimental results validating its superior performance. In the Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma case study, differential expression analysis is performed to identify potential biomarkers, while the cancer subtypes identified by DCMC are validated for their responses to specific therapeutic drugs. The datasets and source code for DCMC are available online at https://github.com/LinMengX/DCMC.

                <p>by Dylan J. Morris, Lauren Kennedy, Andrew J. Black</p>

Mechanistic mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics are tools for understanding how a virus’ biology and its interaction with the immune system shape the infectivity of a host. The biology of the process is encoded by the structure and parameters of the model that can be inferred statistically by fitting to viral load data. The main drawback of mechanistic models is that this inference is computationally expensive because the model must be repeatedly solved. This limits the size of the datasets that can be considered or the complexity of the models fitted. In this paper we develop a much cheaper inference method for this class of models by implementing a novel approximation of the model dynamics that uses a combination of random and deterministic processes. This approximation also properly accounts for process noise early in the infection when cell and virion numbers are small, which is important for the viral dynamics but often overlooked. Our method runs on a consumer laptop and is fast enough to facilitate a full hierarchical Bayesian treatment of the problem with sharing of information to allow for individual level parameter differences. We apply our method to simulated datasets and a reanalysis of COVID-19 monitoring data in an National Basketball Association cohort of 163 individuals.

                <p>by Tianyu Xie, Yicong Mao, Cheng Zhang</p>

Probabilistic modeling over the combinatorially large space of tree topologies remains a central challenge in phylogenetic inference. Previous approaches often necessitate pre-sampled tree topologies, limiting their modeling capability to a subset of the entire tree space. A recent advancement is ARTree, a deep autoregressive model that offers unrestricted distributions for tree topologies. However, its reliance on repetitive tree traversals and inefficient local message passing for computing topological node representations may hamper the scalability to large datasets. This paper proposes ARTreeFormer, a novel approach that harnesses fixed-point iteration and attention mechanisms to accelerate ARTree. By introducing a fixed-point iteration algorithm for computing the topological node embeddings, ARTreeFormer allows fast vectorized computation, especially on CUDA devices. This, together with an attention-based global message passing scheme, significantly improves the computation speed of ARTree while maintaining great approximation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on a benchmark of challenging real data phylogenetic inference problems.

                <p>by Gaurav S. Athreya, Chaitanya S. Gokhale, Prateek Verma</p>

The coexistence of diverse microbial communities despite the common presence of antimicrobial weapons presents a fundamental puzzle in ecology. To address this issue, we investigate the role of antibiotic-mediated interactions in driving microbial diversity using methods from graph theory and theoretical ecology. Our exhaustive analysis of small interaction graphs involving antibiotic production, resistance, and degradation reveals that two factors together determine whether an interaction pattern can support coexistence or not: a certain producer-sensitive-degrader (PSD) motif is critical, and a form of cyclicity between the action of different antibiotics is necessary. Using individual-based simulations, we also explore the role of the PSD motif in spatially structured populations and demonstrate that community coexistence is robust over a wide range of antibiotic and degrader diffusivities. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the interaction patterns that drive diversity in complex microbial communities. Specifically, we emphasize how antagonism does not preclude biodiversity. These results offer clear pathways for cultivating synthetic microbial consortia, enabling the design of more effective strategies for manipulating microbial communities.

                <p>by Obadiah J. Mulder, Maya Peters Kostman, Abdulrahmen Almodaimegh, Michael D. Edge, Joseph W. Larkin</p>

Microbes of nearly every species can form biofilms, communities of cells bound together by a self-produced matrix. It is not understood how variation at the cellular level impacts putatively beneficial, colony-level behaviors, such as cell-to-cell signaling. Here we investigate this problem with an agent-based computational model of metabolically driven electrochemical signaling in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilms. In this process, glutamate-starved interior cells release potassium, triggering a depolarizing wave that spreads to exterior cells and limits their glutamate uptake. More nutrients diffuse to the interior, temporarily reducing glutamate stress and leading to oscillations. In our model, each cell has a membrane potential coupled to metabolism. As a simulated biofilm grows, collective membrane potential oscillations arise spontaneously as cells deplete nutrients and trigger potassium release, reproducing experimental observations. We further validate our model by comparing spatial signaling patterns and cellular signaling rates with those observed experimentally. By oscillating external glutamate and potassium, we find that biofilms synchronize to external potassium, providing a potential mechanism for previously observed oscillation synchronization. By tracking cellular glutamate concentrations, we find that oscillations evenly distribute nutrients in space: non-oscillating biofilms have an external layer of well-fed cells surrounding a starved core, whereas oscillating biofilms exhibit a relatively uniform distribution of glutamate. Our work shows the potential of agent-based models to connect cellular properties to collective phenomena and facilitates studies of how inheritance of cellular traits can affect the evolution of group behaviors.

The BioModels Repository contains over 1000 manually curated mechanistic models from published literature, most often encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). This community-based standard formally specifies each model, but does not describe the computational experimental conditions to run a simulation and collect data. Therefore, it can be challenging to reproduce any figure or result from a publication with an SBML model alone. The Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) provides a solution: a standard way to specify exactly how to run an experiment corresponding to a specific figure or result. BioModels was established years before SED-ML, and both systems evolved over time, both in content and acceptance. Hence, only about half of the entries in BioModels contained SED-ML files, and these files reflected the version of SED-ML that was available at the time. Additionally, almost all of these SED-ML files had at least one minor mistake that made them impossible to run. To make these models and their results more reproducible, we report here on our work updating, correcting and generating new SED-ML files for 1055 curated mechanistic models in BioModels. In addition, because SED-ML is implementation-independent, it can be used for <i>verification</i>, demonstrating that results hold across multiple simulation engines. We tested, corrected, and improved over 450 existing SED-ML files in the BioModels database, and created basic files for the rest of the entries. Then, we used a wrapper architecture for interpreting SED-ML, and report verification results across five different ODE-based biosimulation engines, after further improving the models, the wrappers, and the engines themselves. Our work with SED-ML and the BioModels collection aims to improve the utility of these models by making them more reproducible and credible. Improved reproducibility means these models are now even more fit for re-use, such as in new investigations and as components of multiscale models.

                <p>by Aditya Kamat, Asha Mary Joseph, Deeksha Rathour, Anjana Badrinarayanan</p>

Bacteria encode for gene regulatory networks crucial for sensing and repairing DNA damage. Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, these transcriptional networks are induced in a temporally structured manner. A case in point is of the highly conserved SOS response that is regulated by the LexA repressor. Studies have proposed that affinity of LexA towards promoters of SOS response genes is the primary determinant of its expression dynamics. Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA box properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. We observe that LexA box properties are insufficient in predicting the temporal hierarchy of these genes. Instead, we find that intrinsic promoter strength underlies the order of gene activation, with differential sigma factor association as one of the factors modulating gene expression timing. Our findings highlight a novel regulatory layer in SOS dynamics and underscore the importance of promoter properties in shaping bacterial stress responses.

                <p>by Yizhun Zeng, Xiaopeng Song, Qi Chen, Yue Gu, Jie Zhang, Tao Zhou, Zhihao Li, Tao Wang, Le Chang, Hongwei Yao, Yan Wang, Liyan Miao, Liujia Qian, Tiannan Guo, Yong Zhang, Sonia Rodriguez-Fernandez, Antonio Vidal-Puig, Ying Xu</p>

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, orchestrates daily metabolic rhythms, yet its role in substrate selection and thermogenic adaptation under stress remains insufficiently understood. Here, we show that SCN lesioning abolishes the adaptive suppression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis typically observed during time-restricted feeding in subthermoneutral environments (TRF-STE), a paradigm that imposes concurrent nutrient and thermal stress. Contrary to wild-type responses, SCN-lesioned mice maintain elevated BAT thermogenic activity, despite impaired lipolysis, instead shifting toward glucose-driven heat production. This phenotype is accompanied by sustained sympathetic tone and β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) signaling in BAT. Mechanistically, we identify a SCN-regulated ADRB3-S100B signaling axis underlying this metabolic reprogramming. S100B, a nutrient-sensitive calcium-binding protein, is upregulated in BAT following SCN disruption, where it promotes thermogenesis by stimulating brown adipocyte proliferation and suppressing senescence. Functional studies reveal that S100B is both necessary and sufficient for sustaining BAT thermogenesis under TRF-STE. Furthermore, diverse SCN disruption models, including light-induced circadian arrhythmia, N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) excitotoxicity, and Caspase-3-mediated ablation, consistently elevate S100B expression in BAT, reinforcing its role as a convergent effector of SCN-regulated metabolic adaptation. Thus, in intact animal, the SCN restrains the ADRB3-S100B module, gating BAT thermogenic output in accordance with energetic availability. Disruption of SCN output lifts this restraint, unmasking a latent ADRB3-S100B program that preserves thermogenesis when lipid fuel is limited. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of the SCN in governing thermogenic flexibility and fuel partitioning, and position the ADRB3-S100B axis as a potential target for mitigating circadian misalignment and metabolic disease.

                <p>by Wei Qi Guinevere Sew, Maria Molano-Fernández, Zhiquan Li, Artim Lange, Nahia Pérez de Ciriza, Lene Juel Rasmussen, Hector Herranz</p>

Mitochondrial function and dynamics are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and overall health. Disruptions in these processes can contribute to various diseases, including cancer. The Hippo signaling pathway, a key regulator of tissue growth, plays a central role in cancer through its main effector, the Yes-associated protein (YAP), known as Yorkie (Yki) in <i>Drosophila</i>. In this model organism, <i>Yki</i> upregulation drives benign tissue overgrowth in imaginal discs. Our research demonstrates that the conserved metabolic regulator dPGC1 restricts Yki-driven tissue hyperplasia and helps maintain epithelial integrity in vivo. Combined <i>Yki</i> upregulation and <i>dPGC1</i> depletion results in tumors characterized by enlarged mitochondria and the upregulation of genes promoting mitochondrial fusion, a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for Yki-driven oncogenic growth. We further demonstrate that mitochondrial enlargement is associated with increased levels of the cell cycle regulator Cyclin E, which plays a critical role in tumor development. These findings identify dPGC1 as a context-dependent tumor suppressor that coordinates mitochondrial dynamics and cell cycle regulation in response to oncogene activation, with implications for understanding cancer development in humans.

                The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in project management is transforming decision-making processes, enhancing task execution, and improving risk management. This study aimed to elucidate the challenges raised by AI in project management (PM) using a scientometric and qualitative analysis. The research employs both quantitative and qualitative analysis using VOSviewer. The scientometric analyses reveal a substantial increase in AI in PM publications, with “project management,” “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “cost reduction,” “decision making” and “supply chain management” as the most influential co-occurrence. The systematic review the implementation of challenges and strategies. The analysis identifies the publication trends, most significant keywords, leading institutions and researchers, prominent collaboration connections, primary publication venues, and the most-cited publications. This research enhances understanding of AI in PM, promotes the utilization of artificial intelligence technologies for gaining insights during certain phases of project development, and improves project management efficiency. The utilization of AI technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, markedly improves project efficiency by enhancing decision-making, effectiveness, and risk mitigation.
