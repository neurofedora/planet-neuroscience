     alt="Morphological principles of neuronal mitochondria"/>
<p>High quality 3D reconstructions of mitochondria were generated using serial TEM tomography images of axonal and presynaptic mitochondria, producing minimal distortion from the original images. The resulting in-silico representations were subsequently quantified by differential geometry methods in terms of curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. These methods enable structural motifs to be identified across the sampled population, presenting useful information for future physiological modeling of neuronal mitochondria.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the highly dynamic metabolic landscape of a neuron, mitochondrial membrane architectures can provide critical insight into the unique energy balance of the cell. Current theoretical calculations of functional outputs like adenosine triphosphate and heat often represent mitochondria as idealized geometries, and therefore, can miscalculate the metabolic fluxes. To analyze mitochondrial morphology in neurons of mouse cerebellum neuropil, 3D tracings of complete synaptic and axonal mitochondria were constructed using a database of serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomography images and converted to watertight meshes with minimal distortion of the original microscopy volumes with a granularity of 1.64 nanometer isotropic voxels. The resulting in-silico representations were subsequently quantified by differential geometry methods in terms of the mean and Gaussian curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. Finally, we identify structural motifs present across this population of mitochondria, which may contribute to future modeling studies of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism in neurons.</p>

	<p>Facial expression is a key aspect in observational scales developed to improve pain assessment in individuals with cognitive impairments. Although these scales are used internationally in individuals with different types of cognitive impairments, it is not known whether observing facial expressions of pain might differ between regions or between different types of cognitive impairments. In a pilot study, facial responses to standardized experimental pressure pain were assessed among individuals with different types of cognitive impairments (dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Huntington’s disease, and intellectual disability) from different countries (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Israel, and Spain) and were analyzed using facial descriptors from the PAIC scale (Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition). We found high inter-rater reliability between observers from different countries. Moreover, facial responses to pain did not differ between individuals with dementia from different countries (Denmark, Germany, and Spain). However, the type of cognitive impairment had a significant impact; with individuals with intellectual disability (all being from Israel) showing the strongest facial responses. Our pilot data suggest that the country of origin does not strongly affect how pain is facially expressed or how facial responses are being scored. However, the type of cognitive impairment showed a clear effect in our pilot study, with elevated facial responses in individuals with intellectual disability.</p>

                Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes the endothelial tumor KS, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. KSHV-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play an important role in viral oncogenesis; however, the role of host miRNAs in KS tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here, high-throughput small-RNA sequencing of the...

     alt="Secondary thalamic neuroinflammation after focal cortical stroke and traumatic injury mirrors corticothalamic functional connectivity"/>
<p>Focal cortical TBI or stroke in various cortical areas leads to gliosis in the functionally connected thalamocortical nuclei and of the <i>nucleus reticularis thalami</i> (nRT). The dotted line in the prefrontal cortex-injured section indicates that the top and bottom halves of the brain are sourced from different bregma positions in order to display cortical injury and relevant thalamic nuclei together.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While cortical injuries, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neocortical stroke, acutely disrupt the neocortex, most of their consequent disabilities reflect secondary injuries that develop over time. Thalamic neuroinflammation has been proposed to be a biomarker of cortical injury and of the long-term cognitive and neurological deficits that follow. However, the extent to which thalamic neuroinflammation depends on the type of cortical injury or its location remains unknown. Using two mouse models of focal neocortical injury that do not directly damage subcortical structures—controlled cortical impact and photothrombotic ischemic stroke—we found that chronic neuroinflammation in the thalamic region mirrors the functional connections with the injured cortex, and that sensory corticothalamic regions may be more likely to sustain long-term damage than nonsensory circuits. Currently, heterogeneous clinical outcomes complicate treatment. Understanding how thalamic inflammation depends on the injury site can aid in predicting features of subsequent deficits and lead to more effective, customized therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From spikes to intercellular waves: Tuning intercellular calcium signaling dynamics modulates organ size control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dharsan K. Soundarrajan, Francisco J. Huizar, Ramezan Paravitorghabeh, Trent Robinett, Jeremiah J. Zartman</p>

Information flow within and between cells depends significantly on calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling dynamics. However, the biophysical mechanisms that govern emergent patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dynamics at the organ level remain elusive. Recent experimental studies in developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal discs demonstrate the emergence of four distinct patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity: Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, tissue-level Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, and a global “fluttering” state. Here, we used a combination of computational modeling and experimental approaches to identify two different populations of cells within tissues that are connected by gap junction proteins. We term these two subpopulations “initiator cells,” defined by elevated levels of Phospholipase C (PLC) activity, and “standby cells,” which exhibit baseline activity. We found that the type and strength of hormonal stimulation and extent of gap junctional communication jointly determine the predominate class of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activity. Further, single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are stimulated by insulin, while intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves depend on Gαq activity. Our computational model successfully reproduces how the dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients varies during organ growth. Phenotypic analysis of perturbations to Gαq and insulin signaling support an integrated model of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a dynamic reporter of overall tissue growth. Further, we show that perturbations to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling tune the final size of organs. This work provides a platform to further study how organ size regulation emerges from the crosstalk between biochemical growth signals and heterogeneous cell signaling states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical modelling of human P2X-mediated plasma membrane electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in microglia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alireza Poshtkohi, John Wade, Liam McDaid, Junxiu Liu, Mark Dallas, Angela Bithell</p>

Regulation of cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics is fundamental to microglial function. Temporal and spatial Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes are induced from a complicated signal transduction pathway linked to brain ionic homeostasis. In this paper, we develop a novel biophysical model of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) dynamics in human microglia and evaluate the contribution of purinergic receptors (P2XRs) to both intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> levels in response to agonist/ATP binding. This is the first comprehensive model that integrates P2XRs to predict intricate Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transient responses in microglia. Specifically, a novel compact biophysical model is proposed for the capture of whole-cell patch-clamp currents associated with P2X<sub>4</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, which is composed of only four state variables. The entire model shows that intricate intracellular ion dynamics arise from the coupled interaction between P2X<sub>4</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX), Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> leak channels. Both P2XRs are modelled as two separate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> conductance channels, where the stoichiometry is the removal of one Ca<sup>2+</sup> for the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. Two unique sets of model parameters were determined using an evolutionary algorithm to optimise fitting to experimental data for each of the receptors. This allows the proposed model to capture both human P2X<sub>7</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> data (hP2X<sub>7</sub> and hP2X<sub>4</sub>). The model architecture enables a high degree of simplicity, accuracy and predictability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> dynamics thus providing quantitative insights into different behaviours of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> which will guide future experimental research. Understanding the interactions between these receptors and other membrane-bound transporters provides a step forward in resolving the qualitative link between purinergic receptors and microglial physiology and their contribution to brain pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How the spleen reshapes and retains young and old red blood cells: A computational investigation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by He Li, Zixiang Leonardo Liu, Lu Lu, Pierre Buffet, George Em Karniadakis</p>

The spleen, the largest secondary lymphoid organ in humans, not only fulfils a broad range of immune functions, but also plays an important role in red blood cell’s (RBC) life cycle. Although much progress has been made to elucidate the critical biological processes involved in the maturation of young RBCs (reticulocytes) as well as removal of senescent RBCs in the spleen, the underlying mechanisms driving these processes are still obscure. Herein, we perform a computational study to simulate the passage of RBCs through interendothelial slits (IES) in the spleen at different stages of their lifespan and investigate the role of the spleen in facilitating the maturation of reticulocytes and in clearing the senescent RBCs. Our simulations reveal that at the beginning of the RBC life cycle, intracellular non-deformable particles in reticulocytes can be biomechanically expelled from the cell upon passage through IES, an insightful explanation of why this peculiar “pitting” process is spleen-specific. Our results also show that immature RBCs shed surface area by releasing vesicles after crossing IES and progressively acquire the biconcave shape of mature RBCs. These findings likely explain why RBCs from splenectomized patients are significantly larger than those from nonsplenectomized subjects. Finally, we show that at the end of their life span, senescent RBCs are not only retained by IES due to reduced deformability but also become susceptible to mechanical lysis under shear stress. This finding supports the recent hypothesis that transformation into a hemolyzed ghost is a prerequisite for phagocytosis of senescent RBCs. Altogether, our computational investigation illustrates critical biological processes in the spleen that cannot be observed <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro</i> and offer insights into the role of the spleen in the RBC physiology.

In biology, we are often confronted with information-rich, large-scale trajectory data, but exploring and communicating patterns in such data can be a cumbersome task. Ideally, the data should be wrapped with an interactive visualisation in one concise packet that makes it straightforward to create and test hypotheses collaboratively. To address these challenges, we have developed a tool, <i>linus</i>, which makes the process of exploring and sharing 3D trajectories as easy as browsing a website. We provide a python script that reads trajectory data, enriches them with additional features such as edge bundling or custom axes, and generates an interactive web-based visualisation that can be shared online. <i>linus</i> facilitates the collaborative discovery of patterns in complex trajectory data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nonlinear visuoauditory integration in the mouse superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shinya Ito, Yufei Si, Alan M. Litke, David A. Feldheim</p>

Sensory information from different modalities is processed in parallel, and then integrated in associative brain areas to improve object identification and the interpretation of sensory experiences. The Superior Colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that plays a critical role in integrating visual, auditory, and somatosensory input to assess saliency and promote action. Although the response properties of the individual SC neurons to visuoauditory stimuli have been characterized, little is known about the spatial and temporal dynamics of the integration at the population level. Here we recorded the response properties of SC neurons to spatially restricted visual and auditory stimuli using large-scale electrophysiology. We then created a general, population-level model that explains the spatial, temporal, and intensity requirements of stimuli needed for sensory integration. We found that the mouse SC contains topographically organized visual and auditory neurons that exhibit nonlinear multisensory integration. We show that nonlinear integration depends on properties of auditory but not visual stimuli. We also find that a heuristically derived nonlinear modulation function reveals conditions required for sensory integration that are consistent with previously proposed models of sensory integration such as spatial matching and the principle of inverse effectiveness.

                <p>by Tania Mendonca, Ana A. Jones, Jose M. Pozo, Sarah Baxendale, Tanya T. Whitfield, Alejandro F. Frangi</p>

A common feature of morphogenesis is the formation of three-dimensional structures from the folding of two-dimensional epithelial sheets, aided by cell shape changes at the cellular-level. Changes in cell shape must be studied in the context of cell-polarised biomechanical processes within the epithelial sheet. In epithelia with highly curved surfaces, finding single-cell alignment along a biological axis can be difficult to automate <i>in silico</i>. We present ‘Origami’, a MATLAB-based image analysis pipeline to compute direction-variant cell shape features along the epithelial apico-basal axis. Our automated method accurately computed direction vectors denoting the apico-basal axis in regions with opposing curvature in synthetic epithelia and fluorescence images of zebrafish embryos. As proof of concept, we identified different cell shape signatures in the developing zebrafish inner ear, where the epithelium deforms in opposite orientations to form different structures. Origami is designed to be user-friendly and is generally applicable to fluorescence images of curved epithelia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A gap-filling algorithm for prediction of metabolic interactions in microbial communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dafni Giannari, Cleo Hanchen Ho, Radhakrishnan Mahadevan</p>

The study of microbial communities and their interactions has attracted the interest of the scientific community, because of their potential for applications in biotechnology, ecology and medicine. The complexity of interspecies interactions, which are key for the macroscopic behavior of microbial communities, cannot be studied easily experimentally. For this reason, the modeling of microbial communities has begun to leverage the knowledge of established constraint-based methods, which have long been used for studying and analyzing the microbial metabolism of individual species based on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of microorganisms. A main problem of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions is that they usually contain metabolic gaps due to genome misannotations and unknown enzyme functions. This problem is traditionally solved by using gap-filling algorithms that add biochemical reactions from external databases to the metabolic reconstruction, in order to restore model growth. However, gap-filling algorithms could evolve by taking into account metabolic interactions among species that coexist in microbial communities. In this work, a gap-filling method that resolves metabolic gaps at the community level was developed. The efficacy of the algorithm was tested by analyzing its ability to resolve metabolic gaps on a synthetic community of auxotrophic <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains. Subsequently, the algorithm was applied to resolve metabolic gaps and predict metabolic interactions in a community of <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, two species present in the human gut microbiota, and in an experimentally studied community of <i>Dehalobacter</i> and <i>Bacteroidales</i> species of the ACT-3 community. The community gap-filling method can facilitate the improvement of metabolic models and the identification of metabolic interactions that are difficult to identify experimentally in microbial communities.

To survive elevated temperatures, ectotherms adjust the fluidity of membranes by fine-tuning lipid desaturation levels in a process previously described to be cell autonomous. We have discovered that, in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, neuronal heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the conserved master regulator of the heat shock response (HSR), causes extensive fat remodeling in peripheral tissues. These changes include a decrease in fat desaturase and acid lipase expression in the intestine and a global shift in the saturation levels of plasma membrane’s phospholipids. The observed remodeling of plasma membrane is in line with ectothermic adaptive responses and gives worms a cumulative advantage to warm temperatures. We have determined that at least 6 TAX-2/TAX-4 cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated channel expressing sensory neurons, and transforming growth factor ß (TGF-β)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are required for signaling across tissues to modulate fat desaturation. We also find neuronal <i>hsf-1</i> is not only sufficient but also partially necessary to control the fat remodeling response and for survival at warm temperatures. This is the first study to show that a thermostat-based mechanism can cell nonautonomously coordinate membrane saturation and composition across tissues in a multicellular animal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Edge computing for Vehicle to Everything: a short review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and services have sparked considerable interest as a potential component of future Intelligent Transportation Systems. V2X serves to organise communication and interaction between vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to pedestrians (V2P), and vehicle to networks (V2N). However, having multiple communication channels can generate a vast amount of data for processing and distribution. In addition, V2X services may be subject to performance requirements relating to dynamic handover and low latency communication channels. Good throughput, lower delay, and reliable packet delivery are the core requirements for V2X services.  Edge Computing (EC) may be a feasible option to address the challenge of dynamic handover and low latency to allow V2X information to be transmitted across vehicles. Currently, existing comparative studies do not cover the applicability of EC for V2X. This review explores EC approaches to determine the relevance for V2X communication and services. EC allows devices to carry out part or all of the data processing at the point where data is collected. The emphasis of this review is on several methods identified in the literature for implementing effective EC. We describe each method individually and compare them according to their applicability. The findings of this work indicate that most methods can simulate the EC positioning under predefined scenarios. These include the use of Mobile Edge Computing, Cloudlet, and Fog Computing. However, since most studies are carried out using simulation tools, there is a potential limitation in that crucial data in the search for EC positioning may be overlooked and ignored for bandwidth reduction. The EC approaches considered in this work are limited to the literature on the successful implementation of V2X communication and services. The outcome of this work could considerably help other researchers better characterise EC applicability for V2X communications and services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal diagnosis enables detection of any disease or disability of the fetus during the pregnancy of a woman. Parents whose fetus is found to have a serious disorder from antenatal testing may terminate the pregnancy if it is permitted by the law or continue with the pregnancy to term. However, the chance of terminating a pregnancy may be denied if there is prenatal negligence by the medical practitioner in terms of diagnosis or failure to advise on the test results correctly. The purpose of this research is to examine the possible legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Methods: This study adopts doctrinal legal research in which the researcher examines statutes and decided cases in Malaysia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore relating to abortion, wrongful birth and wrongful life claims, in order to determine the legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Results: In Malaysia, abortion following a prenatal diagnosis is only legally possible if the statutory criteria in the Penal Code are met. Abortion is illegal if it is not done for therapeutic purposes. A wrongful birth action brought by a woman who claims to be deprived of the opportunity to terminate her pregnancy may be successful in Malaysia, if it can be proven that a legal abortion could have been performed if not because of the prenatal negligence of the medical practitioner. However, a wrongful life action brought in the child’s name for being allowed to be born with a disability may not be viable since the claim could hardly be established and it is against the public policy. Conclusions: Theoretically, it is possible to bring a wrongful birth action resulted from negligence in prenatal diagnosis successfully in Malaysia, but the chance is relatively slim for wrongful life action.

                Background: FabB (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 1) is part of the fatty acid synthesis II pathway found in bacteria and a potential target for antibiotics. The enzyme catalyses the Claisen condensation of malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) with acyl-ACP via an acyl intermediate. Here, we report the crystal structure of the intermediate-mimicking Pseudomonas aeruginosa FabB (PaFabB) C161A variant. Methods: His-tagged PaFabB C161A was expressed in E.coli Rosetta DE3 pLysS cells, cleaved by TEV protease and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Commercial screens were used to identify suitable crystallization conditions which were subsequently improved to obtain well diffracting crystals. Results: We developed a robust and efficient system for recombinant expression of PaFabB C161A. Conditions to obtain well diffracting crystals were established. The crystal structure of PaFabB C161A was solved by molecular replacement at 1.3 Å resolution. Conclusions: The PaFabB C161A crystal structure can be used as a template to facilitate the design of FabB inhibitors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of vitamin D supplementation on peripheral neuropathy in a sample of Egyptian prediabetic individuals [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vitamin D deficiency is seen more frequently in diabetic patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data concerning prediabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy (PN). Therefore, we aimed to study the association of vitamin D deficiency with PN severity and to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on PN in prediabetics. Methods: A case-control study was conducted consisting of 89 prediabetic individuals with PN and a control group of prediabetics without PN, recruited from the outpatient department of the National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt. All patients were screened for PN using clinical examination and Douleur Neuropathique 4 diagnostic questionnaire (DN4). Group A (with PN) was assessed for neuropathic severity using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). In addition, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, ionized calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour post 75g glucose (2h-PPBG) and lipid profile were measured for both groups. Prediabetic patients with PN were given vitamin D3 200.000 IU IM monthly for three months. After three months, clinical assessment, DN4, SF-MPQ and all laboratory measures were repeated. Results: Vitamin D was not associated with the severity of PN patients. However, supplementation of vitamin D resulted in a highly significant improvement in glycemic parameters , p≤0.001. Interestingly, neuropathy score and severity before vitamin D supplementation were (6.4±1.6 and 28.3±7.2) and after became (2.5±0.9 and 17±6.3, p≤0.001). Conclusion: Correction of vitamin D deficiency in prediabetics with PN as well as hypovitaminosis D, improves glycemic parameters, PN score and severity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Frequency of anisometropia in children and adolescents [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Our objective was to estimate the frequency of anisometropia at various educational stages, from pre-school to 9th school year, studying its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Methods: 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) participated in this study, 46.7% girls and 42.7% living in a rural environment. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field autorefractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegic and under binocular conditions. Results: The frequency rate of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most frequent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical evidence was found to state that the occurrence of anisometropia differs between genders or between areas of residence. Regarding the school cycle, a significant association was found with spherical equivalent anisometropia, with an increase in its frequency with school progress (p=0,012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: The increase in workload for near tasks has been identified as a risk factor for the increase in myopia. This fact may be related to the increase in anisometropia with the educational stage, found in this study. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition to beyond childhood.

                <p>We evaluated whether genetically elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with lower risk of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage (IA/SAH). We conducted a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Our primary analysis used the inverse-variance weighted method. In secondary analyses, we implemented the MR-PRESSO method, restricted our analysis to LDL-C–specific instruments, and performed multivariate MR. A 1-mmol/l increase in genetically instrumented LDL-C levels was associated with a 17% lower risk of IA/SAH (odds ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = 0.73–0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.004). Results remained consistent in secondary and multivariate analyses (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Our results provide evidence for an inverse causal relationship between LDL-C levels and risk of IA/SAH.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modifications to the delivery of NHS face-to-face general practice consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in England [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In order to minimise transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, delivery of English general practice consultations was modified in March 2020 to enable the separation of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 from others. Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted face-to-face contact used only when clinically necessary. Face-to-face delivery modifications were decided locally and this study aimed to identify the different models used nationwide in spring/summer 2020. Methods: In June 2020, a survey was sent by email to the 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) responsible for planning and commissioning NHS health care services in England to identify the local organisation of face-to-face general practice consultations since March 2020. Results: All CCGs responded. Between March and July 2020, separation of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 (‘COVID-19 patients’) from others was achieved using the following models: zoned practices (used within 47% of CCGs), where COVID-19 and other patients were separated within their own practice; ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ hubs (used within 90% of CCGs), separate sites where COVID-19 or other patients registered at one of several collaborating practices were seen; ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ home visits (used within 70% of CCGs). For around half of CCGs, either all their GP practices used zoning, or all used hubs; in other CCGs, both models were used. Demand-led hub availability offered flexibility in some areas. Home visits were mainly used supplementally for patients unable to access other services, but in two CCGs, they were the main/only form of COVID-19 provision.  Conclusions: Varied, flexible ways of delivering face-to-face general practice consultations were identified.  Analysis of the modified delivery in terms of management of COVID-19 and other conditions, and other impacts on staff and patients, may both aid future pandemic management and identify beneficial elements for practice beyond this.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Public perception of NHS general practice during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In March 2020, the delivery of NHS general practice consultations was rapidly modified to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted models for face-to-face contact if clinically required. This study aimed to gain insight into public perception of these adaptations. Methods: Two online surveys were developed, and conducted in August and September 2020. Survey A, open to adults (>18 years) receiving the link to it, considered respondents’ perspectives on healthcare contacts since March 2020, and their understanding of the adapted delivery. Survey B, open to survey A respondents only, then considered how healthcare communication had been received and individual preferences for this. Survey participation was voluntary. Results: The perceptions of 150 members of the public were obtained. 105 had considered contacting general practice, although half avoided this or delayed doing so for longer than usual. While some patients did so ‘to help the NHS’, others experienced reduced access for reasons including concerns about telephone consultations and about COVID-19 safety. Some however reported benefitting from remote consultation availability and regular texts/emails from their practice. 68% (102/150) of respondents were unaware that patients with COVID-19 were seen separately from other patients during general practice appointments. 27% in survey B who had avoided or delayed contact said they would have felt more comfortable contacting general practice had they known this. Conclusions: Experience and use of the adapted general practice models varied. Some patients felt their access to healthcare was reduced, often due to technological requirements. For some who found attending face-to-face appointments difficult however, remote contact was advantageous. Most of those surveyed were unaware of the COVID-19 control measures in place during face-to-face general practice consultations. Assessment of adapted delivery model accessibility and clearer public messaging about the changes may help reduce inequalities.

                Closser et al. show that neuronal genes are associated with highly complex regulatory systems in expanded non-coding genomic domains. Neuronal enhancers are distributed broadly and utilized sparsely in cell-type- and cell-stage-specific patterns. Acquisition of new enhancers might be a fundamental process underlying the evolutionary increase in cellular complexity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">All-trans retinoic acid induces synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed that the vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) induces synaptic plasticity in acute brain slices prepared from the mouse and human neocortex (Lenz et al., 2021). Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata—a brain region implicated in memory acquisition. No major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral hippocampus while a significant increase in both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies and synapse numbers were evident in the dorsal hippocampus 6 hr after atRA administration. The intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells were not significantly different and hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential neuronal changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, that is, for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic strength. Indeed, in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, therefore, extending our previous results regarding the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our data show that atRA mediates synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Monitoring single-cell dynamics of entry into quiescence during an unperturbed lifecycle</a></h4>

              
                The life cycle of microorganisms is associated with dynamic metabolic transitions and complex cellular responses. In yeast, how metabolic signals control the progressive choreography of structural reorganizations observed in quiescent cells during a natural life cycle remains unclear. We have developed an integrated microfluidic device to address this question, enabling continuous single-cell tracking in a batch culture experiencing unperturbed nutrient exhaustion to unravel the coordination between metabolic and structural transitions within cells. Our technique reveals an abrupt fate divergence in the population, whereby a fraction of cells is unable to transition to respiratory metabolism and undergoes a reversible entry into a quiescence-like state leading to premature cell death. Further observations reveal that non-monotonous internal pH fluctuations in respiration-competent cells orchestrate the successive waves of protein super-assemblies formation that accompany the entry into a <i>bona fide</i> quiescent state. This ultimately leads to an abrupt cytosolic glass transition that occurs stochastically long after proliferation cessation. This new experimental framework provides a unique way to track single-cell fate dynamics over a long timescale in a population of cells that continuously modify their ecological niche.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Shu complex prevents mutagenesis and cytotoxicity of single-strand specific alkylation lesions</a></h4>

              
                Three-methyl cytosine (3meC) are toxic DNA lesions, blocking base pairing. Bacteria and humans, express members of the AlkB enzymes family, which directly remove 3meC. However, other organisms, including budding yeast, lack this class of enzymes. It remains an unanswered evolutionary question as to how yeast repairs 3meC, particularly in single-stranded DNA. The yeast Shu complex, a conserved homologous recombination factor, aids in preventing replication-associated mutagenesis from DNA base damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We found that MMS-treated Shu complex-deficient cells, exhibit a genome-wide increase in A:T and G:C substitutions mutations. The G:C substitutions displayed transcriptional and replicational asymmetries consistent with mutations resulting from 3meC. Ectopic expression of a human AlkB homolog in Shu-deficient yeast rescues MMS-induced growth defects and increased mutagenesis. Thus, our work identifies a novel homologous recombination-based mechanism mediated by the Shu complex for coping with alkylation adducts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel, ataxic mouse model of Ataxia Telangiectasia caused by a clinically relevant nonsense mutation</a></h4>

              
                Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) and Ataxia with Ocular Apraxia Type 1 (AOA1) are devastating neurological disorders caused by null mutations in the genome stability genes, A-T mutated (<i>ATM</i>) and Aprataxin (<i>APTX</i>), respectively. Our mechanistic understanding and therapeutic repertoire for treating these disorders is severely lacking, in large part due to the failure of prior animal models with similar null mutations to recapitulate the characteristic loss of motor coordination (i.e., ataxia) and associated cerebellar defects. By increasing genotoxic stress through the insertion of null mutations in both the <i>Atm</i> (nonsense) and <i>Aptx </i>(knockout) genes in the same animal, we have generated a novel mouse model that for the first time develops a progressively severe ataxic phenotype associated with atrophy of the cerebellar molecular layer. We find biophysical properties of cerebellar Purkinje neurons are significantly perturbed (e.g., reduced membrane capacitance, lower action potential thresholds, etc.), while properties of synaptic inputs remain largely unchanged. These perturbations significantly alter Purkinje neuron neural activity, including a progressive reduction in spontaneous action potential firing frequency that correlates with both cerebellar atrophy and ataxia over the animal’s first year of life. Double mutant mice also exhibit a high predisposition to developing cancer (thymomas) and immune abnormalities (impaired early thymocyte development and T-cell maturation), symptoms characteristic of A-T. Lastly, by inserting a clinically relevant nonsense-type null mutation in <i>Atm</i>, we demonstrate that Small Molecule Read-Through (SMRT) compounds can restore ATM production, indicating their potential as a future A-T therapeutic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A coupled mechano-biochemical model for cell polarity guided anisotropic root growth</a></h4>

              
                Plants develop new organs to adjust their bodies to dynamic changes in the environment. How independent organs achieve anisotropic shapes and polarities is poorly understood. To address this question, we constructed a mechano-biochemical model for <i>Arabidopsis</i> root meristem growth that integrates biologically plausible principles. Computer model simulations demonstrate how differential growth of neighboring tissues results in the initial symmetry-breaking leading to anisotropic root growth. Furthermore, the root growth feeds back on a polar transport network of the growth regulator auxin. Model, predictions are in close agreement with <i>in vivo</i> patterns of anisotropic growth, auxin distribution, and cell polarity, as well as several root phenotypes caused by chemical, mechanical, or genetic perturbations. Our study demonstrates that the combination of tissue mechanics and polar auxin transport organizes anisotropic root growth and cell polarities during organ outgrowth. Therefore, a mobile auxin signal transported through immobile cells drives polarity and growth mechanics to coordinate complex organ development.

                Acoustic signals serve communication within and across species throughout the animal kingdom.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synthesis of a comprehensive population code for contextual features in the awake sensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                How cortical circuits build representations of complex objects is poorly understood. Individual neurons must integrate broadly over space, yet simultaneously obtain sharp tuning to specific global stimulus features. Groups of neurons identifying different global features must then assemble into a population that forms a comprehensive code for these global stimulus properties. Although the logic for how single neurons summate over their spatial inputs has been well-explored in anesthetized animals, how large groups of neurons compose a flexible population code of higher order features in awake animals is not known. To address this question, we probed the integration and population coding of higher order stimuli in the somatosensory and visual cortices of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging across cortical layers. We developed a novel tactile stimulator that allowed the precise measurement of spatial summation even in actively whisking mice. Using this system, we found a sparse but comprehensive population code for higher order tactile features that depends on a heterogeneous and neuron-specific logic of spatial summation beyond the receptive field. Different somatosensory cortical neurons summed specific combinations of sensory inputs supra-linearly, but integrated other inputs sub-linearly, leading to selective responses to higher order features. Visual cortical populations employed a nearly identical scheme to generate a comprehensive population code for contextual stimuli. These results suggest that a heterogeneous logic of input-specific supra-linear summation may represent a widespread cortical mechanism for the synthesis of sparse higher order feature codes in neural populations. This may explain how the brain exploits the thalamocortical expansion of dimensionality to encode arbitrary complex features of sensory stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts is a developmental disorder of the gliovascular unit</a></h4>

              
                Absence of the astrocyte-specific membrane protein MLC1 is responsible for megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), a rare type of leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset macrocephaly and progressive white matter vacuolation that lead to ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive decline. During postnatal development (from P5 to P15 in the mouse), MLC1 forms a membrane complex with GlialCAM (another astrocytic transmembrane protein) at the junctions between perivascular astrocytic processes. Perivascular astrocytic processes along with blood vessels form the gliovascular unit. It was not previously known how MLC1 influences the physiology of the gliovascular unit. Here, using the <i>Mlc1</i> knock-out (KO) mouse model of MLC, we demonstrated that MLC1 controls the postnatal development and organization of perivascular astrocytic processes, vascular smooth muscle cell contractility, neurovascular coupling and intraparenchymal interstitial fluid clearance. Our data suggest that MLC is a developmental disorder of the gliovascular unit, and perivascular astrocytic processes and vascular smooth muscle cell maturation defects are primary events in the pathogenesis of MLC and therapeutic targets for this disease.

                Bacteria must balance the different needs for substrate assimilation, growth functions, and resilience in order to thrive in their environment. Of all cellular macromolecules, the bacterial proteome is by far the most important resource and its size is limited. Here, we investigated how the highly versatile 'knallgas' bacterium <i>Cupriavidus necator</i> reallocates protein resources when grown on different limiting substrates and with different growth rates. We determined protein quantity by mass spectrometry and estimated enzyme utilization by resource balance analysis modeling. We found that <i>C. necator</i> invests a large fraction of its proteome in functions that are hardly utilized. Of the enzymes that are utilized, many are present in excess abundance. One prominent example is the strong expression of CBB cycle genes such as Rubisco during growth on fructose. Modeling and mutant competition experiments suggest that CO<sub>2</sub>-reassimilation through Rubisco does not provide a fitness benefit for heterotrophic growth, but is rather an investment in readiness for autotrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Correct regionalisation of a tissue primordium is essential for coordinated morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                During organ development, tubular organs often form from flat epithelial primordia. In the placodes of the forming tubes of the salivary glands in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, we previously identified spatially defined cell behaviours of cell wedging, tilting and cell intercalation that are key to the initial stages of tube formation. Here we address what the requirements are that ensure the continuous formation of a narrow symmetrical tube from an initially asymmetrical primordium whilst overall tissue geometry is constantly changing. We are using live-imaging and quantitative methods to compare wild-type placodes and mutants that either show disrupted cell behaviours or an initial symmetrical placode organisation, with both resulting in severe impairment of the invagination. We find that early transcriptional patterning of key morphogenetic transcription factors drives the selective activation of downstream morphogenetic modules, such as GPCR signalling that activates apical-medial actomyosin activity to drive cell wedging at the future asymmetrically-placed invagination point. Over time, transcription of key factors expands across the rest of the placode and cells switch their behaviour from predominantly intercalating to predominantly apically constricting as their position approaches the invagination pit. Misplacement or enlargement of the initial invagination pit leads to early problems in cell behaviours that eventually result in a defective organ shape. Our work illustrates that the dynamic patterning of the expression of transcription factors and downstream morphogenetic effectors ensures positionally fixed areas of cell behaviour with regards to the invagination point. This patterning in combination with the asymmetric geometrical set-up ensures functional organ formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CA1 pyramidal cell diversity is rootedin the time of neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Cellular diversity supports the computational capacity and flexibility of cortical circuits. Accordingly, principal neurons at the CA1 output node of the murine hippocampus are increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous population. Their genes, molecular content, intrinsic morphophysiology, connectivity, and function seem to segregate along the main anatomical axes of the hippocampus. Since these axes reflect the temporal order of principal cell neurogenesis, we directly examined the relationship between birthdate and CA1 pyramidal neuron diversity, focusing on the ventral hippocampus. We used a genetic fate-mapping approach that allowed tagging three groups of age-matched principal neurons: pioneer, early- and late-born. Using a combination of neuroanatomy, slice physiology, connectivity tracing and cFos staining in mice, we show that birthdate is a strong predictor of CA1 principal cell diversity. We unravel a subpopulation of pioneer neurons recruited in familiar environments with remarkable positioning, morpho-physiological features, and connectivity. Therefore, despite the expected plasticity of hippocampal circuits, given their role in learning and memory, the diversity of their main components is also partly determined at the earliest steps of development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury alterations of corticotropin-releasing factor neuronal activity in the mouse hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mbTBI) is the most common cause of TBI in US service members and veterans. Those exposed to TBI are at greater risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, and substance use disorders following TBI [1, 2]. Previously, we have demonstrated that mbTBI increases anxiety-like behaviors in mice and dysregulates the stress at the level of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). To expand on how mTBI may dysregulate the stress axis centrally, here PVN CRF neuronal activity was evaluated using whole cell-patch clamp recordings in hypothalamic slices from sham and mbTBI adult male CRF:tdTomato mice 7 days post-injury. We found that mbTBI generally did not affect the neuronal excitability and intrinsic membrane properties of PVN CRF neurons; this injury selectively increased the frequency of spontaneous neuronal firing of PVN CRF neurons localized to the dorsal PVN (dPVN) but not ventral PVN (vPVN). Consistently, mbTBI-induced dPVN CRF hyperactivity was associated with pre- and post-synaptic depression of spontaneous GABAergic transmission onto dPVN CRF neurons suggesting that mbTBI-induced GABAergic synaptic dysfunction may underlie dPVN CRF neuronal hyperactivity and increases in dPVN CRF signaling. The present results provide the first evidence for mbTBI-induced alterations in PVN CRF neuronal activity and GABAergic synaptic function that could mediate hypothalamic CRF dysregulation following mbTBI contributing to stress psychopathology associated with blast injury.

                Recording the activity of the same neurons over the adult life of an animal is important to neuroscience research and biomedical applications. Current implantable devices cannot provide stable recording on this time scale. Here, we introduce a method to precisely implant nanoelectronics with an open, unfolded mesh structure across multiple brain regions in the mouse. The open mesh structure forms a stable interwoven structure with the neural network, preventing probe drifting and showing no immune response and neuron loss during the yearlong implantation. Using the implanted nanoelectronics, we can track single-unit action potentials from the same neurons over the entire adult life of mice. Leveraging the stable recordings, we build machine learning algorithms that enable automated spike sorting, noise rejection, stability validation, and generate pseudotime analysis, revealing aging-associated evolution of the single-neuron activities.

                Understanding percepts, engrams and actions requires methods for selectively modulating synaptic communication between specific subsets of interconnected cells. Here, we develop an approach to control synaptically connected elements using bioluminescent light: Luciferase-generated light, originating from a presynaptic axon terminal, modulates an opsin in its postsynaptic target. Vesicular-localized luciferase is released into the synaptic cleft in response to presynaptic activity, creating a real-time Optical Synapse. Light production is under experimenter-control by introduction of the small molecule luciferin. Signal transmission across this optical synapse is temporally defined by the presence of both the luciferin and presynaptic activity. We validate synaptic Interluminescence by multi-electrode recording in cultured neurons and in mice in vivo.

                Neuropathic pain is a refractory condition that involves de novo protein synthesis in the nociceptive pathway. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of protein translation; however, mechanisms underlying its role in neuropathic pain remain elusive. Using spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain model, we found that mTOR is preferentially activated in large-diameter dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and spinal microglia. However, selective ablation of mTOR in DRG neurons, rather than microglia, alleviated neuropathic pain. We show that injury-induced mTOR activation promoted transcriptional induction of NPY likely via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation. NPY further acted primarily on Y2 receptors (Y2R) to enhance nociceptor excitability. Peripheral replenishment of NPY reversed pain alleviation upon mTOR removal, whereas Y2R antagonists prevented pain restoration. Our findings reveal an unexpected link between mTOR and NPY in promoting nociceptor sensitization and neuropathic pain, through NPY/Y2R signaling-mediated intra-ganglionic transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictions and experimental tests of a new biophysical model of the mammalian respiratory oscillator</a></h4>

              
                Previously our computational modeling studies (Phillips et al., 2019) proposed that neuronal persistent sodium current (INaP) and calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) are key biophysical factors that, respectively, generate inspiratory rhythm and burst pattern in the mammalian preBotzinger complex (preBotC) respiratory oscillator. Here, we experimentally tested and confirmed three predictions of the model from new simulations concerning the roles of INaP and ICAN: (1) INaP and ICAN blockade have opposite effects on the relationship between network excitability and preBotC rhythmic activity; (2) INaP is essential for preBotC rhythmogenesis; (3) ICAN is essential for generating the amplitude of rhythmic output but not rhythm generation. These predictions were confirmed via optogenetic manipulations of preBotC network excitability during graded INaP or ICAN blockade by pharmacological manipulations in neonatal mouse slices in vitro. Our results support and advance the hypothesis that INaP and ICAN mechanistically underlie rhythm and inspiratory burst pattern generation, respectively, in the isolated preBotC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding grasp and speech signals from the cortical grasp circuit in a tetraplegic human</a></h4>

              
                Tetraplegia from spinal cord injury leaves many patients paralyzed below the neck, leaving them unable to perform most activities of daily living. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) could give tetraplegic patients more independence by directly utilizing brain signals to control external devices such as robotic arms or hands. The cortical grasp network has been of particular interest because of its potential to facilitate the restoration of dexterous object manipulation. However, a network that involves such high-level cortical areas may also provide additional information, such as the encoding of speech. Towards understanding the role of different brain areas in the human cortical grasp network, neural activity related to motor intentions for grasping and performing speech was recorded in a tetraplegic patient in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), the ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and the somatosensory cortex (S1). We found that in high-level brain areas SMG and PMv, grasps were well represented by firing rates of neuronal populations already at visual cue presentation. During motor imagery, grasps could be significantly decoded from all brain areas. At identical neuronal population sizes, SMG and PMv achieved similar highly-significant decoding abilities, demonstrating their potential for grasp BMIs. During speech, SMG encoded both spoken grasps and colors, in contrast to PMv and S1, which were not able to significantly decode speech.These findings suggest that grasp signals can robustly be decoded at a single unit level from the cortical grasping circuit in human. Data from PMv suggests a specialized role in grasping, while SMG's role is broader and extends to speech. Together, these results indicate that brain signals from high-level areas of the human cortex can be exploited for a variety of different BMI applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fragmented Spatial Maps: State Abstraction and Efficient Planning from Surprisal</a></h4>

              
                When animals explore spatial environments, their representations often fragment into multiple maps. What determines these map fragmentations, and can we predict where they will occur with simple principles? We pose the problem of fragmentation of an environment as one of (online) spatial clustering. Taking inspiration from the notion of a "contiguous region" in robotics, we develop a theory in which fragmentation decisions are driven by surprisal. When this criterion is implemented with boundary, grid, and place cells in various environments, it produces map fragmentations from the first exploration of each space. Augmented with a long-term spatial memory and a rule similar to the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process for selecting among relevant memories, the theory predicts the reuse of map fragments in environments with repeating substructures. Our model provides a simple rule for generating spatial state abstractions and predicts map fragmentations observed in electrophysiological recordings. It further predicts that there should be "fragmentation decision" or "fracture" cells, which in multicompartment environments could be called "doorway" cells. Finally, we show that the resulting abstractions can lead to large (orders of magnitude) improvements in the ability to plan and navigate through complex environments.

                Older adults exposed to enriched environments (EE) maintain relatively higher levels of cognitive function, even in the face of compromised markers of brain health. Response speed (RS) is often used as a simple proxy to measure the preservation of global cognitive function in older adults. However, it is unknown which specific sensory, decision, and/or motor processes provide the most specific indices of neurocognitive health. Here, using a simple decision task with electroencephalography (EEG), we found that the efficiency with which an individual accumulates sensory evidence was a critical determinant of the extent to which RS was preserved in older adults. Moreover, the mitigating influence of EE on age-related RS declines was most pronounced when evidence accumulation rates were shallowest. Our results suggest that EEG metrics of evidence accumulation may index neurocognitive vulnerability of the ageing brain.

                Sensory systems reliably process incoming stimuli in spite of changes in context. Most recent models accredit this context invariance to an extraction of increasingly complex sensory features in hierarchical feedforward networks. Here, we study how context-invariant representations can be established by feedback rather than feedforward processing. We show that feedforward neural networks modulated by feedback can dynamically generate invariant sensory representations. The required feedback can be implemented as a slow and spatially diffuse gain modulation. The invariance is not present on the level of individual neurons, but emerges only on the population level. Mechanistically, the feedback modulation dynamically reorients the manifold of neural activity and thereby maintains an invariant neural subspace in spite of contextual variations. Our results highlight the importance of population-level analyses for understanding the role of feedback in flexible sensory processing.

                Gamma rhythms play a major role in many different processes in the brain, such as attention, working memory and sensory processing. While typically considered detrimental, counterintuitively noise can sometimes have beneficial effects on communication and information transfer. Recently, Meng and Riecke showed that synchronization of interacting networks of inhibitory neurons increases while synchronization within these networks decreases when neurons are subject to uncorrelated noise. However, experimental and modelling studies point towards an important role of the pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma (PING) mechanism in the cortex. Therefore, we investigated the effect of uncorrelated noise on the communication between excitatory-inhibitory networks producing gamma oscillations via a PING mechanism. Our results suggest that synaptic noise can have a supporting role in facilitating inter-regional communication and that noise-induced synchronization between networks is generated via a different mechanism than when synchronization is mediated by strong synaptic coupling. Noise-induced synchronization is achieved by lowering synchronization within networks which allows the respective other network to impose its own gamma rhythm resulting in synchronization between networks.

                In cognitive neuroscience and psychology, reaction times are an important behavioral measure. However, in instrumental learning and goal-directed decision making experiments, findings often rely only on choice probabilities from a value-based model, instead of reaction times. Recent advancements have shown that it is possible to connect value-based decision models with reaction time models, for example in a joint reinforcement learning and diffusion decision model. We propose a novel joint model of both choices and reaction times by combining a mechanistic account of Bayesian sequential decision making with a sampling procedure. Specifically, we use a recent context-specific Bayesian forward planning model which we extend by an MCMC sampler to obtain both choices and reaction times. We show that we can explain and reproduce well-known experimental findings in value based-decision making as well as classical inhibition and switching tasks. First, we use the proposed model to explain how instrumental learning and automatized behavior result in decreased reaction times and improved accuracy. Second, we reproduce classical results in the Eriksen flanker task. Third, we reproduce established findings in task switching. These findings show that the proposed joint behavioral model may describe common underlying processes in all these types of decision making paradigms.

                Background: Alcohol use during adolescence can alter maturational changes that occur in brain regions associated with social and emotional responding. Our previous studies have shown that adult male, but not female rats demonstrate social anxiety-like alterations and enhanced sensitivity to ethanol-induced social facilitation following adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. These consequences of AIE may influence adult social drinking in a sex-specific manner. Methods: To test effects of AIE on social drinking, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to water or ethanol [0 or 4 g/kg, intragastrically, every other day, between postnatal day (P) 25 and 45] were tested as adults (P72-83) in a social drinking paradigm (30-minute access to a 10% ethanol solution in supersac or supersac alone in groups of three same-sex littermates across two 4-day cycles separated by 4 days off). Social behavior was assessed during the last drinking session, with further assessment of oxytocin (OXT), oxytocin receptor (OXTR), vasopressin (AVP) and vasopressin receptors 1a and 1b (AVPR1a, AVPR1b) in the hypothalamus and lateral septum. Results: Males exposed to AIE consumed more ethanol than water-exposed controls during the second drinking cycle, whereas AIE did not affect supersac intake in males. AIE-exposed females consumed less ethanol and more supersac than water-exposed controls. Water-exposed females drinking ethanol showed more social investigation as well as significantly higher hypothalamic OXTR, AVP, and AVPR1b gene expression than their counterparts ingesting supersac and AIE females drinking ethanol. In males, hypothalamic AVPR1b gene expression was affected by drinking solution, with significantly higher expression evident in males drinking ethanol than those consuming supersac. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings provide new evidence regarding sex-specific effects of AIE on social drinking and suggest that the hypothalamic OXT and AVP systems are implicated in the effects of ingested ethanol on social behavior in a sex- and adolescent exposure-dependent manner.

                Maintenance of long-term memory requires transcription and translation of activity-regulated genes. Many of these are immediate early genes (IEGs) with short-lived mRNAs and proteins, often decaying rapidly after stimulation. It remains unknown how an IEG with rapid mRNA and protein turnover can impact long-lasting changes at the synapses. Here, we imaged the long-term transcription and translation dynamics of an IEG, Arc, important for memory consolidation, after stimulation in individual neurons. We demonstrated that the gene underwent reactivation in the same neuron without an additional stimulus, often at the same allele. The cycling of Arc transcription required protein synthesis. Indeed, phases of Arc translation were coordinated with the transcription cycles. Arc mRNAs from later cycles preferentially localized at dendritic sites marked by previous Arc protein, thereby creating hubs of local protein enrichment, potentially maintained by cycles of dendritic translation. These results identify novel characteristics of an IEG and provide insights into how unstable proteins may be sustained over the long-time scale of memory consolidation.

                The decision to engage in courtship depends on external cues from potential mates and internal cues related to maturation, health, and experience. Hormones allow such information to be conveyed to distal tissues in a coordinated fashion. Here, we show Ecdysis-Triggering Hormone (ETH) is a regulator of male courtship in Drosophila melanogaster, and critical for mate choice and courtship inhibition after the completion of copulation. Preventing ETH release increases male-male courtship and decreases post-copulation courtship inhibition (PCCI). Such aberrant male courtship behavior in ETH-deficient males appears to be the consequence of inabilityto integrate pheromone cues into decision making. Silencing of ETH receptor (ETHR) in GR32A-expressing neurons leads to reduced ligand sensitivity and elevated male-male courtship. We find OR67D is critical for suppression of courtship after mating, and ETHR silencing in OR67D-expressing neurons, and GR32A-expressing neurons to a lesser degree, elevates post-copulation courtship. Finally, ETHR silencing in the corpus allatum increases post-copulation courtship; treatment of with juvenile hormone analog partially restores normal post-mating behavior. ETH, a stress-sensitive reproductive hormone, appears to coordinate multiple sensory modalities to guide Drosophila male courtship behaviors, especially after mating.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Removing Inter-Experimental Variability from Functional Data in Systems Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Integrating data from multiple experiments is common practice in systems neuroscience but it requires inter-experimental variability to be negligible compared to the biological signal of interest. This requirement is rarely fulfilled; systematic changes between experiments can drastically affect the outcome of complex analysis pipelines. Modern machine learning approaches designed to adapt models across multiple data domains offer flexible ways of removing inter-experimental variability where classical statistical methods often fail. While applications of these methods have been mostly limited to single-cell genomics, in this work, we develop a theoretical framework for domain adaptation in systems neuroscience. We implement this in an adversarial optimization scheme that removes inter-experimental variability while preserving the biological signal. We compare our method to previous approaches on a large-scale dataset of two-photon imaging recordings of retinal bipolar cell responses to visual stimuli. This dataset provides a unique benchmark as it contains biological signal from well-defined cell types that is obscured by large inter-experimental variability. In a supervised setting, we compare the generalization performance of cell type classifiers across experiments, which we validate with anatomical cell type distributions from electron microscopy data. In an unsupervised setting, we remove inter-experimental variability from data which can then be fed into arbitrary downstream analyses. In both settings, we find that our method achieves the best trade-off between removing inter-experimental variability and preserving biological signal. Thus, we offer a flexible approach to remove inter-experimental variability and integrate datasets across experiments in systems neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Where is the money? Dynamics in feedback processing and attention during spatial probabilistic learning</a></h4>

              
                Learned feature-based stimulus-reward-associations can modulate behavior and the underlying neural processing of information. In our study, we investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying learning of spatial stimulus-reward-associations. Participants performed a probabilistic spatial reward-learning task that required participants, within 40 trials, to learn which out of four locations on a computer screen yielded the most gain-feedback when chosen. Our behavioral findings show that participants learned to choose which location was most rewarding. Those findings were paralleled by significant amplitude differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by the presentation of loss and gain feedback; the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was more negative in response to loss feedback compared to gain feedback, but showed no modulation by trial-number. On the other hand, the late positive component (LPC), became larger in response to losses as the learning-set progressed, but smaller in response to gains. Additionally, immediately following feedback presentation, brain activity in the visual cortex - read out through alpha frequency oscillations measured over occipital sites - was predictive of the amplitude of the N2pc ERP component, a marker of spatial attention orienting, observed on the next trial. Taken together, we elucidated neurocognitive dynamics underlying feedback processing in spatial reward learning, and the subsequent effects that spatial stimulus-reward association learning have on spatial attention.

                Spontaneous network bursts, the intervals of intense network-wide activity interleaved with longer periods of sparse activity, are a hallmark phenomenon observed in cortical networks at postnatal developmental stages. Generation, propagation and termination of network bursts depend on a combination of synaptic, cellular and network mechanisms; however, the interplay between these mechanisms is not fully understood. We study this interplay in silico, using a new data-driven framework for generating spiking neuronal networks fitted to the microelectrode array recordings. We recorded the network bursting activity from rat postnatal cortical networks under several pharmacological conditions. In each condition, the function of specific excitatory and inhibitory synaptic receptors was reduced in order to examine their impact on global network dynamics. The obtained data was used to develop two complementary model fitting protocols for automatic model generation. These protocols allowed us to disentangle systematically the modeled cellular and synaptic mechanisms that affect the observed network bursts. We confirmed that the change in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in silico, consistent with pharmacological conditions, can account for the changes in network bursts relative to the control data. Reproducing the exact recorded network bursts statistics required adapting both the synaptic transmission and the cellular excitability separately for each pharmacological condition. Our results bring new understanding of the complex interplay between cellular, synaptic and network mechanisms supporting the burst dynamics. While here we focused on analysis of in vitro data, our approach can be applied ex vivo and in vivo given that the appropriate experimental data is available.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A retrograde mechanism coordinates memory allocation across brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Memories engage ensembles of neurons across different brain regions within a memory system. However, it is unclear whether the allocation of a memory to these ensembles is coordinated across brain regions. To address this question, we used CREB expression to bias memory allocation in one brain region, and rabies retrograde tracing to test memory allocation in connected presynaptic neurons in the other brain regions. We find that biasing allocation of CTA memory in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) also biases memory allocation in presynaptic neurons of the insular cortex (IC). By manipulating the allocation of CTA memory to specific neurons in both BLA and IC, we found that we increased their connectivity and enhanced CTA memory performance. These results, which are corroborated by mathematical simulations and by studies with auditory fear conditioning, demonstrate that a retrograde mechanism coordinates the allocation of memories across different brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Co-allocation to overlapping dendritic branches in the retrosplenial cortex integrates contextual memories across time</a></h4>

              
                Events occurring close in time are often linked in memory, providing an episodic timeline and a framework for those memories. Recent studies suggest that memories acquired close in time are encoded by overlapping neuronal ensembles, and that this overlap is necessary for memory linking. Transient increases in neuronal excitability drive this ensemble overlap, but whether dendritic plasticity plays a role in linking memories is unknown. Here, we show that contextual memory linking is not only dependent on ensemble overlap in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), but also on RSC branch-specific dendritic allocation mechanisms. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of RSC dendrites, we show that the same dendritic segments are preferentially activated by two linked (but not independent) contextual memories, and that spine clusters added after each of two linked (but not independent) contextual memories are allocated to the same dendritic segments. Importantly, with a novel optogenetic tool, selectively targeted to activated dendritic segments following learning, we show that reactivation of dendrites tagged during the first context exploration is sufficient to link two contextual memories. These results demonstrate a causal role for dendritic mechanisms in memory linking and reveal a novel set of rules that govern how linked, and independent memories are allocated to dendritic compartments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Finger representations in primary somatosensory cortex are modulated during vibrotactile working memory</a></h4>

              
                It is well-established that vibrotactile stimulations elicit Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in somatotopically organized brain regions. Whether these somatotopic maps are modulated by working memory (WM) is still unknown. In our WM experiment, participants had to compare frequencies that were separated by a delay period. Vibrotactile stimuli were sequentially applied to either their right index or little finger. Using functional MRI, we investigated whether vibrotactile WM modulated neural activity in primary somatosensory (S1), an area that is known to contain individual finger representations. Our mass-univariate results revealed the well-described network of brain regions involved in WM. Interestingly, our mass-univariate results did not demonstrate S1 to be part of this network. However, when we parametrically modulated the time-binned regressors in our GLM we found that the delay activity in S1 and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) was reflected in a U-shaped manner. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), an analysis technique that is more sensitive to subtle activity differences, we found finger-specific patterns of activation in the S1 hand area during the WM delay period. These results indicate that processes underlying WM modulate finger-specific representations during our discrimination task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mean field approximation of network of biophysical neurons driven by conductance-based ion exchange dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Changes in extracellular ion concentrations are known to modulate neuronal excitability and play a major role in controlling the neuronal firing rate, not just during the healthy homeostasis, but also in pathological conditions such as epilepsy. The microscopic molecular mechanisms of field effects are understood, but the precise correspondence between the microscopic mechanisms of ion exchange in the cellular space of neurons and the macroscopic behavior of neuronal populations remains to be established. We derive a mean field model of a population of Hodgkin Huxley type neurons. This model links the neuronal intra- and extra-cellular ion concentrations to the mean membrane potential and the mean synaptic input in terms of the synaptic conductance of the locally homogeneous mesoscopic network and can describe various brain activities including multi-stability at resting states, as well as more pathological spiking and bursting behaviors, and depolarizations. The results from the analytical solution of the mean field model agree with the mean behavior of numerical simulations of large-scale networks of neurons. The mean field model is analytically exact for non-autonomous ion concentration variables and provides a mean field approximation in the thermodynamic limit, for locally homogeneous mesoscopic networks of biophysical neurons driven by an ion exchange mechanism. These results may provide the missing link between high-level neural mass approaches which are used in the brain network modeling and physiological parameters that drive the neuronal dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variations in EEG predicts the individual differences in social tasks</a></h4>

              
                People experience events and form an impression of others in a way that is affected by social influence every day. In the present study, we designed a series of experiments centered on social influence to investigate people's bias in following others' opinions and its underlying neural predictors. Our results showed social conformity and proved that social influence-induced change can be predicted by the amount of electroencephalogram (EEG) variations when people view others' faces. This prediction effect is robust in the alpha-band over the right frontal and left occipital electrodes for negative influence. EEG variations can also predict the subsequent trust difference between negatively and positively influenced faces. Our findings suggest that higher EEG variations in the pre-influence task may serve as a predictor of high vulnerability to social influence. The present study provides a novel approach that considers both the stability of one's endogenous EEG and the variations in external task components to predict human social behaviors.

	<p>Introduction: Depression is highly prevalent and causes considerable suffering and disease burden despite the existence of wide-ranging treatment options. Momentary assessment is a promising tool in the management of psychiatric disorders, and particularly depression. It allows for a real-time evaluation of symptoms and an earlier detection of relapse or treatment efficacy. Treating the motivational and hedonic aspects of depression is a key target reported in the literature, but it is time-consuming in terms of human resources. Digital Applications offer a major opportunity to indirectly regulate impaired motivational circuits through dopaminergic pathways. Objective: The main objective of this review was twofold: (1) propose a conceptual and critical review of the literature regarding the theoretical and technical principles of digital applications focused on motivation in depression, activating dopamine, and (2) suggest recommendations on the relevance of using these tools and their potential place in the treatment of depression. Material and Methods: A search for words related to “dopamine”, “depression”, “smartphone apps”, “digital phenotype” has been conducted on PubMed. Results: Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) differ from traditional treatments by providing relevant, useful intervention strategies in the context of people’s daily lives. EMIs triggered by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) are called “Smart-EMI”. Smart-EMIs can mimic the “dopamine reward system” if the intervention is tailored for motivation or hedonic enhancement, and it has been shown that a simple reward (such as a digital badge) can increase motivation. Discussion: The various studies presented support the potential interest of digital health in effectively motivating depressed patients to adopt therapeutic activation behaviors. Finding effective ways to integrate EMIs with human-provided therapeutic support may ultimately yield the most efficient and effective intervention method. This approach could be a helpful tool to increase adherence and motivation. Conclusion: Smartphone apps can motivate depressed patients by enhancing dopamine, offering the opportunity to enhance motivation and behavioral changes, although longer term studies are still needed.</p>

	<p>Dissociated cortical neurons in vitro display spontaneously synchronized, low-frequency firing patterns, which can resemble the slow wave oscillations characterizing sleep in vivo. Experiments in humans, rodents, and cortical slices have shown that awakening or the administration of activating neuromodulators decrease slow waves, while increasing the spatio-temporal complexity of responses to perturbations. In this study, we attempted to replicate those findings using in vitro cortical cultures coupled with micro-electrode arrays and chemically treated with carbachol (CCh), to modulate sleep-like activity and suppress slow oscillations. We adapted metrics such as neural complexity (NC) and the perturbational complexity index (PCI), typically employed in animal and human brain studies, to quantify complexity in simplified, unstructured networks, both during resting state and in response to electrical stimulation. After CCh administration, we found a decrease in the amplitude of the initial response and a marked enhancement of the complexity during spontaneous activity. Crucially, unlike in cortical slices and intact brains, PCI in cortical cultures displayed only a moderate increase. This dissociation suggests that PCI, a measure of the complexity of causal interactions, requires more than activating neuromodulation and that additional factors, such as an appropriate circuit architecture, may be necessary. Exploring more structured in vitro networks, characterized by the presence of strong lateral connections, recurrent excitation, and feedback loops, may thus help to identify the features that are more relevant to support causal complexity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Do crocodiles have a zona incerta?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In mammals, the zona incerta is thought to be involved in a number of behaviors: visceral activity; arousal; attention; and posture and locomotion. These diverse and complex features suggested that the zona incerta functions as a global or integrative node. Nevertheless, despite multiple investigations into its anatomy, physiology, and behavior in a variety of mammals, no specific character identifies the zona incerta besides its appearance in fiber-stained material and its relationship to surrounding structures. One such structure is the thalamic reticular nucleus whose caudal pole often contains some intermingled cells of the zona incerta. In crocodilians, the entopeduncular nucleus abuts the caudal pole of the thalamic reticular nucleus and displays different immunohistochemical properties and soma size when compared with neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus itself. To determine if neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, the entopeduncular nucleus was investigated using Golgi methodology. The morphology and soma size of neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus and indicated that these two areas are indeed separate neuronal aggregates. Based on these data and the known relationships of the zona incerta to surrounding structures in mammals, the entopeduncular nucleus of crocodilians is suggested to be the counterpart of the zona incerta of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronally Produced Betaine Acts via a Novel Ligand Gated Ion Channel to Control Behavioural States</a></h4>

              
                Trimethyl glycine, or betaine, is an amino acid derivative found in diverse organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. It can function as an osmolyte to protect cells against osmotic stress, and building evidence suggests betaine may also play important functional roles in the nervous system. However, despite growing interest in betaine's roles in the nervous system, few molecular mechanisms have been elucidated. Here we identify the expression of betaine synthesis pathway genes in the nervous system of the nematode worm, C. elegans. We show that betaine, produced in a single pair of interneurons, the RIMs, can control complex behavioural states. Moreover, we also identify and characterise a new betaine-gated inhibitory ligand gated ion channel, LGC-41, which is required for betaine related behavioural changes. Intriguingly we observed expression of LGC-41 in punctate structures across several sensory and interneurons, including those synaptically connected to the RIMs. Our data presents a neuronal molecular mechanism for the action of betaine, via a specific receptor, in the control of complex behaviour within the nervous system of C. elegans. This may suggest a much broader role for betaine in the regulation of animal nervous systems than previously recognised.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural substrate for Bayesian integration in human parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Making adaptive decisions often requires inferring unobservable states based on unreliable information. Bayesian logic prescribes that individuals form probabilistic beliefs about a state by integrating the likelihood of new evidence with their prior beliefs, but human neuroimaging studies on probability representations have not typically examined this integration process. We developed an inference fMRI task in which participants estimated the posterior probability of a hidden state while we parametrically modulated the prior probability of the state, the likelihood of the supporting evidence, and a monetary penalty for estimation inaccuracy. Consistent with a neural substrate for Bayesian integration, activation in left posterior parietal cortex tracked the estimated posterior probability of the solicited state and its components of prior probability and likelihood, all independently of expected value. This activation further reflected deviations in individual reports from objective probabilities. Thus, this region may provide a neural substrate for humans' ability to approximate Bayesian inference.

	<p>Choosing optimal anti-seizure medication (ASM) is very important in pediatric patients with epilepsy who attend school, especially children with an intellectual disability (ID). Levetiracetam (LEV) has proven to be an effective, safe, generally well-tolerated, broad-spectrum ASM in children. In the context of increasing use of LEV in school-aged children with epilepsy and ID, we evaluate relevant clinical data, including efficacy, safety, and tolerability in children with epilepsy and an intellectual disability (ID) or normal intelligence (NI). We performed a retrospective chart review of children and included 298 pediatric patients with epilepsy who were treated with LEV with NI (147) and ID (151). After 6 months, 96% of NI and 83% of ID subjects had a seizure reduction rate greater than 50% (p = 0.031). The tolerability of LEV was generally good, with 75% retention rates at 2 years in both groups and only minor side effects (under 15%). The retention rates of patients with NI and ID were 76% and 74%, respectively (p = 0.597). Thus, LEV showed considerable efficacy with minimal side effects and high retention rates and is an easily maintained and safe treatment option for pediatric epilepsy with ID. However, better-designed research studies are needed to clearly elucidate the efficacy and safety of LEV in children with epilepsy and ID.</p>

	<p>Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a high-efficiency transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm that has been applied to post-stroke aphasia (PSA). However, its efficacy mechanisms have not been clarified. This study aimed to explore the immediate effects of iTBS of the primary motor cortex (M1) of the affected hemisphere, on the functional activities and connectivity of the brains of PSA patients. A total of 16 patients with aphasia after stroke received iTBS with 800 pulses for 300 s. All patients underwent motor, language, and cognitive assessments and resting-state functional MRI scans immediately before and after the iTBS intervention. Regional, seed-based connectivity, and graph-based measures were used to test the immediate functional effects of the iTBS intervention, including the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), degree centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC) of the left M1 area throughout the whole brain. The results showed that after one session of iTBS intervention, the fALFF, DC, and FC values changed significantly in the patients’ brains. Specifically, the DC values were significantly higher in the right middle frontal gyrus and parts of the left parietal lobe (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while fALFF values were significantly lower in the right medial frontal lobe and parts of the left intracalcarine cortex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and the strength of the functional connectivity between the left M1 area and the left superior frontal gyrus was reduced (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Our findings provided preliminary evidences that the iTBS on the ipsilesional M1 could induce neural activity and functional connectivity changes in the motor, language, and other brain regions in patients with PSA, which may promote neuroplasticity and functional recovery.</p>

	<p>Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads are now widely used, but the orientation of directional leads needs to be taken into account when relating DBS to neuroanatomy. Methods that can reliably and unambiguously determine the orientation of directional DBS leads are needed. In this study, we provide an enhanced algorithm that determines the orientation of directional DBS leads from postoperative CT scans. To resolve the ambiguity of symmetric CT artifacts, which in the past, limited the orientation detection to two possible solutions, we retrospectively evaluated four different methods in 150 Cartesia™ directional leads, for which the true solution was known from additional X-ray images. The method based on shifts of the center of mass (COM) of the directional marker compared to its expected geometric center correctly resolved the ambiguity in 100% of cases. In conclusion, the DiODe v2 algorithm provides an open-source, fully automated solution for determining the orientation of directional DBS leads.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This observational cohort study aims to quantify disease burden over time, establish disease progression rates and identify factors that may determine the disease course of Leigh syndrome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy-two Leigh syndrome children who completed the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scales (NPMDS) at baseline 3.7 years (IQR 2.0-7.6) and follow-up assessments 7.5 years (IQR 3.7-11.0) in clinics were enrolled. 82% of this cohort had a confirmed genetic diagnosis with pathogenic variants in the <i>MT-ATP6</i> and <i>SURF1</i> genes being the most common cause. The total NPMDS scores denoted mild (0-14), moderate (15-25) and severe (&gt;25) disease burden. Detailed clinical, neuroradiological and molecular genetic findings were also analysed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median total NPMDS scores rose significantly (<i>Z</i>=-6.9, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and the percentage of children with severe disease burden doubled (22%→42%) over 2.6 years of follow-up. Poor function (especially mobility, self-care, communication, feeding and education) and extrapyramidal features contributed significantly to the disease burden (<i>τ</i>
<sub>b</sub>≈0.45-0.68, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). These children also deteriorated to wheelchair dependence (31%→57%), exclusive enteral feeding (22%→46%) and one-to-one assistance for self-care (25%→43%) during the study period. Twelve children (17%) died after their last NPMDS scores were recorded. These children had higher follow-up NPMDS scores (disease burden) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and steeper increase in NPMDS score per annum (disease progression) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001). Other predictors of poor outcomes include <i>SURF1</i> gene variants (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and bilateral caudate changes on neuroimaging (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study has objectively defined the disease burden and progression of Leigh syndrome<b>.</b> Our analysis has also uncovered potential influences on the trajectory of this neurodegenerative condition.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are abundant cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and are involved in processes including synapse formation/function, ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter uptake, and neurovascular coupling. Recent evidence indicates that astrocytes show diverse molecular, structural, and physiological properties within the CNS. This heterogeneity is reflected in differences in astrocyte structure, gene expression, functional properties, and responsiveness to injury/pathological conditions. Deeper investigation of astrocytic heterogeneity is needed to understand how astrocytes are configured to enable diverse roles in the CNS. While much has been learned about astrocytic heterogeneity in rodents, much less is known about astrocytic heterogeneity in the primate brain where astrocytes have greater size and complexity. The common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) is a promising non-human primate model because of similarities between marmosets and humans with respect to genetics, brain anatomy, and cognition/behavior. Here, we investigated the molecular and structural heterogeneity of marmoset astrocytes using an array of astrocytic markers, multi-label confocal microscopy, and quantitative analysis. We used male and female marmosets and found that marmoset astrocytes show differences in expression of astrocytic markers in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. These differences were accompanied by intra-regional variation in expression of markers for glutamate/GABA transporters, and potassium and water channels. Differences in astrocyte structure were also found, along with complex interactions with blood vessels, microglia, and neurons. This study contributes to our knowledge of the cellular and molecular features of marmoset astrocytes and is useful for understanding the complex properties of astrocytes in the primate CNS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder involving defective peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), due to mutation in the <i>ABCD1</i> gene. X-ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism and confers a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Remarkably, a subset of patients exhibit a cerebral form with inflammatory invasion of the central nervous system and extensive demyelination, while in others only dying-back axonopathy or even isolated adrenal insufficiency is seen, without genotype–phenotype correlation. X-ALD's biochemical signature is marked elevation of VLCFAs in blood, a finding that has been utilized for massive newborn screening for early diagnosis. Investigational gene therapy approaches hold promises for improved outcomes. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease remain poorly understood, limiting investigation of targeted therapeutic options. Animal models for the disease recapitulate the biochemical signature of VLCFA accumulation and demonstrate mitochondrially generated reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage, increased glial death, and axonal damage. Most strikingly, however, cerebral invasion of leukocytes and demyelination were not observed in any animal model for X-ALD, reflecting upon pathological processes that are yet to be discovered. This review summarizes the current disease models in animals, the lessons learned from these models, and the gaps that remained to be filled in order to assist in therapeutic investigations for ALD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Xenon is an inert gas with stable chemical properties which is used as an anesthetic. Recent <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> findings indicate that xenon also elicits an excellent neuroprotective effect in subanesthetic concentrations. The mechanisms underlying this primarily involve the attenuation of excitotoxicity and the inhibition of N-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and NMDA receptor-related effects, such as antioxidative effects, reduced activation of microglia, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms, as well as the interaction with certain ion channels and glial cells. Based on this strong neuroprotective role, a large number of experimental and clinical studies have confirmed the significant therapeutic effect of xenon in the treatment of neurological diseases. This review summarizes the reported neuroprotective mechanisms of xenon and discusses its possible therapeutic application in the treatment of various neurological diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mispatterned motile cilia beating causes flow blockage in the epileptic brain</a></h4>

              
                Beating of motile cilia at the brain ventricular surface generates rapid flow in an evolutionary conserved pattern mediating the transport of cerebrospinal fluid, but its functional importance has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show disturbance of this transport may contribute to seizure susceptibility. Mice haploinsufficient for FoxJ1, transcription factor regulating motile cilia exhibited cilia-driven flow blockage and increased seizure susceptibility. Mutations in two epilepsy-associated kinases, Cdkl5 and Yes1, in mice resulted in similar cilia-driven flow blockage and increased seizure susceptibility. We showed this arises from disorganized cilia polarity associated with disruption in the highly organized basal body anchoring meshwork. Together these findings suggest mispatterning of cilia-generated flow may contribute to epilepsy and thus might account for seizures unresponsive to current seizure medications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping neurotransmitter systems to the structural and functional organization of the human neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter receptors support the propagation of signals in the human brain. How receptor systems are situated within macroscale neuroanatomy and how they shape emergent function remains poorly understood, and there exists no comprehensive atlas of receptors. Here we collate positron emission tomography scans in >1,200 healthy individuals to construct a whole-brain 3-D normative atlas of 18 receptors and transporters across 9 different neurotransmitter systems. We find that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and resting state hemodynamic functional connectivity. Using the Neurosynth cognitive atlas, we uncover a topographic gradient of overlapping receptor distributions that separates extrinsic and intrinsic psychological processes. Finally, we find both expected and novel associations between receptor distributions and cortical thinning patterns across 13 disorders. We replicate all findings in an independently collected autoradiography dataset. This work demonstrates how chemoarchitecture shapes brain structure and function, providing a new direction for studying multi-scale brain organization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correcting the Hebbian Mistake: Toward a Fully Error-Driven Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a critical role in the rapid learning of new episodic memories. Many computational models propose that the hippocampus is an autoassociator that relies on Hebbian learning (i.e., "cells that fire together, wire together"). However, Hebbian learning is computationally suboptimal as it modifies weights unnecessarily beyond what is actually needed to achieve effective retrieval, causing more interference and resulting in a lower learning capacity. Our previous computational models have utilized a powerful, biologically plausible form of error-driven learning in hippocampal CA1 and entorhinal cortex (EC) (functioning as a sparse autoencoder) by contrasting local activity states at different phases in the theta cycle. Based on specific neural data and a recent abstract computational model, we propose a new model called Theremin (Total Hippocampal ERror MINimization) that extends error-driven learning to area CA3 --- the mnemonic heart of the hippocampal system. In the model, CA3 responds to the EC monosynaptic input prior to the EC disynaptic input through dentate gyrus (DG), giving rise to a temporal difference between these two activation states, which drives error-driven learning in the EC->CA3 and CA3<->CA3 projections. In effect, DG serves as a teacher to CA3, correcting its patterns into more pattern-separated ones, thereby reducing interference. Results showed that Theremin, compared with our original model, has significantly increased capacity and learning speed. The model makes several novel predictions that can be tested in future studies.

	<p>Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is not a defined, separate disease classification, but a set of etiologically diverse symptoms that change with the child’s age. According to the up-to-date definition, CP is a group of permanent but not unchanging disorders of movement and/or posture and motor function, which are due to a nonprogressive interference, lesion, or abnormality of the developing/immature brain. CP is one of the most frequent causes of motor disability in children. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether selected risk factors may vary depending on particular types of CP. Methods: 181 children with CP (aged 4–17 years), hospitalized at the Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Age Neurology in Katowice in the years 2008–2016 were retrospectively analyzed in the present study. The assumed risk factors of CP were divided into two groups: 1—pre-conception and prenatal (mother’s age, family history of epilepsy, burdened obstetric history, mother’s systemic diseases, pregnancy order, multiple pregnancy, duration of pregnancy, bleedings from the genital tract during gestation, arterial hypertension during pregnancy, infections during pregnancy, preterm contractions, maintained pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes, abruptio placentae, and others), 2—perinatal and postnatal (mode of delivery, birth weight, Apgar score at the first and fifth minute, neonatal convulsions, respiratory failure, infections in neonatal and infant period, and intraventricular bleeding). The division into particular CP types was based on Ingram’s classification. Results: The following risk factors were the most frequent in the total group: respiratory failure, infections, intraventricular bleeding, and prematurity. Among the analyzed preconception and prenatal factors, the duration of pregnancy and preterm contractions during pregnancy significantly differentiated the subgroups of patients depending on the type of CP. The prevalence of almost all analyzed perinatal, neonatal, and infant-related risk factors (i.e., birth weight, Apgar score at the first and fifth minute, neonatal convulsions, respiratory failure, infections in neonatal and infant period, and intraventricular bleeding) significantly differed between CP types, apart from the mode of delivery. However, in multivariate regression, only intraventricular bleeding was an independent predictor for tetraplegic CP type when compared to joined extrapyramidal and ataxic types (OR = 2.801, p = 0.028). Conclusions: As CP is a syndrome of multifactorial etiology, the identification of CP risk factors entails the need for careful observation and comprehensive care of children in the risk group. The presence of certain risk factors may be a prognostic indicator for particular types of CP. The knowledge about the association between the risk factor(s) and the CP type could be a very useful tool for pediatricians looking after the child at risk of developmental disorders.</p>

	<p>Social distancing was universally implemented to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Long-term social distancing can lead to increased feelings of social isolation or dissatisfaction with one’s daily interpersonal interactions, which can subsequently result in reduced psychological health (e.g., greater depression). The present study quantified this association, and the extent to which it was moderated by measures of sleep and physical activity, by surveying 3658 adults (mean age = 46.0 years) from across the United States. Participants answered questions related to their social experiences, sleep, physical activity, and depressive symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic (March–June 2020). Results showed that social isolation and social dissatisfaction were associated with greater depressive symptoms. As predicted, self-reported sleep quality and physical activity moderated these associations, such that lower sleep quality and physical activity exacerbated their effect on depressive symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">TwinCons: Conservation score for uncovering deep sequence similarity and divergence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Petar I. Penev, Claudia Alvarez-Carreño, Eric Smith, Anton S. Petrov, Loren Dean Williams</p>

We have developed the program TwinCons, to detect noisy signals of deep ancestry of proteins or nucleic acids. As input, the program uses a composite alignment containing pre-defined groups, and mathematically determines a ‘cost’ of transforming one group to the other at each position of the alignment. The output distinguishes conserved, variable and signature positions. A signature is conserved within groups but differs between groups. The method automatically detects continuous characteristic stretches (segments) within alignments. TwinCons provides a convenient representation of conserved, variable and signature positions as a single score, enabling the structural mapping and visualization of these characteristics. Structure is more conserved than sequence. TwinCons highlights alternative sequences of conserved structures. Using TwinCons, we detected highly similar segments between proteins from the translation and transcription systems. TwinCons detects conserved residues within regions of high functional importance for the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and demonstrates that signatures are not confined to specific regions but are distributed across the rRNA structure. The ability to evaluate both nucleic acid and protein alignments allows TwinCons to be used in combined sequence and structural analysis of signatures and conservation in rRNA and in ribosomal proteins (rProteins). TwinCons detects a strong sequence conservation signal between bacterial and archaeal rProteins related by circular permutation. This conserved sequence is structurally colocalized with conserved rRNA, indicated by TwinCons scores of rRNA alignments of bacterial and archaeal groups. This combined analysis revealed deep co-evolution of rRNA and rProtein buried within the deepest branching points in the tree of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Point-estimating observer models for latent cause detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Laura Lee, Wei Ji Ma</p>

The spatial distribution of visual items allows us to infer the presence of latent causes in the world. For instance, a spatial cluster of ants allows us to infer the presence of a common food source. However, optimal inference requires the integration of a computationally intractable number of world states in real world situations. For example, optimal inference about whether a common cause exists based on <i>N</i> spatially distributed visual items requires marginalizing over both the location of the latent cause and 2<sup>N</sup> possible affiliation patterns (where each item may be affiliated or non-affiliated with the latent cause). How might the brain approximate this inference? We show that subject behaviour deviates qualitatively from Bayes-optimal, in particular showing an unexpected positive effect of <i>N</i> (the number of visual items) on the false-alarm rate. We propose several “point-estimating” observer models that fit subject behaviour better than the Bayesian model. They each avoid a costly computational marginalization over at least one of the variables of the generative model by “committing” to a point estimate of at least one of the two generative model variables. These findings suggest that the brain may implement partially committal variants of Bayesian models when detecting latent causes based on complex real world data.

                Background: With the tremendous increase in the usage of smart meters for industrial/ household purposes, their implementation is considered a crucial challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) world, leading to a demand for emerging 5G technology. In addition, a large amount of data has to be communicated by smart meters efficiently, which needs a significant enhancement in bandwidth. The power amplifier (PA) plays a major role in deciding the efficiency and bandwidth of the entire communication system. Among the various modes of PAs, a newly developed Class-J mode PA has been proven to achieve high efficiency over a wide bandwidth by maintaining linearity. Methods: This paper proposes a Class-J mode PA design methodology using a CGH40010F-GaN device that operates at a 3.5 GHz frequency to meet the requirements of 5G wireless communication technology for the replacement of existing 4G/LTE technology used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids. This research's main objective is to design the proper matching networks (M.Ns) to achieve Class-J mode operation that satisfies the bandwidth requirements of 5G smart grid applications. With the target impedances obtained using the load-pull simulation, lumped element matching networks are analyzed and designed in 3 ways using the ADS EDA tool. Results: The simulation results reveal that the proposed Class-J PA provides a maximum drain efficiency (D.E) of 82%, power added efficiency (PAE) of 67% with 13 dB small-signal gain at 3.5 GHz, and output power of 40 dBm (41.4 dBm peak) with a power gain of approximately 7 dB over a bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz with a 28 V power supply into a 50 Ω load. Conclusion: The efficiency and bandwidth of the proposed Class-J PA can be enhanced further by fine-tuning the matching network design to make it more suitable for 5G smart meter/grid applications.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives of the study were to characterize autistic features in young children with TSC.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 138 children followed from ages 3 to 36 months with TSC from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASD in TSC. Developmental and autism-specific assessments were administered, and a clinical diagnosis of ASD was determined for all participants at 36 months. Further analyses were performed on 117 participants with valid autism assessments based on nonverbal mental age greater than 15 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prevalence of clinical diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was 25%. Nearly all autistic behaviors on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were more prevalent in children diagnosed with ASD; however, autism-specific behaviors were also observed in children without ASD. Overall quality of social overtures, facial expressions, and abnormal repetitive interests and behaviors were characteristics most likely to distinguish children with ASD from those without an ASD diagnosis. Participants meeting ADOS-2 criteria but not a clinical ASD diagnosis exhibited intermediate developmental and ADOS-2 scores compared to individuals with and without ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASD is highly prevalent in TSC, and many additional individuals with TSC exhibit a broad range of subthreshold autistic behaviors. Our findings reveal a broader autism phenotype that can be identified in young children with TSC, which provides opportunity for early targeted treatments. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epilepsy is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures attributed to the disruption of the dynamic excitatory and inhibitory balance in the brain. Epilepsy has emerged as a global health concern affecting about 70 million people worldwide. Despite recent advances in pre-clinical and clinical research, its etiopathogenesis remains obscure, and there are still no treatment strategies modifying disease progression. Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis have not been clarified yet, the role of ion channels as regulators of cellular excitability has increasingly gained attention. In this regard, emerging evidence highlights the potential implication of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in epileptogenesis. Kir channels consist of seven different subfamilies (Kir1–Kir7), and they are highly expressed in both neuronal and glial cells in the central nervous system. These channels control the cell volume and excitability. In this review, we discuss preclinical and clinical evidence on the role of the several subfamilies of Kir channels in epileptogenesis, aiming to shed more light on the pathogenesis of this disorder and pave the way for future novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

                Visually impaired persons face challenges in running business activities, especially in handling banknotes. Malaysia researchers had proposed some Ringgit banknotes recognition systems to aid visually impaired persons recognize and classify Ringgit banknotes. However, these electronic banknote readers can only recognize Malaysian Banknotes’ Ringgit value, they have no counterfeit detection features. The purpose of this study is to develop a banknote reader that not only can help visually impaired persons recognize the banknote value, but also to detect the counterfeit of the banknote, safeguarding their losses. This paper proposed a Malaysian banknote reader using backlight mechanism and image processing techniques to read and detect counterfeit for one Ringgit and five Ringgit Malaysian banknotes. The developed handheld banknote reader used visual type sensor to capture banknote image, passed to raspberry pi controller to perform image processing on banknote value and the extracted watermarks features. The developed image processing algorithm will trace out the region of interests: 1)see-thru windows, 2)Crescent and Star, 3)Perfect see though register and detect the watermarks features accordingly. The processed result will be passed back to the handheld banknote reader and broadcast on an attached mini speaker to aid the visually impaired understand the holding banknote, whether it is a real one Ringgit, real five Ringgit or none of them. The experimental result shown by this approach able to accomplish numerous round of banknote reading attempts with successful outcomes. Confusion matrix is further employed to study the performance of the banknote reader, in terms of true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. Details analysis had been focused on the critical false positive cases (predicted real banknote and actually is fake banknote) and false negative cases (predicted fake banknote and it is actually real banknote).

                Clinical presentation of liver hydatidosis can vary from asymptomatic forms to lethal complications. We report a rare case of a 27-year-old male from a rural Tunisian region who presented with large-abundance haematemesis, haemodynamic instability, and marked biological signs of hypersplenism. Endoscopy showed bleeding esophageal varicose veins that were ligated. Abdominal ultrasound concluded the presence of three type CE2 hydatic liver cysts causing portal cavernoma with signs of portal hypertension. Despite resuscitation, the patient died of massive rebleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock. Hepatic hydatid cyst should be considered as an indirect cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in endemic countries. Early abdominal ultrasound in varicose haemorrhage is essential in orienting the diagnosis.

<p><i>Faim</i> knockout mice present early aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, chronic gliosis, blood-retinal barrier disruption and alterations in survival pathways that culminate in photoreceptor cell death. We think FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis and a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fas Apoptotic Inhibitory Molecule protein (FAIM) is a death receptor antagonist and an apoptosis regulator. It encodes two isoforms, namely FAIM-S (short) and FAIM-L (long), both with significant neuronal functions. FAIM-S, which is ubiquitously expressed, is involved in neurite outgrowth. In contrast, FAIM-L is expressed only in neurons and it protects them from cell death. Interestingly, FAIM-L is downregulated in patients and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease before the onset of neurodegeneration, and <i>Faim</i> transcript levels are decreased in mouse models of retinal degeneration. However, few studies have addressed the role of FAIM in the central nervous system, yet alone the retina. The retina is a highly specialized tissue, and its degeneration has proved to precede pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe that <i>Faim</i> depletion in mice damages the retina persistently and leads to late-onset photoreceptor death in older mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that <i>Faim</i> knockout (<i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup>) mice present ubiquitinated aggregates throughout the retina from early ages. Moreover, retinal cells released stress signals that can signal to Müller cells, as shown by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR. Müller cells monitor retinal homeostasis and trigger a gliotic response in <i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice that becomes pathogenic when sustained. In this regard, we observed pronounced vascular leakage at later ages, which may be caused by persistent inflammation. These results suggest that FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis, and they support the premise that FAIM is a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration.</p>

     alt="Long-term hypogonadism diminishes the neuroprotective effects of dietary genistein in young adult ovariectomized rats after transient focal ischemia"/>
<p>After short-term, but not after long-term hypogonadism, estrogen and genistein reduced strike-induced infarct in ovariectomize female rats. Estrogen improved neurological function after long-term hypogonadism. Genistein improved aspects of cognition independent of length of hypogonadism. These data support differential benefits of estrogen and genistein after loss of endogenous steroids.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing age disproportionately increases the risk of stroke among women compared to men of similar age, especially after menopause. One of the reasons for this observation is a sharp drop in circulating estrogens. However, the timing of initiation of estrogen replacement after menopause is associated with mixed beneficial and detrimental effects, hence contributing to widespread mistrust of estrogen use. Agents including soy isoflavones are being assessed as viable alternatives to estrogen therapy. In this study, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effects of genistein, a soy isoflavone are less sensitive to the length of hypogonadism in young adult ovariectomized rats following cerebral ischemia. We expected that long-term hypogonadism will worsen motor and cognitive function, increase post-stroke inflammation with no effect on the neuroprotection of genistein. We compared the effect of treatment with dietary genistein (GEN) on short-term (2 weeks) and long-term hypogonadism (12 weeks) in young adult ovariectomized Sprague–Dawley rats on sensorimotor function, cognition and inflammation after focal ischemia. Dorsal Silastic implant of 17β-estradiol (E2) was used as a control for hormone therapy. Long-term hypogonadism stroked rats performed worse than the short-term hypogonadism stroked rats on the motor and cognitive function tests. GEN did not improve neurological assessment and motor learning after either short-term or long-term hypogonadism. GEN improved cognitive flexibility after short-term hypogonadism but not after the long-term. Both GEN and E2 reduced tissue loss after short-term hypogonadism and reduced GFAP expression at the contralateral side of ischemia after long-term hypogonadism. The length of hypogonadism may differentially influence the neuroprotective effects of both GEN and E2 on the motor and cognitive functions in young adult rats.</p>

     alt="Increased susceptibility to quinolinic acid-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations in an animal model of glutaric acidemia type I"/>
<p>Following quinolinic acid (QA) intrastriatal injection, glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) animal model is more susceptible to QA-induced severe seizures, develops spontaneous recurrent seizures, and presents increased mortality rate and persistent changes in brain cortical oscillation patterns. This emphasizes the crucial role of QA in neurological impairment in GA-I</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) is an inborn error of metabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, caused by glutaryl-CoA-dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency, characterized by the buildup of toxic organic acids predominantly in the brain. After acute catabolic states, patients usually develop striatal degeneration, but the mechanisms behind this damage are still unknown. Quinolinic acid (QA), a metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, increases especially during infections/inflammatory processes, and could act synergically with organic acids, contributing to the neurological features of GA-I. The aim of this study was to investigate whether QA increases seizure susceptibility and modifies brain oscillation patterns in an animal model of GA-I, the <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice taking high-lysine diet (<i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys). Therefore, the characteristics of QA-induced seizures and changes in brain oscillatory patterns were evaluated by video-electroencephalography (EEG) analysis recorded in <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>-</i>Lys, <i>Gcdh<sup>+/+</sup>-</i>Lys, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N (normal diet) animals. We found that the number of seizures <i>per</i> animal was similar for all groups receiving QA, <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA, <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA. However, severe seizures were observed in the majority of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA mice (82%), and only in 25% of <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA and 44% of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA mice. All <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), but <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA animals had increased number of SRS, higher mortality rate, and significant predominance of lower frequency oscillations on EEG. Our results suggest that QA plays an important role in the neurological features of GA-I, as <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys mice exhibit increased susceptibility to intrastriatal QA-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations.</p>

                Self-initiated actions in freely moving rats can be predicted by specific ensemble activity patterns in the secondary motor cortex (M2). Variability in action timing can be explained by metastable attractors in a network model of M2. Transitions between attractors are generated by low-dimensional correlated variability, empirically verified in M2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humans use forward thinking to exploit social controllability</a></h4>

              
                The controllability of our social environment has a profound impact on our behavior and mental health. Nevertheless, neurocomputational mechanisms underlying social controllability remain elusive. Here, 48 participants performed a task where their current choices either did (Controllable), or did not (Uncontrollable), influence partners’ future proposals. Computational modeling revealed that people engaged a mental model of forward thinking (FT; i.e., calculating the downstream effects of current actions) to estimate social controllability in both Controllable and Uncontrollable conditions. A large-scale online replication study (n=1342) supported this finding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (n=48), we further demonstrated that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) computed the projected total values of current actions during forward planning, supporting the neural realization of the forward-thinking model. These findings demonstrate that humans use vmPFC-dependent FT to estimate and exploit social controllability, expanding the role of this neurocomputational mechanism beyond spatial and cognitive contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Piezo1 ion channels inherently function as independent mechanotransducers</a></h4>

              
                Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint, which indirectly suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other’s spatial distribution and interact functionally. Here, we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Our data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that both at endogenous densities (1–2 channels/μm<sup>2</sup>), and at non-physiological densities (10–100 channels/μm<sup>2</sup>) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap, Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension. The results suggest that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetically engineered mice for combinatorial cardiovascular optobiology</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic effectors and sensors provide a novel real-time window into complex physiological processes, enabling determination of molecular signaling processes within functioning cellular networks. However, the combination of these optical tools in mice is made practical by construction of genetic lines that are optically compatible and genetically tractable. We present a new toolbox of 21 mouse lines with lineage-specific expression of optogenetic effectors and sensors for direct biallelic combination, avoiding the multiallelic requirement of Cre recombinase -mediated DNA recombination, focusing on models relevant for cardiovascular biology. Optogenetic effectors (11 lines) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors (10 lines) were selectively expressed in cardiac pacemaker cells, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, alveolar epithelial cells, lymphocytes, glia, and other cell types. Optogenetic effector and sensor function was demonstrated in numerous tissues. Arterial/arteriolar tone was modulated by optical activation of the second messengers InsP<sub>3</sub> (optoα1AR) and cAMP (optoß2AR), or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant membrane channels (CatCh2) in smooth muscle (<i>Acta2</i>) and endothelium (<i>Cdh5</i>). Cardiac activation was separately controlled through activation of nodal/conducting cells or cardiac myocytes. We demonstrate combined effector and sensor function in biallelic mouse crosses: optical cardiac pacing and simultaneous cardiomyocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in <i>Hcn4</i><sup>BAC</sup>-CatCh2/<i>Myh6</i>-GCaMP8 crosses. These experiments highlight the potential of these mice to explore cellular signaling in vivo, in complex tissue networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic, cellular and structural characterization of the membrane potential-dependent cell-penetrating peptide translocation pore</a></h4>

              
                Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) allow intracellular delivery of bioactive cargo molecules. The mechanisms allowing CPPs to enter cells are ill-defined. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based screening, we discovered that KCNQ5, KCNN4, and KCNK5 potassium channels positively modulate cationic CPP direct translocation into cells by decreasing the transmembrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>). These findings provide the first unbiased genetic validation of the role of Vm in CPP translocation in cells. <i>In silico</i> modeling and live cell experiments indicate that CPPs, by bringing positive charges on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, decrease the V<sub>m</sub> to very low values (-150 mV or less), a situation we have coined megapolarization that then triggers formation of water pores used by CPPs to enter cells. Megapolarization lowers the free energy barrier associated with CPP membrane translocation. Using dyes of varying dimensions in CPP co-entry experiments, the diameter of the water pores in living cells was estimated to be 2(-5) nm, in accordance with the structural characteristics of the pores predicted by <i>in silico</i> modeling. Pharmacological manipulation to lower transmembrane potential boosted CPPs cellular internalization in zebrafish and mouse models. Besides identifying the first proteins that regulate CPP translocation, this work characterized key mechanistic steps used by CPPs to cross cellular membrane. This opens the ground for strategies aimed at improving the ability of cells to capture CPP-linked cargos<i> in vitro</i> and<i> in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Growth-dependent signals drive an increase in early G1 cyclin concentration to link cell cycle entry with cell growth</a></h4>

              
                Entry into the cell cycle occurs only when sufficient growth has occurred. In budding yeast, the cyclin Cln3 is thought to initiate cell cycle entry by inactivating a transcriptional repressor called Whi5. Growth-dependent changes in the concentrations of Cln3 or Whi5 have been proposed to link cell cycle entry to cell growth. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the behavior and roles of Cln3 and Whi5. Here, we found no evidence that changes in the concentration of Whi5 play a major role in controlling cell cycle entry. Rather, the data suggest that cell growth triggers cell cycle entry by driving an increase in the concentration of Cln3. We further found that accumulation of Cln3 is dependent upon homologs of mammalian SGK kinases that control cell growth and size. Together, the data are consistent with models in which Cln3 is a crucial link between cell growth and the cell cycle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Paths and pathways that generate cell-type heterogeneity and developmental progression in hematopoiesis</a></h4>

              
                Mechanistic studies of <i>Drosophila</i> lymph gland hematopoiesis are limited by the availability of cell-type specific markers. Using a combination of bulk RNA-Seq of FACS-sorted cells, single cell RNA-Seq, and genetic dissection, we identify new blood cell subpopulations along a developmental trajectory with multiple paths to mature cell types. This provides functional insights into key developmental processes and signaling pathways. We highlight metabolism as a driver of development, show that graded Pointed expression allows distinct roles in successive developmental steps, and that mature crystal cells specifically express an alternate isoform of Hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif/Sima). Mechanistically, the Musashi-regulated protein Numb facilitates Sima-dependent non-canonical, and inhibits canonical, Notch signaling. Broadly, we find that prior to making a fate choice, a progenitor selects between alternative, biologically relevant, transitory states allowing smooth transitions reflective of combinatorial expressions rather than stepwise binary decisions. Increasingly, this view is gaining support in mammalian hematopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The decoy SNARE Tomosyn sets tonic versus phasic release properties and is required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic vesicle release probability (<i>P<sub>r</sub></i>) is a key presynaptic determinant of synaptic strength established by cell intrinsic properties and further refined by plasticity. To characterize mechanisms that generate <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> heterogeneity between distinct neuronal populations, we examined glutamatergic tonic (Ib) and phasic (Is) motoneurons in Drosophila with stereotyped differences in <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> and synaptic plasticity. We found the decoy SNARE Tomosyn is differentially expressed between these motoneuron subclasses and contributes to intrinsic differences in their synaptic output. Tomosyn expression enables tonic release in Ib motoneurons by reducing SNARE complex formation and suppressing <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> to generate decreased levels of synaptic vesicle fusion and enhanced resistance to synaptic fatigue. In contrast, phasic release dominates when Tomosyn expression is low, enabling high intrinsic <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> at Is terminals at the expense of sustained release and robust presynaptic potentiation. In addition, loss of Tomosyn disrupts the ability of tonic synapses to undergo presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The consequences of group structure and efficiency benefits for the evolution of division of labour</a></h4>

              
                Recent theory has overturned the assumption that accelerating returns from individual specialisation are required to favour the evolution of division of labour. Yanni et al. (2020) showed that topologically constrained groups, where cells cooperate with only direct neighbours such as for filaments or branching growths, can evolve a reproductive division of labour even with diminishing returns from individual specialisation. We develop a conceptual framework and specific models to investigate the factors that can favour the initial evolution of reproductive division of labour. We find that selection for division of labour in topologically constrained groups: (1) is not a single mechanism to favour division of labour - depending upon details of the group structure, division of labour can be favoured for different reasons; (2) always involves an efficiency benefit at the level of group fitness; and (3) requires a mechanism of coordination to determine which individuals perform which tasks. Given that such coordination must evolve prior to or concurrently with division of labour, this could limit the extent to which topological constraints favoured the initial evolution of division of labour. We conclude by suggesting experimental designs that could determine why division of labour is favoured in the natural world.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Causal roles of prefrontal cortex during spontaneous perceptual switching are determined by brain state dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to orchestrate cognitive dynamics. However, in tests of bistable visual perception, no direct evidence supporting such presumable causal roles of the PFC has been reported. Here, using a novel brain-state-dependent neural stimulation system, we identified causal effects on percept dynamics in three PFC activities-right frontal eye fields, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and inferior frontal cortex (IFC)-. The causality is behaviourally detectable only when we track brain state dynamics and modulate the PFC activity in brain-state-/state-history-dependent manners. The behavioural effects are underpinned by transient neural changes in the brain state dynamics, and such neural effects are quantitatively explainable by structural transformations of the hypothetical energy landscapes. Moreover, these findings indicate distinct functions of the three PFC areas: in particular, the DLPFC enhances the integration of two PFC-active brain states, whereas IFC promotes the functional segregation between them. This work resolves the controversy over the PFC roles in spontaneous perceptual switching and underlines brain state dynamics in fine investigations of brain-behaviour causality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Subcortical Modulators of Human Default Mode Network Function</a></h4>

              
                The brains  default mode network (DMN) enables flexible switching between internally and externally focused cognition. Precisely how this modulation occurs is not well understood, although may involve key subcortical mechanisms, including hypothesized influences from the basal forebrain (BF) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Here, we used ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the involvement of the BF and MD across states of task-induced DMN activity modulation. Specifically, we mapped DMN activity suppression ( deactivation) when participants transitioned between rest and externally focused task performance, as well as DMN activity engagement ( activation) when task performance was internally (i.e., self) focused. Consistent with recent rodent studies, the BF showed overall activity suppression with DMN cortical regions when comparing the rest to external task conditions. Further analyses, including dynamic causal modelling, confirmed that the BF drove changes in DMN cortical activity during these rest-to-task transitions. The MD, by comparison, was specifically engaged during internally focused cognition and demonstrated a broad excitatory influence on DMN cortical activation. These results provide the first direct evidence in humans of distinct basal forebrain and thalamic circuit influences on the control of DMN function and suggest novel mechanistic avenues for ongoing translational research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artifacts in EEG-based BCI therapies: friend or foe?</a></h4>

              
                EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have promising therapeutic potential beyond traditional neurofeedback training, such as enabling personalized and optimized virtual reality (VR) neurorehabilitation paradigms where the timing and parameters of the visual experience is synchronized with specific brain-states. While BCI algorithms are often designed to focus on whichever portion of a signal is most informative, in these brain-state-synchronized applications, it is of critical importance that the resulting decoder is sensitive to physiological brain activity representative of various mental states, and not to artifacts such as those arising from naturalistic movements. In this study, we compare the relative classification accuracy with which different motor tasks can be decoded from both extracted brain activity and artifacts contained in the EEG signal. EEG data was collected from 17 chronic stroke patients while performing six different head, hand, and arm movements in a realistic VR-based neurorehabilitation paradigm. Results show that the artifact component of the EEG signal is significantly more informative than brain activity to the classifier. This finding is consistent across different feature extraction methods and classification pipelines. Whereas informative artifacts are a helpful friend in BCI-based communication applications, they can be a problematic foe in the estimation of physiological brain states.
