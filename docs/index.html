                Abstract Background Recent advancements in online gambling have significantly increased the popularity and participation in gambling activities among the general population, specifically the young generations. These changes are reshaping gambling behaviors, attracting a growing number of enthusiasts. This paper describes a dataset that maps online gambling activities among young individuals in Portugal, providing insights into their gambling prevalence, habits, behaviors, preferences, and potential antecedents and consequences of these activities. Methods A survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,993 young people in Portugal, aged between 18 and 34, to gather data on their activities. This methodology involved a quantitative telephone survey conducted in March and April 2023, utilizing quota sampling to ensure representation across various regions. The data collection process employed Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and involved rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability. Conclusion The dataset generated from this survey provides valuable insights into the patterns of online gambling activities among young Portuguese individuals. It allows researchers to explore potential risk factors, including gambling-related harm, and to understand the sociodemographic factors influencing gambling behaviors. The findings can inform interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of online gambling among youth.

[version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 2 not</a></h4>

              
                Background Interest in alternative sources of tubers and legumes has increased due to the search for raw materials with bioactive antioxidant compounds. The objective of this study was to characterize taro (TF) and sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) flours obtained by the wet (SIF-WM) and defatted (SIF-DM) methods, as alternatives for the formulation of functional foods. Methods Proximal tests were conducted to determine basic chemical composition, quantification of free polyphenols, antioxidant activity using the ABTS* radical method (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) with Trolox as a standard, and rheological analyses, including pasting curves, flow profiles, and viscoelastic properties. Microbiological characterization of the flours was also performed. Results The highest protein content was found in sacha inchi flour obtained by the defatted method (72.62%), while carbohydrates were the main component in taro flour (85.4%). In terms of antioxidant activity, taro flour showed higher values of 2.71 µmol ET/g and 7.47 mg EAG/g. Rheological analysis showed that adding taro flour increased the viscosity peak and reduced breakdown, improving gel stability. Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. were detected in taro flour. Conclusions Taro and sacha inchi flours have great potential for the development of functional products like protein snacks, with good expansion due to taro starch and are naturally gluten-free, making them suitable for people with celiac disease.

Currently, only two complete annotated mitochondrial genome assemblies are available for appendicularians, both for cryptic species of Oikopleura dioica. This underrepresentation of available appendicularian mitochondrial genomes limits environmental DNA sequencing (eDNA) studies that rely on mitochondrial markers as a taxonomic barcode. We report the complete mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation of an unknown appendicularian species isolated from the Amami Oshima island, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan, that has significant sequence difference with other currently available assemblies and will serve as a useful resource for ecological studies and further mitochondrial studies of appendicularians.

                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Campus cuisine differs substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study uses the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand university students’ food choices, employing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students in technical and health science programs from a private university in Udupi who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The duration of students’ campus residence provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, there was an absence of nutritional information displayed in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation provides insights into the role of UDF in offering nutritionally balanced meals to students, potentially contributing to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

                Background First line (1L) TP-Ex-like regimen followed by 2nd-line (2L) immunotherapy represents one of the standards of care in platinum-sensitive recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (R/M SCCHN). We report our experience from 2 tertiary care institutions of India. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients of platinum-sensitive R/M SCCHN treated with 1L weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab (PCC) regimen followed by cetuximab maintenance (if non-progressive) or 2L nivolumab or oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMCT) on progression. Overall response rates (ORR), progression-free survival after 1L and 2L (PFS-1 & PFS-2), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. Results The study included 54 patients; median age 56.5 years; 89% men; 11% had cardiac dysfunction; 13% had renal dysfunction. After 1L PCC, ORR was 59.3%; median PFS-1 was 7.031 months; 61% had progression; 35% were treated with nivolumab and 18% with OMCT. The ORR was 26.3% (nivolumab) and 10% (OMCT). Median PFS-2 was 6.5 months (nivolumab) and 2 months (OMCT). The median OS was 15.01 months (entire cohort), 20.6 months (nivolumab), and 7 months (OMCT). Grade III/IV adverse events on PCC included neutropenia (31.4%), anaemia (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.1%), and skin reaction (16.6%); no Grade-III/IV treatment-related toxicities on 2L. Conclusions  1L weekly PCC is an effective regimen for palliative therapy of platinum- sensitive R/MSCCHN with an acceptable toxicity profile. The addition of 2L nivolumab on progression further improves the outcomes.

                Rab1 is a highly conserved small GTPase that exists in humans as two isoforms: Rab1A and Rab1B, sharing 92% sequence identity. These proteins regulate vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi and within the Golgi stacks. Rab1A and Rab1B may be oncogenes, as they are frequently dysregulated in various human cancers. Moreover, they contribute to the progression of Parkinson’s disease. The availability of high-quality antibodies specific for Rab1A or Rab1B is essential to understand the distinct functions of these Rab1 proteins in both health and diseaseand to enhance the reproducibility of research involving these proteins. In this study, we characterized seven antibodies targeting Rab1A and five antibodies targeting Rab1B for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a much larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a valuable resource for the scientific community. While uses of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Dental identification methods are employed to determine a person’s identity in forensic odontology. Additionally, analyzing a person’s teeth can provide insights into their socioeconomic status, which may assist in the process of identification. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between dental health status and SES among individuals, with a focus on identifying predictors of SES based on dental health indicators Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between dental health status and socioeconomic status among 135 individuals. who had visited the Department of Oral Medicine for various forms of dental care. SES was measured according to a modified Kuppuswamy scale. The associations between SES and dental health indicators were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results Dental caries is more common in lower SES groups, attributed to factors like poor nutrition and hygiene. Partial and complete edentulism are also more prevalent in lower SES populations, often due to financial constraints and lack of awareness, leading to extractions rather than restorations. However, urban populations, regardless of SES, show greater utilization of dental restorations, likely due to the concentration of dentists in cities and access to community-based dental camps offering low-cost treatments. Periodontal diseases further reflect SES disparities. Studies show that individuals from lower SES backgrounds report more severe periodontal issues, such as gingival swelling, while higher SES groups report milder symptoms like gingival bleeding, indicating earlier intervention. Conclusion SES plays a vital role in shaping health and lifestyle outcomes. The findings in our study demonstrate the value of incorporating SES indicators, such as education, occupation, marital status, and residence, into forensic investigations to enhance the precision of identification processes.

Understanding the large-scale information processing that underlies complex human cognition is the central goal of cognitive neuroscience. While emerging activity flow models demonstrate that cognitive task information is transferred by interregional functional or structural connectivity, graph-theory-based models typically assume that neural communication occurs via the shortest path of brain networks. However, whether the shortest path is the optimal route for empirical cognitive information transmission remains unclear. Based on a large-scale activity flow mapping framework, we found that the performance of activity flow prediction with the shortest path was significantly lower than that with the direct path. The shortest path routing was superior to other network communication strategies, including search information, path ensembles, and navigation. Intriguingly, the shortest path outperformed the direct path in activity flow prediction when the physical distance constraint and asymmetric routing contribution were simultaneously considered. This study not only challenges the shortest path assumption through empirical network models but also suggests that cognitive task information routing is constrained by the spatial and functional embedding of the brain network.

Gene expression studies often use bulk RNA sequencing of mixed cell populations because single cell or sorted cell sequencing may be prohibitively expensive. However, mixed cell studies may miss expression patterns that are restricted to specific cell populations. Computational deconvolution can be used to estimate cell fractions from bulk expression data and infer average cell-type expression in a set of samples (e.g., cases or controls), but imputing sample-level cell-type expression is required for more detailed analyses, such as relating expression to quantitative traits, and is less commonly addressed. Here, we assessed the accuracy of imputing sample-level cell-type expression using a real dataset where mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and sorted (CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19) RNA sequencing data were generated from the same subjects (N=158), and pseudobulk datasets synthesised from eQTLgen single cell RNA-seq data. We compared three domain-specific methods, CIBERSORTx, bMIND and debCAM/swCAM, and two cross-domain machine learning methods, multiple response LASSO and ridge, that had not been used for this task before. We also assessed the methods according to their ability to recover differential gene expression (DGE) results. LASSO/ridge showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity for recovering DGE signals seen in observed data compared to deconvolution methods, although LASSO/ridge had higher area under curves than deconvolution methods. Machine learning methods have the potential to outperform domain-specific methods when suitable training data are available.

Aberrant alternative splicing, prevalent in cancer, impacts various cancer hallmarks involving proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Splicing disruption often results from somatic point mutations rewiring functional pathways to support cancer cell survival. We introduce iSoMAs (iSoform expression and somatic Mutation Association), an efficient computational pipeline leveraging principal component analysis technique, to explore how somatic mutations influence transcriptome-wide gene expression at the isoform level. Applying iSoMAs to 33 cancer types comprising 9,738 tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified 908 somatically mutated genes significantly associated with altered isoform expression across three or more cancer types. Mutations linked to differential isoform expression occurred through both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-acting mechanisms, involving well-known oncogenes/suppressor genes, RNA binding protein and splicing factor genes. With wet-lab experiments, we verified direct association between <i>TP53</i> mutations and differential isoform expression in cell cycle genes. Additional iSoMAs genes have been validated in the literature with independent cohorts and/or methods. Despite the complexity of cancer, iSoMAs attains computational efficiency via dimension reduction strategy and reveals critical associations between regulatory factors and transcriptional landscapes.

                <p>by Giuseppe de Alteriis, Oliver Sherwood, Alessandro Ciaramella, Robert Leech, Joana Cabral, Federico E Turkheimer, Paul Expert</p>

A crucial challenge in neuroscience involves characterising brain dynamics from high-dimensional brain recordings. Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change over time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a common theoretical framework and a clear view on the interpretation of the results derived from the dFC matrices. Moreover, the dFC community has not been using the most efficient algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently, which has prevented dFC from showing its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a framework that presents the most commonly used dFC measures in a common language and implements them in a computationally efficient way. This allows the study of brain activity at different spatio-temporal scales, down to the voxel level. DySCo provides a single framework that allows to: (1) Use dFC as a tool to capture the spatio-temporal interaction patterns of data in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities. (2) Provide a comprehensive set of measures to quantify the properties and evolution of dFC over time: the amount of connectivity, the similarity between matrices, and their informational complexity. By using and combining the DySCo measures it is possible to perform a full dFC analysis. (3) Leverage the Temporal Covariance EVD algorithm (TCEVD) to compute and store the eigenvectors and values of the dFC matrices, and then also compute the DySCo measures from the EVD. Developing the framework in the eigenvector space is orders of magnitude faster and more memory efficient than naïve algorithms in the matrix space, without loss of information. The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm from the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We show that all the proposed measures are sensitive to changes in brain configurations and consistent across time and subjects. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we performed the analysis at the voxel level, a task which is computationally demanding but easily afforded by the TCEVD.

                <p>by Joseph A Heng, Michael Woodford, Rafael Polania</p>

The ability to rapidly estimate non-symbolic numerical quantities is a well-conserved sense across species with clear evolutionary advantages. However, despite its importance, this sense is surprisingly imprecise and biased, and a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside (i) Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory information, (ii) logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and (iii) optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.

                <p>by Joseph Masison, Pedro Mendes</p>

Intestinal mucosal block is the transient reduction in iron absorption ability of intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) in response to previous iron exposures that occur at the cell scale. The block characteristics have been shown to depend both on iron exposure magnitude and temporality, and understanding block control will enable deeper understanding of how intestinal iron absorption contributes to pathological iron states. Three biochemical mechanisms implicated in driving the block behavior are divalent metal transporter 1 endocytosis, ferritin iron sequestration, and iron regulatory protein regulation of iron related protein expression. In this work, a model of enterocyte iron metabolism is built based on published experimental data that is capable of reproducing the mucosal block phenomena. The model is then used to estimate the quantitative contribution of each of the three mechanisms on the properties of the mucosal block. Analysis reveals that ferritin and iron regulatory proteins are the main intracellular mechanisms contributing to the mucosal block, findings congruent with experimental predictions. Lastly, DMT1 endocytosis is shown to play a role in limiting total iron uptake by enterocytes but does not contribute to the decrease in total iron transfer across their basal membrane seen in the mucosal block.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003026">Structural characterization of the ABC transporter DppABCDF in Escherichia coli reveals insights into dipeptide acquisition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Panpan Li, Manfeng Zhang, Yihua Huang</p>

The prokaryote-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) peptide transporters are involved in various physiological processes and plays an important role in transporting naturally occurring antibiotics across the membrane to their intracellular targets. The dipeptide transporter DppABCDF in Gram-negative bacteria is composed of five distinct subunits, yet its assembly and underlying peptide import mechanism remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the DppBCDF translocator from <i>Escherichia coli</i> in both its apo form and in complexes bound to nonhydrolyzable or slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMPPNP and ATPγS), as well as the ATPγS-bound DppABCDF full transporter. Unlike the reported heterotrimeric <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> DppBCD translocator, the <i>E. coli</i> DppBCDF translocator is a heterotetramer, with a [4Fe-4S] cluster at the C-terminus of each ATPase subunit. Structural studies reveal that ATPγS/AMPPNP-bound DppBCDF adopts an inward-facing conformation, similar to that of apo-DppBCDF, with only one ATPγS or AMPPNP molecule bound to DppF. By contrast, ATPγS-bound DppABCDF adopts an outward-facing conformation, with two ATPγS molecules glueing DppD and DppF at the interface. Consistent with structural observations, ATPase activity assays show that the DppBCDF translocator itself is inactive and its activation requires concurrent binding of DppA and ATP. In addition, bacterial complementation experiments imply that a unique periplasmic scoop motif in DppB may play important roles in ensuring dipeptide substrates import across the membrane, presumably by preventing dipeptide back-and-forth binding to DppA and avoiding dipeptides escaping into the periplasm upon being released from DppA.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-274/v1?src=rss">Exploration of hyperparameter tuning in handwritten digit recognition datasets using CNN [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for this purpose due to their ability to automatically extract relevant features. However, the role of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing CNN performance for this task remains underexplored. Methods This study evaluates the impact of hyperparameter tuning on CNN performance using the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark for digit recognition. The framework involves varying hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of convolutional layers, and optimization techniques. The Adam optimizer was employed to optimize the network, and experiments were conducted to assess the effect of adding extra convolutional layers on recognition accuracy. Results Our experiments achieved a 99.89% recognition rate on the MNIST dataset, surpassing prior benchmarks. This high accuracy was attained through systematic hyperparameter analysis and optimization. The addition of convolutional layers significantly contributed to improving the model’s performance by enabling deeper feature extraction and enhanced pattern recognition. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of hyperparameter tuning in CNN-based handwritten digit recognition. By providing insights into the impact of hyperparameters and architectural adjustments, it demonstrates how careful optimization can simplify processes and enhance accuracy in computer vision tasks. These findings pave the way for more effective and streamlined approaches to pattern recognition using deep learning techniques.

                Mao et al. characterized choroid plexus multicilia that transduce Shh signaling to repress a specific water channel and an ion transporter via a non-canonical Smo/Gαi/cAMP pathway. A developmental decrease of ChP ciliary length yields declined Shh signaling intensity, possibly contributing to elevated CSF production.

                Crowley et al. investigated the evolutionary origins of the pluripotency gene Nanog. Their research suggests that a single Vent gene capable of programming both pluripotency and germline competency was present in the last common ancestor of deuterostomes. In vertebrates, these activities sub-functionalized into the Vent and Nanog gene families, respectively.

                Cumbersome serum amyloid A 3 (SAA3) structures accumulate in the heart after myocardial infarction, impairing left ventricle wall contractility. Cimini et al. report that exosomal SAA3 triggers SAA3 overproduction in macrophages after binding Toll-like receptor 2 and activating p38-MAPK phosphorylation. The retro-inverso D-peptide DRI-R5S abrogates SAA3 monomer aggregation and amyloid formation.

                Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a commonly used biomarker in neurodegenerative disease. Kahn et al. describe the mechanism of release from degenerating neurons. They also demonstrate that loss of NfL reduces inflammation in a mouse ALS model and that NfL exposure causes cytokine release and transcriptional changes in immune cells.

                Memory consolidation requires the synthesis of new proteins. Kinsky et al. perform longitudinal calcium imaging in the hippocampus of mice and pharmacologically block protein synthesis with anisomycin following contextual fear learning. They show deficits in learning-related place field remapping and freeze-predictive ensemble activation during natural and pharmacologically induced memory consolidation failures.

                Tinkey et al. demonstrate that the upregulation of BATF2 downstream of IFNγ regulates the inflammatory potential of astrocytes during neuroinflammation. In vivo evidence suggests that BATF2 limits CNS autoimmunity and the expression of IFNγ-driven inflammatory mediators. These data suggest that BATF2 contributes to protective mechanisms in astrocytes during chronic neuroinflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90347">ThermoMaze behavioral paradigm for assessing immobility-related brain events in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Brain states fluctuate between exploratory and consummatory phases of behavior. These state changes affect both internal computation and the organism’s responses to sensory inputs. Understanding neuronal mechanisms supporting exploratory and consummatory states and their switching requires experimental control of behavioral shifts and collecting sufficient amounts of brain data. To achieve this goal, we developed the ThermoMaze, which exploits the animal’s natural warmth-seeking homeostatic behavior. By decreasing the floor temperature and selectively heating unmarked areas, we observed that mice avoided the aversive state by exploring the maze and finding the warm spot. In its design, the ThermoMaze is analogous to the widely used water maze but without the inconvenience of a wet environment and, therefore, allows the collection of physiological data in many trials. We combined the ThermoMaze with electrophysiology recording, and report that spiking activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons during sharp-wave ripple events encode the position of mice. Thus, place-specific firing is not confined to locomotion and associated theta oscillations but persist during waking immobility and sleep at the same location. The ThermoMaze will allow for detailed studies of brain correlates of immobility, preparatory–consummatory transitions, and open new options for studying behavior-mediated temperature homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96890">Adult neurogenesis through glial transdifferentiation in a CNS injury paradigm</a></h4>

              
                As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders is fast increasing. This neurodegeneration as well as other central nervous system (CNS) injuries cause permanent disabilities. Thus, generation of new neurons is the rosetta stone in contemporary neuroscience. Glial cells support CNS homeostasis through evolutionary conserved mechanisms. Upon damage, glial cells activate an immune and inflammatory response to clear the injury site from debris and proliferate to restore cell number. This glial regenerative response (GRR) is mediated by the neuropil-associated glia (NG) in <i>Drosophila</i>, equivalent to vertebrate astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (OL), and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here, we examine the contribution of NG lineages and the GRR in response to injury. The results indicate that NG exchanges identities between ensheathing glia (EG) and astrocyte-like glia (ALG). Additionally, we found that NG cells undergo transdifferentiation to yield neurons. Moreover, this transdifferentiation increases in injury conditions. Thus, these data demonstrate that glial cells are able to generate new neurons through direct transdifferentiation. The present work makes a fundamental contribution to the CNS regeneration field and describes a new physiological mechanism to generate new neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99790">Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal the cytological mechanism of conjugated linoleic acids in regulating intramuscular fat deposition</a></h4>

              
                Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) can serve as a nutritional intervention to regulate quality, function, and fat infiltration in skeletal muscles, but the specific cytological mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models. We investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on cell populations and molecular characteristics in pig muscles and found CLAs could promote the transformation of fast glycolytic myofibers into slow oxidative myofibers. We also observed three subpopulations including SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup>, FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup>, and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> subclusters in adipocytes and CLAs could increase the percentage of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. RNA velocity analysis showed FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. We further verified the differentiated trajectory of mature adipocytes and identified PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes by using high intramuscular fat (IMF) content Laiwu pig models. The cell-cell communication analysis identified the interaction network between adipocytes and other subclusters such as fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis and RNA velocity analysis also showed FAPs could differentiate into PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> preadipocytes and we discovered the differentiated trajectory of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Besides, we found CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in vitro. This study provides a foundation for regulating fat infiltration in skeletal muscles by using nutritional strategies and provides potential opportunities to serve pig as an animal model to study human fat infiltrated diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100424">UNC-6/Netrin promotes both adhesion and directed growth within a single axon</a></h4>

              
                During development axons undergo long-distance migrations as instructed by guidance molecules and their receptors, such as UNC-6/Netrin and UNC-40/DCC. Guidance cues act through long-range diffusive gradients (chemotaxis) or local adhesion (haptotaxis). However, how these discrete modes of action guide axons in vivo is poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of axon guidance in <i>C. elegans</i>, we demonstrate that UNC-6 and UNC-40 are required for local adhesion to an intermediate target and subsequent directional growth. Exogenous membrane-tethered UNC-6 is sufficient to mediate adhesion but not directional growth, demonstrating the separability of haptotaxis and chemotaxis. This conclusion is further supported by the endogenous UNC-6 distribution along the axon’s route. The intermediate and final targets are enriched in UNC-6 and separated by a ventrodorsal UNC-6 gradient. Continuous growth through the gradient requires UNC-40, which recruits UNC-6 to the growth cone tip. Overall, these data suggest that UNC-6 stimulates stepwise haptotaxis and chemotaxis in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104460">Multi-dimensional social relationships shape social attention in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Social relationships guide individual behavior and ultimately shape the fabric of society. Primates exhibit particularly complex, differentiated, and multidimensional social relationships, which form interwoven social networks, reflecting both individual social tendencies and specific dyadic interactions. How the patterns of behavior that underlie these social relationships emerge from moment-to-moment patterns of social information processing remains unclear. Here, we assess social relationships among a group of four monkeys, focusing on aggression, grooming, and proximity. We show that individual differences in social attention vary with individual differences in patterns of general social tendencies and patterns of individual engagement with specific partners. Oxytocin administration altered social attention and its relationship to both social tendencies and dyadic relationships, particularly grooming and aggression. Our findings link the dynamics of visual information sampling to the dynamics of primate social networks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102205">Plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk as a target for inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma growth and metastasis</a></h4>

              
                The most common primary malignancy of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a heterogeneous tumor entity with high metastatic potential and complex pathophysiology. Increasing evidence suggests that tissue mechanics plays a critical role in tumor onset and progression. Here, we show that plectin, a major cytoskeletal crosslinker protein, plays a crucial role in mechanical homeostasis and mechanosensitive oncogenic signaling that drives hepatocarcinogenesis. Our expression analyses revealed elevated plectin levels in liver tumors, which correlated with poor prognosis for HCC patients. Using autochthonous and orthotopic mouse models we demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of plectin potently suppressed the initiation and growth of HCC. Moreover, plectin targeting potently inhibited the invasion potential of human HCC cells and reduced their metastatic outgrowth in the lung. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling linked plectin-dependent disruption of cytoskeletal networks to attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt signatures. Importantly, by combining cell line-based and murine HCC models, we show that plectin inhibitor plecstatin-1 (PST) is well-tolerated and potently inhibits HCC progression. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plectin-controlled cytoarchitecture is a key determinant of HCC development and suggests that pharmacologically induced disruption of mechanical homeostasis may represent a new therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99545">Efficient coding in biophysically realistic excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                The principle of efficient coding posits that sensory cortical networks are designed to encode maximal sensory information with minimal metabolic cost. Despite the major influence of efficient coding in neuroscience, it has remained unclear whether fundamental empirical properties of neural network activity can be explained solely based on this normative principle. Here, we derive the structural, coding, and biophysical properties of excitatory-inhibitory recurrent networks of spiking neurons that emerge directly from imposing that the network minimizes an instantaneous loss function and a time-averaged performance measure enacting efficient coding. We assumed that the network encodes a number of independent stimulus features varying with a time scale equal to the membrane time constant of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The optimal network has biologically plausible biophysical features, including realistic integrate-and-fire spiking dynamics, spike-triggered adaptation, and a non-specific excitatory external input. The excitatory-inhibitory recurrent connectivity between neurons with similar stimulus tuning implements feature-specific competition, similar to that recently found in visual cortex. Networks with unstructured connectivity cannot reach comparable levels of coding efficiency. The optimal ratio of excitatory vs inhibitory neurons and the ratio of mean inhibitory-to-inhibitory vs excitatory-to-inhibitory connectivity are comparable to those of cortical sensory networks. The efficient network solution exhibits an instantaneous balance between excitation and inhibition. The network can perform efficient coding even when external stimuli vary over multiple time scales. Together, these results suggest that key properties of biological neural networks may be accounted for by efficient coding.

">Breathing-Driven Modulation of Reticulospinal Tract Activity</a></h4>

              
                The reticulospinal tract (RST) plays a pivotal role in motor control, especially during recovery after neurological injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). Understanding how RST activity is modulated offers valuable insights into improving motor function recovery. Recent studies have demonstrated that breathing rhythms influence brain activity. This study explores how respiratory rhythms modulate RST excitability during motor tasks, using the StartReact paradigm to examine reaction times (RTs) across visual (VRT), visual-auditory (VART), and visual-auditory startling (VSRT) conditions. We measured RTs in three muscles (first dorsal interosseous, flexor digitorum superficialis, and biceps) in healthy adult participants (n=13, both sexes) performing multi-joint movements. RTs were longest in the VRT condition and significantly decreased when auditory stimuli were added (VART), with further reductions observed in the VSRT condition. Additionally, respiratory phase transitions, particularly from inspiration to expiration (IE), significantly influenced RTs, with the shortest RTs observed during these transitions in the VSRT condition. These findings suggest that RST excitability is dynamically modulated by respiratory rhythms. This modulation of the RST by respiratory phase transitions could inform future neurorehabilitation strategies, such as respiratory-phase-aligned stimulation, to enhance motor recovery following corticospinal lesions. Ultimately, this approach may optimize the timing of interventions, improving outcomes in conditions such as stroke and SCI.

">TBCK-deficiency leads to compartment-specific mRNA and lysosomal trafficking defects in patient-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Monogenic pediatric neurodegenerative disorders can reveal fundamental cellular mechanisms that underlie selective neuronal vulnerability. TBCK-Encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by stop-gain variants in the TBCK gene. Clinically, patients show evidence of profound neurodevelopmental delays, but also symptoms of progressive encephalopathy and motor neuron disease. Yet, the physiological role of TBCK protein remains unclear. We report a human neuronal TBCKE model, derived from iPSCs homozygous for the Boricua variant (p.R126X). Using unbiased proteomic analyses of human neurons, we find TBCK interacts with PPP1R21, C12orf4, and Cryzl1, consistent with TBCK being part of the FERRY mRNA transport complex. Loss of TBCK leads to depletion of C12ORF4 protein levels across multiple cell types, suggesting TBCK may also play a role regulating at least some members of the FERRY complex. We find that TBCK preferentially, but not exclusively, localizes to the surface of endolysosomal vesicles and can colocalize with mRNA in lysosomes. Furthermore, TBCK-deficient neurons have reduced mRNA content in the axonal compartment relative to the soma. TBCK-deficient neurons show reduced levels of the lysosomal dynein/dynactin adapter protein JIP4, which functionally leads to TBCK-deficient neurons exhibiting striking lysosomal axonal retrograde trafficking defects. Hence, our work reveals that TBCK can mediate endolysosomal trafficking of mRNA, particularly along lysosomes in human axonal compartments. TBCK-deficiency leads to compartment-specific mRNA and lysosomal trafficking defects in neurons, which likely contribute to the preferential susceptibility to neurodegeneration.

">NADPH oxidase inhibitor enhances brain resilience in Alzheimer's disease by reducing tauopathy and neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease associates closely with activation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) isozymes. We identified that CRB-2131, a novel oxadiazole derivative, potently suppresses Nox isozymes. It inhibits reactive oxygen species production (ROS) by hippocampal neuronal and microglial cells and reduces microglial activation. Prophylactic (starting at 3.5 months of age) and therapeutic (starting at 6 months of age) oral administration with CRB-2131 for 10 weeks in 5XFAD mice reduced hippocampal superoxide levels, lipid peroxidation, Tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Prophylactic and therapeutic CRB-2131 treatment of 5XFAD mice restored their impaired cognition as shown by the novel-object recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water-maze tests. CRB-2131 treatment increased mature neurons, reduced apoptotic mature neurons, and elevated immature neurons in the hippocampus. Positron-emission tomography/computed-tomography imaging confirmed that CRB-2131 stimulated neuronal regeneration. CRB-2131 suppresses brain oxidation, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation, thereby preventing mature neuron death and promoting neuron regeneration. Ultimately, this fosters a resilient brain and protects cognition.

">Gamma frequency neuronal oscillations modulate microglia morphology via colony stimulating factor 1 receptor and NFκB pathway signalling</a></h4>

              
                Within the brain, neurons and glial cells engage in dynamic crosstalk to maintain homeostasis and regulate neuroimmune responses. Recent studies have implicated rhythmic neuronal network activity, most notably at gamma oscillation frequencies (approx. 25-100 Hz), in modulating the morphology and function of microglia, the brain's primary immune cells. Little is known, however, about the cellular mechanisms underlying this form of neuroimmune communication. Using pharmacological and optogenetic models of gamma oscillations in mouse brain slices, we found that gamma oscillations stimulate microglia to adopt a reactive morphological phenotype via activation of colony stimulation factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated signalling. Surprisingly, inhibition of two downstream mediators of CSF1R signalling - phosphoinositide-3-kinase or phospholipase C - did not prevent this effect, suggesting that neuron-microglia interactions in this context may occur via compensatory or alternative CSF1R-linked pathways. These findings provide important insights into how rhythmic brain activity regulates neuroimmune function, with potential implications for neurological health and disease.

">Parity and APOEε4 genotype contribute distinct changes to functional connectivity across the middle-aged brain</a></h4>

              
                Cognition and its underlying neurobiology change throughout the trajectory of aging, with prominent sex differences and influences of sex-specific factors. Research has shown that parity (pregnancy and parenthood) uniquely altered various biomarkers of brain health in middle age depending on presence of Alzheimers disease (AD) risk. The present study builds on prior work by providing a comprehensive view of functional connectivity changes and elucidating how network-level dynamics contribute to cognitive outcomes depending on primiparity and APOEe4 genotype, the top genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD risk. We assessed neural activation in middle-aged wildtype and hAPOEe4 rats that were either nulliparous (0 litters) or primiparous (1 litter). Activation of the immediate early gene zif268 was quantified across 19 brain regions implicated in memory and AD. Primiparous hAPOEe4 rats exhibited widespread reductions in neural activation, particularly in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex. Network analyses further revealed that primiparous wildtype rats had the most cohesive and efficient functional connectivity networks. Notably, the hierarchy of influence of brain regions within the neural network shifted based on parity and hAPOEe4 genotype. Activation of hippocampal new-born neurons in conjunction with subregions of the dorsal striatum, frontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex dynamically predicted cognitive performance in a parity- and genotype-dependent manner. These findings underscore the lasting impact of reproductive history on brain health and cognitive aging, highlighting the need to consider sex-specific experiences in aging and AD research.

">Designing optimal perturbation inputs for system identification in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Investigating the dynamics of neural networks, which are governed by connectivity between neurons, is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Perturbation-based approaches allow the precise estimation of neural dynamic models and have been extensively applied in studies of brain functions and neural state transitions. However, the question of how optimal perturbations which most effectively identify dynamical models in neuroscience should be designed remains unclear. To address this, we propose a novel theoretical framework for estimating optimal perturbation inputs for system identification in linear time-invariant systems. The model represents neural dynamics using a connectivity matrix and an input matrix. Our framework derives an objective function to optimize perturbation inputs, which minimizes estimation errors in the model matrices. Building upon this, we further explore the relationship of this function with stimulation patterns commonly used in neuroscience, such as frequency, impulse, and step inputs. We then outline an iterative approach to perturbation input design. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating perturbation inputs significantly improves system identification accuracy as dictated by the objective function. Moreover, perturbation inputs tuned to a parameter related to the eigenvalues and a network structure of the intrinsic model enhance system identification. Through this iterative approach, the estimated model matrix gradually approaches the true matrix. As an application, we confirmed that the framework also contributes to the optimal control theory. This study highlights the potential of designing perturbation inputs to achieve the advanced identification of neural dynamics. By providing a framework for optimizing perturbations, our work facilitates deeper insights into brain functions and advances in the study of complex neural systems.

">Signaling of trans-saccadic prediction error by foveal neurons of the monkey superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Across saccades, neurons in retinotopically organized visual representations experience drastically different images, but visual percepts remain stable. Here we investigated whether such stability can be mediated, in part, via prediction-error signaling by neurons processing post-saccadic visual images. We specifically recorded from foveal superior colliculus (SC) neurons when a visual image only overlapped with their response fields (RF's) after foveating saccades but not pre-saccadically. When we rapidly changed the target features intra-saccadically, the foveal neurons' post-saccadic visual reafferent responses were elevated, even though the neurons did not directly sample the pre-saccadic extrafoveal target features. This effect did not occur in the absence of saccades, and it also scaled with the extent of the introduced intra-saccadic image feature discrepancies. These results suggest that foveal SC neurons may signal a trans-saccadic prediction error when the foveated image stimulating them is inconsistent with that expected from pre-saccadic extrafoveal representations, a potential perceptual stability mechanism.

">Bodily perception links memory and self: a case study of an amnesic patient</a></h4>

              
                Episodic autobiographical memory (EAM) is a building block of self-consciousness, involving recollection and subjective re-experiencing of personal past experiences. Any life episode is originally encoded by a subject within a body. This raises the possibility that memory encoding is shaped by bodily self-consciousness (BSC), a basic form of self-consciousness arising from the multisensory and sensorimotor perceptual signals from the body. Recent studies in healthy subjects showed that embodied encoding improves EAM, with the involvement of the hippocampus. However, there are only few imaging studies to date, hippocampal data are not consistent, and the role of hippocampal damage is not understood. We investigated how different BSC states during encoding, modulate later EAM retrieval, in a patient with severe amnesia caused by rare bilateral hippocampal damage. We performed three separate behavioral experiments using immersive virtual reality. The patient showed consistently more difficulties recollecting information encoded in embodied vs. disembodied states, particularly when asked to recall her perspective experienced at encoding. These results contrasted with the usual beneficial effect of BSC on EAM, and significantly differed from controls. These data provide consistent evidence that BSC impacts encoding and later reliving, and shows that the hippocampus is not just a critical structure for EAM, but also for effects of embodiment on memory. Additional fMRI data extend these findings by revealing that hippocampal-parietal connectivity mediates BSC-EAM coupling. Our findings plead for an important role of BSC in EAM, mediated by the hippocampus and its connectivity, leading to embodied memories that are experienced as belonging to the self.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Synchronized beta-band oscillations (14&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz) are critical for sensorimotor processing and motor performance. Modulating beta activity either locally in targeted brain regions or globally across sensorimotor networks may enhance motor function. This study aimed to explore whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) could enhance sensorimotor responses by modulating beta-band synchronization. Methods: Eight participants performed a stimulus&amp;amp;ndash;response task requiring a quick keypress to a visual cue. Response times (RTs) and electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded during pre-, in-, and post-stimulation sessions for five conditions: motor-anodal tDCS, visual-anodal tDCS, alpha (10 Hz) tACS, beta (20 Hz) tACS, and sham, with a one-week interval between conditions. Results: Significant RT reductions were observed only after motor-anodal tDCS. EEG analysis revealed a positive correlation between these RT reductions and increased beta-phase synchronization between visual and motor areas. In contrast, tACS conditions did not yield significant RT improvements or beta-phase synchronization changes. Conclusions: These findings indicate that motor-anodal tDCS has the potential to enhance sensorimotor performance by facilitating beta-phase synchronization across the visual-motor network. The observed effects likely extend beyond localized neuronal modulation, emphasizing the importance of network-level connectivity in sensorimotor integration. Beta-phase synchronization appears to play a critical role in integrating visual and motor information, contributing to task-related performance improvements. Further research is warranted to build upon these findings and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Advancements in biomedical imaging technologies over the past few decades have made it increasingly possible to measure the long-term effects of exercise on the central nervous system. This study aims to compare the brain morphology and functional connectivity of wrestlers and handball players, exploring sport-specific neural adaptations. Methods: Here, we examined 26 elite male athletes (13 wrestlers and 13 handball players) using anatomical and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements. Connectivity maps are derived using the seed-based correlation analysis of resting-state fMRI, while voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is employed to identify anatomical differences. Additionally, the cortical thickness and global volumetric values of the segmented images are examined to determine the distinctions between elite wrestlers and handball players using non-parametric statistical tests. Results: Wrestlers exhibited greater grey matter volume (GMV) in the right middle temporal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right posterior cingulate gyrus (uncorr., p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). On the other hand, wrestlers showed increased functional connectivity in the left superior temporal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, the left anterior orbital gyrus, and right superior frontal gyrus&amp;amp;ndash;medial frontal region (P(FWE) &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, wrestlers showed greater cortical thickness in several brain regions. Conclusions: The increased GMV, cortical thickness, and functional connectivity observed in wrestlers highlight the presence of sport-specific neural adaptations. While this research provides valuable insights into the neuroplastic effects of various athletic disciplines, further studies involving additional sports and control groups are needed for a more comprehensive understanding.</p>

	<p>Background: Childhood is a crucial period for brain development, and short-term juvenile stress has demonstrated long-lasting effects on cognitive and cellular functions in the hippocampus. However, the influence of such stress on the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall network remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the effects of transient wild stress on juvenile male rats. Pregnant rats were purchased and housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment, with pups separated by sex on postnatal day 21 (PD21). From PD27 to PD29, male rats were subjected to transient wild stress, which included forced swimming, elevated platform exposure, and restraint stress. Following stress exposure, all animals were carefully maintained and scanned at 42 days of age (PD42) using fMRI. Structural analysis was performed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess changes in gray matter volume, while functional activity was evaluated through regional homogeneity (ReHo) and voxel-wise functional connectivity. Results: The results showed significant reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions in the stress group, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), entorhinal cortex (Ent), and dentate gyrus (DG). In terms of functional activity, cortical regions, particularly the primary somatosensory areas, exhibited decreased activity, whereas increased activity was observed in the PAG, DG, and medulla. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a significant reduction in connectivity between the DG and entorhinal cortex, while the DG-PAG connectivity was significantly enhanced. Conclusions: These findings suggest that juvenile stress leads to profound alterations in both brain structure and function, potentially disrupting emotional regulation and memory processing by affecting the development and connectivity of key brain regions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The widespread phenomenon of &amp;amp;ldquo;brain rot&amp;amp;rdquo;, named the Oxford Word of the Year 2024, refers to the cognitive decline and mental exhaustion experienced by individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, due to excessive exposure to low-quality online materials, especially on social media. The present study is exploratory and interpretative in nature, aiming to investigate the phenomenon of &amp;amp;ldquo;brain rot&amp;amp;rdquo;, with a focus on its key pillars, psychological factors, digital behaviors, and the cognitive impact resulting from the overconsumption of low-quality digital content. Methods: This study employs a rapid review approach, examining research published between 2023 and 2024 across PubMed, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. It explores the causes and effects of brain rot, focusing on the overuse of social media, video games, and other digital platforms. Results: The findings reveal that brain rot leads to emotional desensitization, cognitive overload, and a negative self-concept. It is associated with negative behaviors, such as doomscrolling, zombie scrolling, and social media addiction, all linked to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. These factors impair executive functioning skills, including memory, planning, and decision-making. The pervasive nature of digital media, driven by dopamine-driven feedback loops, exacerbates these effects. Conclusions: The study concludes by offering strategies to prevent brain rot, such as controlling screen time, curating digital content, and engaging in non-digital activities. Given the increasing prevalence of digital engagement, it is essential to explore a variety of strategies, including mindful technology use, to support cognitive health and emotional well-being. The results can guide various stakeholders&amp;amp;mdash;policymakers, practitioners, researchers, educators, and parents or caregivers&amp;amp;mdash;in addressing the pervasive impact of brain rot and promoting a balanced approach to technology use that fosters cognitive resilience among adolescents and young adults.</p>

                Background Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a highly effective tool for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a sensitive technique that depends on the b value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for the diagnosis of PCa. The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in DW-MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods A prospective study including 26 male participants were conducted. MRI examinations were performed with T2 fat saturation sequences, and Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with b-values (800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mm2/s) were used, and the corresponding ADC maps were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Results According to the present study, a b-value of 0,1500 mm2/s exhibited the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Signal Intensity Ratio (SIR), and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). Area Under the Curve (AUC) for 0,1500 mm2/s was 0.80, indicating a high diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer. Conclusion DWI with a b-value of 1500 mm2/s provides good diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis of prostate lesions. DWI is a crucial sequence in multiparametric MRI of the prostate and offers detailed information that enhances the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis and management.

                Background Vancomycin is an effective first-line therapy primarily in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and Clostridium difficile, however, it has been shown that its effectiveness and the reduction of nephrotoxicity depend on maintaining adequate therapeutic levels. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPk) models attempt to parameterize the behavior of plasma concentrations in different target populations and scenarios such as renal replacement therapy, to successful therapeutic outcome and avoid these side effects. Methods A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), through a search in PubMed, LILACS, OVID Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, SAGE Journals, Google Scholar and previous known registers of PopPk models in non-critically ill adult patients, published between 1998 and 2024. Results A total of 190 papers were fully screened, of which were included 36 studies conducted in different populations; 12 in general population, 23 in special populations (surgical, with impaired renal function, obese, elderly, with cancer and cystic fibrosis), and 1 in mixed population (general and with cancer). The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies used internal evaluation and 4 of them used an external group. Discussion The technology for the development and implementation of PopPk models requires experts in clinical pharmacology and is limited to university and research centers. The software is mostly expensive and, in most cases, the pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and evaluation methods depend on which compartmental model, parameters, covariates and software have been used. Conclusions These models require validation in the clinical context and conducting experiments to adapt them for precision dosing in different subpopulations.

                Background Maxillofacial fractures, frequently arising from road traffic incidents, falls, and acts of interpersonal aggression, are a considerable public health issue, exhibiting diverse epidemiological patterns according to demographic factors. The application of miniplates for fracture stabilization is a recognized technique, with innovative methods such as 3D plate systems emerging. Nonetheless, consequences including infections and hardware malfunctions persist. This systematic review seeks to present current evidence regarding the complications linked to miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures over the last ten years. Methods A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA principles. Databases such as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus were examined from September 2014 to September 2024. Studies documenting problems related to miniplate placement were included, without language constraints. The ROBINS-I tool was utilized for non-randomized studies, whereas the Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to randomized controlled trials. Results From 2,289 initially found studies, 56 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among these, 28 employed interventional designs, whilst the remaining 28 were observational research. The predominant problems documented in several investigations encompassed infection, wound dehiscence, malocclusion, paraesthesia, malunion/non-union, segment movement, hardware failure, and palpable hardware. Advanced methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms were linked to diminished complication rates. Conclusion This systematic analysis presents a decade of updated research about problems associated with miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures. Novel methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms demonstrate promise in mitigating problems relative to conventional techniques. These findings can facilitate informed decision-making in clinical practice. Additional study utilizing standardized outcomes and prospective designs is essential to enhance comprehension of the long-term effects of miniplate utilization.

                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Background The approach to estimating mandibular age has been widely used, although it has shown age estimation disparities in diverse populations, including Indians. Objective Our goal was to test the Demirjian 8-teeth approach utilizing orthopantomogram to estimate age reliably after incorporating the third molar. We also used Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations to estimate age estimation accuracy in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods The retrospective study included 196 people. Individuals were 8–24 years old. The left mandibular teeth were staged using an orthopantomographs utilizing the Demirjian 8-teeth approach. The Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression models determined dental age, and statistical methods compared dental age to chronological age. Results The gender breakdown was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. Gender did not significantly affect chronological mean age or estimated mean age (13.39±3.77 vs. 13.10±3.51, p = 0.583; 11.75±2.92 vs. 11.58±2.70, p = 0.674). Statistically substantial differences in chronological and estimated mean ages between male and female individuals (p<0.001). Out of the total participants, 31.6% had a difference in age of ±1 year, 30.6% had a difference of 1-2 years, and 37.8% had a difference of more than 2 years. Compared to chronological and estimated ages, these variations in age between males and females were not statistically significant (p=0.557). Conclusions The findings of this study support the use of Demirjian’s 8-teeth approach in the Saudi population residing in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, employing Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations.

                Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers globally, ranking 4th in men and 2nd in women. While once rare in Asian countries, the incidence of CRC has increased in these populations, likely due to risk factors such as a Western diet, smoking, sedentary lifestyles, and aging. In Indonesia, early-onset CRC (EOCRC) has risen alarmingly, with a previous study reporting an annual percentage change of 1.98% from 2009 to 2019. Several studies have linked EOCRC with Microsatellite Instability (MSI), which is gaining attention for its role in CRC diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to explore MSI status in Indonesian CRC patients to better understand its role in the rise of EOCRC and its potential in CRC screening. Methods Fixed formalin paraffin-embedded samples and corresponding clinical data were retrieved from 100 patients diagnosed with CRC between 2018 and 2020. DNA extraction was performed on the samples, and subsequent analysis utilized the N_lynch panel, real-time PCR, and HRM analysis. MSI status was determined based on the presence of two positive markers. Results As much as 12.4% of our subjects were MSI-H and 34% of the subjects were early onset cases. There is a significant difference of tumor location between MSI-H and MSS, in which larger percentage of MSI-H tumor was right-sided (33.3%) than left-sided (9.7%). No significant difference was found in terms of gender, age, onset, stage, and performance status. No significant difference between gender, tumor location, stage, MSI status, and performance status between early onset and late onset group. Conclusion There is a high rate of early onset CRC in Indonesia that is not caused by MSI but rather, possibly, by an undiscovered factor. Further study is needed to explore novel pathway that could explain this phenomenon.

                Introduction People with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) suffer from a number of motor and non-motor disorders. Research in the field of motor learning suggests the superiority of an external focus of attention (EFA) compared to an internal focus of attention (IFA), including for PwPD. However, no systematic review with meta-analysis has yet examined the effectiveness of different attentional foci across medication states (ON & OFF) for this population. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an EFA versus an IFA on balance, gait, and motor symptom severity in PwPD during both medication states. Methods The study design was a systematic review with meta-analysis. Four electronic databases were searched for eligible studies. Methodological quality was assessed with the PEDro scale. Results Nine studies with a total of 240 subjects were used for the analyses. The meta-analysis for the ON/normal medication status did not indicate an effect in favour of any attentional focus for balance (SMD: 0.00; 95% CI between -0.46 and 0.46), gait (SMD: 0.11; 95% CI between - 0.30 and 0.53), and motor symptom severity (SMD: -0.16; 95% CI between -0.55 and 0.22). The meta-analysis for the OFF medication status did not indicate an effect in favour of any attentional focus for balance (SMD: 0.15; 95% CI between -0.24 and 0.54), gait (SMD: 0.16; 95% CI between -0.56 and 0.88), and motor symptom severity (SMD: -0.15; 95% CI between -0.53 and 0.24). Conclusion Neither attentional focus showed a significant benefit over the other for balance, gait, or motor symptom severity in PwPD regardless of medication state. In the absence of a group effect, the choice of attentional focus may be determined by a person-cantered approach, considering aspects such as individual preferences, training duration, and medication. The results of this work should only be interpreted considering the risk of bias.

                Introduction Perforation of mature ovarian teratomas is rare. This revelation may be misleading. We report a unique case of a ruptured teratoma mimicking an appendicular abscess, emphasizing the value of sharing such an experience to learn from our mistakes as well as the importance of a conservative approach in the treatment of these tumors in children. Case description A 12-year-old-girl presented to the emergency room with a 3-days history of worsening abdominal pain. She reported a fever associated with vomiting and diarrhea. On physical examination, the patient was feverish and displayed generalized tenderness, especially in the right iliac fossa where there was a palpable mass. white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were significantly elevated. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed appendicular abscess. Intraoperatively, a perforated right ovarian teratoma was found, and ovarian sparing surgery was performed. No postoperative complications were noted, and histology confirmed the diagnosis of a mature teratoma. Conclusion The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in girls is broad and includes gynecological disorders. Ovarian teratomas can progress silently. In this case, the diagnosis can be made intraoperatively when a complication has occurred. Surgeons and radiologists are not always able to establish a positive diagnosis when there are no obvious clinicoradiological features. Even when the diagnosis is made intraoperatively, treatment must be appropriate and conservative surgery remains a therapeutic option.

                Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms are a well-known complication of vascular access procedures and account for the majority of pseudoaneurysm presentations. To mitigate open surgical risk, the current mainstays of endovascular treatment include direct percutaneous thrombin injection or selective embolization or stenting which are contingent on favourable pseudoaneurysm characteristics. We present a case of a comorbid 91-year-old woman with a large refractory iatrogenic superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck following elective coronary angiography with successful vascular closure device-assisted repair following attempted direct thrombin injection. This case presents a novel technique for the endovascular repair of refractory femoral pseudoaneurysms in patients on anticoagulation and at high risk for open surgical repair.

                Introduction We examined the predictors of tobacco smoking initiation considering factors such as age, gender, pocket money, exposure to smoke in public outdoor places, anti-tobacco media, smoking parents, smoking teachers, and smoking friends among adolescents in Indonesia. Methods Using data from the 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey grades 7–12, data from 9,655 teenagers were analyzed. The research used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. The analysis used univariate, chi-square and logistic regression with the STATA application version 15. Results In total, 9655 adolescent respondents participated. Multivariate tests indicated that teenagers aged 13-15 years (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66) and teenagers aged> 15 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.17), teenagers who were male (AOR: 13.99, 95% CI: 11.11-17.63), teenagers who were exposed to cigarette smoke in public places outside the room (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.74-2.29), teenagers who had never seen anti-tobacco messages in the mass media (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48), Teenagers who had parents who smoke (AOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), teenagers who saw teachers smoking in the school area (AOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18-1.71), and teenagers who accepted offers of cigarettes from friends (AOR: 15.11, 95% CI: 10.33-22.11). Conclusion The initiation of tobacco smoking among teenagers in Indonesia can be predicted by various factors such as age, gender, exposure to smoke in outdoor public places, exposure to anti-tobacco media, and influence of parents, teachers, and friends.

                Background Bangladesh is an emerging country where teachers and students of public and private universities have started using technology in the classrooms. Many teachers and students of social science faculty have an inclination to use ChatGPT for educational and research purposes. By focusing on this specific context, the study aims to bring insights into the perception and integration of ChatGPT into the educational practices in an emerging country. Methods This study employed a mixed method approach. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaire survey from 402 teachers and 440 students of eight different public and private universities following a stratified sampling approach. A convenience sampling technique was followed with a view to collecting qualitative data through in-depth interviews of 32 participants, including 16 teachers and 16 students from both public and private universities. Results The research presents that students and teachers both have proficiency, but there is a gap in expertise. Students perceive ChatGPT as beneficial for better learning outcomes, and teachers find it helpful in preparing for classes and instructional materials. Both teachers and students consider ChatGPT requirng minimal effort. Though students are influenced by their peers to use it, teachers are not. On the other hand, teachers have more behavioral intentions to use it in the future than the students have. Yet worries over ethical use, reliance, and information accuracy prevail. High cost and language barriers are also listed as reasons for level of accessibility . Conclusion The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of policies, research endeavors, and teaching-learning practices in the higher education sector covering both public and private universities in Bangladesh and similar contexts.

                Background Transitioning from national service to mainstream employment can be daunting, especially in this era of high unemployment in Ghana. Most universities found the need to incorporate entrepreneurship education into their curriculum hoping to get graduates to take up entrepreneurship activities instead of being employed by someone else. This study investigated Ghanaian tertiary-level graduates’ education and work intentions as they work through their mandatory national service program. Methods Graduates from across Ghana’s tertiary institutions were sampled (n=1011; males=73%, females=27%) from various tertiary institutions via the National Service Scheme website. An online questionnaire with questions on work and postgraduate study intentions, perceptions of tertiary education received, and whether they would like to start their own business or expect to be employed was filled out. Results The results revealed that despite calls for graduates to venture into self-employment, graduates still had hopes for formal sector employment (64%) and fewer had entrepreneurship intentions (8%). Entrepreneurship intentions were significantly related to gender as more males than females had intentions of starting their own businesses regardless of having taken entrepreneurship courses. Graduates expressed satisfaction (83%) with their tertiary education however called for additional services like attachment opportunities and internship positions within industry. Conclusions The study concludes that though the graduates were satisfied with their education, yet they wished they had received more practical hands-on training in addition, and more career and job fairs, however, none of these desires were to help them set themselves up but rather to help them to be employed by someone. The study recommendations reiterate calls for enhanced industry-educational institutions’ collaboration to provide graduates with more industry-specific skills and ease the transition to labour market. Intensify entrepreneurship learning opportunities but also at the national level address barriers to successful entrepreneurship including access to low-interest rate funding and favourable policies and infrastructure.

                <p>by Yifan Yao, Scott Pauls, Duncan Foley, Tomoko Yoshikawa, Sato Honma, Ken-Ichi Honma, Ellie McVeigh, Nicolas C. Foley, Rae Silver</p>

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), locus of a circadian clock, is a small nucleus of approximately 20,000 neurons that oscillate with a period of about 24 hours. While individual neurons produce circadian oscillations even when dispersed in culture, the coherence and robustness of oscillation of the SCN as a whole is dependent on its circuitry. Surprisingly, the individual neurons of the intact SCN do not all oscillate in phase with each other. To understand the oscillatory dynamics across the intact nucleus, we develop a model of the relation of the phase of neurons to their PER2 expression at a particular subjective time (CT1900) using <i>time series data</i> from SCN slice preparations. Next, we use the model, which produces a surprisingly good fit in the SCN slice data, to estimate oscillator phase at a single time point (CT1900) in <i>snapshot</i> data from PER2 expression measurements in intact, unsliced SCN-wide tissue. To monitor temporal changes in phase in time series data, we use PER2::LUC imaging in an ex vivo SCN slice preparation. To study phase in the intact SCN at a fixed time point we use data generated by PER2 staining and a tissue clearing protocol. Because PER2 expression, as measured in the time series slices and the snapshot intact SCN are not directly comparable, the model estimated from time series slices to the snapshot intact SCN data requires a calibrating constant. The results indicate that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the SCN slice data and is therefore a meaningful method for estimating phase in the intact SCN snapshot data, permitting the study of virtual interventions such as virtual tissue slicing. We next compare oscillation in circuits in the SCN-wide tissue to those that have been disrupted by virtual slicing using a Kuramoto model to simulate the dynamics. The results support prior evidence that the damage done by coronal slicing has the most disruptive impact on SCN oscillation, while horizontal slicing has the least damage. The results point to the importance of connectivity along the caudal-to-rostral axis and indicate that SCN circuit organization depends on the caudal-to-rostral flow of information. In summary, the construction of this model is a major finding of the paper. Our modeling allows us to perform the previously impossible analysis of oscillatory dynamics in static data in an intact SCN captured at a single time point.

                Background The neoliberal approach to higher education management has significantly transformed collegiality and university governance. This study identifies and analyzes how and where these changes have occurred, as well as their impact on the efficiency and competitiveness of universities. It addresses existing research gaps and provides new insights for adaptation strategies. Methods We selected all retrieved sources based on the keywords and analyzed all the documents we obtained. This study obtained data from Scopus retrieved on October 27, 2023, using the following keywords: (TITLE-ABS-KEY (“collegiality”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“change management”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“neolibelism”)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (“higher education”). This study utilized bibliometric analysis to ensure a structured review of the literature on collegiality, change management, and neoliberalism in higher education. Results The findings show that organizational management, leadership, education, technology, curriculum, innovation, organizational change, decision-making, and human beings are significant trajectories of neoliberalism in higher education. Conclusions This study offers other constructs for accelerating leadership success in higher education. This relates to how change leadership can navigate changes resulting from neoliberal ideology.

                Nakazawa et al. show that the cerebellar granule cell is equipped with multiple actomyosin engines to migrate in the heterogeneous microenvironment of developing brain tissue. In a 3D confined environment, PIEZO1 induces the translocation of actomyosin to the posterior membrane through PKC-ezrin signaling and generates pushing force in the migrating neuron.

This stability of the PM not only prevents overactivation of the Imd pathway but also maintains the homeostasis of intestinal epithelial cells.

                Xu et al. show that IL6, not TNF-α, suppresses mitochondrial function. When PGC1 is low, IL6 increases HIF1A transcription and stabilizes HIF1α protein via ERRα. HIF1α reciprocally suppresses ERRα, contributing to the mitochondrial suppression. Overexpression of PGC1 rescues ERRα from being sequestered by HIF1α, thereby boosting mitochondrial function.

                Mergan et al. conducted an fMRI-guided electrophysiology study in macaque prefrontal face patches. They found that, although receptive fields and basic selectivity in these face patches resemble those in ITC, a subset of POC neurons show rapid face responses (30 ms). These may enable fast top-down facilitation in face processing.

                YAP/TAZ-mediated gene transcription is necessary for Schwann cell laminin receptor expression and differentiation. Weaver et al. use transgenic mouse models to show that the STRIPAK complex is required to regulate YAP/TAZ and facilitate radial sorting. Additionally, they show that two STRIPAK complex members, STRN3 and MOB4, directly interact with Rac1-GTP.

                <p>Nature Photonics, Published online: 06 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01629-w">doi:10.1038/s41566-025-01629-w</a></p>The challenges of fabricating low-loss waveguides and the reliance on bulky external magnets hinder the miniaturization of Faraday isolators. Now, researchers have overcome this limitation by femtosecond laser writing of waveguides within latched garnet.
