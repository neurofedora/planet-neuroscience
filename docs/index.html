              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00058">Sight, smell and more: What cues do free-ranging dogs use for decision-making while scavenging?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding food is a fundamental activity for survival of all living organisms. Free-ranging dogs have been known to use their olfaction to assess the quality and type of available food but their use of visual ability in foraging is not well-documented. In the current study, we seek to remedy that by testing free-ranging dogs in a food-based choice test. We tested whether the dogs implemented hierarchical or synergistic usage of cues while finding food. We found limited prioritization of olfactory cues over visual cues in dichromatic choice tests but in phases with similar perceptual elements, the sensory choice was not clear. Furthermore, free-ranging dogs display a dynamic decision-making in unpredictable urban environments adopting a good-enough strategy during foraging. They prefer speed over accuracy, settling for intermediate quality food if their preferred food item is not available. These dogs also displayed left-bias during food choice. In multi-sensorial, natural setting multiple modulators like environmental noise, risk, and internal perceptual elements apart from food cues seem to be affecting the decision-making in dogs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00063">Exploring the changes in brain network SC-FC coupling patterns of partial sleep deprivation based on DTI-fMRI fusion analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep disorder is a serious global public health issue, with cognitive-emotional dysfunction being a core symptom. The analysis of multimodal MRI data provides an effective method for detecting sleep deprivation-induced neural network abnormalities. The structure-function coupling (SC-FC) integrates functional connectivity with white matter structural information, which can enable comprehensive detection of brain network abnormalities and offer quantitative measures of sleep deprivation-induced neural damage. This study integrates diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to systematically investigate brain network reorganization and their relationship with emotional functions in partial sleep deprivation (PSD). Our methodology employed DTI to construct structural connectivity (SC) networks and rs-fMRI to establish functional connectivity (FC) networks, then construct SC-FC coupling model . The experiment included 16 healthy controls (HC) and 20 PSD patients, with comprehensive whole-brain and nodal-level SC-FC analyses performed. The results show that (1) severe FC disruptions in PSD patients involving the limbic system, default mode network, sensorimotor network, and visual networks; (2) altered SC in default mode, sensorimotor, visual, language, and auditory networks; (3) significant SC-FC decoupling in these networks; and (4) strong correlations between these neural changes and clinical measures (KSQ and HADS scores). The SC-FC coupling approach achieved comprehensive detection of PSD-related network abnormalities. Compared to single-modal approaches, this integrated SC-FC analysis provides more comprehensive biomarkers for sleep-related emotional dysregulation. This innovative multimodal neuroimaging approach elucidates the neural mechanisms of SC-FC imbalance induced by PSD, establishing novel biomarkers for sleep-mediated emotional dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00090">Biomimetic Metamaterial-based Interface for Decoding Heterogeneous Mechanodermal Activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human skin acts as a dynamic biomechanical interface that conveys critical physiological and behavioural information through spatiotemporally distributed deformations. Due to the limited capabilities of current sensing technologies, the spatiotemporal diversity of its mechanical cues has remained underutilised to date, preventing these mechanisms from being used to capture and decode the full spectrum of underlying physiological states. In this work, we define this heterogeneous set of mechanical signals as mechanodermal activity (MDA) and introduce the biomimetic metamaterial-based interface (BMMI), an engineered auxetic metamaterial substrate that reproduces the microrelief and mechanoreceptor architecture of natural skin. The BMMI allows selective capture of diverse MDA signals from adjacent skin regions with simultaneous signal amplification and noise suppression, and permits straightforward modulation to accommodate various scenarios. Combined with bespoke algorithms, the wireless BMMI device decodes MDA accurately and robustly for multimodal communication interfaces, unleashing applications in healthcare monitoring and human-machine interaction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00109">The Dual-Loop Model of Psychophysiological Regulation: A Framework for Psychological Breakthrough and State Transition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real life, psychological and physiological states rarely change along a single dimension. Through self-tracking and discussions with clinicians, I have come to recognise with increasing clarity that sleep patterns, autonomic arousal, bodily sensations, and cognitive load are in constant interaction. Existing models often fail to capture this complexity. Many theoretical frameworks continue to analyse these elements in isolation, making it difficult to explain sudden changes reported by individuals,such as abrupt spikes in anxiety, sudden drops in dissociation, or even moments of heightened alertness. The mathematical modelling employed herein does not replace clinical or subjective narratives, but rather provides a structural framework for these rapid transitions and elucidates why bodily-driven and cognitively-driven changes manifest differently. The objective is to build a conceptual bridge between physiological signals and lived experience, laying the groundwork for dynamic modelling and future case analyses.

                arXiv:2512.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schr\"odinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00140">The Geometry of Certainty: Recursive Topological Condensation and the Limits of Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation fundamentally separates time from space: nondeterministic search is exponential in time but polynomially simulable in space (Savitch's Theorem). We propose that the brain physically instantiates a biological variant of this theorem through Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI), creating a geometry of certainty from the chaos of exploration. We formalize the cortical algorithm as a recursive topological transformation of flow into scaffold:$H_{odd}^{(k)} \xrightarrow{\text{Condense}} H_{even}^{(k+1)}$, where a stable, high-frequency cycle ($\beta_1$) at level $k$ is collapsed into a static atomic unit ($\beta_0$) at level $k+1$. Through this Topological Trinity (Search $\to$ Closure $\to$ Condensation), the system amortizes the thermodynamic cost of inference. By reducing complex homological loops into zero-dimensional defects (memory granules), the cortex converts high-entropy parallel search into low-entropy serial navigation. This mechanism builds a ``Tower of Scaffolds'' that achieves structural parity with the environment, allowing linear cortical growth to yield exponential representational reach. However, this efficiency imposes a strict limit: the same metric contraction that enables \emph{generalization} (valid manifold folding) inevitably risks \emph{hallucination} (homological collapse). We conclude that intelligence is the art of navigating this trade-off, where the ``Geometry of Certainty'' is defined by the precise threshold between necessary abstraction and topological error.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00984">Symmetries at the origin of hierarchical emergence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems of interest exhibit nested emergent layers with their own rules and regularities, and our knowledge about them seems naturally organised around these levels. This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.

                arXiv:2512.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a conductance-based neuron model to explore how voltage-gated ion channel isoforms influence action-potential generation. The model combines a six-state Markov representation of NaV channels with a first-order KV3.1 model, allowing us to vary maximal sodium and potassium conductances and compare nine NaV isoforms. Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01073">The Modeler Schema Theory of Consciousness, with a Falsifiable Experiment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that consciousness arises from a single control agent, the Modeler-schema. It monitors the brain's Modeler as that system constructs and updates the internal World Model. As part of that monitoring, the Modeler-schema generates experience by applying a qualia-based consistency check to the Modeler's output. The Human Agent comprises three cooperating agents: Modeler, Controller, and Targeter, each paired with an associated regulatory "schema" agent. We also describe fast-Modelers and fast-Controllers; evolutionary shortcuts whose rapid actions will precede awareness. Our core prediction is that the Modeler-schema performs a qualia-based consistency check during saccades and issues a bottom-up target when a discrepancy is found. To test this prediction, we propose a saccadic change-detection experiment that distinguishes Modeler-generated from Modeler-schema-generated targets. Locating qualia in the Modeler-schema ties experience to the regulation and refinement of internal representations, clarifies how awareness arises from model control, and suggests a path toward empirical falsification, thereby offering a concrete, testable proposal toward solving the Hard Problem of consciousness.

                arXiv:2512.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons in cortical areas often integrate signals from different origins. In the primary visual cortex (V1), neural responses are modulated by non-visual context such as the animal's position. However, the spatial profile of these position signals across the environment remains unknown. Here, we propose a new framework to disentangle visual and spatial contributions in virtual reality. This method relies on two principles: 1) a virtual corridor design that decorrelates vision and space through targeted cue repetitions and manipulations and 2) a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that explicitly estimates visual contributions in retinotopic rather than environmental coordinates. In simulations, we demonstrate that this framework is highly specific (recovering spatial modulation only when present) and effectively captures the profile and weight of spatial gain fields across the environment. When applied to V1 recordings from mice navigating the virtual corridor, the model isolated significant spatial components in a substantial fraction of V1 neurons. The recovered spatial components exhibited heterogeneous, often multi-peaked, profiles. Application of this framework to large-scale recordings may provide a robust approach to characterize the nature of spatial signals modulating sensory processing across brain areas.

Abstract: Early detection of malignant lung nodules is critical, but its dependence on size and growth in screening inherently delays diagnosis. We present an AI system that redefines lung cancer screening by performing both detection and malignancy diagnosis directly at the nodule level on low-dose CT scans. To address limitations in dataset scale and explainability, we designed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models. Trained and evaluated on 25,709 scans with 69,449 annotated nodules, the system outperforms radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle). It achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on an independent cohort. With 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3\% sensitivity, it addresses key barriers to AI adoption. Critically, it outperforms radiologists across all nodule sizes and stages, excelling in stage 1 cancers, and all growth-based metrics, including the least accurate: Volume-Doubling Time. It also surpasses radiologists by up to one year in diagnosing indeterminate and slow-growing nodules.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01006">The Coupling Strength Is a Scale Parameter in Threshold Power-Law Reservoirs and Does Not Influence Training Accuracy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reservoir computing, the coupling strength of the initial untrained recurrent neural network (the reservoir) is an important hyperparameter that can be varied for accurate training. A common heuristic is to set this parameter near the ``edge of chaos", where the untrained reservoir is near the transition to chaotic dynamics, and the chaos can be ``tamed". Here, we investigate how the overall connectivity strength should be varied in threshold power-law recurrent neural networks, where the firing rate is 0 below some threshold of the current and is a power function of the current above this threshold. These networks have been previously shown to exhibit chaotic solutions for very small coupling strengths, which may imply that the chaos cannot be tamed at all. We show that for reservoirs constructed with threshold power-law transfer functions, if the reservoir can be trained for one single positive value of the initial reservoir coupling strength, then there exist networks with identical accuracy for all positive coupling strengths, implying that the chaotic dynamics can always be tamed or never be tamed. This is a direct consequence of the coupling strength of threshold power-law RNNs acting as a scale parameter that does not qualitatively influence the dynamics of the system, but only scales all system solutions in magnitude. This is independent of the power of the transfer function, with the exception of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. This is in contrast with conventional RNNs/reservoirs employing sigmoidal firing rates, where the strength of the recurrent coupling in the initial reservoir determines the performance on different tasks during training and also influences the network dynamics explicitly.

                arXiv:2512.01199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons process information in ways that depend on their cell type, connectivity, and the brain region in which they are embedded. However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals. Code is available at https://github.com/nerdslab/nuclr.

                arXiv:2512.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) dosing in children remains largely empirical, relying on one-size-fits-all protocols despite rapid developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties that strongly modulate how currents reach the developing brain. Using 70 pediatric head models and commonly used cortical targets, our forward simulations find that standard montages produce marked age-dependent reductions in target electric-field intensity and systematic sex differences linked to tissue-volume covariation, underscoring the profound limitations of conventional uniform montages. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a developmentally informed, dual-objective optimization framework designed to generate personalized Pareto fronts summarizing the trade-off between electric-field intensity and focality. From these optimized solutions, we derive two practical dosing prescriptions: a dose-consistency strategy that, for the first time, enforces fixed target intensity across individuals to implicitly mitigate demographic effects, and a target-engagement strategy that maximizes target intensity under safety limits. Both strategies remain robust to large conductivity variations, and we further show that dense HD-tDCS solutions admit sparse equivalents without performance loss under the target-engagement strategy. We also find that tissue conductivity sensitivity is depth-dependent, with Pareto-front distributions for superficial cortical targets most influenced by gray matter, scalp, and bone conductivities, and those for a deep target predominantly shaped by gray and white matter conductivities. Together, these results establish a principled framework for pediatric HD-tDCS planning that explicitly accounts for developmental anatomy and physiological uncertainty, enabling reliable and individualized neuromodulation dosing in pediatric populations.

                arXiv:2512.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the representations learned by large language models (LLMs) are partially aligned to those of the human brain. However, whether and why this alignment score arises from a similar sequence of computations remains elusive. In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2407.09567v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information is typically understood as a structure that tells something about another structure, yet no widely accepted definition of information has been derived from first physical principles. Here we develop a substrate-agnostic framework that defines information directly from physical dynamics in systems ranging from molecular to neural, cultural, and technological. Persistent physical structures are represented as almost invariant sets of the underlying dynamics, and their structure-creating relations are encoded in a causal structure set whose nodes are long-lived structures and whose edges capture active generative influences. Within this setting we identify specific generative motifs - replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates - through which informational relations emerge: a structure carries information about another precisely when they are linked by these hereditary motifs. In this framework, information and evolution are ontologically intertwined: information is the hereditary causal agent in evolution, and evolution is the differential persistence of information variants within a causal structure set. We show how information entropy and information fitness can be constructed directly and algorithmically from the causal structure, providing substrate-independent measures of diversity and evolutionary success. Finally, by analogy with random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we formulate a hypothesis on the generic emergence of information: under broad structural conditions on persistence, generativity, and diversity, hereditary informational motifs should arise generically in sufficiently large causal-physical systems, making information-bearing, life-like processes expected rather than exceptional.

Abstract: Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy is an emerging, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has demonstrated considerable potential in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Several studies have found that pulsed wave (PW) tPBM therapy yields superior biomodulatory effects. However, its neural mechanisms are still unknown which poses a significant barrier to the development of an optimized protocol. A randomized, single-blind study including 29 participants was conducted using a crossover design, with sham and continuous wave (CW) groups as controls. The EEG microstate analysis was utilized to explore the relative variations in temporal parameters and brain functional connectivity. To further elucidate the dynamic activity patterns of microstates, a 10-repeat 10-fold cross-validation with nine machine learning algorithms and kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed. Results indicated that the pulsed wave mode enhanced the global efficiency, local efficiency, and betweenness centrality of microstate C in brain functional networks as well as the mean durations parameter achieving a middle to large effect size, with superior effects compared to the sham and continuous wave groups. Furthermore, the support vector machine based on the radial basis function method with kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis demonstrated the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.956, and found that the 8 of top-10 microstate features related to microstate C contributed most significantly to the PW mode. In conclusion, the EEG microstate analysis found that PW tPBM therapy modulates the microstate C-specific patterns in the human brain, suggesting that microstate dynamics may serve as a state-dependent biomarker for the optimization of tPBM protocol.

Abstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes

Abstract: Long COVID "brain fog" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground-truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for evaluating brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Many tasks require mapping continuous input data (e.g. images) to discrete task outputs (e.g. class labels). Yet, how neural networks learn to perform such discrete computations on continuous data manifolds remains poorly understood. Here, we show that signatures of such computations emerge in the representational geometry of neural networks as they learn. By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01081">Testing the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.01081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.

                arXiv:2310.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can implement complex computations by leveraging a range of dynamics, such as oscillations, attractors, and transient trajectories. A growing body of work has highlighted the emergence of phase codes, a type of oscillatory activity where information is encoded in the relative phase of network activity, in RNNs trained for working memory tasks. However, these studies rely on architectural constraints or regularization schemes that explicitly promote oscillatory solutions. Here, we investigate whether phase coding can emerge purely from task optimization by training continuous-time RNNs to perform a simple modular arithmetic task without oscillatory-promoting biases. We find that in the absence of such biases, RNNs can learn phase code solutions. Surprisingly, we also uncover a rich diversity of alternative solutions that solve our modular arithmetic task via qualitatively distinct dynamics and dynamical mechanisms. We map the solution space for our task and show that the phase code solution occupies a distinct region. These results suggest that phase coding can be a natural but not inevitable outcome of training RNNs on modular arithmetic, and highlight the diversity of solutions RNNs can learn to solve simple tasks.

                arXiv:2511.02241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.

                arXiv:2512.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking is central to optimization research, yet existing test suites for continuous optimization remain limited: classical collections are fixed and rigid, while previous generators cover only narrow families of landscapes with restricted variability and control over details. This paper introduces PORTAL (Platform for Optimization Research, Testing, Analysis, and Learning), a general benchmark generator that provides fine-grained, independent control over basin curvature, conditioning, variable interactions, and surface ruggedness. PORTAL's layered design spans from individual components to block-wise compositions of multi-component landscapes with controllable partial separability and imbalanced block contributions. It offers precise control over the shape of each component in every dimension and direction, and supports diverse transformation patterns through both element-wise and coupling operators with compositional sequencing. All transformations preserve component centers and local quadratic structure, ensuring stability and interpretability. A principled neutralization mechanism prevents unintended component domination caused by exponent or scale disparities, which addresses a key limitation of prior landscape generators. On this foundation, transformations introduce complex landscape characteristics, such as multimodality, asymmetry, and heterogeneous ruggedness, in a controlled and systematic way. PORTAL enables systematic algorithm analysis by supporting both isolation of specific challenges and progressive difficulty scaling. It also facilitates the creation of diverse datasets for meta-algorithmic research, tailored benchmark suite design, and interactive educational use. The complete Python and MATLAB source code for PORTAL is publicly available at [https://github.com/EvoMindLab/PORTAL].

                arXiv:2512.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are widely used general-purpose optimization methods due to their domain independence. However, under a limited number of function evaluations (#FEs), the performance of EAs is quite sensitive to the quality of the initial population. Obtaining a high-quality initial population without problem-specific knowledge remains a significant challenge. To address this, this work proposes a general-purpose population initialization method, named mixture-of-experience for population initialization (MPI), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. MPI leverages solving experiences from previously solved problems to generate high-quality initial populations for new problems using only a small number of FEs. Its main novelty lies in a general-purpose approach for representing, selecting, and transferring solving experiences without requiring problem-specific knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted across six binary optimization problem classes, comprising three classic classes and three complex classes from real-world applications. The experience repository is constructed solely based on instances from the three classic classes, while the performance evaluation is performed across all six classes. The results demonstrate that MPI effectively transfers solving experiences to unseen problem classes (i.e., the complex ones) and higher-dimensional problem instances, significantly outperforming existing general-purpose population initialization methods.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate a neural network model in which weights between computational nodes are modified according to a local learning rule. To determine whether local learning rules are sufficient for learning, we encode the network architectures and learning dynamics genetically and then apply selection pressure to evolve networks capable of learning the four boolean functions of one variable. The successful networks are analysed and we show how learning behaviour emerges as a distributed property of the entire network. Finally the utility of genetic algorithms as a tool of discovery is discussed.

                arXiv:2512.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations.
  We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.

                arXiv:2512.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a regression method that aims to discover mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between variables, and it is often implemented through Genetic Programming, a metaphor for the process of biological evolution. Its appeal lies in combining predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its promise is limited by several long-standing challenges: parameters are difficult to optimize, the selection of solutions can affect the search, and models often grow unnecessarily complex. In addition, current methods must be constantly re-evaluated to understand the SR landscape. This thesis addresses these challenges through a sequence of studies conducted throughout the doctorate, each focusing on an important aspect of the SR search process. First, I investigate parameter optimization, obtaining insights into its role in improving predictive accuracy, albeit with trade-offs in runtime and expression size. Next, I study parent selection, exploring $\epsilon$-lexicase to select parents more likely to generate good performing offspring. The focus then turns to simplification, where I introduce a novel method based on memoization and locality-sensitive hashing that reduces redundancy and yields simpler, more accurate models. All of these contributions are implemented into a multi-objective evolutionary SR library, which achieves Pareto-optimal performance in terms of accuracy and simplicity on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming several contemporary SR approaches. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to a famous large-scale symbolic regression benchmark suite, then running the experiments to assess the symbolic regression landscape, demonstrating that a SR method with the contributions presented in this thesis achieves Pareto-optimal performance.

                arXiv:2512.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handling static images that lack inherent temporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge for spiking neural networks (SNNs). In directly trained SNNs, static inputs are typically repeated across time steps, causing the temporal dimension to collapse into a rate like representation and preventing meaningful temporal modeling. This work revisits the reported performance gap between direct and rate based encodings and shows that it primarily stems from convolutional learnability and surrogate gradient formulations rather than the encoding schemes themselves. To illustrate this mechanism level clarification, we introduce a minimal learnable temporal encoding that adds adaptive phase shifts to induce meaningful temporal variation from static inputs.

Abstract: Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) is a popular method for non-algorithmic estimation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) model was proposed by researchers, however, no optimal approach for reliable estimation was developed. Achieving high accuracy in the ABE might be challenging for new software projects that differ from previous initiatives. This study (conducted in June 2024) proposes a Firefly Algorithm-guided Analogy-Based Estimation (FAABE) model that combines FA with ABE to improve estimation accuracy. The FAABE model was tested on five publicly accessible datasets: Cocomo81, Desharnais, China, Albrecht, Kemerer and Maxwell. To improve prediction efficiency, feature selection was used. The results were measured using a variety of evaluation metrics; various error measures include MMRE, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Compared to conventional models, the experimental results show notable increases in prediction precision, demonstrating the efficacy of the Firefly-Analogy ensemble.

                arXiv:2512.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms constitute a branch of optimization that is concerned with discovering a diverse and high-quality set of solutions to an optimization problem. Current QD methods commonly maintain diversity by dividing the behavior space into discrete regions, ensuring that solutions are distributed across different parts of the space. The QD problem is then solved by searching for the best solution in each region. This approach to QD optimization poses challenges in large solution spaces, where storing many solutions is impractical, and in high-dimensional behavior spaces, where discretization becomes ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality. We present an alternative framing of the QD problem, called \emph{Soft QD}, that sidesteps the need for discretizations. We validate this formulation by demonstrating its desirable properties, such as monotonicity, and by relating its limiting behavior to the widely used QD Score metric. Furthermore, we leverage it to derive a novel differentiable QD algorithm, \emph{Soft QD Using Approximated Diversity (SQUAD)}, and demonstrate empirically that it is competitive with current state of the art methods on standard benchmarks while offering better scalability to higher dimensional problems.

Abstract: We present Conformer-based decoders for the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL competition, targeting two foundational MEG tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks. For further implementation details, the technical documentation, source code, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/neural2speech/libribrain-experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01626">Parallel Delayed Memory Units for Enhanced Temporal Modeling in Biomedical and Bioacoustic Signal Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced deep learning architectures, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely applied in audio, bioacoustic, and biomedical signal analysis, especially in data-scarce environments. While gated RNNs remain effective, they can be relatively over-parameterised and less training-efficient in some regimes, while linear RNNs tend to fall short in capturing the complexity inherent in bio-signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Parallel Delayed Memory Unit (PDMU), a {delay-gated state-space module for short-term temporal credit assignment} targeting audio and bioacoustic signals, which enhances short-term temporal state interactions and memory efficiency via a gated delay-line mechanism. Unlike previous Delayed Memory Units (DMU) that embed temporal dynamics into the delay-line architecture, the PDMU further compresses temporal information into vector representations using Legendre Memory Units (LMU). This design serves as a form of causal attention, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its reliance on past states and improve real-time learning performance. Notably, in low-information scenarios, the gating mechanism behaves similarly to skip connections by bypassing state decay and preserving early representations, thereby facilitating long-term memory retention. The PDMU is modular, supporting parallel training and sequential inference, and can be easily integrated into existing linear RNN frameworks. Furthermore, we introduce bidirectional, efficient, and spiking variants of the architecture, each offering additional gains in performance or energy efficiency. Experimental results on diverse audio and biomedical benchmarks demonstrate that the PDMU significantly enhances both memory capacity and overall model performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01698">Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Integer Linear Programming: Explainable Graph-Based Instance Space Analysis in Air Transportation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.01698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01824">HERMES: Heterogeneous Application-Enabled Routing Middleware for Edge-IoT Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of the Internet of Things has enabled a new generation of applications, pushing computation and intelligence toward the network edge. This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.

                arXiv:2312.08134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has emerged as a popular topic of evolutionary computation over the past decade. It aims to concurrently address multiple optimization tasks within limited computing resources, leveraging inter-task knowledge transfer techniques. Despite the abundance of multitask evolutionary algorithms (MTEAs) proposed for multitask optimization (MTO), there remains a need for a comprehensive software platform to help researchers evaluate MTEA performance on benchmark MTO problems as well as explore real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first open-source benchmarking platform, named MToP, for EMT. MToP incorporates over 50 MTEAs, more than 200 MTO problem cases with real-world applications, and over 20 performance metrics. Based on these, we provide benchmarking recommendations tailored for different MTO scenarios. Moreover, to facilitate comparative analyses between MTEAs and traditional evolutionary algorithms, we adapted over 50 popular single-task evolutionary algorithms to address MTO problems. Notably, we release extensive pre-run experimental data on benchmark suites to enhance reproducibility and reduce computational overhead for researchers. MToP features a user-friendly graphical interface, facilitating results analysis, data export, and schematic visualization. More importantly, MToP is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing users to develop new algorithms and tackle emerging problem domains. The source code of MToP is available at: https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform

                arXiv:2407.03131v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.

                arXiv:2504.04527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The green vehicle routing problem with private capacitated alternative fuel stations (GrVRP-PCAFS) extends the traditional green vehicle routing problem by considering capacitated refueling stations, where a limited number of vehicles can refuel simultaneously and additional vehicles must wait. This feature presents new challenges for route planning, as waiting times at stations must be managed while keeping route durations within limits and reducing total travel distance. This article presents METS, a novel memetic algorithm (MA) with separate constraint-based tour segmentation (SCTS) and a local search procedure tailored for solving GrVRP-PCAFS. METS balances exploration and exploitation through three key components. For exploration, the SCTS strategy splits giant tours to generate diverse solutions, and the search process is guided by a comprehensive fitness evaluation function to dynamically control feasibility and diversity to produce solutions that are both diverse and near-feasible. For exploitation, the local search procedure incorporates tailored move operators with constant-time evaluation mechanisms, enabling efficient examination of large solution neighborhoods. Experimental results demonstrate that METS discovers 31 new best-known solutions out of 40 instances in existing benchmark sets, achieving substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a new large-scale benchmark set based on real-world logistics data is introduced to facilitate future research.

                arXiv:2506.23717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and DVS-GESTURE datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet.

Abstract: Online reviews play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions, especially in the context of e-commerce. However, the quality and reliability of these reviews can vary significantly. Some reviews contain misleading or unhelpful information, such as advertisements, fake content, or irrelevant details. These issues pose significant challenges for recommendation systems, which rely on user-generated reviews to provide personalized suggestions. This article introduces a recommendation system based on Passer Learning Optimization-enhanced Bi-LSTM classifier applicable to e-commerce recommendation systems with improved accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. It achieves as low as 1.24% MSE on the baby dataset. This lifts it as high as 88.58%. Besides, there is also robust performance of the system on digital music and patio lawn garden datasets at F1 of 88.46% and 92.51%, correspondingly. These results, made possible by advanced graph embedding for effective knowledge extraction and fine-tuning of classifier parameters, establish the suitability of the proposed model in various e-commerce environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we build a general modelling framework for memristors, suitable for the simulation of event-based systems such as hardware spiking neural networks, and more generally, neuromorphic computing systems composed of three independent components: i) an event-based modelling approach, extending and generalising an existing general model of memristors - the Generalised Metastable Switch Model (GMSM) - eliminating errors associated with discrete time approximation, as well as offering potential improvements in terms of suitability for neuromorphic memristive system simulations; ii) a volatility state variable to allow for the unified understanding of disparate non-linear and volatile phenomena, including state relaxation, structural disruption, Joule heating, and non-linear drift in different memristive devices; and iii) a readout equation that separates the latent state variable evolution from explicit variables of interest such as an instantaneous resistance. We exhibit an illustrative implementation of this framework, fit to a resistive drift dataset for titanium dioxide memristors, based on a proposed linear conductance model for resistive drift in the devices. Finally, we highlight the application of the model to neuromorphic computing, through demonstrating the contribution of the volatility state variable to switching dynamics, resulting in frequency-dependent switching (for stable memristors acting as programmable synaptic weights) and the generation of action potentials (for unstable memristors, acting as spike-generators).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05126">Skewed Neuronal Heterogeneity Enhances Efficiency On Various Computing Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.05126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity is a ubiquitous property of many biological systems and has profound implications for computation. While it is conceivable to optimize neuronal and synaptic heterogeneity for a specific task, such top-down optimization is biologically implausible, prone to catastrophic forgetting, and both data- and energy-intensive. In contrast, biological organisms, with remarkable capacity to perform numerous tasks with minimal metabolic cost, exhibit a heterogeneity that is inherent, stable during adulthood, and task-unspecific. Inspired by this intrinsic form of heterogeneity, we investigate the utility of variations in neuronal time constants for solving hundreds of distinct temporal tasks of varying complexity. Our results show that intrinsic heterogeneity significantly enhances performance and robustness in an implementation-independent manner, indicating its usefulness for both (rate-based) machine learning and (spike-coded) neuromorphic applications. Importantly, only skewed heterogeneity profiles-reminiscent of those found in biology-produce such performance gains. We further demonstrate that this computational advantage eliminates the need for large networks, allowing comparable performance with substantially lower operational, metabolic, and energetic costs, respectively in silico, in vivo, and on neuromorphic hardware. Finally, we discuss the implications of intrinsic (rather than task-induced) heterogeneity for the design of efficient artificial systems, particularly novel neuromorphic devices that exhibit similar device-to-device variability.

                Background This research supports SDG 17, partnerships for goals, as it will focus on the relationship between the Cañariaco Project’s communication strategies and citizens’ environmental perceptions, promoting transparency, informed participation, and institutional trust at the local level. The study aims to determine the relationship between the communication strategies of the Cañariaco project and the environmental perception of citizens in a district of the province of Ferreñafe 2025, Peru. Methods The chosen methodology is quantitative, with a non-experimental, cross-sectional correlational design. The population consisted of 183 citizens, who were sampled using a representative sample of 125 participants using physical surveys composed of two previously validated instruments that assess the relevant constructs. Results The analysis revealed that, while people show a high level of environmental awareness, the outreach tactics of the Cañariaco project are generally not considered very impactful. We noted that a significant portion of the survey participants felt that these tactics are at a low or medium level, which highlights certain deficiencies in the clarity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the feedback received. However, it was also discovered that there is a group with strong environmental awareness, which indicates concern and understanding about environmental issues, beyond the communication initiatives of the project. Additionally, the collected data diverges from studies that propose a direct connection between outreach tactics and environmental awareness, suggesting that other aspects may be influencing how the community perceives things. Conclusions Consequently, it was concluded that the communication strategies of the Cañariaco project do not directly affect how the population perceives the environment. In reality, this perception is mainly built upon past experiences and the cultural values of the people. This shows us that simply improving external communication is not enough to foster trust and community participation.

                <p>The medial habenula (MHb) and its main projection target, the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), play an important role in mood/affect, anxiety, and the aversive experience associated with nicotine withdrawal. Given that MHb axons release glutamate onto IPN neurons, we investigated the expression and functional responses of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) in neurons of the rostral IPN (IPR) in male rats. After confirming mRNA expression of <I>Gria1</I> and <I>Grin1</I> iGluR subunits in IPR, we employed glutamate uncaging coupled with two-photon imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology. IPR dendrites, which often contained spine-like protrusions suggestive of synaptic contacts, featured a variety of response profiles following localized glutamate uncaging. Pharmacology experiments confirmed functional &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate iGluR responses in IPR neuronal somata. Rats were trained to self-administer nicotine or saline during 10 fixed ratio 1 sessions and seven intermittent access sessions. In rats with a history of nicotine self-administration, perisomatic IPR iGluR responses are reduced. Acute nicotine application to slices from drug-naive rats recapitulated the effect of nicotine self-administration. These results identify a mechanism, whereby nicotine, even acute nicotine, may reduce IPR neuron sensitivity to glutamate from MHb axons, which could play a role in the aversive response to nicotine withdrawal.</p>

                Background The study of the reproductive biology of pelagic fish species, such as Sarda chiliensis (Bonito), is essential for effective fisheries management and aquaculture development. Overfishing has significantly impacted the population of pelagic fish species, making it crucial to understand their reproductive cycles, including maturity stages and spawning periods, to ensure sustainable exploitation. Methods This study provides the first histological characterization of the early gonadal stages of Sarda chiliensis from northern Chile. A total of 444 specimens were collected from artisanal fisheries between December 2013 and June 2014. Gonadal maturity stages were identified using histological techniques, and a range of microscopic stains (Hematoxylin-Eosin, Van Gieson, and Periodic Acid–Schiff ) were employed to examine the cellular structure of the gonads. Results Two key gonadal stages—inactive and previtellogenic—were identified in females, while males exhibited both immature and mature stages. Histological observations revealed distinct characteristics of early gonadal development, including primary oocytes and spermatogonia, with evidence of early vitellogenesis in females. No mature females were observed, and the smallest mature female recorded was 48.5 cm in total length. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) exhibited temporal fluctuations, with a peak observed in February. Conclusions This study provides vital histological data on the early gonadal stages of Sarda chiliensis from northern Chile, offering a baseline for future reproductive studies and aquaculture initiatives. The absence of mature females in the sample highlights the need for broader temporal and spatial sampling to fully characterize the reproductive cycle. These findings are crucial for developing sustainable fisheries management strategies and improving broodstock conditioning for aquaculture.

                Narrative Curriculum Vitae (NCVs) are a type of CV focusing on written descriptions of researchers’ skills, experiences, collaborations, and achievements, which seek to promote more equitable and responsible research assessments. Despite an apparent shift by funding organizations towards the use of NCVs to reassess how researchers are evaluated, the extent of current NCV adoption is unclear. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to answer the following: 1. Which research funding agencies currently provide NCVs templates for their applicants? and 2. What are the characteristics of said NCV templates? To this end, we employed grey literature searches to identify all existing NCV templates provided by research funding organizations. Our findings highlight several key insights. First, number of funders currently requiring NCVs remains low overall, although national granting agencies are among the early adopters. Second, some funders do not provide formal guidance on how to complete narrative CV’s—this may create barriers to uptake. Third, among the NCV templates identified, there are structural commonalities, although there is little insight into the evaluation of NCVs. As interest in NCVs grows, addressing these gaps will be essential to realizing their potential as a fairer and more holistic tool for research assessment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1344/v1?src=rss">Hybrid PSO-GA Metaheuristic Optimization for Comprehensive Student Performance Enhancement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Students aim for well-rounded performance, and higher education institutions strive to support them. While written tests assess academic achievement, they do not fully capture skills like critical thinking, creativity, public speaking, and physical fitness. The proposed paper suggests a holistic optimization model involving a Hybrid PSO-GA (Particle Swarm Optimization - Genetic Algorithm) metaheuristic algorithm that would generate a more holistic student assessment platform that constitutes a fitness function that would evaluate students not only on exams but also on academic, co-curricular and extracurricular facets. The model formulates a constrained optimization problem where cognitive effort allocation is optimized under individual workload limits derived from factors such as cognitive capacity, time availability, fatigue, and task complexity. Proposed model evaluated in C++ and analyzed statistically in Python across three setups with population sizes of 25, 50, and 100, and up to 200 iterations. A previous survey-based study was considered in formulating datasets, and normalized cognitive workload scores were applied to five categories of tasks. The hybrid algorithm outperformed standalone Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization methods, achieving the highest mean fitness of 1.273 and the lowest standard deviation of 0.004. Statistical significance was confirmed using the Friedman and Nemenyi tests with p-values less than 0.0001, demonstrating the robustness and superior convergence of the hybrid model. The proposed approach provides a computationally intelligent and statistically robust framework for holistic student performance assessment, with implications for adaptive academic workload management and policy-driven educational enhancement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1343/v1?src=rss">Validation of the diagnostic score for acute pancreatitis: a prospective study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a potentially life-threatening condition with a rising global incidence and mortality. Early diagnosis is critical for improving prognosis; however, in resource-limited settings such as Tunisia, access to lipase testing and imaging may be restricted, leading to delayed diagnosis. The PRE-PAN score was recently developed as a clinical diagnostic tool for AP, based on pain characteristics and other readily available clinical parameters. Methods We conducted a prospective monocentric study at the Rabta Hospital in Tunis, Tunisia, including patients who presented with epigastric pain between October 2024 and April 2025. The PRE-PAN scores were calculated for each patient. Lipase testing and/or CT scans were ordered based on the clinical suspicion. Statistical analyses included ROC curve evaluation to assess the diagnostic accuracy. Results A total of 200 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 56 years and female predominance (64%). Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in 11.6% of the cases. Patients with AP experienced significantly more intense and radiating pain (p<0.001). The PRE-PAN score had an area under the ROC curve of 0.955 (p<0.001), indicating excellent diagnostic performance. A cutoff score >5.75 yielded a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 85.5%, positive predictive value of 44.5%, and negative predictive value of 98%. Conclusion The PRE-PAN score is a highly sensitive and specific clinical tool for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Its ease of use and strong diagnostic performance support its implementation as an early screening tool in emergency departments, particularly in settings with limited diagnostic resources.

Thermostability is an important property of proteins and a critical factor for their wide application. Accurate prediction of ΔΔG enables the estimation of the impact of mutations on thermostability in advance. A range of ΔΔG prediction methods based on machine learning has now emerged. However, their prediction performance remains limited due to insufficiently informative training features and little effort has been made to integrate feature calculation resources. Based on this, we integrated 12 computational resources to develop a pipeline capable of automatically calculating 1,547 features. In addition, a feature-enriched DDGWizard dataset was created, including 15,752 ΔΔG data. Furthermore, we performed feature selection and developed an accurate ΔΔG prediction model that achieved an <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> of 0.61 in cross-validation. It also outperformed several other representative prediction methods in comparisons with independent datasets. Together, the feature calculation pipeline, DDGWizard dataset, and prediction model constitute the DDGWizard system, freely available for ΔΔG analysis and prediction.

                <p>by Jimin Pei, R. Dustin Schaeffer, Qian Cong, Nick V. Grishin</p>

Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2, have enabled identification of vast numbers of putative novel protein domains across the sequence space, many of which adopt structures dissimilar to known folds. Based on structural segmentation and classification, the Encyclopedia of Domains (TED) project recently cataloged more than 7400 low-symmetry, structure-based domains as candidate novel-fold (CNF) domains. To place these domains in their broader evolutionary and structural context, we applied DPAM (Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models), a complementary method that combines AlphaFold-derived confidence metrics with sensitive sequence and structure similarity searches, to parse domains for the AlphaFold models of proteins containing TED CNF domains. We identified 8044 DPAM domains with significant overlap with TED CNF domains, among which 2490 were confidently assigned to entries in the ECOD (Evolutionary Classification of protein Domains) structural classification hierarchy. Our results suggest that a substantial subset of TED candidate novel-fold domains are distant homologs of existing ECOD domains. Comparison of domain boundaries between TED and DPAM showed varied patterns: more than one-third of cases featured TED CNF domains largely embedded within DPAM domains—often representing insertions or extensions into enzymatic or repeat folds. A smaller fraction (17%) exhibited consistent domain boundaries between TED and DPAM. These consistently defined domains are often characterized by significant structural diversity, including long insertions and duplications. An even smaller subset showed the reverse relationship, with DPAM domains largely embedded within TED CNF domains. In these cases, DPAM effectively separated multiple structural units that TED grouped as single domains. Together, these findings highlight the complementarity of structural and evolutionary approaches for domain annotation and demonstrate the power of integrative methods, such as DPAM, in refining the classification of challenging protein folds and uncovering distant evolutionary relationships.

                <p>by Domenico Guarino, Ilaria Carannante, Alain Destexhe</p>

The activity of neurons in the central nervous system changes drastically across different states like asleep or awake, attentive or drowsy, behaving or resting. Neuromodulation supports these changes by altering neuronal excitability. Much work has been devoted to understanding the effects of neuromodulators on various neurons. However, we still lack a cohesive picture of how neuromodulation affects neuronal dynamics. Here, we provide an analytical framework to characterise neuromodulation.
First, we analyse electrophysiological data from published papers and extracte features for seven types of neurons from five areas of the human and rodent central nervous system, under the effect of five neuromodulators. Second, we describe this data using the widespread, simple, yet biologically accurate, Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire model (AdEx). Third, we use a dimensionality reduction technique to study the parameter space of the control and neuromodulated conditions. Fourth, we examine the dynamics of each neuromodulator through bifurcation and phase-plane analyses.
Our analyses revealed that: (i) different neuromodulators remap the parameters space of neurons into non-overlapping clusters, (ii) changes in electrophysiological properties induced by neuromodulators can be explained by transitions between dynamical regimes in the excitability landscape of neurons, and (iii) there are only two distinct neuromodulatory effects: “switching” – changing the spiking behaviour – and “scaling” – strengthening or weakening an existing behaviour. Leveraging this framework, we estimated the effect of neuromodulation in one species using data from another species.This study provides an integrative perspective on neuromodulation, offering experimenters and theoreticians a compact description of its impact on neuronal activity. The open-source Python-based workflow is modular and readily applicable to other datasets.

                <p>by Mackenzie M. Johnson, Kevin Sung, Hugh K. Haddox, Ashni A. Vora, Tatsuya Araki, Gabriel D. Victora, Yun S. Song, Julia Fukuyama, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

Antibodies play a crucial role in adaptive immunity. They develop as B cell receptors (BCRs): membrane-bound forms of antibodies that are expressed on the surfaces of B cells. BCRs are refined through affinity maturation, a process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and natural selection, to improve binding to an antigen. Computational models of affinity maturation have developed from two main perspectives: molecular evolution and language modeling. The molecular evolution perspective focuses on nucleotide sequence context to describe mutation and selection; the language modeling perspective involves learning patterns from large data sets of protein sequences. In this paper, we compared models from both perspectives on their ability to predict the course of antibody affinity maturation along phylogenetic trees of BCR sequences. This included models of SHM, models of SHM combined with an estimate of selection, and protein language models. We evaluated these models for large human BCR repertoire data sets, as well as an antigen-specific mouse experiment with a pre-rearranged cognate naive antibody. We demonstrated that precise modeling of SHM, which requires the nucleotide context, provides a substantial amount of predictive power for predicting the course of affinity maturation. Notably, a simple nucleotide-based convolutional neural network modeling SHM outperformed state-of-the-art protein language models, including one trained exclusively on antibody sequences. Furthermore, incorporating estimates of selection based on a custom deep mutational scanning experiment brought only modest improvement in predictive power. To support further research, we introduce EPAM (Evaluating Predictions of Affinity Maturation), a benchmarking framework to integrate evolutionary principles with advances in language modeling, offering a road map for understanding antibody evolution and improving predictive models.

                <p>by Siyi Huang, Linfeng Jiang, Ming Yi, Yuan Zhu</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity. A major challenge, however, lies in the prevalence of non-biological zeros—false measurements caused by technical limitations that mask a cell’s true transcriptome. This fundamental issue of distinguishing these artifacts from true biological zeros, where a gene is genuinely absent, remains a key hurdle for computational methods, as misclassification can distort biological signals during data recovery. To overcome this, we introduce D3Impute, a discriminative imputation framework built on three key innovations: (1) a distribution-aware normalization step that adapts to dataset-specific characteristics while preserving meaningful biological variation; (2) a dual-network discriminator that uses bulk RNA-seq data as a biological reference to accurately identify non-biological zeros while retaining the true biological zeros; and (3) a density-guided imputation engine that recovers expression values while maintaining local cellular neighborhood structures. Through comprehensive benchmarking against 12 state-of-the-art methods across six diverse datasets, D3Impute demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in essential downstream analyses, including cell clustering, trajectory inference, and differential expression detection. Furthermore, we provide an extensive practical evaluation of D3Impute, demonstrating its robustness across varying data qualities and providing clear guidelines for optimal application. By offering a robust, biologically informed, and user-oriented solution, D3Impute not only enhances scRNA-seq data analysis but also offers a generalizable framework for handling zero-inflated data in computational biology.

Long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), affects an estimated 10–20% of patients and presents persistent multisystemic symptoms. Although demographic and clinical factors, such as age, sex, and comorbidities, contribute to risk, the genetic mechanisms underlying this risk remain poorly defined. To address this gap, we developed a multi-omics framework that integrates Transcriptome-Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR), Control Theory (CT), Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network to identify putative causal genes and network drivers in Long COVID. Our approach prioritized 32 candidate genes, including 19 previously reported and 13 novel, with roles in the SARS-CoV-2 response, viral carcinogenesis, immune regulation, and cell cycle control. Enrichment analyses revealed a shared genetic architecture in syndromic, metabolic, autoimmune, and connective tissue disorders. Using causal gene expression profiles, we identified three distinct symptom-based subtypes of Long COVID, providing information on the heterogeneity of disease mechanisms and clinical presentation. Finally, we developed an open-source Shiny application for interactive exploration of these findings. Together, this integrative framework highlights novel causal mechanisms and therapeutic targets, advancing precision medicine strategies for Long COVID.

RNA abundance quantification has become routine and affordable thanks to high-throughput “short-read” technologies that provide accurate molecule counts at the gene level. Similarly accurate and affordable quantification of definitive full-length, transcript isoforms has remained a stubborn challenge, despite its obvious biological significance across a wide range of problems. “Long-read” sequencing platforms now produce data-types that can, in principle, drive routine definitive isoform quantification. However some particulars of contemporary long-read datatypes, together with isoform complexity and genetic variation, present bioinformatic challenges. We show here, using ONT data, that fast and accurate quantification of long-read data is possible and that it is improved by exome capture. To perform quantifications we developed lr-kallisto, which adapts the kallisto bulk and single-cell RNA-seq quantification methods for long-read technologies.

What seems obvious in one context can take on an entirely different meaning if that context shifts. While context-dependent inference has been widely studied, a fundamental question remains: how does the brain simultaneously infer both the meaning of sensory input and the underlying context itself, especially when the context is changing? Here, we study flexible perceptual inference—the ability to adapt rapidly to implicit contextual shifts without trial and error. We introduce a novel change-detection task in dynamic environments that requires tracking latent state and context. We find that mice exhibit first-trial behavioral adaptation to latent context shifts driven by inference rather than reward feedback. By deriving the Bayes-optimal policy under a partially observable Markov decision process, we show that rapid adaptation emerges from sequential updates of an internal belief state. In addition, we show that artificial neural networks trained via reinforcement learning achieve near-optimal performance, implementing Bayesian inference-like mechanisms within their recurrent dynamics. These networks develop flexible internal representations that enable adaptive inference in real-time. Our findings establish flexible perceptual inference as a core principle of cognitive flexibility, offering computational and neural-mechanistic insights into adaptive behavior in uncertain environments.

                <p>by Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman</p>

A recent study by Faye Orcales and colleagues proposes a teaching curriculum on supervised machine learning applied to genomics data aimed at predicting antibiotic resistance. The article describes a traditional machine learning pipeline step-by-step in a way that is accessible to anyone, including novices. However, the authors provide a misleading piece of advice in the “Evaluating model performance” section, where they recommend that readers use accuracy and the F1 score for binary classification. We write this short formal comment on that article to reaffirm and explain why accuracy and the F1 score should be avoided in the evaluation of binary classification and why the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) should be employed instead. We also take this opportunity to warn readers about the dangers of <i>k</i>-fold cross-validation, which is suggested as a standard method for dividing data into training set and test set, but has several flaws and pitfalls.

                <p>by Creighton M. Lisowski, Gavin M. King, Ioan Kosztin</p>

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) can create images of biomolecules under near-native conditions but suffers from limited lateral resolution due to the finite AFM tip size and recording frequency. The recently developed Localization Atomic Force Microscopy or LAFM (Heath et al., Nature 594, 385 (2021)) enhances lateral resolution by reconstructing peak positions in AFM image stacks, but it is less effective for flexible proteins with multiple conformations. Here we introduce an unsupervised deep learning algorithm that simultaneously registers and clusters images by protein conformation, thus making LAFM applicable to more flexible proteins. Using simulated AFM images from molecular dynamics simulations of the SecYEG translocon as a model membrane protein system, we demonstrate improved resolution for individual protein conformations. This work represents a step towards a more general LAFM algorithm that can handle biological macromolecules with multiple distinct conformational states such as SecYEG.

                <p>by Ana Paredes-Vázquez, Eva Balsa-Canto, Julio R. Banga</p>

Microbial communities, complex ecological networks crucial for human and planetary health, remain poorly understood in terms of the quantitative principles governing their composition, assembly, and function. Dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting microbiome behaviors. However, developing reliable ODE models is severely hampered by their nonlinear nature and the presence of significant challenges, particularly critical issues related to identifiability.
Here, we address the identification problem in dynamic microbial community models by proposing an integrated methodology to tackle key challenges. Focusing on nonlinear ODE-based models, we examine four critical pitfalls: identifiability issues (structural and practical), unstable dynamics (potentially leading to numerical blow-up), underfitting (convergence to suboptimal solutions), and overfitting (fitting noise rather than signal). These pitfalls yield unreliable parameter estimates, unrealistic model behavior, and poor generalization. Our study presents a comprehensive workflow incorporating structural and practical identifiability analysis, robust global optimization for calibration, stability checks, and rigorous predictive power assessment. The methodology’s effectiveness and versatility in mitigating these pitfalls are demonstrated through case studies of increasing complexity, paving the way for more reliable and mechanistically insightful models of microbial communities.

                <p>by Harriet Longley, Christophe Fraser, Chris Wymant, Katrina Lythgoe</p>

HIV-1 is a well-studied example of a pathogen that has evolved an intermediate level of virulence that maximises transmission. For a trait to evolve it must be heritable, and although viral load—a proxy for disease severity—has been shown to be a heritable trait, it is surprising that specific heritable viral factors remain mostly elusive. Rapid within-host evolution is also expected to diminish heritability. We hypothesised that rather than a small number of mutations of large effect determining viral load, the number of slightly deleterious mutations could be key. As a proof of principle, we explored how viral load is expected to evolve within and between hosts using a nested modelling approach that links within-host evolution with epidemiological outcomes. For mutations of sufficiently small effect, a mutation-selection balance is gradually reached during infection, resulting in slow changes in viral load despite rapid rates of genomic evolution. In simulated epidemics, we generated realistic population distributions of viral loads and estimates of heritability. The existence of many slightly deleterious mutations provides a mechanism that can help to explain why viral loads change slowly during infection, broad distributions of viral loads among individuals, and why searches for viral factors that determine viral load have had limited success.

                <p>by Angus F. Chapman, Rachel N. Denison</p>

How does the visual system process dynamic inputs? Perception and neural activity are shaped by the spatial and temporal context of sensory input, which has been modeled by divisive normalization over space or time. However, theoretical work has largely treated normalization separately within these dimensions and has not explained how future stimuli can suppress past ones. Here, we introduce a dynamic spatiotemporal normalization model (DSTN) with a unified spatiotemporal receptive field structure that implements normalization across both space and time and ask whether this model captures the bidirectional effects of temporal context on neural responses and behavior. DSTN implements temporal normalization through excitatory and suppressive drives that depend on the recent history of stimulus input, controlled by separate temporal windows. We found that biphasic temporal receptive fields emerged from this normalization computation, consistent with empirical observations. The model also reproduced several neural response properties, including surround suppression, nonlinear response dynamics, subadditivity, response adaptation, and backwards masking. Further, spatiotemporal normalization captured bidirectional temporal suppression that depended on stimulus contrast, consistent with human behavior. Thus, DSTN captured a wide range of neural and behavioral effects, demonstrating that a unified spatiotemporal normalization computation could underlie dynamic stimulus processing and perception.

Why do we observe some plant phenotypes but not others? The multivariate phenotypic space occupied by individuals or species often reveals both limits and phenotypes strikingly deviating from main syndromes. These observations are usually thought to indicate, respectively, inviable trait combinations and unique phenotypes adapted to specific environments. However, the evolutionary drivers underlying trait covariations often remain unclear. Here, we characterized the phenotypic space of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by comparing 713 wild accessions collected across the globe with 2,544 artificially-created recombinant individuals. This, combined with the detection of adaptive processes operating within species, allowed us to elucidate the roles of natural selection as a driver of phenotypic (co)variations within <i>A. thaliana</i>. We found that the phenotypic space of this species is constrained and driven by varying levels of divergent and stabilizing selection across different traits. Moreover, at the margins of the European geographic range, strong directional selection favored outlier phenotypes characterized by very late flowering and variation in a WRKY transcription factor gene. Genome analyses revealed that these extreme phenotypes may be explained by hybridization between ancestral and modern lineages of <i>A. thaliana</i>. Our findings demonstrate how interplays between population history and natural selection shape phenotypic diversity in a plant species.

                <p>by Vanessa Kay Miller, Kendal Broadie</p>

Synapse connectivity is optimized in response to environmental input in critical periods, characterized by experience-dependent, temporally-restricted, and transiently-reversible synapse pruning by glial phagocytes. This precise, targeted synaptic elimination process requires glial serotonergic intercellular signaling. We discover glia-to-glia communication between different glial classes is essential for experience-dependent synaptic pruning in a well-defined <i>Drosophila</i> juvenile brain olfactory critical period. We find ensheathing glia infiltrate specific target synaptic glomeruli in response to guiding odorant experience via 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) signaling. Using cell-targeted tryptophan hydroxylase (Trhn) RNAi to block serotonin production, we discover serotonin signaling from ensheathing glia is required for experience-dependent synapse pruning. Using cell-targeted 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R RNAi, we find the serotonin receptor is required exclusively in astrocyte-like glia (ALG). Using cell-targeted 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R rescue in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R null mutants, we discover the serotonin receptor mediates experience-dependent synapse pruning. Thus, glia-to-glia serotonin signaling between different glial classes mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors is necessary and sufficient for synapse elimination. We discover that ALG-targeted conditional 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R in mature adults induces experience-dependent synapse pruning indistinguishable from the critical period mechanism. Thus, astrocyte 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R signaling is sufficient to ‘re-open’ this characteristic critical period remodeling capability at maturity. We find astrocytic matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) induced by critical period odorant experience is required for experience-dependent synapse pruning downstream of 5HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation. We discover that ALG-targeted MMP-1 induction restores synapse pruning in the absence of 5HT<sub>2A</sub>R signaling. Taken together, we conclude that glia-to-glia serotonergic 5HT<sub>2A</sub>R signaling drives MMP-1 for experience-dependent infiltration phagocytosis synapse pruning, and can rekindle this remodeling capacity at adult maturity.

                <p>by Sabih Rashid, Richard Roy</p>

Developmental plasticity allows organisms to adapt to environmental stress and improve reproductive fitness. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> adapts to starvation and other stressors by transiting through an alternate developmental stage called dauer, which allows them to remain quiescent for several months, and yet fully retain reproductive fitness when they resume development. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential for animals to passage through the dauer stage without reproductive consequence. The loss of AMPK leads to germline hyperplasia, dramatically reduced post-dauer fertility, and shortened dauer survival. We identified a putative RNA-binding helicase (HZL-1) that is targeted by AMPK. Disabling HZL-1 function rescues many dauer and post-dauer reproductive defects typical of the AMPK mutants. HZL-1 shares significant similarity with the conserved HELZ family of RNA helicases, possessing characteristic DEAH helicase motifs, a predicted ATP binding motif, and intrinsically disordered regions that are crucial for its localization and function. Curiously, HZL-1 is expressed and exerts its function in the intestine, yet its elimination suppresses the aberrant germ cell proliferation while restoring germline quiescence and subsequent post-dauer fertility in AMPK mutants. CLIP-seq data revealed that HZL-1 binds several mRNAs during the dauer stage, and thus when it is active in AMPK mutants, its regulation of these RNAs contributes to germline hyperplasia in the dauer germ line. The most enriched RNA bound and inhibited by HZL-1, <i>argk-1</i>, promotes fertility by suppressing TOR activity in the germ line of dauer larvae, thereby preserving germline quiescence. These findings underscore the intricate role of RNAs and RNA-binding helicases in the complex interplay of genetic signals that animals have acquired to ensure their effective transit through periods of environmental challenge.

Promislow, Dana L. Miller, Amy K. Walker</p>

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), produced by SAM synthases, is critical for various cellular regulatory pathways and the synthesis of diverse metabolites. Humans and many other organisms express multiple SAM synthases. However, loss of different synthase activity can have distinct phenotypic effects. For instance, in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> loss of <i>sams-1</i> leads to enhanced heat shock survival and increased life span, but loss of <i>sams-4</i> reduces heat stress survival. This provides a biological context to test the hypothesis that the enzymatic source of SAM impacts its function and to identify mechanistic connections. Here, we show that SAMS-1 contributes SAM to a variety of intermediary metabolic pathways, whereas SAMS-4 has a more limited role to support SAM-dependent protein transmethylation reactions. Mitochondria seem to be particularly impacted specifically by loss of <i>sams-1</i>; many mitochondrial metabolites are perturbed and there is an age-dependent decline of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression in these animals. We further demonstrate that reduced production of phosphatidylcholine in <i>sams-1</i>-deficient animals leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent loss of mitochondrial components. We propose that alterations in mitochondria are mechanistically linked to the increased survival in heat stress specific to <i>sams-1</i>-deficient animals.

                The increasing demand for ethically acceptable, economically viable, and translationally relevant animal models in biomedical research positions Danio rerio (zebrafish) as a prominent alternative to traditional rodent systems. This review provides an integrated analysis of zebrafish biology and delineates their expanding applications in pharmacological investigations and toxicological evaluations. Emphasis is placed on genetic homology with humans, optical transparency during embryogenesis, and suitability for high-throughput screening, which collectively support the model’s relevance in contemporary biomedical studies. The historical progression of zebrafish usage is outlined, and critical biological features, such as developmental kinetics, sexual dimorphism, and organogenesis are described to contextualize their utility in disease modeling. Zebrafish are examined for their capacity to assess acute, chronic, and specialized toxicity endpoints, including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. Their roles in investigating inflammation, metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, cancer, and infectious diseases are also reviewed. Technological advancements, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing and the development of transgenic lines, are discussed alongside innovations in imaging and screening methodologies. Regulatory frameworks, as well as compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), are addressed. The review concludes by evaluating the potential of zebrafish in precision medicine and their capacity to enhance early-phase drug discovery through scalable, cost-effective, and biologically relevant approaches.

                Background Myocardial ischemia is a dynamic, complex process characterized by hyperkalemia, acidosis, and ATP depletion. While these three conditions alter cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, it is difficult to discern how much each one individually contributes to the resulting changes in action potential (AP). In this study, we test whether machine learning can deconvolute these distinct ischemic patterns within a single AP. Methods We developed a multi-target regression model trained on data generated by the Luo-Rudy (1991) computational model of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, simulating a wide range of ischemic conditions. The model was designed to predict two continuous variables: extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and intracellular pH (pHi). Results The model achieved high accuracy on a held-out test set, with mean squared errors (MSE) below 0.25 for [K+]o and below 0.01 for pHi. To further generalize this model, we applied this trained model to a structurally distinct model, the Ten Tusscher (2006) framework. We were able to accurately predict [K+]o and pHi from APs, demonstrating that the learned principles are robust. A feature importance analysis revealed that resting membrane potential (RMP) was the strongest predictor for [K+]o, while action potential duration (APD) is most important for predicting pHi, underscoring these distinct cardiomyocyte electrophysiological patterns Conclusions Our approach can distinguish distinct ischemic drivers and has potential for in silico drug screening and mechanistic analysis.

                The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has taken some measures to advance collective action to accelerate telehealth in the region. Still, it has encountered the problem of digital readiness and digital health preparedness disparities within the region. To maintain the consolidation of digital health utilization across ASEAN member states, this article offers policy recommendations to address the diverse approaches taken and compensate for capacity differences among members. Drawing on insights from published official policies, government health ministry websites of Southeast Asian nations, and ASEAN’s digital health policies, the article first reviews the diversities of digital technologies in a post-pandemic Southeast Asia and then assesses measures to enhance regional approaches. Several recommendations are presented: First, ASEAN can standardize regional frameworks for telehealth by sharing digital health transformation blueprints and leveraging ASEAN and ASEAN Plus forums to bridge divergent understandings and advance the region’s digital health initiatives. Second, ASEAN facilitates investment through a telehealth sandbox and fosters collaboration among stakeholders. Although the recommendations are consistent with the ‘ASEAN Way,’ lingering concerns in Southeast Asia’s telehealth landscape include different commitments and expectations, risks of privacy infringements, and the misuse of technology in the region’s authoritarian states.

                Molluscum contagiosum and human papillomavirus (HPV) are very common cutaneous infections with worldwide distribution, yet treatment options remain limited. Traditional therapies are invasive and have a high rate of recurrence, and newer topical agents available are costly. Here I discuss evidence supporting the hypothesis that the aluminum-based salts, utilized in the antiperspirant industry since the early 1900s, could have a therapeutic effect on skin lesions due to molluscum contagiosum, HPV and possibly other viruses. Clinical trials in this area are needed.

                Background The development of intercultural competences mediated by digital technologies has gained prominence in higher education, driven by academic internationalization and the advancement of virtual learning environments. However, questions remain regarding the most frequently studied competence dimensions, the geographic regions involved, and the methodologies employed. Methods A systematic literature mapping was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to analyze scientific production from 2005 to 2024, sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO. Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed, open-access articles, in English or Spanish, addressing the integration of digital technologies in the teaching of intercultural competence. After screening 176 records, 23 studies were included for analysis. Results Scientific production was primarily concentrated in the Americas and Europe (78%), with Mexico (15%) and countries such as the United States, Spain, and Russia each accounting for 11%. The most frequent competence dimensions were adaptation and management (47.83%), intercultural knowledge (39.13%), communication skills (39.13%), and intercultural attitudes (39.13%). Competences such as cultural adaptability, intercultural awareness, and intercultural communication were the most frequently addressed, reflecting the need for flexibility and communication skills in multicultural contexts. Technologies like COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) and immersive tools are emerging as effective strategies to promote intercultural learning, although areas such as innovative leadership (4.35%) and personal development (8.70%) remain underexplored. Temporally, there has been sustained growth in research since 2019, with peaks in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Conclusion Digital technologies show significant potential for the development of intercultural competences, but their implementation requires addressing structural, pedagogical, and equity-related gaps. This study lays the groundwork for future research and policies aimed at enhancing inclusive and sustainable intercultural education in digital environments.

                The human brain’s long-range axonal connections are the scaffolding for communication across functionally distinct areas. Yet knowledge of the human brain’s wiring diagram remains limited, largely due to longstanding technological challenges. Recent innovations in microscopy may now enable mapping human brain connectivity at the mesoscale (groups of neurons and their axons). In this review we describe the challenges of generating the wiring diagrams of the human brain, avenues forward, and reasons why such an effort is so important. We argue for building a human mesoscale connectome via a multimodal, multi-species, axon-centric approach, focusing on where axons begin and end to reconstruct connectivity across spatial resolutions. Finally, we consider the utility of a potential exemplar connectome for both clinical applications and research.

                Novelty is a double-edged sword for agents and animals alike: they might benefit from untapped resources or face unexpected costs or dangers such as predation. The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus colored by risk sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example, using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals’ differing prior expectations about reward and threat, and differing degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behavior of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena. We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (with distinguished, cautious, tail-behind approach) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. Some animals begin with cautious exploration and quickly transition to a confident approach to maximize exploration for reward; we classify them as potentially more risk neutral and enjoying a flexible hazard prior. By contrast, other animals only ever approach in a cautious manner and display a form of self-censoring; they are characterized by potential risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors. Explaining risk-sensitive exploration using factorized parameters of reinforcement learning models could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric abnormalities such as anxiety disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105875">Nanophysiology approach reveals diversity in calcium microdomains across</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and high local calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals are essential for triggering neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. In specialized bipolar ribbon synapses of the retina, these local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals control multiple processes, including the priming, docking, and translocation of vesicles on the ribbon before exocytosis, endocytosis, and the replenishment of release-ready vesicles to the fusion sites for sustained neurotransmission. However, our knowledge about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the axis of the ribbon active zone is limited. Here, we used fast confocal quantitative dual-color ratiometric line-scan imaging of a fluorescently labeled ribbon binding peptide and Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of individual ribbon active zones in zebrafish retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). We observed that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient elicited a much greater fluorescence amplitude when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator was conjugated to a ribeye-binding peptide than when using a soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, and the estimated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at the ribbon active zone exceeded 26 μM in response to a 10 millisecond stimulus, as measured by a ribbon-bound low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator. Our quantitative modeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering is consistent with this estimate and provides a detailed view of the spatiotemporal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics near the ribbon. Importantly, our data demonstrates that the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may vary between ribbons of different RBCs and within the same cells. The variation in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is found to correlate with ribbon size and active zone extent. Our serial electron microscopy results provide new information about the heterogeneity in ribbon size, shape, and area of the ribbon in contact with the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108181">Acidocalcisome-like vacuoles constitute a feedback-controlled phosphate buffering system for the cytosol</a></h4>

              
                Cells experience strong variations in the consumption and availability of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). Since P<sub>i</sub> is an essential macronutrient but excess P<sub>i</sub> has negative impacts on nucleotide hydrolysis and metabolism, its concentration must be maintained in a suitable range. Conserved storage organelles, acidocalcisomes, provide this buffering function. We used acidocalcisome-like yeast vacuoles to study how such organelles are set up to perform this task. Our combined in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that their ATP-driven polyphosphate polymerase VTC converts cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> into inorganic polyphosphates (polyP), which it transfers into the vacuole lumen. Luminal polyphosphatases immediately hydrolyse this polyP to establish a growing reservoir of vacuolar P<sub>i</sub>. Product inhibition by this P<sub>i</sub> pool silences the polyphosphatases, caps P<sub>i</sub> accumulation, and favours vacuolar polyP storage. Upon cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> scarcity, the declining inositol pyrophosphate levels activate the vacuolar P<sub>i</sub> exporter Pho91 to replenish cytosolic P<sub>i</sub>. In this way, acidocalcisome-like vacuoles constitute a feedback-regulated buffering system for cytosolic P<sub>i</sub>, which the cells can switch between P<sub>i</sub> accumulation, P<sub>i</sub> release, and high-capacity phosphate storage through polyP.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106273">Cerebellar Purkinje cell stripe patterns reveal a differential vulnerability and resistance to cell loss during normal aging in mice</a></h4>

              
                Age-related neurodegenerative diseases involve reduced cell numbers and impaired behavioral capacity. Neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits also occur during aging, and notably in the absence of disease. The cerebellum, which modulates movement and cognition, is susceptible to cell loss in both aging and disease. Here, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in aged mice is not spatially random but rather occurs in a pattern of parasagittal stripes. We also find that aged mice exhibit impaired motor coordination and more severe tremor compared to younger mice. However, the relationship between patterned Purkinje cell loss and motor dysfunction is not straightforward. Examination of postmortem samples of human cerebella from neurologically typical individuals supports the presence of selective loss of Purkinje cells during aging. These data reveal a spatiotemporal cellular substrate for aging in the cerebellum that may inform how neuronal vulnerability leads to neurodegeneration and the ensuing deterioration of behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106062">Complex opioid-driven modulation of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in a GABAergic brain nucleus associated with emotion, reward, and addiction</a></h4>

              
                The medial habenula (mHb)/interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) circuitry is resident to divergent molecular, neurochemical, and cellular components which, in concert, perform computations to drive emotion, reward, and addiction behaviors. Although housing one of the most prominent mu-opioid receptor (mOR) expression levels in the brain, remarkably little is known as to how they impact mHb/IPN circuit function at the granular level. In this study, our systematic functional and pharmacogenetic analyses in mice demonstrate that mOR activation attenuates glutamatergic signaling while producing an opposing potentiation of glutamatergic/cholinergic co-transmission mediated by mHb substance P and cholinergic neurons, respectively. Intriguingly, this latter non-canonical augmentation is developmentally regulated only emerging during later postnatal stages. In addition, we reveal that specific potassium channels act as a molecular brake on nicotinic receptor signaling in the IPN with the opioid-mediated potentiation of this arm of neurotransmission being operational only following attenuation of Kv1 function. Thus, mORs play a complex role in shaping the salience of distinct afferent inputs and transmitter modalities that ultimately influence synaptic recruitment of downstream GABAergic IPN neurons. Together, these observations provide a framework for future investigations aimed at identifying the neural underpinnings of maladaptive behaviors that can emerge when opioids, including potent synthetic analogs such as fentanyl, modulate or hijack this circuitry during the vulnerable stages of adolescence and in adulthood.

                Cost–benefit decisions are ubiquitous in both human and animal behavior. Economists have developed formal models of cost–benefit decision-making by focusing on discounting behavior, the devaluation of a reward based on the costs associated with it. The phylogenetic limits of discounting behavior remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> exhibits behavior closely resembling effort discounting. Given a choice between food options that are easy or difficult to consume, worms devalue the latter in a manner predicted by economic models. We identified a plausible mechanism for this behavior based on differential rates of leaving food patches and demonstrated that this mechanism is disrupted by deficits in dopamine signaling, as in rodents. Together, these results establish <i>C. elegans</i> as a potential invertebrate model for discounting behavior and set new phylogenetic bounds on this type of cost–benefit decision-making.

                Despite their importance for brain function, cortico-subcortical white matter tracts are under-represented in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography studies. Their non-invasive mapping is more challenging and less explored compared to other major cortico-cortical bundles. We introduce a set of standardised tractography protocols for delineating tracts between the cortex and various deep subcortical structures, including the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus. To enable comparative studies, our protocols are designed for both human and macaque brains. We demonstrate how tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers in the macaque and how these translate to humans. We show that the proposed protocols are robust against data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of these species-matched protocols in mapping homologous grey matter regions in humans and macaques, both in cortex and subcortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102578">Joint profiling of cell morphology and gene expression during in vitro neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) toward neuronal lineages has enabled diverse cellular models of human neurodevelopment and related disorders. Here, we jointly profiled neuronal morphology and gene expression at single-cell resolution across 60,000 iPSC-derived cortical neurons at three developmental time points with Cell Painting (CP) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). By modeling the relationship between morphological features and gene expression within our differentiation system, we annotated image-based features with biological functions and showed that while CP resolves broader neuronal classes than scRNA-seq, it complements transcriptomic data by quantifying the biological processes that drive neuronal differentiation over time, such as mitochondrial function and cell cycle. Further, we found that while over 60% of the cells resembled those seen in the fetal brain, 28% represented metabolically abnormal cell states and broader neuronal classes specific to <i>in vitro</i> cells. We show that iPSC-derived cortical neurons are nonetheless a relevant model for a range of brain-related complex traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that disease heritability can also be captured in the morphological feature space. Finally, we applied CP to iPSC-derived neural progenitors from patients with Kabuki syndrome, revealing morphological signatures of precocious differentiation and altered cell cycling. These results highlight the potential of multi-modal single-cell characterization to reveal complementary and disease-relevant cellular and molecular phenotypes.

">Early life stress induces social behavioral deficits and peripheral biomarker alterations in adolescence that perpetuate intergenerationally</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress (ELS) increases the likelihood of developing chronic health problems including mental illness. In humans, deficits in social behavior often emerge during adolescence and correlate with later-life psychiatric diagnoses. We examined in mice the effects of a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model of ELS on pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during postnatal days 3-9 (P3-P9). Then on P30, an adolescent timepoint, we assessed social behavior as well as thymus involution and adrenal hypertrophy, both biomarkers of stress. We found reductions in USVs as early as P3, resembling low levels normally seen later in development. There were few changes in SI, with deficits observed only after restraint stress in female LBN mice. Surprisingly, thymus weights were augmented and adrenal glands were smaller in LBN adolescent mice, opposite to alterations typically observed after chronic adult stress. LBN also produced signs of precocious puberty in both sexes, especially in cohorts of LBN-exposed offspring bred to create second-generation LBN offspring that subsequently underwent LBN, indicating perpetuation across generations. Together, these data suggest that stress in early life has distinct and diverse effects, including accelerating several processes, and that some of these effects persist intergenerationally.

">Multimodal MRI Insights into Glymphatic Clearance and Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in Healthy Aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with impaired CSF clearance in preclinical models, but its impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) health and glymphatic function in humans remains unclear. We aimed to compare healthy younger and older adults using multimodal MRI to assess age-related changes in BBB permeability and glymphatic clearance, and to examine the relationships between these measures. Thirty participants were recruited (12 younger, 26 {+/-} 3 years; 18 older, 75 {+/-} 7 years). Diffusion-prepared arterial spin labeling measured the water exchange rate (Kw) across the BBB; free water (FW) imaging quantified extracellular free water in white matter; and diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces (DTI-ALPS) assessed glymphatic function. Older individuals showed reduced whole-brain Kw (p=0.021), increased white matter FW (p=0.002), and reduced DTI-ALPS (p<0.001) compared to younger adults. Kw associated with both DTI-ALPS ({beta}=0.402x10-2, p=0.022) and FW ({beta}=-0.676x10-3, p=0.008). Reduced Kw may reflect impaired BBB function, while reduced DTI-ALPS and increased FW indicate impaired glymphatic clearance. FW partially mediated the relationship between Kw and DTI-ALPS, suggesting a potential mechanistic link. Overall, this study provides novel multimodal MRI insights into BBB and glymphatic alterations in healthy aging and may inform the development of MRI biomarkers to preserve cognitive health.

">Tracking instances of task evoked oxygen influxes using a novel sensitive BLE enabled wearable fNIRS device identifies mPFC role in spatial memory.</a></h4>

              
                Real-world neuroimaging requires true portability and sensitivity to detect signals from neuronal activity. Conventional methods such as MRI, EEG, or PET are constrained by their size and instrumentation complexity. Near Infra-Red (NIR) based optical methods have the potential for sensitive detection with a smaller footprint. Despite rapid advances in NIR detection there is no known device that is implementable using off-the-shelf integrated microprocessors and possesses the above desired characteristics along with proven sensitivity to detect task evoked responses. Here, we present a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled, high-sensitivity wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device designed for untethered cortical hemodynamic monitoring during naturalistic cognitive tasks. Our fully integrated optical sensing device merges optical data acquisition and wireless transmission into a compact, cable-free platform with a very small footprint. This enables continuous multi-channel recording without placing any constraint on the movement of the subject. We validate our device for reliable detection of task-evoked oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin dynamics in the forearm, primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Subsequently, we capture real-time forebrain activity during a screen-based learning and memory task, revealing robust goal-specific hemodynamic responses. We formulate a method to identify the instances of peak neuronal activity and follow the task Evoked Instances of Differential Oxygen influx(tEIDO) as the subject is engaged in a task. These results highlight the potential of our proposed fNIRS device as a mobile neuroimaging solution for next-generation brain-computer interfaces and real-world cognitive monitoring.

">A non-canonical top-down pathway regulating relapse to opioid</a></h4>

              
                The high relapse rates are major challenges in treating opioid addiction. However, it remains poorly understood the mechanisms underlying long-lasting vulnerability to relapse. Here, we identify the cortico-subthalamic projection from the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) to the zona incerta (ZI) as a key circuit for controlling relapse to opioid. We uncover that an ensemble of RSG glutamatergic neurons that locate in layer 5 and express B subtype cholecystokinin receptor (RSGGlu-Cckbr ensemble) are critically implicated in the encoding and retrieval of opioid-associated memories, leading to relapse to opioid via innervating ZI GABAergic (ZIGABA) rather than dopaminergic neurons. We further identify that the Cckergic neurons from anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (AD thalamus) orchestrates RSGGlu-Cckbr-ZIGABA circuit function via release of cholecystokinin (Cck) in RSG. These results elucidate a previously unknown non-canonical top-down pathway regulating relapse to opioid and shed new light on the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat relapse to opioids.

">Preserved Neural Dynamics across Arm- and Brain-controlled Movements</a></h4>

              
                The neural response for motor control is complex and dynamic; it has been found to dramatically transit from planning to executing movements. As brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can directly connect the brain and the external world by yielding comparable motor outcomes with artificial apparatus, a central question remains whether the neural dynamics underlying brain-control movement share characteristics or mechanism in natural neural motor control. To enable a systematic comparison, we developed a feedforward BMI framework that enables rapid cursor control to intercept moving targets. This BMI allowed monkeys to voluntarily initiate neural states which controlled the direction and timing of a launched ballistic movement, like skeet shooting. Based on this, we found similar neural representation patterns and computational structure across brain- and arm-control conditions. Notably, in addition to resembling the rotational structure in natural reaching, the neural population dynamics during open loop control also shared preserved manifold with those during arm interception. These findings suggest a fundamental principle and reveal a set of basic computational motifs, for neural control of movement in an abstract hierarchy independent of constraints from actuators. This study thus has potential to reshape the consideration of how BMIs assist paralyzed patients in interacting with dynamic environments and promote next-generation BMI systems.

">Spontaneous perceptual reversals are accompanied by systematic changes in pupil size but not respiration phase</a></h4>

              
                Humans tend to align their respiration with important events, in line with the notion that respiration serves as a tool to allocate (neuro-)physiological resources. This respiration alignment is consistently reported in laboratory studies relying on sequences of stimulus-driven experimental trials. However, whether such respiration alignment also occurs in the absence of external cues - such as during spontaneous perceptual changes - remains unknown. However, pupil size is known to change around spontaneous changes in perception, and pupil size supposedly covaries with respiration phase, suggesting that indeed respiration may align to spontaneous changes in perception. We investigate the link between respiration, pupil size, and spontaneous perceptual changes while participants (n=21) reported spontaneous perceptual reversals while viewing an ambiguous Necker cube. We confirmed the biphasic modulation of pupil size around reversals (constriction followed by dilation) and the general variation of pupil size with respiration phase. However, this coupling of pupil size and respiration phase broke down around perceptual reversals. Crucially, our data reveal no clear alignment of respiration phase to perceptual reversals although respiration frequency was predictive of the perceptual stability duration. These findings suggest that the temporal predictability of external events is critical for the robust respiration alignment to cognitive events.

">Nuclear RNA Clusters Are Dynamic Structural Entities in Huntington's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease research has focused on a toxic protein gain-of-function as the main driver of pathology. The role of mutant HTT mRNA in vivo has been only partially studied and remains largely unexplored. Recently, we discovered that fully processed human HTT mRNA is retained, together with the alternatively processed HTT1a transcript, in RNA nuclear clusters in YAC128 mouse brains. Here, we demonstrate that these clusters were already present in the prenatal stage at day 14.5, indicating early developmental effects. Moreover, these clusters were confined to neurons, implying a neuron-specific mechanism of accumulation, and were colocalised with Prpf8, a core spliceosomal protein, suggesting potential impact on nuclear homeostasis. HTT nuclear RNA clusters showed remarkable dynamics, rapidly dissolving when ionic interactions were disrupted or transcription and splicing were inhibited. This malleability underscores the accessibility of HTT mRNA to therapeutic interventions and may guide the future design of HTT-targeting therapies.

">An integrated biobehavioral study of empathy</a></h4>

              
                Empathy, a crucial prosocial human trait, is mainly measured through questionnaires, but performance in tasks involving emotional stimuli, brain activity during these tasks, and genetic information also provide relevant clues. These approaches are developed separately or by combining only some of these factors. Integrating them into a single study and analysis may help to better characterize their relative load and to understand the complexity of empathy. The IRI empathy scale was administered to 65 participants, who later performed a lexical decision task on emotional words while their performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Three genetic polymorphisms, one in the OXTR gene (SNP rs2254298) and two in the AVPR1a gene (RS1 and RS3 regions), were also analyzed. Generalized linear models revealed that these biobehavioral factors jointly predicted emotional but not cognitive empathy. Reaction times and the amplitude of the LPP component of ERPs in response to emotional words, along with rs2254298 AA/AG genotype, were significantly associated with scores on the IRI personal distress subscale. Meanwhile, LPP amplitudes and AVPR1a-RS1 LL genotype significantly predicted scores on the empathy concern subscale. The balanced loading of all these factors in the models reinforces the desirability of a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to characterizing empathy.

">Graded Hair Cell Ablation Reveals Functional Redundancy in the Mature Mouse Vestibular System</a></h4>

              
                Inner ear hair cells are mechanoreceptors critical for hearing and balance. Damage to vestibular hair cells causes balance impairment, yet it is unclear whether hair cell loss correlates with vestibular dysfunction. In this study, we ablated hair cells in Pou4f3DTR/+ mice with diphtheria toxin (DT), and found a dose-dependent decrease in hair cell survival in both the macula and crista ampullaris, including loss of type I and II hair cells in the striolar/central and extrastriolar/peripheral regions. Responses to linear acceleration, measured by the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex (tVOR) and vestibular sensory evoked potential (VsEP), were intact with 25% or more hair cell survival in the macula, and diminished only when hair cell survival decreased further. By contrast, rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (rVOR) responses were significantly reduced with ~31% hair cell survival in the cristae. Further, single-unit recordings of vestibular afferents from cristae and maculae showed more irregular and reduced firing rates, but only those corresponding to cristae displayed reduced sensitivity to head rotation. Limited hair cell regeneration was observed in the extrastriolar/peripheral regions of both maculae and cristae 6 months post ablation, although no significant recovery of the VORs was observed. Thus, the adult mouse vestibular end organs display different degrees of redundancy, demonstrating robust responses to head rotation and linear acceleration despite loss of most hair cells.

">Dorsomedial hypothalamus cold-sensitive neurons drive shivering thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Shivering thermogenesis is the body 's response to cold, where the hypothalamus signals muscle contractions to generate heat. While cold-responsive neurons in the preoptic area and ventromedial hypothalamus are known to regulate thermogenesis, the specific neurons driving shivering thermogenesis remain unclear. Here, we identify a subset of VGLUT2-positive excitatory neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMHVglut2), enriched with Calbindin D28k (CALB1) expression (DMHCalb1/Vglut2), that selectively initiate cold-evoked shivering thermogenesis. When core body temperature (Tcore) dropped to 33{degrees}C, c-Fos expression peaked in the DMH. RNA sequencing of retrogradely labelled DMH neurons, traced through cervical muscles, revealed CALB1 and VGLUT2 expression in these neurons. Activation or inhibition of DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons specifically affected shivering thermogenesis, while modulation of DMHVglut2 neurons influenced Tcore through both shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis. Activation of CALB1-negative, VGLUT2-positive DMH neurons impacted non-shivering thermogenesis, confirming that DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons drive shivering. DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons exhibited cold temperature-dependent firing, with 23% peaking at 35{degrees}C, 27% at 34{degrees}C, and 50% at 33{degrees}C, explaining the hierarchical increase in shivering intensity during cold exposure. Their activation relies on the cold receptor TRPM8. Knockdown of TRPM8 expression in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons in vivo reduced cold-evoked shivering. Pharmacological activation or inhibition of TRPM8 in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons in vitro, respectively, reduced or enhanced cold temperature-dependent firing. These effects were eliminated when TRPM8 was knocked down in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons. Inhibition of DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons prevented counteractive shivering, enabled rapid hypothermia, and protected the ischemic brain. This work revealed the central control mechanism of shivering and provided a potential strategy for controlled therapeutic hypothermia.

">Reevaluating the Role of Beta2-Microglobulin: New Insights on Selective Vulnerability in ALS Pathology</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons (MNs). Why these neurons show particular vulnerability in ALS is still debated, and also why certain MNs remain resilient. We investigated the importance of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and particularly beta2-microglobulin (b2m) in MN susceptibility to ALS as these molecules have been implicated both in prolonging and shortening disease. RNA-sequencing demonstrated that disease-resistant oculomotor neurons (OMNs) and Onuf nucleus MNs had similar b2m and HLA mRNA levels to vulnerable spinal MNs in control tissues. Thus, baseline differences in these transcripts do not explain the differential vulnerabilities of these neurons to disease. Nonetheless, the HLA protein level showed an inverse correlation with spinal MN size, where large MNs, which are lost early in ALS, had low HLA levels. HLA protein levels were also reduced in end-stage ALS patient spinal MNs, while remaining unchanged in OMNs with disease. Spinal MNs uniquely exhibited a significant upregulation of b2m and HLA-C transcripts with disease, likely as a protective compensatory response. Thus, b2m and HLA may relate to vulnerability to ALS. Cross-breeding of b2m knockout mice with SOD1G93A ALS mice resulted in modest transient worsening of functional motor performance, but did not affect life span. There was partial preservation of innervation of particular muscles in SOD1G93A mice lacking b2m, which was insufficient to improve motor behavior. These findings indicate that b2m and HLAs are dynamically regulated in ALS, and may influence MN vulnerability, but they are not major disease modifiers in ALS.

">Spatiotemporal multi-omics atlas of the aging neuromuscular junction</a></h4>

              
                The demographic shift toward a global aging population, coupled with rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, poses major public health challenges. Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative conditions, making the elucidation of its molecular mechanisms critical for developing effective interventions. Dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the specialized synapse essential for motor function, is an early hallmark of aging and several neurodegenerative disorders, yet its molecular determinants remain incompletely understood. To shed light on potential common underlying mechanisms, we performed a spatiotemporal multiomics analysis of the murine NMJ during aging, uncovering several genes showing decoupling between transcript and protein trajectories that may drive the related progressive motor decline. NMJs of soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, differing in fiber composition and vulnerability to aging and disease, displayed distinct spatiotemporal dynamics: fast-twitch EDL, more susceptible to degeneration, exhibited stronger mRNA-protein decoupling than aged slowtwitch SOL or younger SOL and EDL muscles. Elevated expression of miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins in aged EDL highlights the key role of post-transcriptional regulation in NMJ aging. This study provides new insights into the physiopathology of neuromuscular aging and offers a resource for investigating mechanisms shared between aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, it opens avenues for AI-driven discovery of drug targets and early biomarkers, potentially accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies.

">Memory network activity flow failures in temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Declarative memory deficits represent considerable challenges to adequate functioning and wellbeing in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), two of the most common pharmaco-resistant epilepsies. TLE and FLE are impacted differently however, with TLE affecting primarily episodic, and mildly semantic memory, while FLE presenting with overall lesser declarative impairments and a greater involvement of language processes. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are overall compatible with differential disruptions of medial temporal and fronto-limbic networks in both syndromes, direct comparisons of brain activity and connectivity remain scarce. The current study investigated how alterations in intrinsic functional brain organization, as mapped with resting-state connectivity (rsFC), shapes altered brain network activations in both episodic and semantic memory states. To this end, we acquired task- and rs-fMRI data in 28 TLE patients and 17 FLE patients and 87 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We used activity flow mapping (AFM), a generative machine learning technique that derives plausible task activation patterns via individualized rsFC as well as normative task activation data. Previous studies in HC as well as patient populations have shown that this technique has been effective in identifying mechanisms contributing to atypical functional organization across different context. Overall, AFM reliably predicted task activations across HC, TLE, and FLE, but prediction accuracy was consistently reduced in both patient groups, indicating impaired propagation of task-relevant signals. These reductions co-occurred with abnormal episodic and semantic task activation patterns, atypical rsFC, and behavioral profiles marked by preserved semantic but impaired episodic memory performance in both patient groups. Importantly, although neither task-evoked abnormalities nor rsFC disruptions alone were associated with clinical variables, lower AFM accuracy in patients robustly tracked poorer episodic and semantic memory performance and longer disease duration. Prediction accuracy was driven more by intrinsic functional than structural network features, suggesting that altered network communication, rather than gross anatomy, constrains AFM in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Our work revealed syndrome-specific yet convergent disruptions in paralimbic and heteromodal association systems, linking intrinsic dysconnectivity to a shared episodic vulnerability and semantic resilience across TLE and FLE. By modelling how intrinsic connectivity shapes task-evoked responses, AFM provides a mechanistic account of imbalanced memory-state activations and isolates network-flow pathways as targets for intervention and rehabilitation.

">Concurrent saliency and intentional maps in posterior parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The goal for the motor action represents the desired state of the individual to interact with world. Investigating how the goal is generated requires clarifying spatial extrapolation that involves perceptual and action processes. Here, we recorded neural activity from monkeys manually intercepting a circularly moving target being occluded. The saliency and intentional maps, which developed to locate the target of interest and the intended action goal, were thus distinguished in neural activity recorded from the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) and parietal reach region (PRR). Dynamic internal representations spanning from visual registration to state estimation were unveiled in both areas, with the goal for the interception being inferred as the visual consequence of the movement. The motion extrapolation was found to be an intrinsic part of movement planning so that the continuous and stable spatial extrapolation from motion to action was prevalent in both areas. The goal estimation based on the sensory extrapolation rationalized the concurrency and correlation of saliency and intentional maps, which were found to switch their dominance by reorganizing the read-out dimensions of the spatial manifold. The extrapolation achieved at both the perceptual and motor stages not only bridged the saliency and intentional maps, but also revealed the form of the state estimation in guiding predictive sensorimotor control.

">Longitudinal Proteomic Profiling Defines Robust Molecular Subtypes Underlying the Heterogeneity of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology is a barrier to developing therapeutics and understanding progression and prognosis. High throughput proteomic measures can be used to better interpret PD pathophysiology and generate clusters to define disease subtypes. Identification of subtypes related to clinical phenotypes will help researchers understand PD progression. We analyzed longitudinal proteomic data from the Tracking Parkinson's Cohort, consisting of recent-onset PD patients across 72 UK sites. 794 patients were measured on the Somalogic platform (7596 proteins) for three time points. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) at each time point revealed consistent protein co-expression modules. Two modules were strongly preserved across all three time points and in validation in the Global Neurodegenerative Proteomics Consortia (GNPC) datasets. The brown module was enriched for metabolite pathways and the blue module with cellular signaling pathways and associated with quality of life scores. Conversely, the smaller red module had distinct cognitive function phenotypes and changed protein expression between visit time points. Using detailed characterization of proteomic clusters we have provided a comprehensive view of PD progression offering deeper insights into the conservation of proteomic expression, suggesting new module subsets and providing candidate target proteins for further study.

">Amyloid-β 42-carrying extracellular vesicles are associated with neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation and neurodegeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been implicated in AD pathology, but their relationship to disease progression and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome remains poorly understood. In this study, we analysed plasma-derived A{beta}42-containing EVs from participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and calculated the ratio between the percentage of A{beta}42-positive peripheral EVs and CSF A{beta}42 (rA{beta}42). This ratio was elevated in AD and positively correlated with amyloid pathology as measured by PET. Longitudinal analyses revealed that higher rA{beta}42 values predicted accelerated hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline, independent of CSF A{beta}42 concentrations. Proteomic profiling of CSF using the SomaScan platform showed that rA{beta}42 was associated with an inflammatory signature characterized by myeloid activation and type II interferon-related signalling pathways. Together, these findings indicate that A{beta}42-carrying EVs reflect an active and inflammatory component of AD pathology and may represent a novel class of biomarkers for disease progression. Understanding the mechanisms that link A{beta}42-positive EVs to neuroinflammatory signalling could open new avenues for pathway-specific diagnostics and therapeutic strategies in AD.

">Testing for Interactions in Multivariate Data</a></h4>

              
                Factorial designs are a mainstay of the scientific paradigm, allowing the effects of multiple experimental factors and their interactions to be efficiently studied within a single experiment. In brain imaging, however, multivariate data analyses commonly proceed using multivariate decoding and we argue that the standard "difference of accuracies" test is not a true test of interactions. To remedy this situation we propose an encoding method based on a Bayesian Multivariate Linear model which is ideally suited to the factorial analysis of such data. We show how it can be used to test for multivariate main effects and interactions using data from EEG studies of Reward Learning and Declarative Memory. This approach additionally allows for null hypotheses to be accepted and allows one to infer whether multivariate effects are driven by collections of univariate effects or voxel dependencies. We also propose that those wishing to pursue tests for interactions using decoding methods use an "accuracy of differences" test.

">Modeling Temporal Dependencies and Feature Interactions Reveal Novel Clinical and Molecular Insights into Alzheimer's Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease remains a major public health challenge, requiring insights into feature interactions and temporal trends of feature importance. Community-wide data science competitions such as TADPOLE Challenge provide platforms to benchmark predictive models using ADNI datasets. While top performing models achieve accurate predictions, they leave mechanistic questions unresolved. METHODS: We analyzed XGBoost with TreeSHAP for feature interactions and RNN with Integrated Gradients for temporal trends. This two-branch design allows XGBoost to capture nonlinear cross sectional interactions, while RNN captures evolving, time dependent influences. We conducted parallel attribution analyses across full and reduced feature sets, and then fused the outputs from both branches into a unified importance map. This fusion step prioritizes features consistently supported by both static and temporal models. RESULTS: Our framework showed agreement between TreeSHAP and IG, highlighting FAQ, CDRSB, ADAS13, MMSE, and RAVLT variants as the most consistently important features across both branches. Temporal attribution analysis revealed stage dependent trends: in CN, DX:CN, FAQ, and RAVLT_immediate increased in importance; in MCI, MidTemp and WholeBrain gained importance; and in AD, FAQ remained dominant. Feature interaction analysis identified strong clinical-clinical interactions and secondary clinical-molecular interactions. Notably, FAQ and CDRSB repeatedly formed high-strength interaction pairs, while hippocampal and entorhinal volumes contributed secondary molecular modulation, revealing distinct clusters of jointly influential biomarkers. DISCUSSION: This work highlights feature interactions and temporal trends in AD prediction models, offering insights for personalized treatments and patient specific trial designs. Our framework provides stable, cross validated explanations that unify structural and temporal importance, enhancing trustworthiness and mechanistic interpretability in AD modeling.

">The developmental emergence of tonic and phasic REM sleep in rats</a></h4>

              
                REM sleep is composed of two substates - phasic and tonic - that differ in their behavioral, sensory, and electrophysiological features. Although these substates are well characterized in adults, their developmental trajectory remains unclear. Here, we examined the development of tonic and phasic REM in rats from postnatal day (P) 12-24, spanning a period of rapid corticothalamic development. We recorded local field potentials and single units from primary motor cortex (M1), together with high-speed video and electromyographic recordings of the nuchal muscle. Periods of behavioral quiescence along with high delta power indicated NREM sleep, whereas periods of sustained muscle atonia and low delta power indicated REM sleep. At P16, M1 theta oscillations first appeared, and the delay to the first twitch increased, revealing the start of a distinct twitch-free portion of REM sleep. Motivated by this, we divided REM sleep into phasic and tonic periods, with and without twitching, respectively. Spiking activity and gamma power were consistently higher during phasic REM. At P20, phasic REM also showed faster theta oscillations than tonic REM. At P24, tonic REM was accompanied by a distinct alpha oscillation. These results show that the features distinguishing the two REM substates appear sequentially across development, revealing a progressive differentiation of REM sleep into tonic and phasic periods, a developmental refinement that may support increasingly complex forms of sleep-dependent plasticity.

">Proteomic Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease with Psychosis Reveals Separate Molecular Signatures for Core AD Proteinopathy and Postsynaptic Density Disruption</a></h4>

              
                Background and Hypothesis: Alzheimer's disease with psychosis (AD+P) is a subgroup of AD patients with more rapid cognitive deterioration. While our previous study showed that AD+P is associated with loss of prefrontal cortex postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, identifying proteins in the broader cellular environment that influence PSD loss addresses a critical knowledge gap about synaptic dysfunction mechanisms in early disease stages. Study Design: We conducted a proteomic analysis comparing prefrontal grey matter cortex tissue homogenates from elderly normal controls (n=18), individuals with AD+P (n=61), and individuals with AD-P (n=48), all with Braak stages 3-5. Study Results: AD+P showed the most pronounced alterations relative to controls (178 proteins with q<0.05), although alterations in AD-P and AD+P relative to controls were highly similar (R2=0.965, p<0.001). Weighted-gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified four modules significantly associated with disease status, comparing AD subjects to controls, but none differed significantly between AD+P and AD-P. We identified 15 proteins significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, including ENPP6, linked to AD+P by GWAS. Additionally, PSD yield-associated proteins showed minimal overlap with altered AD proteins (1 of 137). WGCNA revealed one module significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, enriched for inflammatory terms. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a model in which AD+P arises from the combination of quantitative alterations within a shared AD proteome profile and a superimposed set of protein alterations correlated with PSD yield that are largely independent of the shared AD proteome, conferring distinct mechanisms of synaptic vulnerability and psychosis risk.

">Split trial analysis reveals the information capacity of neural population codes</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how correlated neural noise affects neural population coding represents one basic question in computational and systems neuroscience. Recent theoretical work suggest that shared noise along the stimulus encoding direction is the primary factor that limits information encoding (i.e., information-limiting noise). Despite this theoretical insight, it has been difficult to test experimentally due to the challenges in inferring information-limiting noise from neural data. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a method (i.e., split-trial analysis) based on partitioning the neural population response of an individual trial. Results from extensive numerical simulations suggest that split-trial analysis substantially outperforms existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Notably, it does so without estimating the noise covariance matrix, which represents a major barrier for prior studies. Applications of split-trial analysis to a number of neurophysiological datasets reveals insights into the precision of the neural codes for several systems. First, it reveals a substantial amount of information-limiting noise in the head direction system in mice. Second, it suggests a small yet positive information-limiting noise in the orientation code in mouse V1. Third, it reveals that the information-limiting noise in the macaque prefrontal cortex is highly consistent over time during a simple saccade task. Split-trial analysis is a general technique that should be widely applicable in analyzing the properties of population codes in the brain.

">Longitudinal Changes in Cortical Response Dynamics with Deep Brain Stimulation to the Subcallosal Cingulate for Treatment-Resistant Depression</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) is a promising intervention for treatment-resistant depression, yet objective biomarkers that track recovery remain limited. This study examined longitudinal changes in stimulation-evoked potentials (SEPs) to characterize how SCC-driven cortical communication evolves during treatment. Ten patients across three SCC-DBS trials underwent high-density EEG recordings at 4 and 24 weeks. SEP features were extracted from source-localized SCC signals and related to clinical outcomes and fractional anisotropy (FA) of midcingulate cingulum fibers. Cortical responses showed a consistent reduction in latency and an increase in magnitude over time, indicating faster and stronger electrocortical signaling with chronic stimulation. Higher baseline midcingulate FA predicted greater latency acceleration, linking SEP timing to white-matter integrity. These findings identify temporal SEP dynamics as candidate mechanistic biomarkers that reflect circuit engagement during SCC-DBS and offer a pathway toward physiology-guided optimization of neuromodulation for depression.

">Early, sex-dependent and progressive proteomic imbalance in the amygdala during Alzheimers disease progression</a></h4>

              
                Background: The amygdala is involved in the emotional expression, memory processing and managing stimulatory input. Although amygdala atrophy is early evidenced in Alzheimers Disease (AD), the molecular mechanisms disrupted in initial neuropathological stages are still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the proteomic impairment of the amygdaloid region from AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects to better understand the neuropathological processes occurred early in this area and to identify potential targets that may face AD from the beginning of the disease. Methods: Label-free quantitative proteomics was applied using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass-spectrometer in 24 postmortem amygdala specimens derived from non-demented (n=3F/5M), AD-Braak stage I-II (n=4F/4M) and AD-Braak stage III-IV (n=4F/4M). Data analysis was performed using MaxQuant and Perseus software (two-way Student T-test; p<0.05). Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis softwares were considered for biological interpretation. Connectivity map platform was used for drug repurposing analyses. Transcriptomic/proteomic data of other brain regions were obtained from AlzData, Neuropro, and Agora repositories. Results: Amygdaloid proteome of AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects compared to controls revealed a progressive proteomic impairment with a minimal overlap across Braak stages. Some of the amygdaloid DEPs were known interactors of human A{beta} plaques, APP, or Tau proteins or were previously identified at transcriptional or translational level in other brain regions affected by AD. Interestingly, amygdaloid proteome was more severely affected in women than in men with a particular protein expression profile associated to each AD stage. Comparing our sex-dependent differential proteome datasets with transcriptomic data of different brain regions, we identified potential sex-specific proteins related to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Finally, data-driven drug repositioning using amygdaloid omics profiles unveiled that most of the small molecule candidates were neuropathological stage and/or sex-specific. Conclusions: Early and sex-specific amygdaloid proteome dysregulation in AD highlights the consideration of a deliberate stratification by sex in future research and clinical trials to develop effective therapeutic strategies in AD for both sexes.

">Intranigral injection of Alpha-Synuclein pre-formed fibrils leads to BBB compromise and Bilateral Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in A53T Alpha-Synuclein transgenic mice.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-Synuclein neuronal aggregation and loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Developing animal models that replicate PD neuropathological phenotypes is critical for understanding its pathophysiology and evaluating potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we show that direct unilateral injection of human Synuclein PFFs into the Substantia Nigra (SN) of mutant A53T alpha-synuclein overexpressing mice induce bilateral phosphorylated alpha-Synuclein (pS129) pathology in the SN. This pathology spreads to the striatum, cerebral cortex, and midbrain within 60 days and is accompanied by neuroinflammation in the midbrain and cerebral cortex. Additionally, we observed synuclein-dependent neurodegeneration, with a 50% reduction in Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) intensity in the SN and a 40% reduction in Striatum, both bilaterally. The model also revealed a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and T-cell infiltration in the PFF injected animals, correlating with pS129 pathology and neuroinflammation. Taken together, we developed a mouse model that recapitulates multiple PD phenotypes, providing a valuable platform for testing therapeutic strategies targeting human alpha-Synuclein pathology and for exploring CNS-peripheral immune interactions in PD.

">Projection-defined ventral tegmental area neurons exhibit distinct fentanyl-induced molecular and functional adaptations that differentially support drug-context associations</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are contributing to unprecedented overdose rates. Despite the abundance of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, an understanding of fentanyl s effects on the brain remains lacking. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an important site of fentanyl s rewarding actions in the brain and sends diverse projections to several regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previous work shows downstream projection target influences baseline properties and opioid-induced neuroadaptations in VTA, but most work has focused on single neurotransmitter-defined cell types. Here, we investigate how projection-defined VTA neurons exhibit different responses to fentanyl independent of cell type. We use RNA sequencing to show that fentanyl induces discordant transcriptional adaptations in VTA neurons that project to NAc vs PFC. We then used fiber photometry and chemogenetics to characterize functional differences in fentanyl-related behavior. We found different timescales of activation between VTA-NAc and VTA-PFC during conditioned place preference that support distinct aspects of fentanyl-context association. Together, our data demonstrate that based on projection target alone, VTA neurons can undergo vastly different adaptations in response to fentanyl, providing new insight into VTA encoding of opioid behaviors.

">GPR34 regulation of disease-associated microglial states and responses to physiological stimuli</a></h4>

              
                GPR34 is a microglia-enriched GPCR whose expression is downregulated under several disease conditions, including Alzheimers disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite this, its function is poorly understood in normal or disease conditions, as is its contribution to disease-related microglia states. Using RNA-sequencing, we find that microglia from global Gpr34 knockout (KO) mouse brains exhibited transcriptional shifts toward disease-associated microglia (DAM) and inflammatory profiles, partially mirroring the microglial phenotype seen in 5xFAD AD model mice. Notably, when Gpr34 KO mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice, DAM transcriptional profiles and glial pathology were further exacerbated despite the already robust DAM signature driven by amyloidosis. This occurred without affecting amyloid plaque burden. In human stem cell-derived microglia (iMGLs), GPR34 KO strongly reduced calcium and phosphorylated ERK signaling in response to known GPR34 agonists, including lyso-phosphatidylserine (lysoPS) and myelin, and caused transcriptional alterations linked to immune regulation and cell proliferation. Interestingly, GPR34 loss selectively impaired phagocytosis of myelin but not amyloid-beta; or E. coli. Furthermore, GRP34 KO diminished, but did not abolish, the transcriptional response elicited by myelin. Together, these findings suggest that GPR34 is important for maintaining microglia homeostasis, mediating phagocytosis of and transcriptional response to myelin, and restraining microglial response to neurodegenerative disease conditions.

">A Functional Resting-State Network Atlas Based on 420 Older Adults with Hypertension</a></h4>

              
                The Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease (rrAD) trial included 513 cognitively normal, sedentary, hypertensive older adults (aged 60 to 85 years) with dementia risk factors. We utilized 420 high-quality baseline resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans from this cohort to develop a functional atlas tailored for aging populations. Typical rs-fMRI atlases derived from healthy young adults do not account for age-related changes, such as cortical atrophy, enlarged ventricles, and altered connectivity. To address this gap, we created a cohort-specific MNI-adjacent anatomical template, rrAD420, using SPM12's DARTEL registration. In this space, we derived a comprehensive functional atlas using both group independent component analysis (GICA) and probabilistic functional mode decomposition (PROFUMO). The rrAD420 atlas offers detailed representations of Resting-State Network (RSN) connectivity, encompassing unique configurations and overlapping interactions. It features two Default-Mode Network (DMN)-specific seed-based maps (DMN24 with cerebellum, DMN18 without) and data-driven components resembling the major RSNs. Furthermore, PROFUMO allowed for the identification of multimodal and combinatory networks, capturing connections within and between RSNs. While optimized for hypertensive older adults, the rrAD420 atlas serves as a versatile tool for broader aging populations, aiding in the study of neurodegenerative processes and biomarker discovery.

">ACSS2 mediates prenatal alcohol exposure-related morphological and behavioral phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                The metabolic enzyme Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2 (ACSS2) recently emerged as an unexpected regulator of molecular and behavioral changes associated with alcohol use. Its role during prenatal exposure, however, remains unknown. Here, we use a combination of proteomic, genomic and behavioral approaches to establish ACSS2 as a key mediator of prenatal alcohol exposure-related phenotypes. We define the developmental window during which ACSS2 translocates to nuclei in the mouse brain, and show that alcohol-derived acetate is incorporated into fetal brain histone acetylation in utero. Using genetically engineered mice not expressing ACSS2, we demonstrate that loss of this enzyme attenuates chronic prenatal alcohol exposure-induced craniofacial abnormalities, motor function deficits, cognitive impairments as well as associated chromatin and gene expression changes in the dorsal hippocampus and the cerebellar vermis. Our results outline a previously unknown mechanism underlying prenatal alcohol exposure-related phenotypes regulated by ACSS2, which will inform the development of future therapeutic interventions.

">Improved Estimation of Correlation Accuracy for Machine Learning Brain-Phenotype Associations</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning is used in neuroscience to examine brain-phenotype associations and facilitate individual prediction from high-dimensional brain imaging. For continuous phenotypes, Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted phenotype is used to quantify model accuracy in testing data. However, recent research suggests millions of samples may be needed to reliably estimate the maximum achievable predictive accuracy (MAPA). We formally define the MAPA and show that the Pearson estimator is biased for this quantity and its confidence intervals fail to capture the target. We develop a semiparametric (double machine learning) one-step estimator that more accurately estimates the MAPA and yields valid confidence intervals across flexible machine learning settings. Analyzing data from the Reproducible Brain Charts dataset, we show that this estimator has smaller bias when estimating brain-phenotype associations of neuroimaging data with age and psychopathology phenotypes. We show that MAPA for psychopathology factor scores using machine learning models built on structural and functional imaging measures is not better than using demographic and nuisance covariates alone.

">Sleep controls peroxisomal abundance to reduce wake-induced brain oxidation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is increasingly linked to the regulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms underlying this interaction are underexplored. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to report a bidirectional relationship between sleep and peroxisomes, cellular organelles that process lipids and alleviate ROS. Of the genes that change expression after sleep deprivation in the dorsal fan-shaped body, knockdown of the peroxisomal biogenesis factor Pex16 results in decreased sleep. Pex16 acts in several brain regions to modulate sleep amount, with ellipsoid body neurons (EB) producing the highest sleep reduction of the sleep-promoting regions. Consistent with a general role for peroxisomes, knockdown of other peroxisomal enzymes relevant for lipid import and synthesis also decreases sleep. Whole-brain peroxisomal numbers increase with wake, which is supported by lipidomic analysis indicating that peroxisomal-derived phospholipids are the major contributors to phospholipid changes after wake or sleep deprivation. Peroxisomal proliferation in the EB is driven by neuronal activity and increased oxidation, suggesting that these mediate the effect of wake/sleep loss. In turn, peroxisomes alleviate the oxidation accumulated during wake, such that loss of Pex16 in the EB works non-cell autonomously to increase lipid peroxidation brain-wide. This likely contributes to sleep loss, as sleep is rescued with an antioxidant. Together, these results position peroxisomes as key players in sleep, regulating ROS and thereby maintaining normal cycles.

This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning with detailed behavioral and physiological measures in 27 unconstrained social learning interactions. Learning was supported by teacher–learner interbrain synchrony (interpersonal neural synchrony), over regions important for mutual understanding (temporoparietal junction) and communicative coordination (ventral premotor cortex). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the interpersonal neural synchrony–learning association in oppositive ways, motivating a dual-process model: during knowledge-building phases, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low interpersonal neural synchrony in regions for mutual understanding (temporoparietal junction) and coordination (right ventral premotor cortex), and high interpersonal neural synchrony in language-related areas (left ventral premotor cortex). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high interpersonal neural synchrony over temporoparietal junction. Cross-brain general linear modeling revealed asymmetric neural dependencies linked to speaking and teaching roles in the left-hemisphere language network. These effects remained after controlling for nodding, gaze, and breathing, indicating that interpersonal neural synchrony reflects true social-cognitive alignment beyond sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated and nonlinear brain–body dynamics and positions interpersonal neural synchrony as a marker of mutual prediction during communicative social interaction.</span>

Five hundred fifty participants were grouped based on their accuracy rates in the 2-back task.

We used their functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the emotion processing task to investigate the differences in emotional distraction between two groups and the specificity of functional connectivity. We found that the H_WM performed faster, meaning they processed the target stimuli more quickly and were better at inhibiting distractions. The results of the psychophysiological interaction analysis further revealed that H_WM have stronger task-specific functional connections between the right amygdala and the emotion regulation network (ERN). Moreover, the ERN-right Amygdala connection was positively correlated with the accuracy of the task. These results suggest that individuals with high working memory are able to inhibit emotional distractions quickly and focus on the current task. This helps to understand the influence of cognition on emotions and promotes the further development of emotional intervention.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Response speed is a fundamental cognitive function, yet the cortical mechanisms linking sensory processing to motor execution remain unclear. Using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during the Attention Network Test, we examined preresponse cortical activity in 47 adults to identify oscillatory markers of rapid responses. Faster responses were characterized by enhanced occipital theta power and reduced occipital alpha power, suggesting a functional interaction between cognitive control and sensory processing regions. A brief theta burst preceding fast responses, coinciding with an alpha plateau, indicates a cross-frequency interplay optimizing response execution. Increased theta/alpha ratio further supports a cortical state favoring efficient stimulus–response processing. These findings highlight cortical oscillatory mechanisms that govern response speed, supporting top–down attentional control models. By identifying EEG-based biomarkers of rapid decision-making, this study advances our understanding of cortical dynamics underlying sensorimotor integration. The results have implications for cognitive neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and neuroergonomics, providing insight into how large-scale cortical networks shape behavioral efficiency.</span>

No significant associations between inhibition-shifting and nodal centrality were observed in HCs. These results suggest recruitment of thalamo-cingulate regions in compensation for frontal-temporal organizations affecting inhibition-shifting in FEDN MDD.

<p>Serum miR-598-3p, a multifunctional biomarker in TBI, is elevated in patients, with potential for diagnosis, severity stratification, and prognostic prediction. In vitro, its inhibition reduces microglial inflammatory cytokine release, indicating a role in neuroinflammation modulation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from external mechanical forces causing brain dysfunction. Dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in TBI pathophysiology, but the role of miR-598-3p remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-598-3p in TBI and explore its regulatory effects on inflammation in an LPS-induced microglial injury model. Serum miR-598-3p levels were measured via RT-qPCR in 137 TBI patients and 120 controls. ROC curves assessed its diagnostic and prognostic utility. TBI severity was classified by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, and outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In vitro, LPS-treated BV2 microglia were transfected with a miR-598-3p inhibitor to analyze inflammatory cytokine levels. miR-598-3p expression was significantly elevated in TBI patients versus controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and increased progressively with injury severity. ROC analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing TBI severity (AUC = 0.892/0.905) and predicting poor prognosis (AUC = 0.891, sensitivity = 83.33%, specificity = 90.36%). High miR-598-3p expression correlated with elevated Marshall grades, neural injury markers (S100B, GFAP), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-<i>α</i>). Multivariate analysis identified miR-598-3p as an independent risk factor for poor outcomes (OR = 5.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). miR-598-3p inhibition attenuated LPS-induced IL-6/TNF-<i>α</i> secretion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Serum miR-598-3p demonstrates clinical utility as a biomarker for TBI diagnosis, severity grading, and prognostic evaluation. Its observed association with amplified microglial inflammatory responses suggests a potential mechanism involving regulation of neuroinflammation pathways.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is increasingly used for pediatric large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, however, its role in isolated M2 occlusions remains underexplored. This study compared clinical outcomes in children with isolated M2 occlusion treated with EVT versus best medical therapy (BMT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter cohort study pooled data from 4 pediatric stroke registries (Save ChildS, KidClot, Pediatric LVO Study, and Save ChildS Pro). Children ages 28 days–17 years with isolated M2 occlusion presenting within 24 hours of last seen well were included. Primary outcome was the pediatric modified Rankin scale (ped-mRS) at 3 to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS), Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM), and safety endpoints.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty patients were included, of whom 20 were treated with EVT (median age, 12 years; interquartile range [IQR], 6–15; 40% female) and 20 with BMT only (10 years; IQR, 5–14; 50% female). Baseline demographics were similar. EVT patients showed superior outcomes: median ped-mRS at 3 to 6 months was 1 versus 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.015). EVT resulted in greater PedNIHSS reduction from admission to day 7 (−9 vs −1, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and lower PSOM at 3 to 6 months (0.5 vs 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.009). This benefit persisted at 24 months with a median ped-mRS of 1 (IQR, 0–2) in the EVT group and 2 (IQR, 1–3) in the BMT group (<i>p</i> = 0.012). One symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in the BMT group, and no deaths or access-site complications were reported.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In children with isolated M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with better functional outcomes and neurological recovery than medical therapy alone, with an acceptable safety profile. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this population-based study, we described the epidemiology of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) in northern Italy and compared the clinical characteristics of patients with PLS to those with predominant upper motor neuron (PUMN) involvement and classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients from the PARALS registry diagnosed with probable or definite PLS between 2007 and 2021 were included. Crude annual incidence rates were calculated, along with age- and sex-specific rates. A survival analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors at diagnosis. Covariates included sex, age at onset, site of onset, diagnostic delay, forced vital capacity (FVC), change in ALS Functional Rating Scale (ΔFRS), and change in body mass index (ΔBMI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 57 PLS patients (2.7%) were included, with a crude incidence rate of 0.084 per 100,000 person-years. Compared to PUMN and classic ALS, PLS patients were younger (median onset age 63.5 years, interquartile range [IQR] 54.9–70.4) and predominantly female (male-to-female ratio 0.58). Bulbar onset occurred in 11 cases (19.3%), all of whom later developed spinal symptoms. At censoring, 38 patients (66.7%) were still alive (median survival 8.3 years, IQR 5.7–12.3), corresponding to a point prevalence of 0.89 per 100,000. Survival was significantly associated with age at onset (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–1.33, <i>p</i> = 0.001), male sex (HR 4.41, 95% CI: 1.24–15.6, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and FVC at diagnosis (HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93–0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.006).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PLS was confirmed to be rarer than other ALS phenotypes. Patients had a higher age at onset than previously reported and a female predominance. Sex, age at onset, and respiratory function were key prognostic factors. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Efficient inventory management is a critical internal capability for ensuring the financial sustainability of micro and small enterprises, especially in emerging economies affected by post-pandemic disruptions. In Bagua, Peru, MSMEs often lack digitised control systems, leading to frequent stock imbalances, rushed purchases at high prices, and lower profitability; a deeper understanding of inventory practices that drive financial performance can contribute to more informed and strategic decision-making. Method This quantitative, descriptive, and explanatory study examined the effects of four components of inventory management—control, valuation methods, control records, and measurement—on profitability; a convenience sample of 83 MSMEs yielded 200 valid responses from key personnel involved in inventory decisions; A 21-item Likert scale validated by experts was applied, and the data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression in SPSS v27. Profitability indicators included return on assets (ROA), gross margin (GM), and return on equity (ROE). Results All dimensions of the inventory showed moderate levels of implementation (means: 2.37–2.62 on a five-point scale). The regression model demonstrated satisfactory predictive power (R2 = 0.402; F = 32.81; p < 0.001). Inventory measurement was the strongest and only highly significant predictor of profitability (β = 0.383; p < 0.001), followed by inventory control, with a smaller but significant contribution (β = 0.257; p = 0.013). Inventory valuation methods and control records did not show statistically significant direct effects (p > 0.40). Conclusion The findings highlight that decision-oriented measurement practices, supported by systematic control, are essential factors for the financial performance of micro and small enterprises; investment in digital monitoring tools, replenishment based on key performance indicators, and staff training could improve operational and financial efficiency; due to its cross-sectional design and localised context, future studies should incorporate longitudinal data and broader geographical comparisons to strengthen generalisation and explore possible mediation pathways between accounting-oriented practices and profitability.

                Background Cerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) is widely used to assess neurovascular disorders, but venous contamination often obscures arteries. Optimizing bolus-tracking thresholds is crucial, yet patient factors influencing contrast dynamics and the value of radiation dose indices in head CTA remain unclear. Objectives To optimize bolus-tracking thresholds in cerebral CTA by examining patient-related influences on enhancement and radiation metrics. Methods 126 adults undergoing cerebral CTA were evaluated in this prospective study. Demographics, physiologic parameters, peak enhancement time (PET), peak enhancement attenuation (PEA), and dose indices (CTDIvol, SSDE) were recorded. Linear regression identified predictors of enhancement. Two blinded radiologists graded venous contamination. ROC analysis, including age subgroups, determined the optimal HU threshold. Results Median age was 55.5 years; 70% were male. PET rose with age (+0.086 s/year, p < 0.001) and was shorter in females (–2.39 s, p = 0.003). PEA increased with threshold (+1.03 HU/unit, p < 0.001). Arterial enhancement was higher in females (+40.7 HU, p < 0.001) and patients ≥60 years (+70 HU, p < 0.001). Venous enhancement correlated with PET (p = 0.023) and systolic pressure (p = 0.002). ROC analysis showed an optimal threshold of 105 ± 5 HU (AUC = 0.634; sensitivity 88.4%, specificity 77.1%). CTDIvol, but not SSDE, correlated with weight (p = 0.015). Conclusion Intrinsic (age, gender) and extrinsic (threshold) factors shape CTA enhancement. A 105 ± 5 HU threshold reduces venous contamination, especially in younger patients. CTDIvol remains the preferred dose index. Findings support individualized, resource-efficient CTA protocols aligned with UN SDGs 3, 9, and 12.

                Background Outdoor play has long been recognized as a crucial aspect of childhood development, with potential implications for physical health and cognitive abilities. Objective To examine the impact of outdoor play on the physical health and cognitive development of school-aged children (6-12 years), highlighting its vital role during these formative years. Design A scoping-type search across major databases reviewed observational and systematic reviews, as well as meta-analyses, extracting data on exposure factors such as duration, frequency, setting, and outcomes related to cardiovascular fitness, body composition, obesity risk, attention, executive function, creativity, problem-solving, and emotional well-being. Results Findings indicate regular outdoor play improves fitness and body composition, enhances cognitive function and mood, and is shaped by access to safe green spaces and school policies, with barriers including safety concerns, weather, urban design, and socioeconomic factors. Conclusion Proposed mechanisms involve increased physical activity in diverse settings, engagement with natural stimuli, and social interactions that support learning and resilience. Families, schools, urban planners, and policymakers must ensure that outdoor access is safe and equitable. The implications of this call for action include integrating outdoor play into routines and policymaking, standardizing exposure and outcome measures, and prioritizing longitudinal, diverse-population research to clarify causality.

                Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can result in severe complications such as heart attacks and strokes. Hypertension doubles the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, renal failure, and peripheral arterial disease. Although the exact cause of primary hypertension remains unclear, many risk factors are strongly and independently associated with its development. In contrast, risk factors for secondary hypertension can overlap with those for primary hypertension, presenting significant challenges in maintaining proper blood pressure control. Most individuals with hypertension do not exhibit any symptoms. However, extremely high blood pressure can cause headaches, blurred vision, chest pain, and other symptoms. Multiple studies have shown that physical activity lowers blood pressure regardless of weight loss, benefiting both individuals with normal blood pressure and those with hypertension. The exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of physical activity on blood pressure remain largely unknown, likely due to the complex and multifaceted nature of blood pressure regulation, involving neuro-hormonal, hemodynamic, and metabolic factors. Clinicians should incorporate practical strategies into exercise prescriptions, such as working out with friends, joining community groups, and tracking physical activity duration or counts.

                Background Preserving health outcomes in vulnerable and crisis-prone environments remains a significant challenge due to systemic weaknesses, limited resources, and recurrent emergencies. This study evaluates the ReBUILD for Resilience program in Sierra Leone, an intervention aimed at strengthening health systems and fostering community engagement through co-created radio discussions. Methods The intervention was implemented in the Moyamba and Kailahun districts, focusing on improving health literacy, empowering communities, and addressing local health priorities. Stakeholders, including community members, health workers, and local authorities, collaboratively developed and disseminated culturally relevant radio content. Data were collected through qualitative methods, including interviews and focus group discussions, and analysed to identify key themes related to stakeholder involvement, implementation processes, and perceived impacts. Results Four main themes were identified: stakeholder motivations, perceived objectives, planning and implementation processes, and program impacts. Stakeholders were driven by a sense of community responsibility and the need to bridge health knowledge gaps. The radio discussions were perceived as effective in raising awareness and facilitating communication between communities and health authorities. Successful implementation was attributed to collaborative planning and the use of local languages. While stakeholders noted perceived benefits such as improved health literacy and behaviour changes, these outcomes were not directly assessed in the study. Challenges included logistical and financial constraints, highlighting the need for sustainable funding strategies. Conclusions The ReBUILD for Resilience program demonstrates the transformative potential of co-produced health interventions in fragile and shock-prone settings. Community ownership, cultural relevance, and stakeholder participation were critical to its success. This study contributes to the growing evidence on participatory approaches to strengthening health systems and underscores the need for innovative strategies to ensure the sustainability of such interventions in resource-constrained environments.

                Background Inventory management is essential to ensure cost efficiency and operational continuity in the automotive sector. Traditional (crisp) inventory systems assume fixed values for the input parameters, which may not reflect real-world variability. This study compares the performance of crisp and fuzzy inventory models in managing uncertainty in demand and costs, using Tesla as a case context. Methods Inventory models were developed under crisp and fuzzy frameworks, incorporating a quadratic time-dependent demand function, holding costs, deterioration, production, and setup costs. In the fuzzy model, the key parameters were represented using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and the centroid method was applied for defuzzification. Mathematica 14.0, was used to compute the optimal cycle time and total cost for both systems. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of variations in each parameter. Results The fuzzy inventory model produced a lower total cost ($57.06) compared to the crisp model ($143.33), reflecting an 86.11% reduction. The fuzzy system also demonstrated improved robustness to changes in production rate, setup cost, and deterioration rate. Both models produced similar economic order quantities, but were more economical and flexible to parameter variations. Sensitivity analysis proved that the system was more sensitive to minor changes in input values for the crisp model, raising the overall cost higher than that of the fuzzy model. Conclusions Fuzzy inventory systems can address demand uncertainty and cost variability in the automotive industry. It can be noted that applying inventory planning within fuzzy logic can save costs and aid in reacting better to fluctuations in the market. Such applications can be applied to companies considering the high demand and production variability. Subsequent studies can further develop multi-item models and combine stochastic lead times or dynamic prices.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Assess the performance of serum phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in predicting risk of cognitive impairment or phenoconversion to dementia in individuals with iRBD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured serum p-tau217 and NfL levels by electrochemiluminescence across 4 polysomnographically confirmed iRBD cohorts (n = 300), including individuals who phenoconverted to Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 51), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 22), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 5).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Serum p-tau217 levels were increased in individuals with iRBD and cognitive impairment (CI) on testing defined as Montreal Cognitive Assessment &lt;26 or subthreshold parkinsonism. p-Tau217 differentiated individuals with iRBD who developed PD with CI (PD-CI) or DLB from PD phenoconverters with normal cognition (area under curve [AUC] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.93) and from iRBD non-phenoconverters with normal cognition (AUC = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.89). NfL levels did not correlate with cognitive or motor scores and marginally improved p-tau217 performance (AUC = 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.92), but were notably elevated in iRBD individuals who phenoconverted to MSA. Individuals with p-tau217 in the top quartile were 8 times more likely to phenoconvert to PD-CI or DLB compared to the bottom quartile (hazard ratio = 8.30; 95% confidence interval, 2.49–27.65).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Serum p-tau217, but not NfL, is a useful biomarker of cognitive impairment in iRBD that could be integrated into a multimodal prognostic indicator when stratifying risk of phenoconversion. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>This study provides the first quantitative comparison of the caudal rami of the superior temporal sulcus among humans, chimpanzees, and other great apes, revealing conserved sulcal patterns, as well as species-specific differences. These findings highlight evolutionary pressures shaping the morphology of the caudal temporoparietal cortex underlying different aspects of cognition.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For centuries, anatomists have charted the folding patterns of the sulci of the cerebral cortex in primates. Improvements in neuroimaging technologies over the past decades have led to advancements in the understanding of the sulcal organization of the human cerebral cortex, yet comparisons to chimpanzees, one of humans’ closest extant phylogenetic relatives, remain to be performed in many regions, such as the caudal temporoparietal region (cTPR). For example, while several posterior branches, or rami, of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) have been identified within the cTPR in great apes since the late 1800s, no study has yet comprehensively identified and quantitatively compared these rami across species. To fill this gap in knowledge, in the present study, we defined the three caudal branches of the STS (cSTS) in 72 human and 29 chimpanzee brains (202 total hemispheres) and then extracted and compared the morphological (depth and surface area) properties of these sulci. We report three main findings. First, modern methods replicate classic findings that three rami of the posterior STS are unique to the hominid lineage (i.e., humans and great apes). Second, normalizing for brain size, the cSTS rami were relatively deeper in chimpanzees compared to humans. Third, the cSTS branches were relatively larger in surface area in humans compared to chimpanzees. Finally, we share probabilistic predictions of the cSTS to guide the identification of these sulci in future studies. Altogether, these findings bridge the gap between historic qualitative observations and modern quantitative measurements in a part of the brain that has expanded substantially throughout evolution and that is involved in human-specific aspects of cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78084?af=R">Late Pregnancy Antiseizure Medication Exposure and Offspring Neurodevelopmental Risk: A Multi‐Child Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Antiseizure medication (ASM) use during pregnancy has increased over the past decade. However, evidence linking prenatal ASM exposure to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring remains inconsistent. This study evaluated whether prenatal ASM exposure increases the risk of NDDs in children.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from 5 population-based cohorts of live-born children in Canada (Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec; the Canadian Mother-Child Cohort [CAMCCO] cohorts) and the United States (AM-PREGNANT cohort). ASM exposure was defined as maternal prescription fills overlapping the 60 days before birth. NDDs were identified using validated algorithm based on the International Classification of Disease-9/10 codes from inpatient and outpatient records. Within each cohort, Cox proportional hazards models were applied, with adjustment performed separately using (1) covariates and (2) propensity scores. Pooled estimates were obtained using random-effects meta-analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 2,910,206 children, 0.47% were exposed to ASMs in the 60 days before birth. Prenatal ASM exposure was associated with a 29% increased risk of NDDs (pooled-adjusted hazard ratio [p-aHR], 1.29; 95% CI: 1.22–1.37; 1,805 exposed cases). In the Canadian cohorts, risks of combined NDDs varied by medication: carbamazepine (p-aHR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.20–1.87; 262 exposed cases), clonazepam (p-aHR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12–1.33; 585 exposed cases), topiramate (p-aHR 1.56; 95% CI: 1.04–2.34; 69 exposed cases), and valproic acid (p-aHR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.16–1.65; 134 exposed cases). Although point estimates were higher for polytherapy than monotherapy, the difference was not statistically significant.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Prenatal exposure to certain ASMs was consistently associated with increased risks of NDDs in offspring. These findings support careful, individualized decision-making regarding prenatal ASM use to minimize neurodevelopmental risks. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
