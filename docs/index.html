                Clinical presentation of liver hydatidosis can vary from asymptomatic forms to lethal complications. We report a rare case of a 27-year-old male from a rural Tunisian region who presented with large-abundance haematemesis, haemodynamic instability, and marked biological signs of hypersplenism. Endoscopy showed bleeding esophageal varicose veins that were ligated. Abdominal ultrasound concluded the presence of three type CE2 hydatic liver cysts causing portal cavernoma with signs of portal hypertension. Despite resuscitation, the patient died of massive rebleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock. Hepatic hydatid cyst should be considered as an indirect cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in endemic countries. Early abdominal ultrasound in varicose haemorrhage is essential in orienting the diagnosis.

<p><i>Faim</i> knockout mice present early aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, chronic gliosis, blood-retinal barrier disruption and alterations in survival pathways that culminate in photoreceptor cell death. We think FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis and a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fas Apoptotic Inhibitory Molecule protein (FAIM) is a death receptor antagonist and an apoptosis regulator. It encodes two isoforms, namely FAIM-S (short) and FAIM-L (long), both with significant neuronal functions. FAIM-S, which is ubiquitously expressed, is involved in neurite outgrowth. In contrast, FAIM-L is expressed only in neurons and it protects them from cell death. Interestingly, FAIM-L is downregulated in patients and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease before the onset of neurodegeneration, and <i>Faim</i> transcript levels are decreased in mouse models of retinal degeneration. However, few studies have addressed the role of FAIM in the central nervous system, yet alone the retina. The retina is a highly specialized tissue, and its degeneration has proved to precede pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe that <i>Faim</i> depletion in mice damages the retina persistently and leads to late-onset photoreceptor death in older mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that <i>Faim</i> knockout (<i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup>) mice present ubiquitinated aggregates throughout the retina from early ages. Moreover, retinal cells released stress signals that can signal to Müller cells, as shown by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR. Müller cells monitor retinal homeostasis and trigger a gliotic response in <i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice that becomes pathogenic when sustained. In this regard, we observed pronounced vascular leakage at later ages, which may be caused by persistent inflammation. These results suggest that FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis, and they support the premise that FAIM is a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration.</p>

     alt="Long-term hypogonadism diminishes the neuroprotective effects of dietary genistein in young adult ovariectomized rats after transient focal ischemia"/>
<p>After short-term, but not after long-term hypogonadism, estrogen and genistein reduced strike-induced infarct in ovariectomize female rats. Estrogen improved neurological function after long-term hypogonadism. Genistein improved aspects of cognition independent of length of hypogonadism. These data support differential benefits of estrogen and genistein after loss of endogenous steroids.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing age disproportionately increases the risk of stroke among women compared to men of similar age, especially after menopause. One of the reasons for this observation is a sharp drop in circulating estrogens. However, the timing of initiation of estrogen replacement after menopause is associated with mixed beneficial and detrimental effects, hence contributing to widespread mistrust of estrogen use. Agents including soy isoflavones are being assessed as viable alternatives to estrogen therapy. In this study, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effects of genistein, a soy isoflavone are less sensitive to the length of hypogonadism in young adult ovariectomized rats following cerebral ischemia. We expected that long-term hypogonadism will worsen motor and cognitive function, increase post-stroke inflammation with no effect on the neuroprotection of genistein. We compared the effect of treatment with dietary genistein (GEN) on short-term (2 weeks) and long-term hypogonadism (12 weeks) in young adult ovariectomized Sprague–Dawley rats on sensorimotor function, cognition and inflammation after focal ischemia. Dorsal Silastic implant of 17β-estradiol (E2) was used as a control for hormone therapy. Long-term hypogonadism stroked rats performed worse than the short-term hypogonadism stroked rats on the motor and cognitive function tests. GEN did not improve neurological assessment and motor learning after either short-term or long-term hypogonadism. GEN improved cognitive flexibility after short-term hypogonadism but not after the long-term. Both GEN and E2 reduced tissue loss after short-term hypogonadism and reduced GFAP expression at the contralateral side of ischemia after long-term hypogonadism. The length of hypogonadism may differentially influence the neuroprotective effects of both GEN and E2 on the motor and cognitive functions in young adult rats.</p>

     alt="Increased susceptibility to quinolinic acid-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations in an animal model of glutaric acidemia type I"/>
<p>Following quinolinic acid (QA) intrastriatal injection, glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) animal model is more susceptible to QA-induced severe seizures, develops spontaneous recurrent seizures, and presents increased mortality rate and persistent changes in brain cortical oscillation patterns. This emphasizes the crucial role of QA in neurological impairment in GA-I</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) is an inborn error of metabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, caused by glutaryl-CoA-dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency, characterized by the buildup of toxic organic acids predominantly in the brain. After acute catabolic states, patients usually develop striatal degeneration, but the mechanisms behind this damage are still unknown. Quinolinic acid (QA), a metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, increases especially during infections/inflammatory processes, and could act synergically with organic acids, contributing to the neurological features of GA-I. The aim of this study was to investigate whether QA increases seizure susceptibility and modifies brain oscillation patterns in an animal model of GA-I, the <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice taking high-lysine diet (<i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys). Therefore, the characteristics of QA-induced seizures and changes in brain oscillatory patterns were evaluated by video-electroencephalography (EEG) analysis recorded in <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>-</i>Lys, <i>Gcdh<sup>+/+</sup>-</i>Lys, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N (normal diet) animals. We found that the number of seizures <i>per</i> animal was similar for all groups receiving QA, <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA, <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA. However, severe seizures were observed in the majority of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA mice (82%), and only in 25% of <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA and 44% of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA mice. All <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), but <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA animals had increased number of SRS, higher mortality rate, and significant predominance of lower frequency oscillations on EEG. Our results suggest that QA plays an important role in the neurological features of GA-I, as <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys mice exhibit increased susceptibility to intrastriatal QA-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humans use forward thinking to exploit social controllability</a></h4>

              
                The controllability of our social environment has a profound impact on our behavior and mental health. Nevertheless, neurocomputational mechanisms underlying social controllability remain elusive. Here, 48 participants performed a task where their current choices either did (Controllable), or did not (Uncontrollable), influence partners’ future proposals. Computational modeling revealed that people engaged a mental model of forward thinking (FT; i.e., calculating the downstream effects of current actions) to estimate social controllability in both Controllable and Uncontrollable conditions. A large-scale online replication study (n=1342) supported this finding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (n=48), we further demonstrated that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) computed the projected total values of current actions during forward planning, supporting the neural realization of the forward-thinking model. These findings demonstrate that humans use vmPFC-dependent FT to estimate and exploit social controllability, expanding the role of this neurocomputational mechanism beyond spatial and cognitive contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Piezo1 ion channels inherently function as independent mechanotransducers</a></h4>

              
                Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint, which indirectly suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other’s spatial distribution and interact functionally. Here, we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Our data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that both at endogenous densities (1–2 channels/μm<sup>2</sup>), and at non-physiological densities (10–100 channels/μm<sup>2</sup>) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap, Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension. The results suggest that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane.

	<p>Chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause permanent disability and thereby negatively affect patients, families, and society. Currently, there is no effective treatment for patients with chronic TBI. One possible option is granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which has potential neuroregenerative and neuroprotective effects through its ability to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells and increase neurogenic growth factor levels. Previous studies have shown that G-CSF administration is safe for patients with neurological diseases such as stroke and dementia. The present study aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of G-CSF use in patients with chronic TBI. Methods: 38 patients with chronic TBI were administered 3-day rounds of G-CSF (10 μg/kg per day) once a month for 6 months. These patients were clinically evaluated using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS). Laboratory measures of the leucocyte counts and differential count percentage were also assessed. Results: At the 6-month follow-up, further assessment showed that patients tolerated the treatment well with only mild and transient side effects being observed. Further clinical evaluation showed significant improvements in mRS and KPS after G-CSF treatment. Laboratory results also confirmed the action of the medication, with increased leukocytosis and band forms. Conclusions: The results suggest that 6-month chronic G-CSF treatment is safe for patients with chronic TBI and may provide clinical benefits and neurological improvements. The adverse effects of the treatment, however, are transient and usually tolerable. Thus, these preliminary findings suggest that future clinical trials of G-CSF use in patients with chronic TBI are warranted.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This study explored the effect of short vestibular and cognitive training on the reading speed in dyslexic children. (2) Methods: The reading speed was evaluated by using a reading test (Évaluation de la Lecture en FluencE, ELFE) in a crossover design before (baseline) and after vestibular training (post VT) and no vestibular training (post no VT). Nineteen dyslexic children (9.48 ± 0.15 years) participated in the study. The vestibular and cognitive training (software developed by BeonSolution S.r.l.) consisted in four exercises presented on a Wacom tablet 10″ done for 16 min per session two times per week for four weeks; each exercise was composed of eight levels with increased difficulty. (3) Results: Following vestibular and cognitive training, dyslexic children increased their reading speed; interestingly, such an increase persisted at least one month after training. (4) Conclusions: Vestibular and cognitive training could improve the vestibular network, which is well known for being involved in several cognition functions leading to reading improvement in dyslexic children. Adaptive mechanisms could be responsible for maintaining such improvement for at least one month.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Phosphorylation of CREB at Serine 142 and 143 Is Essential for Visual Cortex Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is involved in a myriad of cellular functions in the central nervous system. For instance, the role of CREB via phosphorylation at the amino-acid residue Serine (Ser)133 in expressing plasticity-related genes and activity-dependent neuronal plasticity processes has been extensively demonstrated. However, much less is known about the role of CREB phosphorylation at Ser142 and Ser143. Here, we employed a viral vector containing a dominant negative form of CREB, with serine-to-alanine mutations at residue 142 and 143 to specifically block phosphorylation at both sites. We then transfected this vector into primary neurons <I>in vitro</I> or intracortically injected it into mice <I>in vivo</I>, to test whether these phosphorylation events were important for activity-dependent plasticity. We demonstrated by immunohistochemistry of cortical neuronal cultures that the expression of Arc, a known plasticity-related gene, requires triple phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133, Ser142, and Ser143. Moreover, we recorded visually-evoked field potentials in awake mice before and after a 7-d period of monocular deprivation (MD) to show that, in addition to CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the visual cortex also requires CREB phosphorylation at Ser142/143. Our findings suggest that Ser142/143 phosphorylation is an additional post-translational modification of CREB that triggers the expression of specific target genes and activity-dependent neuronal plasticity processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Cascades Shape Whole-Brain Functional Dynamics at Rest</a></h4>

              
                <p>At rest, mammalian brains display remarkable spatiotemporal complexity, evolving through recurrent functional connectivity (<I>FC</I>) states on a slow timescale of the order of tens of seconds. While the phenomenology of the resting state dynamics is valuable in distinguishing healthy and pathologic brains, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify neuronal cascades as a potential mechanism. Using full-brain network modeling, we show that neuronal populations, coupled via a detailed structural connectome, give rise to large-scale cascades of firing rate fluctuations evolving at the same time scale of resting-state networks (<I>RSNs</I>). The ignition and subsequent propagation of cascades depend on the brain state and connectivity of each region. The largest cascades produce bursts of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) co-fluctuations at pairs of regions across the brain, which shape the simulated <I>RSN</I> dynamics. We experimentally confirm these theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the existence and stability of intermittent epochs of <I>FC</I> comprising BOLD co-activation (CA) bursts in mice and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We then provide evidence for the existence and leading role of the neuronal cascades in humans with simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. These results show that neuronal cascades are a major determinant of spontaneous fluctuations in brain dynamics at rest.</p>

                Background - Since 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) in Malaysia has given licenses to only eleven P2P lending platforms. Such lending platforms are expected to disrupt the lending services of traditional lenders in the coming years. However, being still in their infant stages, it is essential to know the extent to which such platforms are made known to potential investors out there. This study examines the extent to which young adults are aware of Malaysia's eleven P2P lending platforms.      Methods - A sample of 65 undergraduate students majoring in finance and accounting was used for this pilot study. An online questionnaire was designed with three main parts: demographic, financial literacy, and P2P lending awareness.     Results - Findings show that more than half of respondents in the sample are not aware of P2P lending platforms in Malaysia.  Most of the respondents are financially literate to certain degrees. Those aware of their presence underestimated the potentially high level of their default rates and misunderstood that investor would be fully protected by such platforms when a loan default.     Conclusions -The study's findings have shed light on the current awareness of P2P lending platforms among Malaysian young adults, potential investors of such platforms in the coming years.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Synergistic interventions to control COVID-19: Mass testing and isolation mitigates reliance on distancing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emily Howerton, Matthew J. Ferrari, Ottar N. Bjørnstad, Tiffany L. Bogich, Rebecca K. Borchering, Chris P. Jewell, James D. Nichols, William J. M. Probert, Michael C. Runge, Michael J. Tildesley, Cécile Viboud, Katriona Shea</p>

Stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of non-essential businesses are powerful, but socially costly, tools to control the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Mass testing strategies, which rely on widely administered frequent and rapid diagnostics to identify and isolate infected individuals, could be a potentially less disruptive management strategy, particularly where vaccine access is limited. In this paper, we assess the extent to which mass testing and isolation strategies can reduce reliance on socially costly non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as distancing and shutdowns. We develop a multi-compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission incorporating both preventative non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and testing and isolation to evaluate their combined effect on public health outcomes. Our model is designed to be a policy-guiding tool that captures important realities of the testing system, including constraints on test administration and non-random testing allocation. We show how strategic changes in the characteristics of the testing system, including test administration, test delays, and test sensitivity, can reduce reliance on preventative NPIs without compromising public health outcomes in the future. The lowest NPI levels are possible only when many tests are administered and test delays are short, given limited immunity in the population. Reducing reliance on NPIs is highly dependent on the ability of a testing program to identify and isolate unreported, asymptomatic infections. Changes in NPIs, including the intensity of lockdowns and stay at home orders, should be coordinated with increases in testing to ensure epidemic control; otherwise small additional lifting of these NPIs can lead to dramatic increases in infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Importantly, our results can be used to guide ramp-up of testing capacity in outbreak settings, allow for the flexible design of combined interventions based on social context, and inform future cost-benefit analyses to identify efficient pandemic management strategies.

Experimental data about gene functions curated from the primary literature have enormous value for research scientists in understanding biology. Using the Gene Ontology (GO), manual curation by experts has provided an important resource for studying gene function, especially within model organisms. Unprecedented expansion of the scientific literature and validation of the predicted proteins have increased both data value and the challenges of keeping pace. Capturing literature-based functional annotations is limited by the ability of biocurators to handle the massive and rapidly growing scientific literature. Within the community-oriented wiki framework for GO annotation called the Gene Ontology Normal Usage Tracking System (GONUTS), we describe an approach to expand biocuration through crowdsourcing with undergraduates. This multiplies the number of high-quality annotations in international databases, enriches our coverage of the literature on normal gene function, and pushes the field in new directions. From an intercollegiate competition judged by experienced biocurators, Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies (CACAO), we have contributed nearly 5,000 literature-based annotations. Many of those annotations are to organisms not currently well-represented within GO. Over a 10-year history, our community contributors have spurred changes to the ontology not traditionally covered by professional biocurators. The CACAO principle of relying on community members to participate in and shape the future of biocuration in GO is a powerful and scalable model used to promote the scientific enterprise. It also provides undergraduate students with a unique and enriching introduction to critical reading of primary literature and acquisition of marketable skills.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Radio-frequency exposure of the yellow fever mosquito (A. aegypti) from 2 to 240 GHz</a></h4>

Fifth generation networks (5G) will be associated with a partial shift to higher carrier frequencies, including wavelengths of insects. This may lead to higher absorption of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) by insects and could cause dielectric heating. The yellow fever mosquito (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>), a vector for diseases such as yellow and dengue fever, favors warm climates. Being exposed to higher frequency RF EMFs causing possible dielectric heating, could have an influence on behavior, physiology and morphology, and could be a possible factor for introduction of the species in regions where the yellow fever mosquito normally does not appear. In this study, the influence of far field RF exposure on <i>A</i>. <i>aegypti</i> was examined between 2 and 240 GHz. Using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations, the distribution of the electric field in and around the insect and the absorbed RF power were found for six different mosquito models (three male, three female). The 3D models were created from micro-CT scans of real mosquitoes. The dielectric properties used in the simulation were measured from a mixture of homogenized <i>A</i>. <i>aegypti</i>. For a given incident RF power, the absorption increases with increasing frequency between 2 and 90 GHz with a maximum between 90 and 240 GHz. The absorption was maximal in the region where the wavelength matches the size of the mosquito. For a same incident field strength, the power absorption by the mosquito is 16 times higher at 60 GHz than at 6 GHz. The higher absorption of RF power by future technologies can result in dielectric heating and potentially influence the biology of this mosquito.

The opportunity to participate in and contribute to emerging fields is increasingly prevalent in science. However, simply thinking about stepping outside of your academic silo can leave many students reeling from the uncertainty. Here, we describe 10 simple rules to successfully train yourself in an emerging field, based on our experience as students in the emerging field of ecological forecasting. Our advice begins with setting and revisiting specific goals to achieve your academic and career objectives and includes several useful rules for engaging with and contributing to an emerging field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Operational response simulation tool for epidemics within refugee and IDP settlements: A scenario-based case study of the Cox’s Bazar settlement</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joseph Aylett-Bullock, Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro, Arnau Quera-Bofarull, Anjali Katta, Katherine Hoffmann Pham, Benjamin Hoover, Hendrik Strobelt, Rebeca Moreno Jimenez, Aidan Sedgewick, Egmond Samir Evers, David Kennedy, Sandra Harlass, Allen Gidraf Kahindo Maina, Ahmad Hussien, Miguel Luengo-Oroz</p>

The spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 presents many challenges to healthcare systems and infrastructures across the world, exacerbating inequalities and leaving the world’s most vulnerable populations most affected. Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to disease spread. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements under various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model, based on the June open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. The development and testing of this approach focuses on the Cox’s Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh, although our model is designed to be generalizable to other informal settings. Our findings suggest the encouraging self-isolation at home of mild to severe symptomatic patients, as opposed to the isolation of all positive cases in purpose-built isolation and treatment centers, does not increase the risk of secondary infection meaning the centers can be used to provide hospital support to the most intense cases of COVID-19. Secondly we find that mask wearing in all indoor communal areas can be effective at dampening viral spread, even with low mask efficacy and compliance rates. Finally, we model the effects of reopening learning centers in the settlement under various mitigation strategies. For example, a combination of mask wearing in the classroom, halving attendance regularity to enable physical distancing, and better ventilation can almost completely mitigate the increased risk of infection which keeping the learning centers open may cause. These modeling efforts are being incorporated into decision making processes to inform future planning, and further exercises should be carried out in similar geographies to help protect those most vulnerable.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Proactive measures to eradicate Malaysia’s poverty in IR4.0 era: a shared prosperity vision [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the country’s shared prosperity vision, Malaysia aspires to uplift the bottom 40% household income group (B40) by addressing wealth and income disparities. By 2030, the nation seeks to eradicate poverty through the provision of employment opportunities and career progression plans. A grey area between the nation’s aspirations and actions in practice can be observed because the goals have not been achieved despite numerous efforts aimed at the upliftment of the B40 group. The nation is still way behind its targeted outcomes despite various policies being implemented, which could be attributed to the mismatch between government policies and that of organisational practice. Thus, this study explores the rationale of strategic government intervention in managing B40 talent in the IR4.0 era. Methods: A general qualitative inquiry method that used 11 semi-structured interviews was carried out with representatives of Malaysia’s policy makers’, training providers, and trainees. All Interview questions centred around measures, importance and outcomes of B40 youth training from a multi-stakeholder perspective. Data were thematically analysed in five stages using NVivo. Results: Training, which includes IR4.0 era digital skills, is the key to uplifting the B40 youth to eradicate poverty. Proactive measures are imperative in the success of B40 youth training towards poverty eradication. Conclusions: This study contributes to the existing literature and helps practitioners by addressing the current gap in Malaysia’s aspirations versus organisational practice. Stakeholders should formulate proactive strategies to ensure that the right trainees are matched with the right training providers and government policies. A linkage between government policies and industry requirements needs to be established as opposed to the present discontinuity. A structured training needs analysis should be applied through a collaboration between industries and governments. Then, B40 individuals commonly found in lower-level positions can be pooled into the career pathway towards a shift into M40.

                Bicknell and Häusser develop a theoretical approach for investigating single-neuron computation and learning. By deriving a plasticity rule that optimally adjusts the strengths of interacting synapses to control somatic spiking, they show that neurons can learn to harness the biophysical properties of their dendrites to perform nonlinear computations.

                Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables naturalistic neuroscientific studies while maintaining experimental control, but dynamic and interactive stimuli pose methodological challenges. We here probed the link between emotional arousal, a fundamental property of affective experience, and parieto-occipital alpha power under naturalistic stimulation: 37 young healthy adults completed an immersive VR experience, which included rollercoaster rides, while their EEG was recorded. They then continuously rated their subjective emotional arousal while viewing a replay of their experience. The association between emotional arousal and parieto-occipital alpha power was tested and confirmed by (1) decomposing the continuous EEG signal while maximizing the comodulation between alpha power and arousal ratings and by (2) decoding periods of high and low arousal with discriminative common spatial patterns and a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network. We successfully combine EEG and a naturalistic immersive VR experience to extend previous findings on the neurophysiology of emotional arousal towards real-world neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phagocytic 'teeth' and myosin-II 'jaw' power target constriction during phagocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Phagocytosis requires rapid actin reorganization and spatially controlled force generation to ingest targets ranging from pathogens to apoptotic cells. How actomyosin activity directs membrane extensions to engulf such diverse targets remains unclear. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) with microparticle traction force microscopy (MP-TFM) to quantify actin dynamics and subcellular forces during macrophage phagocytosis. We show that spatially localized forces leading to target constriction are prominent during phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized targets. This constriction is largely driven by Arp2/3-mediated assembly of discrete actin protrusions containing myosin 1e and 1f ('teeth') that appear to be interconnected in a ring-like organization. Contractile myosin-II activity contributes to late-stage phagocytic force generation and progression, supporting a specific role in phagocytic cup closure. Observations of partial target eating attempts and sudden target release via a popping mechanism suggest that constriction may be critical for resolving complex <i>in vivo</i> target encounters. Overall, our findings present a phagocytic cup-shaping mechanism that is distinct from cytoskeletal remodeling in 2D cell motility and may contribute to mechanosensing and phagocytic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), a key checkpoint in reprogramming of regulatory T cells metabolism and function</a></h4>

              
                Cellular metabolism has key roles in T cells differentiation and function. CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper-1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 subsets are highly glycolytic while regulatory T cells (Tregs) use glucose during expansion but rely on fatty acid oxidation for function. Upon uptake, glucose can enter pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) or be used in glycolysis. Here, we showed that blocking 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) in the oxidative PPP resulted in substantial reduction of Tregs suppressive function and shifts toward Th1, Th2, and Th17 phenotypes which led to the development of fetal inflammatory disorder in mice model. These in turn improved anti-tumor responses and worsened the outcomes of colitis model. Metabolically, 6PGD blocked Tregs showed improved glycolysis and enhanced non-oxidative PPP to support nucleotide biosynthesis. These results uncover critical role of 6PGD in modulating Tregs plasticity and function, which qualifies it as a novel metabolic checkpoint for immunotherapy applications.

                Continuous adaptation allows survival in an ever-changing world. Adjustments in the synaptic coupling strength between neurons are essential for this capability, setting us apart from simpler, hard-wired organisms. How these changes can be mathematically described at the phenomenological level, as so-called ‘plasticity rules’, is essential both for understanding biological information processing and for developing cognitively performant artificial systems. We suggest an automated approach for discovering biophysically plausible plasticity rules based on the definition of task families, associated performance measures and biophysical constraints. By evolving compact symbolic expressions, we ensure the discovered plasticity rules are amenable to intuitive understanding, fundamental for successful communication and human-guided generalization. We successfully apply our approach to typical learning scenarios and discover previously unknown mechanisms for learning efficiently from rewards, recover efficient gradient-descent methods for learning from target signals, and uncover various functionally equivalent STDP-like rules with tuned homeostatic mechanisms.

                Background: Altered activity of the ventral pallidum (VP) underlies disrupted motivation after stress exposure. The VP is a very heterogeneous structure comprised of many different neuron types with distinct electrophysiological properties and projections. Neuronal PAS 1-positive (Npas1+) VP neurons are thought to send projections to brain regions critical for stress response. In this study, we evaluated how activity of VP Npas1+ neurons affect emotional behaviors and responses to social stress. Methods: We used a chemogenetic approach to manipulate VP Npas1+ neurons during social defeat stress (SDS) and behavioral tasks related to anxiety and motivation in Npas1-Cre mice. We employed a similar approach in females using the chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS). Finally, to characterize VP Npas1+ neuron circuitry and molecular identity we evaluated the projection targets of the VP Npas1+ neurons and performed RNA-seq on ribosome-associated mRNA from VP Npas1+ neurons. Results: Chemogenetic activation of VP Npas1+ neurons increased susceptibility to a subthreshold (S)SDS and anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and open field. Inhibition of VP Npas1+ neurons enhanced resilience to chronic (C)SDS and CWDS. We identified VP Npas1+ projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), medial and lateral habenula (LHb), lateral hypothalamus (LH), thalamus, medial and lateral septum, and periaqueductal gray area. VP Npas1+ neurons displayed distinct transcriptomes representing distinct biological processes. Conclusions: Activity, of VP Npas1+ neurons, modulates susceptibility to social stressors and anxiety-like behavior. These outcomes could be related to their projections to brain regions that modulate reward and aversion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social experience dependent plasticity of mouse song selectivity without that of song components</a></h4>

              
                Syllable sequences in male mouse ultrasonic-vocalizations (USVs), songs, contain structure - quantified through predictability, like birdsong and aspects of speech. Apparent USV innateness and lack of learnability, discount mouse USVs for modelling speech-like social communication and its deficits. Informative contextual natural sequences (SN) were theoretically extracted and they were preferred by female mice. Primary auditory cortex (A1) supragranular neurons show differential selectivity to the same syllables in SN and random sequences (SR). Excitatory neurons (EXNs) in females showed increases in selectivity to whole SNs over SRs based on extent of social exposure with male, but syllable selectivity remained unchanged. Thus mouse A1 single neurons adaptively represent entire order of acoustic units without altering selectivity of individual units, fundamental to speech perception. Additionally, observed plasticity was replicated with silencing of somatostatin positive neurons, which had plastic effects opposite to EXNs, thus pointing out possible pathways involved in perception of sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Left angular gyrus disconnection impairs multiplication fact retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Arithmetic fact retrieval has been suggested to recruit a left-lateralized network comprising perisylvian language areas, parietal areas such as the angular gyrus (AG), and subcortical structures such as the hippocampus. However, the underlying white matter connectivity of these areas has not been evaluated systematically so far. Using simple multiplication problems, we evaluated how disconnections in parietal brain areas affected arithmetic fact retrieval following stroke. We derived disconnectivity measures by jointly considering data from n=73 patients with acute unilateral lesions in either hemisphere and a white-matter tractography atlas (HCP-842) using the Lesion Quantification Toolbox (LQT). Whole-brain voxel-based analysis indicated a left-hemispheric cluster of white matter fibers connecting the AG and superior temporal areas to be associated with a fact retrieval deficit. Subsequent analyses of direct grey-to-grey matter disconnections revealed that disconnections of additional left-hemispheric areas (e.g., between the superior temporal gyrus and parietal areas) were significantly associated with the observed fact retrieval deficit. Results imply that disconnections of parietal areas (i.e., the AG) with language-related areas (i.e., superior and middle temporal gyri) seem specifically detrimental to arithmetic fact retrieval. This suggests that arithmetic fact retrieval recruits a widespread left-hemispheric network and emphasizes the relevance of white matter connectivity for number processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Insights into Early Word Comprehension: Tracking the Neural Representations of Word Semantics in Infants.</a></h4>

              
                Infants start developing rudimentary language skills and can start understanding simple words well before their first birthday. This development has also been shown primarily using Event Related Potential (ERP) techniques to find evidence of word comprehension in the infant brain. While these works validate the presence of semantic representations of words (word meaning) in infants, they do not tell us about the mental processes involved in the manifestation of these semantic representations or the content of the representations. To this end, we use a decoding approach where we employ machine learning techniques on Electroencephalography (EEG) data to predict the semantic representations of words found in the brain activity of infants. We perform multiple analyses to explore word semantic representations in two groups of infants (9-month-old and 12-month-old). Our analyses show significantly above chance decodability of overall word semantics, word animacy, and word phonetics. As we analyze brain activity, we observe that participants in both age groups show signs of word comprehension immediately after word onset, marked by our model's significantly above chance word prediction accuracy. We also observed strong neural representations of word phonetics in the brain data for both age groups, some likely correlated to word decoding accuracy and others not. Lastly, we discover that the neural representations of word semantics are similar in both infant age groups. Our results on word semantics, phonetics, and animacy decodability, give us insights into the evolution of neural representation of word meaning in infants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesodiencephalic junction Gabaergic inputs are processed separately from motor cortical inputs in the basilar pons</a></h4>

              
                The basilar pontine nuclei (bPN) receive inputs from the entire neocortex and constitute the main source of mossy fibers to the cerebellum. Despite their critical position in the cortico-cerebellar pathway, it remains unclear if and how the bPN process inputs. An important unresolved question is whether the bPN strictly receives excitatory inputs or also receives inhibitory inputs. In the present study, we identified the mesodiencephalic junction as a prominent source of GABAergic afferents to the bPN. We combined optogenetics and whole-cell patch clamp recordings and confirmed that the bPN indeed receives monosynaptic GABA inputs from this region. Furthermore, we found no evidence that these inhibitory inputs converge with motor cortex (M1) inputs at the single neuron level. We also found no evidence of any connectivity between bPN neurons, suggesting the absence of a local circuit. Finally, rabies tracings revealed that GABAergic MDJ neurons themselves receive prominent inputs from neocortical output neurons. Our data indicates that inhibition from the MDJ, and excitation from the neocortex remain separate streams of information through the bPN. It is therefore unlikely that inhibition in the bPN has a gating function, but rather shapes an appropriate output of the bPN during behavior.

                Learning and consolidation of new motor skills require adaptations of neuronal activity and connectivity in the motor cortex and striatum, two key motor regions of the brain. Yet, how neurons undergo synaptic changes and become recruited during motor learning to form a memory engram remains an open question. Here, we train mice on a single-pellet reaching motor learning task and use a genetic approach to identify and manipulate behavior-relevant neurons selectively in the primary motor cortex (M1). We find that the degree of reactivation of M1 engram neurons correlates strongly with motor performance. We further demonstrate that learning-induced dendritic spine reorganization specifically occurs in these M1 engram neurons. In addition, we find that motor learning leads to an increase in the number and strength of outputs from M1 engram neurons onto striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and that these synapses form local clusters along SPN dendrites. These results identify a highly specific synaptic plasticity during the formation of long-lasting motor memory traces in the corticostriatal circuit.

                pinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1). While mutant ATXN1 is expressed throughout the brain, SCA1 is characterized by severe degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and cerebellar gliosis. It is likely that cerebellar microenvironment and in particular glial cells contribute to the Purkinje cell specific vulnerability in SCA1. We have used single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA seq) to uncover effects of mutant ATXN1 on PCs gene expression changes as well as non-cell autonomous changes in glial cells transcriptomes in cerebella of Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] mice, a transgenic SCA1 mouse model expressing mutant ATXN1 only in PCs cells

                Remyelination is crucial for recovery from inflammatory demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). Investigating remyelination in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is difficult in MS, where collecting serial short-interval scans is challenging. Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets, a model of MS that recapitulates focal cerebral MS lesions, we investigated whether remyelination can be detected and characterized noninvasively. In 6 animals followed with multisequence 7-tesla MRI, focal lesions, classified as demyelinated or remyelinated based on signal intensity on proton density-weighted images, were subsequently assessed with histopathology. Remyelination occurred in 5 of 6 marmosets and 51% of lesions. Radiological-pathological comparison showed high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (90%) for detecting remyelination by in vivo MRI. This study demonstrates the prevalence of spontaneous remyelination in marmoset EAE and the ability of in vivo MRI to detect it, with implications for preclinical testing of pro-remyelinating agents and translation to clinical practice.

                As a regressive neurodevelopmental disorder with a well-established genetic cause, Rett Syndrome and its Mecp2 loss-of-function mouse model provide an excellent opportunity to define potentially translatable functional signatures of disease progression, as well as offer insight into Mecp2's role in functional circuit development. Thus, we applied optical fluorescence imaging to assess mesoscale calcium functional connectivity (FC) in the Mecp2 cortex prior to symptom onset as well as during decline. We found that FC was profoundly disrupted in Mecp2 males both in juvenile development and early adulthood. Female Mecp2 mice displayed a subtle homotopic contralateral increase in motor cortex as juveniles but not in adulthood, where instead parietal regions were implicated. Additionally, conditional rescue studies indicated FC phenotypes are driven by excitatory neurons. Altogether, the female results identify subtle candidate translatable biomarkers of disease progression, while the male results indicate MeCP2 protein is needed in a circuit-specific manner for FC.

                Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Separate lines of evidence suggest that synapses and astrocytes could play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying disease. Given that astrocytes make specialised contacts with some synapses, called tripartite synapses, we hypothesise that tripartite synapses could act as the fulcrum of ALS disease. We have performed an extensive microscopy-based analyses to investigate synapses and tripartite synapses in ALS mouse spinal cords. We reveal widescale synaptic changes at the early symptomatic stages of the SOD1G93a mouse models. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that large complex postsynaptic structures are lost in ALS mice. Most surprisingly, tripartite synapses are selectively lost in ALS while non-tripartite synapses remain in equal number to healthy controls. Finally, we also observe that human post-mortem spinal cords display a similar selective loss of tripartite synapses. From these data we conclude that tripartite synaptopathy is a key hallmark of ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parameter and model recovery of reinforcement learning models for restless bandit problems</a></h4>

              
                Multi-armed restless bandit tasks are regularly applied in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to assess exploration and exploitation behavior in structured environments. These models are also readily applied to examine effects of (virtual) brain lesions on performance, and to infer neurocomputational mechanisms using neuroimaging or pharmacological approaches. However, to infer individual, psychologically meaningful parameters from such data, computational cognitive modeling is typically applied. Recent studies indicate that softmax (SM) decision rule models that include a representation of environmental dynamics (e.g. the Kalman Filter) and additional parameters for modeling exploration and perseveration (Kalman SMEP) fit human bandit task data better than competing models. Parameter and model recovery are two central requirements for computational models: parameter recovery refers to the ability to recover true data-generating parameters; model recovery refers to the ability to correctly identify the true data generating model using model comparison techniques. Here we comprehensively examined parameter and model recovery of the Kalman SMEP model as well as nested model versions, i.e. models without the additional parameters, using simulation and Bayesian inference. Parameter recovery improved with increasing trial numbers, from around .8 for 100 trials to around .93 for 300 trials. Model recovery analyses likewise confirmed acceptable recovery of the Kalman SMEP model. Model recovery was lower for nested Kalman filter models as well as delta rule models with fixed learning rates. Exploratory analyses examined associations of model parameters with model-free performance metrics. Random exploration, captured by the inverse softmax temperature, was associated with lower accuracy and more switches. For the exploration bonus parameter modeling directed exploration, we confirmed an inverse- U-shaped association with accuracy, such that both an excess and a lack of directed exploration reduced accuracy. Taken together, these analyses underline that the Kalman SMEP model fulfills basic requirements of a cognitive model.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is characterized by inflammation and focal areas of demyelination, ultimately resulting in axonal degradation and neuronal loss. Several lines of evidence point towards a role for microglia and other brain macrophages in disease initiation and progression, but exactly how lesion formation is triggered is currently unknown. Here, we characterized early changes in MS brain tissue through transcriptomic analysis of normal appearing white matter (NAWM). We found that NAWM was characterized by enriched expression of genes associated with inflammation and cellular stress derived from brain macrophages. Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed an early stress response in brain macrophages in NAWM and identified specific macrophage subsets that associate with different stages of demyelinating lesions. These early changes associated with lesion development in MS brain tissue may provide therapeutic targets to limit lesion progression and demyelination.

                Abstract Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated genetic targeting of microglia remains challenging. Overcoming this hurdle is essential for the eradication of HIV reservoirs in the central nervous system (CNS) wherein microglia harbor the main HIV reservoirs. Here, we characterized the minimal/native promoter of the HexB gene, which is known to be specifically and stably expressed in the microglia under homeostasis and pathological conditions. Dual reporter and serial deletion assays identified the critical role of the natural 5' untranslated region (-97 bp related to the first ATG) in driving transcriptional activity of mouse HexB gene. The native promoter region of mouse, human and monkey HexB located at -135, -134 and -170 bp to the first ATG, respectively. These promoters were highly active and specific in the primary microglia with strong cross-species transcriptional activity, but had no activities in primary the astrocytes. To further exploit microglia specific promoters, we identified a 135 bp CD68 gene promoter, similar to 134 bp HexB gene, was highly active in microglia but not in astrocytes. These data suggest that the novel microglia-specific HexB promoter can be an ideal candidate for specific microglia-targeting AAV gene therapy, which could be developed for HIV proviral eradication in the CNS.

                The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has been reported to improve outcome in patients following ischemic stroke but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, utilizing a photothrombotic murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we show that imatinib-mediated inhibition of stroke-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction coincided with decreased expression of genes associated with inflammation and fibrosis in the cerebrovasculature. We found that imatinib effectively dampened stroke-induced reactive gliosis and myofibroblast transdifferentiation, whilst having very limited effect on the rest of the glia scar and on peripheral leukocyte infiltration. Further, our data suggest that consolidation of the PDGFR+ portion of the fibrotic scar in imatinib-treated mice contributes to the improvement in functional outcome compared to the vehicle controls, where the PDGFR+ scar is expanding. Comparison with human stroke transcriptome databases revealed significant overlap with imatinib-regulated genes, suggesting imatinib may modulate reactive gliosis and fibrotic scarring also in human stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-Term Inactivation of Sodium Channels as a Mechanism of Adaptation in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is involved in memory and spatial navigation. Many CA1 pyramidal cells function as place cells, increasing their firing rate when a specific place field is traversed. The dependence of CA1 place cell firing on position within the place field is asymmetric. We investigated the source of this asymmetry by injecting triangular depolarizing current ramps to approximate the spatially-tuned, temporally-diffuse depolarizing synaptic input received by these neurons while traversing a place field. Ramps were applied to rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro (slice electrophysiology) and in silico (multi-compartmental NEURON model). Under control conditions, CA1 neurons fired more action potentials at higher frequencies on the up-ramp versus the down-ramp. This effect was more pronounced for dendritic compared to somatic ramps. We incorporated a five-state Markov scheme for NaV1.6 channels into our model and calibrated the spatial dependence of long-term inactivation according to the literature; this spatial dependence was sufficient to explain the difference in dendritic versus somatic ramps. Long-term inactivation reduced the firing frequency by decreasing open-state occupancy, and reduced spike amplitude during trains by decreasing occupancy in closed states, which comprise the available pool. PKC activators like phorbol ester phorbol-dibutyrate (PDBu) are known to reduce NaV long-term inactivation. PDBu application removed spike amplitude attenuation during spike trains in vitro, more visibly in dendrites, consistent with decreased NaV long-term inactivation. Moreover, PDBu greatly reduced adaptation, consistent with our hypothesized mechanism. Our synergistic experimental/computational approach shows that long-term inactivation of NaV1.6 is the primary mechanism of adaptation in CA1 pyramidal cells.

                The feedback people receive on their behavior shapes the process of belief formation and self-efficacy in mastering a given task. The neural and computational mechanisms of how the subjective value of these beliefs and corresponding affect bias the learning process are yet unclear. Here we investigate this question during learning of self-efficacy beliefs using fMRI, pupillometry, computational modeling and individual differences in affective experience. Biases in the formation of self-efficacy beliefs were associated with affect, pupil dilation and neural activity within the anterior insula, amygdala, VTA/SN, and mPFC. Specifically, neural and pupil responses map the valence of the prediction errors in correspondence to the experienced affect and learning bias people show during belief formation. Together with the functional connectivity dynamics of the anterior insula within this network our results hint towards neural and computational mechanisms that integrate affect in the process of belief formation.

                Behavior arises from concerted activity throughout the brain. Consequently, a major focus of modern neuroscience is defining the physiology and behavioral roles of projection neurons linking different brain areas. Single-cell RNA sequencing has facilitated these efforts by revealing molecular determinants of cellular physiology and markers that enable genetically targeted perturbations such as optogenetics, but existing methods for sequencing of defined projection populations are low-throughput, painstaking, and costly. We developed a straightforward, multiplexed approach, Virally Encoded Connectivity Transgenic Overlay RNA sequencing (VECTORseq). VECTORseq repurposes commercial retrogradely infecting viruses typically used to express functional transgenes, e.g., recombinases and fluorescent proteins, by treating viral transgene mRNA as barcodes within single-cell datasets. VECTORseq is compatible with different viral families, resolves multiple populations with different projection targets in one sequencing run, and identifies cortical and subcortical excitatory and inhibitory projection populations. Our study provides a roadmap for high-throughput identification of neuronal subtypes based on connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Balancing memory fidelity and representational stability in the female mouse accessory olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems must balance the value of efficient coding schemes against the need to update specific memorized representations without perturbing other memories. Here we describe a unique solution to this challenge that is implemented by the vomeronasal system (VNS) to encode and remember multiple conspecific individuals as part of the Bruce Effect (BE). In the BE, exposure of a pregnant female mouse to the odors of an unfamiliar male leads to failure of the pregnancy (pregnancy block) via the VNS. Following mating and sensory exposure, however, the female becomes protected from a pregnancy block by the stud individual. While this form of natural learning has been proposed to depend on changes in the representation of his odors in her accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), a key VNS structure, there are no direct comparisons of in vivo sensory responses before and after imprinting. It has further been suggested that these changes simply render the AOB insensitive to stud odors. However, the combinatorial odor code used by the AOB and the significant overlap in the odor composition of different males means that silencing responses to one individual is likely to degrade responses to others, posing potential problems for more general sensory encoding. To identify the neuronal correlates of learning in the context of the BE, we recorded extracellular responses of AOB neurons in vivo in mated and unmated female mice upon controlled presentation of urinary chemosignals, including urine from both the stud and males of a distinct strain. We find that while initial sensory responses in the AOB (within a timescale required to guide social interactions) remain stable, responses to extended stimulation (as required for eliciting the pregnancy block) display selective attenuation of stud-responsive neurons. Based on our results, we propose a model that reconciles the formation of strong, selective memories with the need to sustain robust representational bandwidth by noting a distinction between the representations of brief and extended stimuli. This temporal disassociation allows attenuation of slow-acting endocrine processes in a stimulus-specific manner, without compromising consistent ongoing representations of stimuli that guide behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuomotor adaptation modulates the clustering of sleep spindles into trains</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles are thought to promote memory consolidation. Recently, we have shown that visuomotor adaptation (VMA) learning increases the density of spindles and promotes the coupling between spindles and slow oscillations, locally, with the level of spindle-SO synchrony predicting overnight memory retention. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the rhythmicity in spindle occurrence may also influence the stabilization of declarative and procedural memories. Here, we examined if VMA learning promotes the temporal organization of sleep spindles into trains. We found that VMA increased the proportion of spindles and spindle-SO couplings in trains. In agreement with our previous work, this modulation was observed over the contralateral hemisphere to the trained hand, and predicted overnight memory retention. Interestingly, spindles grouped in a cluster showed greater amplitude and duration than isolated spindles. The fact that these features increased as a function of train length, provides evidence supporting a biological advantage of this temporal arrangement. Our work opens the possibility that the periodicity of NREM oscillations may be relevant in the stabilization of procedural memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Offline memory replay in recurrent neuronal networks emerges from constraints on online dynamics</a></h4>

              
                During spatial exploration, neural circuits in the hippocampus store memories of sequences of sensory events encountered in the environment. When sensory information is absent during "offline" resting periods, brief neuronal population bursts can "replay" sequences of activity that resemble bouts of sensory experience. These sequences can occur in either forward or reverse order, and can even include spatial trajectories that have not been experienced, but are consistent with the topology of the environment. The neural circuit mechanisms underlying this variable and flexible sequence generation are unknown. Here we demonstrate in a recurrent spiking network model of hippocampal area CA3 that experimental constraints on network dynamics such as spike rate adaptation, population sparsity, stimulus selectivity, and rhythmicity enable additional emergent properties, including variable offline memory replay. In an online stimulus-driven state, we observed the emergence of neuronal sequences that swept from representations of past to future stimuli on the timescale of the theta rhythm. In an offline state driven only by noise, the network generated both forward and reverse neuronal sequences, and recapitulated the experimental observation that offline memory replay events tend to include salient locations like the site of a reward. These results demonstrate that biological constraints on the dynamics of recurrent neural circuits are sufficient to enable memories of sensory events stored in the strengths of synaptic connections to be flexibly read out during rest and sleep, which is thought to be important for memory consolidation and planning of future behavior.

                Despite the importance and versatility of linear mixed effects models (LME), they have seldom been used in whole brain imaging analyses due to the computational requirement. Here, we introduce a fast and efficient mixed-effects algorithm (FEMA) that makes whole brain voxelwise imaging LME analyses possible. We demonstrate the equivalency of statistical power and control of type I errors between FEMA and classical LME, whilst showing an order of magnitude improvement in the speed of FEMA compared to classical LME. By applying FEMA on diffusion images and resting state functional connectivity matrices from the ABCD StudySM release 4.0 data, we show voxelwise annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and functional connectomes in early adolescence, highlighting a critical time of establishing associations among cortical and subcortical regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term effects of network-based fMRI neurofeedback training for sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback allows for learning voluntary control over one's own brain activity, aiming to enhance cognition and clinical symptoms. A recent study improved sustained attention temporarily by training healthy participants to up-regulate the differential activity of the sustained attention network (SAN) minus the default mode network (DMN). However, long-term learning effects of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training remain under-explored. Here, we evaluate the effects of network-based fMRI neurofeedback training for sustained attention by assessing behavioral and brain measures before, one day after, and two months after training. The behavioral measures include task as well as questionnaire scores, and the brain measures include activity and connectivity during self-regulation runs without feedback (i.e., transfer runs) and during resting-state runs. Neurally, we found that participants maintained their ability to control the differential activity during follow-up sessions. In resting-state runs and only in the follow-up, we observed higher connectivity within the DMN and higher degree of functional connectivity (FC) in regions that were successfully trained. We also show evidence for effects of training in the salience network mediating the switch between anticorrelated networks (the DMN and part of the SAN). Also, the training-induced increase in FC between the DMN and occipital gyrus was maintained during follow-up transfer runs. In contrast, the training-induced increased FC between DMN and occipital gyrus was not observed during follow-up resting-state runs. Behaviorally, we found that enhanced sustained attention right after training returned to baseline level during follow-up. The discrepancy between lasting regulation-related brain changes but transient behavioral and resting-state effects raises the question of how neural changes induced by neurofeedback training translate to potential behavioral improvements. Since neurofeedback directly targets brain measures to indirectly improve behavior long-term, a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations during and after neurofeedback training is needed to develop its full potential as a promising scientific and clinical tool.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous emergence of music detectors in a deep neural network trained for natural sound recognition</a></h4>

              
                Music exists in almost every society, has universal acoustic features, and is processed by distinct neural circuits in humans even with no experience of musical training. These characteristics suggest an innateness of the sense of music in our brain, but it is unclear how this innateness emerges and what functions it has. Here, using an artificial deep neural network that models the auditory information processing of the brain, we show that units tuned to music can spontaneously emerge by learning natural sound detection, even without learning music. By simulating the responses of network units to 35,487 natural sounds in 527 categories, we found that various subclasses of music are strongly clustered in the embedding space, and that this clustering arises from the music-selective response of the network units. The music-selective units encoded the temporal structure of music in multiple timescales, following the population-level response characteristics observed in the brain. The process of generalization was critical for the emergence of music-selectivity, as such properties were absent when the label of the training data was randomized to prevent generalization. We confirmed that music-selectivity can work as a functional basis for the generalization of natural sound, thereby elucidating its origin. These findings suggest that our sense of music can be innate, universally shaped by evolutionary adaptation to process natural sound.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibiting adult neurogenesis differentially affects spatial learning in females and males</a></h4>

              
                Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in the spatial processing functions of the hippocampus but ablating neurogenesis does not consistently lead to behavioral deficits in spatial tasks. Parallel studies have shown that adult-born neurons also regulate behavioral responses to stressful and aversive stimuli. We therefore hypothesized that spatial functions of adult-born neurons may be more prominent under conditions of stress, and may differ between males and females given established sex differences in stress responding. To test this we trained intact and neurogenesis-deficient rats in the spatial water maze at temperatures that vary in their degree of aversiveness. At standard temperatures (25{degrees}C) ablating neurogenesis did not alter learning and memory in either sex, consistent with prior work. However, in cold water (16{degrees}C), ablating neurogenesis had divergent sex-dependent effects: relative to intact rats, male neurogenesis-deficient rats were slower to escape and female neurogenesis-deficient rats were faster. Neurogenesis promoted temperature-related changes in search strategy in females, but it promoted search strategy stability in males. Females displayed greater recruitment of the dorsal hippocampus than males, particularly at 16{degrees}C. However, blocking neurogenesis did not alter activity-dependent immediate-early gene expression in either sex. Finally, morphological analyses of retrovirally-labelled neurons revealed greater experience-dependent plasticity in new neurons in males. Neurons had comparable morphology in untrained rats but 16{degrees}C training increased spine density, and 25{degrees}C training caused shrinkage of mossy fiber presynaptic terminals, specifically in males. Collectively, these findings indicate that neurogenesis functions in memory are prominent under conditions of stress, they provide the first evidence for sex differences in the behavioral function of newborn neurons, and they suggest possibly distinct roles for neurogenesis in cognition and mental health in males and females.

                Adaptive behavior in real-world environments demands that choices integrate over several variables, including the novelty of the options under consideration, their expected value, and uncertainty in value estimation. We recorded neurons from the human pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate to probe how integration over decision variables occurs during decision-making. In contrast to the other areas, preSMA neurons not only represented separate pre-decision variables for each choice option, but also encoded an integrated utility signal and, subsequently, the decision itself. Conversely, post-decision related encoding of variables for the chosen option was more widely distributed and especially prominent in vmPFC. Our findings position the human preSMA as central to the implementation of value-based decisions.

                Studies of healthy brain aging have reported diffusivity patterns associated with white matter degeneration using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which assumes that diffusion measured at the typical b-value (approximately 1000 s/mm2) is Gaussian. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of DTI that measures non-Gaussian diffusion (kurtosis) to better capture microenvironmental changes by incorporating additional data at a higher b-value. In this study, using UK Biobank data (b values of 1000 and 2000 s/mm2), we investigate (1) the extent of novel information gained from adding diffusional kurtosis to diffusivity observations in aging, and (2) how conventional DTI metrics in aging compare with diffusivity metrics derived from DKI, which are corrected for kurtosis. We find a general pattern of lower kurtosis alongside higher diffusivity among older adults. We also find differences between diffusivity metrics derived from DTI and DKI, emphasizing the importance of accounting for non-Gaussian diffusion. This work highlights the utility of measuring diffusional kurtosis as a simple addition to conventional diffusion imaging of aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG microstate dynamics indicate a U-shaped path to propofol-induced loss of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                It is commonly believed that the stream of consciousness is not continuous but parsed into transient brain states manifesting themselves as discrete spatiotemporal patterns of global neuronal activity. Electroencephalographical (EEG) microstates are proposed as the neurophysiological correlates of these transiently stable brain states that last for fractions of seconds. To further understand the link between EEG microstate dynamics and consciousness, we continuously recorded high-density EEG in 23 surgical patients from their awake state to unconsciousness, induced by step-wise increasing concentrations of the intravenous anesthetic propofol. Besides the conventional parameters of microstate dynamics, we introduce a new method that estimates the complexity of microstate sequences. The brain activity under the surgical anesthesia showed a decreased sequence complexity of the stereotypical microstates, which became sparser and longer-lasting. However, we observed an initial increase in microstates' temporal dynamics and complexity with increasing depth of sedation leading to a distinctive U-shape that may be linked to the paradoxical excitation induced by moderate levels of propofol. Our results support the idea that the brain is in a metastable state under normal conditions, balancing between order and chaos in order to flexibly switch from one state to another. The temporal dynamics of EEG microstates indicate changes of this critical balance between stability and transition that lead to altered states of consciousness.

                Water restriction is commonly used to motivate rodents to perform behavioral tasks; however, its effects on hydration and stress hormone levels are unknown. Here, we report daily body weight and bi-weekly packed red blood cell volume and corticosterone in adult male rats across 80 days for three commonly used water restriction schedules. We also assessed renal adaptation to water restriction using post-mortem histological evaluation of renal medulla. A control group received ad libitum water. After one week of water restriction, rats on all restriction schedules resumed similar levels of growth relative to the control group. Nominal hydration was observed, and water restriction did not drive renal adaptation. An intermittent restriction schedule was associated with an increase in corticosterone relative to the control group. Our results suggest that the water restriction schedules used here will maintain welfare in rats. However, intermittent restriction evokes a stress response which could affect behavioral and neurobiological results. Our results also suggest that stable motivation in behavioral tasks may only be achieved after one week of restriction.

                The exact somatotopy of the human facial representation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) remains debated. One reason that progress has been hampered is due the methodological challenge of how to apply automated vibrotactile stimuli to face areas in a manner that is: 1) reliable despite different curvature depending on the face location; and 2) MR-compatible and free of MR-interference artefacts when applied in the MR head-coil. Here we overcame this challenge by using soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) technology. SPAs are made of a soft silicon material and can be in- or deflated by means of airflow, have a small diameter, and are flexible in structure, enabling good skin contact even on curved body surfaces (as on the face). Here, we aimed to provide a methodological advance by providing automated tactile vibration stimulation inside the head-coil of the MRI. As a sanity check, we first mapped the well-characterised S1 finger layout using this novel device. We found that tactile stimulation of the fingers elicited characteristic somatotopic finger activations in S1, validating the use of our SPA-setup to map somatotopic representations. Ultimately, we used the device to automatically and systematically deliver somatosensory stimulation to different face locations. We found that the forehead representation was least distance from the representation of the hand. Within the face representation, we found that the lip representation is most distant from the forehead representation, with the chin represented in between. Together our results show that, by providing vibrotactile stimulation using the SPA-technology, we are able to reveal clear somatotopic representational patterns.

                Converging evidence implicates disrupted brain connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the mechanisms linking altered connectivity early in development to the emergence of ASD symptomatology remain poorly understood. Here we examined whether atypicalities in the Salience Network (SN) -- an early-emerging neural network involved in orienting attention to the most salient aspects of one's internal and external environment -- may predict the development of ASD markers such as reduced social attention and atypical sensory processing. Six-week-old infants at high-risk for ASD exhibited stronger SN connectivity with sensorimotor regions; low-risk infants demonstrated stronger SN connectivity with prefrontal regions involved in social attention. Infants with higher connectivity with sensorimotor regions had lower connectivity with prefrontal regions, suggesting a direct tradeoff between attention to basic sensory versus socially-relevant information. Early alterations in SN connectivity predicted subsequent ASD symptomatology, providing a plausible mechanistic account for the unfolding of atypical developmental trajectories associated with ASD risk.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vivo MR spectroscopy reflects synapse density in a Huntington's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Background: Striatal medium spiny neurons are highly susceptible in Huntington's disease (HD), resulting in early synaptic perturbations that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), have been used in HD mouse models and patients with HD to monitor neurochemical changes associated with neuronal health. However, the molecular connection between brain neurochemical alterations and synaptic dysregulation is unknown, limiting our ability to monitor potential treatments that may affect synapse function. Objective: Assess the intersection of synapse density and 1H-MRS during disease progression in an HD mouse model. Methods: We conducted in vivo longitudinal 1H-MRS in the striatum followed by ex-vivo analyses of excitatory synapse density of two synaptic circuits disrupted in HD: thalamo-striatal (T-S) and cortico-striatal (C-S) pathways. We used the heterozygous knock-in zQ175 HD mouse model as well as zQ175 mice lacking one allele of CK2'(zQ175(Tg/0):CK2'(+/-)), a kinase previously shown to regulate synapse function in HD. Results: Longitudinal analyses of excitatory synapse density showed early and sustained reduction in T-S synapses in zQ175 mice, preceding C-S synapse depletion, which was rescued in zQ175:CK2'(+/-). Linear regression analyses showed C-S synapse number correlated with 1H-MRS-measured levels of GABA while T-S synapse number positively correlated with alterations in the levels of alanine, phosphoethanolamine, lactate, and taurine relative to total creatine. Conclusion: We propose these neurochemicals could be used as surrogate biomarkers to monitor circuit-specific synaptic dysfunction using 1H-MRS in the zQ175 mouse model and perhaps in HD pre-clinical studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">KIBRA-PKCγ signaling pathway modulates memory performance in mice and humans</a></h4>

              
                Human memory is a polygenic cognitive trait that is fundamental to individual competence. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified KIBRA as a novel gene associated with human memory performance. KIBRA interacts with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and proteins essential for synaptic plasticity. The deletion of Kibra in mice impairs synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. However, the molecular basis through which KIBRA regulates dynamic AMPAR trafficking underlying synaptic plasticity is still unknown. Here we report that KIBRA interacts with the neuronal specific kinase PKC{gamma} to modulate AMPAR trafficking upon learning, and KIBRA-PKC{gamma} signaling pathway also associates with human memory performance. We find PKC{gamma} is an essential kinase that phosphorylates AMPARs upon learning, and the loss of KIBRA in mouse brain impedes PKC{gamma}-AMPAR interaction. Activation of PKC{gamma} enables KIBRA to recruit phosphorylated AMPARs to the synapse to promote LTP and learning. We further performed transcriptomic and genetic analyses in human postmortem brain samples, and behavioral and fMRI evaluations in living human subjects, to demonstrate the genetic interactions between KIBRA and PRKCG on memory performance and memory associated physiological engagement of the hippocampal memory system. Overall, our results support that the KIBRA-PKC{gamma} signaling pathway is crucial for modulating memory performance in mice and humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spindle - slow oscillation coupling correlates with memory performance and connectivity changes in a hippocampal network after sleep</a></h4>

              
                After experiences are encoded, post-encoding reactivations during sleep have been proposed to mediate long-term memory consolidation. Spindle-slow oscillation coupling during NREM sleep is a candidate mechanism through which a hippocampal-cortical dialogue may strengthen a newly formed memory engram. Here, we investigated the role of fast spindle- and slow spindle-slow oscillation coupling in the consolidation of spatial memory in humans with a virtual water maze task involving allocentric and egocentric learning strategies. Furthermore, we analyzed how resting-state functional connectivity evolved across learning, consolidation, and retrieval of this task using a data-driven approach. Our results show task-related connectivity changes in the executive control network, the default mode network, and the hippocampal network at post-task rest. The hippocampal network could further be divided into two subnetworks of which only one showed modulation by sleep. Decreased functional connectivity in this subnetwork was associated with higher spindle-slow oscillation coupling power, which was also related to better memory performance at test. Overall, this study contributes to a more holistic understanding of the functional resting-state networks and the mechanisms during sleep associated to spatial memory consolidation.

	<p>Brain dopamine signaling is essential for the motivation to eat, and obesity is associated with altered dopaminergic signaling and increased food craving. We used molecular neuroimaging to explore whether striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability is associated with craving as measured with the General Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait (G-FCQ-T). We here show that humans with obesity (n = 34) experienced significantly more craving for food compared with lean subjects (n = 32), but food craving did not correlate significantly with striatal DAT availability as assessed with 123I-FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography. We conclude that food craving is increased in obesity, but the scores for food craving are not related to changes in striatal DAT availability.</p>

In an emerging scientific field, this technique has been used to explore the reaction of the body in different emotional conditions. However, among available studies, some inconsistencies appear. In this brief report, we want to show how a widely used experimental model, i.e., empathy for pain, allowed in several study to provide comprehensive understanding elements on the postural correlates of socioemotional information processing. In particular, the role of mental simulation is discussed.</p>

	<p>Outcomes following cochlear implantation vary widely for both adults and children, and behavioral tests are currently relied upon to assess this. However, these behavioral tests rely on subjective judgements that can be unreliable, particularly for infants and young children. The addition of an objective test of outcome following cochlear implantation is therefore desirable. The aim of this scoping review was to comprehensively catalogue the evidence for the potential of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to be used as a tool to objectively predict and measure cochlear implant outcomes. A scoping review of the literature was conducted following the PRISMA extension for scoping review framework. Searches were conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science electronic databases, with a hand search conducted in Google Scholar. Key terms relating to near infrared spectroscopy and cochlear implants were used to identify relevant publications. Eight records met the criteria for inclusion. Seven records reported on adult populations, with five records only including post-lingually deaf individuals and two including both pre- and post-lingually deaf individuals. Studies were either longitudinal or cross-sectional, and all studies compared fNIRS measurements with receptive speech outcomes. This review identified and collated key work in this field. The homogeneity of the populations studied so far identifies key gaps for future research, including the use of fNIRS in infants. By mapping the literature on this important topic, this review contributes knowledge towards the improvement of outcomes following cochlear implantation.</p>

	<p>The chronic irreversible regression of cognitive ability and memory function in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAND) is linked with late-stage HIV infection in the brain. The molecular-level signatures of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are linked with dysfunction in HAND patients. Protein expression changes and posttranslational modification are epigenetic cues for dementia and neurodegenerative disease. In this study quantitative proteome analysis was performed to comprehensively elucidate changes in protein profiles in HIV-positive (HIV+) human brains. Frontal and temporal lobes of normal and HIV+ brains were subjected to label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using the data-independent acquisition method. Comprehensive proteomic identification and quantification analysis revealed that 3294 total proteins and 251 proteins were differentially expressed in HIV+ brains; specifically, HIV+ frontal and temporal lobes had 132 and 119 differentially expressed proteins, respectively. Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses revealed protein alterations predominantly in the HIV+ frontal lobe region. The expression of GOLPH3, IMPDH2, DYNLL1, RPL11, and GPNMB proteins was significantly altered in HIV+ frontal lobes compared to that in normal brains. These proteins are associated with metabolic pathways, neurodegenerative disorders, and dementia. These proteomic-level changes may be potential biological markers and therapeutic targets to relieve the dementia-associated symptoms in individuals with HAND.</p>

	<p>Mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs), as the name suggests, are the membranes that physically and biochemically connect mitochondria with endoplasmic reticulum. MAMs not only structurally but also functionally connect these two important organelles within the cell which were previously thought to exist independently. There are multiple points of communication between ER–mitochondria and MAMs play an important role in both ER and mitochondria functions such as Ca2+ homeostasis, proteostasis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, movement, and mitophagy. The number of disease-related proteins and genes being associated with MAMs has been continually on the rise since its discovery. There is an overwhelming overlap between the biochemical functions of MAMs and processes affected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Thus, MAMs have received well-deserving and much delayed attention as modulators for ER–mitochondria communication and function. This review briefly discusses the recent progress made in this now fast developing field full of promise for very exciting future therapeutic discoveries.</p>

	<p>The objective of this pioneering study was to assess potentially neuroprotective properties of topiramate (TPM), a broad spectrum and newer-generation antiepileptic used against damage to synaptic endings of the temporal lobe neocortex in experimental hyperthermia-induced seizures (HS). TPM (80 mg/kg b.m.) was administered in young male Wistar rats with an intragastric tube before and immediately after HS. Specimens (1 mm3) collected from the neocortex, fixed via transcardial perfusion with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde solution, were routinely processed for transmission-electron microscopic study, i.e., for descriptive and morphometric analysis. The ultrastructure of neocortical neuropil components affected by hyperthermic stress showed distinct swelling of pre and post-synaptic axodendritic and axospinal endings, including total disintegration. Mitochondria were markedly damaged in synaptic structures. Axoplasm of presynaptic boutons contained a decreased number of synaptic vesicles. Synaptic junctions showed active zone-shortening. Preventive administration of TPM before HS induction demonstrated neuroprotective effects against synaptic damage in approximately 1/4 of these structures. Interestingly, beneficial effects on synapsis morphology were more common in perivascular zones close to well-preserved capillaries. They were demonstrated by smaller swelling of both presynaptic and postsynaptic parts, well-preserved mitochondria, an increased number and regular distribution of synaptic vesicles within axoplasm, and a significantly increased synaptic active zones. However, topiramate used directly after HS was ineffective in the prevention of hyperthermia-evoked synaptic injury. Our findings support the hypothesis that topiramate applied before HS can protect some neocortical synapses via the vascular factor by enhancing blood–brain barrier components and improving the blood supply of gray matter in the temporal lobe, which may be significant in febrile seizure-prevention in children.</p>

	<p>Background: Gliomas are among the most challenging pathologies for neurosurgeons due to their infiltrative and recurrent nature in functionally relevant regions. Current knowledge confirms that gross total resection highly influence survival in patient with glioma. However, surgery performed in eloquent brain area, could seriously compromise the quality of life in patient with reduced life expectancy even more if it concerns the language function. Methods: 18 right-handed patients with perisylvian gliomas on the left hemisphere were prospectively analyzed over a period of 12 months. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging based tractography of the five main language Tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus, Frontal Aslant Tract, Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, Uncinate Fasciculus) was navigated during the surgical procedure. Using a validated method, correlations were made between the pre-operative fascicles and their possible infiltration and surgical damage. The language status was assessed using the Aachen Aphasia Test. Results: In all nine patients who developed a permanent disorder there was pre-operative involvement of at least one fascicle and resection of at least one of these. In this way, areas of high risk of permanent language damage have emerged as a result of surgical injury: the temporoparietal junction, the middle portion of the FAT and the temporal stem. Conclusions: Navigated tractography has proven to be a user-friendly tool that can assess perioperative risk, guide surgical resection, and help the neurosurgeon to find that balance between tumor resection and function preservation.</p>

	<p>(1) Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of non-immersive virtual reality in reducing falls and improving balance in patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. (2) Methods: The following databases were searched: PUBMED, PEDro, Scielo, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dialnet, Scopus and MEDLINE. These databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published using relevant keywords in various combinations. The methodological quality of the articles was evaluated using the PEDro scale. (3) Results: A total of 10 studies with a total of 537 subjects, 58.7% of which (n = 315) were men, have been included in the review. The age of the participants in these studies ranged between 55 and 80 years. Each session lasted between 30 and 75 min, and the interventions lasted between 5 and 12 weeks. These studies showed that non-immersive virtual reality is effective in reducing the number of falls and improving both static and dynamic balance in patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Results after non-immersive virtual reality intervention showed an improvement in balance and a decrease in the number and the risk of falls. However, no significant differences were found between the intervention groups and the control groups for all the included studies regarding balance. (4) Conclusions: There is evidence that non-immersive virtual reality can improve balance and reduce the risk and number of falls, being therefore beneficial for people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.</p>

	<p>Patients with degenerative disc disease may suffer from chronic lumbar discogenic (DP) or radicular leg (RLP) pain. Minimally invasive DiscoGel therapy involves the percutaneous injection of an ethanol gel into the degenerated disk’s nucleus pulposus. This paper compares the 1-year outcome of such treatment in DP and RLP patients. We operated on 67 patients (49 men and 18 women) aged 20–68 years (mean age 46 ± 11 years) with DP (n = 45) and RLP (n = 22), of at least 6–8 weeks duration, with no adverse effects. We evaluated the treatment outcome with Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). A year after the ethanol gel injection, in the DP cohort, COMI and VAS dropped by 66% (6.40 vs. 2.20) and 53% (6.33 vs. 2.97), respectively. For the RLP patients, the corresponding values dropped 48% (7.05 vs. 3.68) and 54% (6.77 vs. 3.13). There were no differences between the cohorts in COMI and VAS at the follow-up end. Six months into the study, 74% of DP and 81% of RLP patients did not use any analgesics. Ethanol gel therapy can be effective for many patients. Moreover, its potential failure does not exclude surgical treatment options.</p>

	<p>Stereotactic biopsy of posterior fossa lesions is often regarded as hazardous due to the critical structures in that area. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of infratentorial stereotactic biopsy of brainstem or cerebellar lesions and its associations with other clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters. From January 2000 to May 2021, 190 infratentorial stereotactic biopsies of posterior fossa tumors, including 108 biopsies of brainstem lesions, were performed. Moreover, 63 supratentorial biopsies of cerebral peduncle lesions were analyzed to compare the safety and efficacy of both approaches. Additionally, the presence of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii and Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) were documented in 67 and 66 patients, respectively, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated in 114 patients. Only 4% of patients had minor complications and 1.5% had major complications, including one patient who died from intracranial bleeding. Nine (4.7%) biopsies were non-diagnostic. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status were assessed in 29 patients, and were non-diagnostic in only 3 (10.3%) cases. Patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG) were more frequently seropositive for T. gondii than individuals with low-grade gliomas (LGG; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). A total of 27% of HGG and 41% of LGG were non-enhancing on MRI. The infratentorial approach is generally safe and reliable for biopsy of brainstem and cerebellar lesions. In our study, the safety and efficacy of supratentorial biopsy of the cerebral peduncle and infratentorial biopsy of lesions below the cerebral peduncle were comparably high. Moreover, patients with HGG were more frequently seropositive for T. gondii than patients with LGG, and the relationship between toxoplasmosis and gliomagenesis requires further investigation.</p>

	<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most incapacitating pathologies, leading to huge rehabilitation challenges besides a social-economic burden on SCI patients and their families. There is no complete curative treatment available so far. Non-invasive and patient-friendly use of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field stimulation (EMF) has emerged as a therapeutic and rehabilitation option. In this study, we tested whole-body EMF stimulation on thoracic complete SCI-induced nociception including sensorimotor deficits in rats. The EMF application significantly attenuated hyperalgesia and allodynia to thermal, electrical, and chemical stimuli from 6 weeks onwards as well as restoration of spinal reflexes, viz., H-reflex and nociceptive flexion reflex at the study endpoint (week 8). Besides, massively increased glutamate at the SCI injury site was observed in SCI rats with no treatment, which was also attenuated significantly by EMF stimulation. Spinal cord histology of the injury area showed a decrease in lesion volume and glial population in the EMF-stimulated rats. These findings indicate the beneficial role of EMF stimulation after thoracic complete SCI in adult male rats and, thereby, a beneficial patient-friendly rehabilitation tool.</p>

	<p>Patients with severe hemiplegia along with knee instability require knee–ankle–foot orthoses (KAFOs) for gait training. However, in these patients, it is unclear which type of walking training is more effective to improve gait function. Providing alternate gait training (AGT) improves walking function in patients with spinal cord injury, but it is still unclear whether this is effective in hemiplegic stroke patients. In this study, we defined “unified AGT” as AGT performed with the same therapeutic concept by physiotherapists. We then investigated whether AGT improved gait function quicker than our traditional gait training in hemiplegic stroke patients. We enrolled 15 subjects with severe hemiplegia and knee instability who had undergone unified AGT using KAFOs with hinged oil dampers at the ankles, and 30 historical control (HC) subjects who had undergone traditional gait training. We used multiple comparison and survival analyses to analyze the differences in the functional independence measure (FIM) gait score changes between the two groups. The multiple comparison revealed a significant increase (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in the FIM gait score compared with its initial score in the subjects with unified AGT. However, this improvement was not seen in the HC subjects. Additionally, the survival analysis of time taken to recover revealed a significant difference between the subjects with unified AGT and HC subjects (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that unified AGT using a KAFO facilitates gait improvement in patients with severe hemiplegia and knee instability.</p>

	<p>Methods to improve drug delivery efficiency through blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) based on microbubbles and focused ultrasound (FUS) are continuously being studied. However, most studies are being conducted in preclinical trial environments using small animals. The use of the human skull shows differences between the clinical and preclinical trials. BBBD results from preclinical trials are difficult to represent in clinical trials because various distortions of ultrasound by the human skull are excluded in the former. Therefore, in our study, a clinical validation platform based on a preclinical trial environment, using a human skull fragment and a rat model, was developed to induce BBBD under conditions similar to clinical trials. For this, a human skull fragment was inserted between the rat head and a 250 kHz FUS transducer, and optimal ultrasound parameters for the free field (without human skull fragment) and human skull (with human skull fragment) were derived by 300 mVpp and 700 mVpp, respectively. BBBD was analyzed according to each case using magnetic resonance images, Evans blue dye, cavitation, and histology. Although it was confirmed using magnetic resonance images and Evans blue dye that a BBB opening was induced in each case, multiple BBB openings were observed in the brain tissues. This phenomenon was analyzed by numerical simulation, and it was confirmed to be due to standing waves owing to the small skull size of the rat model. The stable cavitation doses (SCDh and SCDu) in the human skull decreased by 13.6- and 5.3-fold, respectively, compared to those in the free field. Additionally, the inertial cavitation dose in the human skull decreased by 1.05-fold compared to that of the free field. For the histological analysis, although some extravasated red blood cells were observed in each case, it was evaluated as recoverable based on our previous study results. Therefore, our proposed platform can help deduct optimal ultrasound parameters and BBBD results for clinical trials in the preclinical trials with small animals because it considers variables relevant to the human skull.</p>

	<p>Developmental dyslexia is defined by reading impairments that are disproportionate to intelligence, motivation, and the educational opportunities considered necessary for reading. Its cause has traditionally been considered to be a phonological deficit, where people have difficulties with differentiating the sounds of spoken language. However, reading is a multidimensional skill and relies on various cognitive abilities. These may include high-level vision—the processes that support visual recognition despite innumerable image variations, such as in viewpoint, position, or size. According to our high-level visual dysfunction hypothesis, reading problems of some people with dyslexia can be a salient manifestation of a more general deficit of high-level vision. This paper provides a perspective on how such non-phonological impairments could, in some cases, cause dyslexia. To argue in favor of this hypothesis, we will discuss work on functional neuroimaging, structural imaging, electrophysiology, and behavior that provides evidence for a link between high-level visual impairment and dyslexia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Heterogeneity Shapes Patterns of Spiral Ganglion Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural response properties that typify primary sensory afferents are critical to fully appreciate because they establish and, ultimately represent, the fundamental coding design used for higher-level processing. Studies illuminating the center-surround receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells, for example, were ground-breaking because they determined the foundation of visual form detection. For the auditory system, a basic organizing principle of the spiral ganglion afferents is their extensive electrophysiological heterogeneity establishing diverse intrinsic firing properties in neurons throughout the spiral ganglion. Moreover, these neurons display an impressively large array of neurotransmitter receptor types that are responsive to efferent feedback. Thus, electrophysiological diversity and its neuromodulation are a fundamental encoding mechanism contributed by the primary afferents in the auditory system. To place these features into context, we evaluated the effects of hyperpolarization and cAMP on threshold level as indicators of overall afferent responsiveness in CBA/CaJ mice of either sex. Hyperpolarization modified threshold gradients such that distinct voltage protocols could shift the relationship between sensitivity and stimulus input to reshape resolution. This resulted in an "accordion effect" that appeared to stretch, compress, or maintain responsivity across the gradient of afferent thresholds. cAMP targeted threshold and kinetic shifts to rapidly adapting neurons, thus revealing multiple cochleotopic properties that could potentially be independently regulated. These examples of dynamic heterogeneity in primary auditory afferents not only have the capacity to shift the range, sensitivity, and resolution, but to do so in a coordinated manner that appears to orchestrate changes with a seemingly unlimited repertoire.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we discriminate the more nuanced qualities of the sound around us? Beyond the basics of pitch and loudness, aspects, such as pattern, distance, velocity, and location, are all attributes that must be used to encode acoustic sensations effectively. While higher-level processing is required for perception, it would not be unexpected if the primary auditory afferents optimized receptor input to expedite neural encoding. The findings reported herein are consistent with this design. Neuromodulation compressed, expanded, shifted, or realigned intrinsic electrophysiological heterogeneity to alter neuronal responses selectively and dynamically. This suggests that diverse spiral ganglion phenotypes provide a rich substrate to support an almost limitless array of coding strategies within the first neural element of the auditory pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Postnatal Sox6 Regulates Synaptic Function of Cortical Parvalbumin-Expressing Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical parvalbumin-expressing (Pvalb<sup>+</sup>) neurons provide robust inhibition to neighboring pyramidal neurons, crucial for the proper functioning of cortical networks. This class of inhibitory neurons undergoes extensive synaptic formation and maturation during the first weeks after birth and continue to dynamically maintain their synaptic output throughout adulthood. While several transcription factors, such as Nkx2-1, Lhx6, and Sox6, are known to be necessary for the differentiation of progenitors into Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons, which transcriptional programs underlie the postnatal maturation and maintenance of Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons' innervation and synaptic function remains largely unknown. Because Sox6 is continuously expressed in Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons until adulthood, we used conditional knock-out strategies to investigate its putative role in the postnatal maturation and synaptic function of cortical Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons in mice of both sexes. We found that early postnatal loss of Sox6 in Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons leads to failure of synaptic bouton growth, whereas later removal in mature Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons in the adult causes shrinkage of already established synaptic boutons. Paired recordings between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons and pyramidal neurons revealed reduced release probability and increased failure rate of Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons' synaptic output. Furthermore, Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons lacking Sox6 display reduced expression of full-length tropomyosin-receptor kinase B (TrkB), a key modulator of GABAergic transmission. Once re-expressed in neurons lacking Sox6, TrkB was sufficient to rescue the morphologic synaptic phenotype. Finally, we showed that Sox6 mRNA levels were increased by motor training. Our data thus suggest a constitutive role for Sox6 in the maintenance of synaptic output from Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons into adulthood.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cortical parvalbumin-expressing (Pvalb<sup>+</sup>) inhibitory neurons provide robust inhibition to neighboring pyramidal neurons, crucial for the proper functioning of cortical networks. These inhibitory neurons undergo extensive synaptic formation and maturation during the first weeks after birth and continue to dynamically maintain their synaptic output throughout adulthood. However, it remains largely unknown which transcriptional programs underlie the postnatal maturation and maintenance of Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons. Here, we show that the transcription factor Sox6 cell-autonomously regulates the synaptic maintenance and output of Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons until adulthood, leaving unaffected other maturational features of this neuronal population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">STK25 and MST3 Have Overlapping Roles to Regulate Rho GTPases during Cortical Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Precise control of neuronal migration is required for the laminar organization of the neocortex and critical for brain function. We previously reported that the acute disruption of the <I>Stk25</I> gene (<I>Stk25</I> conditional knock-out; cKO) during mouse embryogenesis causes anomalous neuronal migration in the neocortex, but paradoxically the <I>Stk25</I> cKO did not have a cortical phenotype, suggesting some forms of compensation exist. In this study, we report that MST3, another member of the GCKIII subgroup of the Ste20-like kinase family, compensates for loss of <I>Stk25</I> and vice versa with sex independent manner. MST3 overexpression rescued neuronal migration deficit and abnormal axonogenesis in <I>Stk25</I> cKO brains. Mechanistically, STK25 leads to Rac1 activation and reduced RhoA levels in the developing brain, both of which are required to fully restore neuronal migration in the <I>Stk25</I> cKO brain. Abnormal migration phenotypes are also rescued by overexpression of Bacurd1and Cul3, which target RhoA for degradation, and activate Rac1. This study reveals that MST3 upregulation is capable of rescuing acute <I>Stk25</I> deficiency and resolves details of signaling downstream STK25 required for corticogenesis both common to and distinct from MST3 signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Proper neuronal migration during cortical development is required for normal neuronal function. Here, we show that STK25 and MST3 kinases regulate neuronal migration and polarization in a mutually compensatory manner. Furthermore, STK25 balances Rac1 activity and RhoA level through forming complexes with &alpha;-PIX and &beta;-PIX, GTPase regulatory enzymes, and Cullin3-Bacurd1/Kctd13, a pair of RhoA ubiquitination molecules in a kinase activity-independent manner. Our findings demonstrate the importance of overlapping and unique roles of STK25 and MST3 to regulate Rho GTPase activities in cortical development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tonotopic Specializations in Number, Size, and Reversal Potential of GABAergic Inputs Fine-Tune Temporal Coding at Avian Cochlear Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABAergic inhibition in neurons plays a critical role in determining the output of neural circuits. Neurons in avian nucleus magnocellularis (NM) use several tonotopic-region-dependent specializations to relay the timing information of sound in the auditory nerve to higher auditory nuclei. Previously, we showed that feedforward GABAergic inhibition in NM has a different dependence on the level of auditory nerve activity, with the low-frequency region having a low-threshold and linear relationship, while the high-frequency region has a high-threshold and step-like relationship. However, it remains unclear how the GABAergic synapses are tonotopically regulated and interact with other specializations of NM neurons. In this study, we examined GABAergic transmission in the NM of chickens of both sexes and explored its contributions to the temporal coding of sound at each tonotopic region. We found that the number and size of unitary GABAergic currents and their reversal potential were finely tuned at each tonotopic region in the NM. At the lower-frequency region, unitary GABAergic currents were larger in number but smaller in size. In addition, their reversal potential was close to the resting potential of neurons, which enabled reliable inhibition despite the smaller potassium conductance. At the higher-frequency region, on the other hand, unitary GABAergic currents were fewer, larger, and highly depolarizing, which enabled powerful inhibition via activating the large potassium conductance. Thus, we propose that GABAergic synapses are coordinated with the characteristics of excitatory synapses and postsynaptic neurons, ensuring the temporal coding for wide frequency and intensity ranges.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found in avian cochlear nucleus that the number and size of unitary GABAergic inputs differed among tonotopic regions and correlated to respective excitatory inputs; it was larger in number but smaller in size for neurons tuned to lower-frequency sound. Furthermore, GABAergic reversal potential also differed among the regions in accordance with the size of Kv1 current; it was less depolarized in the lower-frequency neurons with smaller Kv1 current. These differentiations of GABAergic transmission maximized the effects of inhibition at each tonotopic region, ensuring precise and reliable temporal coding across frequencies and intensities. Our results emphasize the importance of optimizing characteristics of GABAergic transmission within individual neurons for proper neural circuit function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Increased Functional Connectivity of the Intraparietal Sulcus Underlies the Attenuation of Numerosity Estimations for Self-Generated Words</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous studies have shown that self-generated stimuli in auditory, visual, and somatosensory domains are attenuated, producing decreased behavioral and neural responses compared with the same stimuli that are externally generated. Yet, whether such attenuation also occurs for higher-level cognitive functions beyond sensorimotor processing remains unknown. In this study, we assessed whether cognitive functions such as numerosity estimations are subject to attenuation in 56 healthy participants (32 women). We designed a task allowing the controlled comparison of numerosity estimations for self-generated (active condition) and externally generated (passive condition) words. Our behavioral results showed a larger underestimation of self-generated compared with externally generated words, suggesting that numerosity estimations for self-generated words are attenuated. Moreover, the linear relationship between the reported and actual number of words was stronger for self-generated words, although the ability to track errors about numerosity estimations was similar across conditions. Neuroimaging results revealed that numerosity underestimation involved increased functional connectivity between the right intraparietal sulcus and an extended network (bilateral supplementary motor area, left inferior parietal lobule, and left superior temporal gyrus) when estimating the number of self-generated versus externally generated words. We interpret our results in light of two models of attenuation and discuss their perceptual versus cognitive origins.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We perceive sensory events as less intense when they are self-generated compared with when they are externally generated. This phenomenon, called attenuation, enables us to distinguish sensory events from self and external origins. Here, we designed a novel fMRI paradigm to assess whether cognitive processes such as numerosity estimations are also subject to attenuation. When asking participants to estimate the number of words they had generated or passively heard, we found bigger underestimation in the former case, providing behavioral evidence of attenuation. Attenuation was associated with increased functional connectivity of the intraparietal sulcus, a region involved in numerosity processing. Together, our results indicate that the attenuation of self-generated stimuli is not limited to sensory consequences but is also impact cognitive processes such as numerosity estimations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Trial-to-Trial Variability of Spiking Delay Activity in Prefrontal Cortex Constrains Burst-Coding Models of Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>A hallmark neuronal correlate of working memory (WM) is stimulus-selective spiking activity of neurons in PFC during mnemonic delays. These observations have motivated an influential computational modeling framework in which WM is supported by persistent activity. Recently, this framework has been challenged by arguments that observed persistent activity may be an artifact of trial-averaging, which potentially masks high variability of delay activity at the single-trial level. In an alternative scenario, WM delay activity could be encoded in bursts of selective neuronal firing which occur intermittently across trials. However, this alternative proposal has not been tested on single-neuron spike-train data. Here, we developed a framework for addressing this issue by characterizing the trial-to-trial variability of neuronal spiking quantified by Fano factor (FF). By building a doubly stochastic Poisson spiking model, we first demonstrated that the burst-coding proposal implies a significant increase in FF positively correlated with firing rate, and thus loss of stability across trials during the delay. Simulation of spiking cortical circuit WM models further confirmed that FF is a sensitive measure that can well dissociate distinct WM mechanisms. We then tested these predictions on datasets of single-neuron recordings from macaque PFC during three WM tasks. In sharp contrast to the burst-coding model predictions, we only found a small fraction of neurons showing increased WM-dependent burstiness, and stability across trials during delay was strengthened in empirical data. Therefore, reduced trial-to-trial variability during delay provides strong constraints on the contribution of single-neuron intermittent bursting to WM maintenance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> There are diverging classes of theoretical models explaining how information is maintained in working memory by cortical circuits. In an influential model class, neurons exhibit persistent elevated memorandum-selective firing, whereas a recently developed class of burst-coding models suggests that persistent activity is an artifact of trial-averaging, and spiking is sparse in each single trial, subserved by brief intermittent bursts. However, this alternative picture has not been characterized or tested on empirical spike-train data. Here we combine mathematical analysis, computational model simulation, and experimental data analysis to test empirically these two classes of models and show that the trial-to-trial variability of empirical spike trains is not consistent with burst coding. These findings provide constraints for theoretical models of working memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Generalizable EEG Encoding Models with Naturalistic Audiovisual Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                <p>In natural conversations, listeners must attend to what others are saying while ignoring extraneous background sounds. Recent studies have used encoding models to predict electroencephalography (EEG) responses to speech in noise-free listening situations, sometimes referred to as "speech tracking." Researchers have analyzed how speech tracking changes with different types of background noise. It is unclear, however, whether neural responses from acoustically rich, naturalistic environments with and without background noise can be generalized to more controlled stimuli. If encoding models for acoustically rich, naturalistic stimuli are generalizable to other tasks, this could aid in data collection from populations of individuals who may not tolerate listening to more controlled and less engaging stimuli for long periods of time. We recorded noninvasive scalp EEG while 17 human participants (8 male/9 female) listened to speech without noise and audiovisual speech stimuli containing overlapping speakers and background sounds. We fit multivariate temporal receptive field encoding models to predict EEG responses to pitch, the acoustic envelope, phonological features, and visual cues in both stimulus conditions. Our results suggested that neural responses to naturalistic stimuli were generalizable to more controlled datasets. EEG responses to speech in isolation were predicted accurately using phonological features alone, while responses to speech in a rich acoustic background were more accurate when including both phonological and acoustic features. Our findings suggest that naturalistic audiovisual stimuli can be used to measure receptive fields that are comparable and generalizable to more controlled audio-only stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding spoken language in natural environments requires listeners to parse acoustic and linguistic information in the presence of other distracting stimuli. However, most studies of auditory processing rely on highly controlled stimuli with no background noise, or with background noise inserted at specific times. Here, we compare models where EEG data are predicted based on a combination of acoustic, phonetic, and visual features in highly disparate stimuli&mdash;sentences from a speech corpus and speech embedded within movie trailers. We show that modeling neural responses to highly noisy, audiovisual movies can uncover tuning for acoustic and phonetic information that generalizes to simpler stimuli typically used in sensory neuroscience experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Neurocomputational Model for Intrinsic Reward</a></h4>

              
                <p>Standard economic indicators provide an incomplete picture of what we value both as individuals and as a society. Furthermore, canonical macroeconomic measures, such as GDP, do not account for non-market activities (e.g., cooking, childcare) that nevertheless impact well-being. Here, we introduce a computational tool that measures the affective value of experiences (e.g., playing a musical instrument without errors). We go on to validate this tool with neural data, using fMRI to measure neural activity in male and female human subjects performing a reinforcement learning task that incorporated periodic ratings of subjective affective state. Learning performance determined level of payment (i.e., extrinsic reward). Crucially, the task also incorporated a skilled performance component (i.e., intrinsic reward) which did not influence payment. Both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards influenced affective dynamics, and their relative influence could be captured in our computational model. Individuals for whom intrinsic rewards had a greater influence on affective state than extrinsic rewards had greater ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity for intrinsic than extrinsic rewards. Thus, we show that computational modeling of affective dynamics can index the subjective value of intrinsic relative to extrinsic rewards, a "computational hedonometer" that reflects both behavior and neural activity that quantifies the affective value of experience.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traditional economic indicators are increasingly recognized to provide an incomplete picture of what we value as a society. Standard economic approaches struggle to accurately assign values to non-market activities that nevertheless may be intrinsically rewarding, prompting a need for new tools to measure what really matters to individuals. Using a combination of neuroimaging and computational modeling, we show that despite their lack of instrumental value, intrinsic rewards influence subjective affective state and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity. The relative degree to which extrinsic and intrinsic rewards influence affective state is predictive of their relative impacts on neural activity, confirming the utility of our approach for measuring the affective value of experiences and other non-market activities in individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cognitive and Neural State Dynamics of Narrative Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                <p>Narrative comprehension involves a constant interplay of the accumulation of incoming events and their integration into a coherent structure. This study characterizes cognitive states during narrative comprehension and the network-level reconfiguration occurring dynamically in the functional brain. We presented movie clips of temporally scrambled sequences to human participants (male and female), eliciting fluctuations in the subjective feeling of comprehension. Comprehension occurred when processing events that were highly causally related to the previous events, suggesting that comprehension entails the integration of narratives into a causally coherent structure. The functional neuroimaging results demonstrated that the integrated and efficient brain state emerged during the moments of narrative integration with the increased level of activation and across-modular connections in the default mode network. Underlying brain states were synchronized across individuals when comprehending novel narratives, with increased occurrences of the default mode network state, integrated with sensory processing network, during narrative integration. A model based on time-resolved functional brain connectivity predicted changing cognitive states related to comprehension that are general across narratives. Together, these results support adaptive reconfiguration and interaction of the functional brain networks on causal integration of the narratives.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human brain can integrate temporally disconnected pieces of information into coherent narratives. However, the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of how the brain builds a narrative representation remain largely unknown. We showed that comprehension occurs as the causally related events are integrated to form a coherent situational model. Using fMRI, we revealed that the large-scale brain states and interaction between brain regions dynamically reconfigure as comprehension evolves, with the default mode network playing a central role during moments of narrative integration. Overall, the study demonstrates that narrative comprehension occurs through a dynamic process of information accumulation and causal integration, supported by the time-varying reconfiguration and brain network interaction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms Underlying the Selective Therapeutic Efficacy of Carbamazepine for Attenuation of Trigeminal Nerve Injury Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Different peripheral nerve injuries cause neuropathic pain through distinct mechanisms. Even the site of injury may impact underlying mechanisms, as indicated by the clinical finding that the antiseizure drug carbamazepine (CBZ) relieves pain because of compression injuries of trigeminal but not somatic nerves. We leveraged this observation in the present study hypothesizing that because CBZ blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), its therapeutic selectivity reflects differences between trigeminal and somatic nerves with respect to injury-induced changes in VGSCs. CBZ diminished ongoing and evoked pain behavior in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the infraorbital nerve (ION) but had minimal effect in rats with sciatic nerve CCI. This difference in behavior was associated with a selective increase in the potency of CBZ-induced inhibition of compound action potentials in the ION, an effect mirrored in human trigeminal versus somatic nerves. The increase in potency was associated with a selective increase in the efficacy of the Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 channel blocker ICA-121431 and Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 protein in the ION, but no change in Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 mRNA in trigeminal ganglia. Importantly, local ICA-121431 administration reversed ION CCI-induced hypersensitivity. Our results suggest a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of trigeminal neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study is based on evidence of differences in pain and its treatment depending on whether the pain is above (trigeminal) or below (somatic) the neck, as well as evidence that voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) may contribute to these differences. The focus of the present study was on channels underlying action potential propagation in peripheral nerves. There were differences between somatic and trigeminal nerves in VGSC subtypes underlying action potential propagation both in the absence and presence of injury. Importantly, because the local block of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 in the trigeminal nerve reverses nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, the selective upregulation of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 in trigeminal nerves suggests a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of pain associated with trigeminal nerve injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Addiction-Associated Genetic Variants Implicate Brain Cell Type- and Region-Specific Cis-Regulatory Elements in Addiction Neurobiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent large genome-wide association studies have identified multiple confident risk loci linked to addiction-associated behavioral traits. Most genetic variants linked to addiction-associated traits lie in noncoding regions of the genome, likely disrupting <I>cis</I>-regulatory element (CRE) function. CREs tend to be highly cell type-specific and may contribute to the functional development of the neural circuits underlying addiction. Yet, a systematic approach for predicting the impact of risk variants on the CREs of specific cell populations is lacking. To dissect the cell types and brain regions underlying addiction-associated traits, we applied stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression to compare genome-wide association studies to genomic regions collected from human and mouse assays for open chromatin, which is associated with CRE activity. We found enrichment of addiction-associated variants in putative CREs marked by open chromatin in neuronal (NeuN<sup>+</sup>) nuclei collected from multiple prefrontal cortical areas and striatal regions known to play major roles in reward and addiction. To further dissect the cell type-specific basis of addiction-associated traits, we also identified enrichments in human orthologs of open chromatin regions of female and male mouse neuronal subtypes: cortical excitatory, D1, D2, and PV. Last, we developed machine learning models to predict mouse cell type-specific open chromatin, enabling us to further categorize human NeuN<sup>+</sup> open chromatin regions into cortical excitatory or striatal D1 and D2 neurons and predict the functional impact of addiction-associated genetic variants. Our results suggest that different neuronal subtypes within the reward system play distinct roles in the variety of traits that contribute to addiction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We combine statistical genetic and machine learning techniques to find that the predisposition to for nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use behaviors can be partially explained by genetic variants in conserved regulatory elements within specific brain regions and neuronal subtypes of the reward system. Our computational framework can flexibly integrate open chromatin data across species to screen for putative causal variants in a cell type- and tissue-specific manner for numerous complex traits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CDKL5 Deficiency Augments Inhibitory Input into the Dentate Gyrus That Can Be Reversed by Deep Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic behaviors. Although loss of CDKL5 affects a number of molecular pathways, very little has been discovered about the physiological effects of these changes on the neural circuitry. We therefore studied synaptic plasticity and local circuit activity in the dentate gyrus of both <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>&ndash;/<I>y</I></sup> and <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mutant mice. We found that CDKL5 haploinsufficiency in both male and female mice impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in multiple tasks. <I>In vivo</I>, loss of CDKL5 reduced LTP of the perforant path to the dentate gyrus and augmented feedforward inhibition in this pathway; <I>ex vivo</I> experiments confirmed that excitatory/inhibitory input into the dentate gyrus is skewed toward inhibition. Injecting the GABAergic antagonist gabazine into the dentate improved contextual fear memory in <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>&ndash;/<I>y</I></sup> mice. Finally, chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 is important for maintaining proper dentate excitatory/inhibitory balance, with consequences for hippocampal memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder. Although CDKL5 deficiency has been found to affect a number of molecular pathways, little is known about its physiological effects on the neural circuitry.

Chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice, as it had previously done with Rett syndrome mice, suggesting that such stimulation may be useful for other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Slo2/KNa Channels in Drosophila Protect against Spontaneous and Induced Seizure-like Behavior Associated with an Increased Persistent Na+ Current</a></h4>

              
                <p>Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity is a unique feature of Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (K<SUB>Na</SUB>) channels, making them naturally suited to counter a sudden influx in Na<sup>+</sup> ions. As such, it has long been suggested that K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels may serve a protective function against excessive excitation associated with neuronal injury and disease. This hypothesis, however, has remained largely untested. Here, we examine K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels encoded by the <I>Drosophila Slo2</I> (<I>dSlo2</I>) gene in males and females. We show that dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels are selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons in the adult brain, as well as in glutamatergic motor neurons, where dampening excitation may function to inhibit global hyperactivity and seizure-like behavior. Indeed, we show that effects of feeding <I>Drosophila</I> a cholinergic agonist are exacerbated by the loss of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels. Similar to mammalian Slo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels, we show that dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels encode a TTX-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> conductance, indicating that dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels can be activated by Na<sup>+</sup> carried by voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels. We then tested the role of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels in established genetic seizure models in which the voltage-dependent persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current (I<SUB>Nap</SUB>) is elevated. We show that the absence of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels increased susceptibility to mechanically induced seizure-like behavior. Similar results were observed in WT flies treated with veratridine, an enhancer of I<SUB>Nap</SUB>. Finally, we show that loss of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels in both genetic and pharmacologically primed seizure models resulted in the appearance of spontaneous seizures. Together, our results support a model in which dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels, activated by neuronal overexcitation, contribute to a protective threshold to suppress the induction of seizure-like activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Slo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels are unique in that they constitute a repolarizing K<sup>+</sup> pore that is activated by the depolarizing Na<sup>+</sup> ion, making them naturally suited to function as a protective "brake" against overexcitation and Na<sup>+</sup> overload. Here, we test this hypothesis <I>in vivo</I> by examining how a null mutation of the <I>Drosophila Slo2</I> (<I>dSlo2</I>)/<I>K<SUB>Na</SUB></I> gene affects seizure-like behavior in genetic and pharmacological models of epilepsy. We show that indeed the loss of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels results in increased incidence and severity of induced seizure behavior, as well as the appearance of spontaneous seizure activity. Our results advance our understanding of neuronal excitability and protective mechanisms that preserve normal physiology and the suppression of seizure susceptibility.</p>

                Background: Natural products with antibacterial potential have begun to be tested on biofilm models, bringing us closer to understanding the response generated by the complex microbial ecosystems of the oral cavity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic activities and chemical compositions of Peruvian propolis in an in vitro biofilm of Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Methods: The experimental work involved a consecutive, in vitro, longitudinal, and double-blinded study design. Propolis samples were collected from 13 different regions of the Peruvian Andes. The disk diffusion method was used for the antimicrobial susceptibility test. The cytotoxic effect of propolis on human gingival fibroblasts was determined by cell viability method using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the effect of propolis on the biofilm was evaluated by confocal microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The 0.78 mg/mL and 1.563 mg/mL concentrations of the methanolic fraction of the chloroform residue of Oxapampa propolis showed effects on biofilm thickness and the copy numbers of the srtA gene of S. gordonii and the radD gene of F. nucleatum at 48 and 120 hours, and chromatography (UV, λ 280 nm) identified rhamnocitrin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, kaempferol, diosmetin, acacetin, glycerol, and chrysoeriol. Conclusions: Of the 13 propolis evaluated, it was found that only the methanolic fraction of Oxapampa propolis showed antibacterial and antibiofilm effects without causing damage to human gingival fibroblasts. Likewise, when evaluating the chemical composition of this fraction, eight flavonoids were identified.

                Background: Orofacial myofunctional therapy (OMT), for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is emerging with recognition of specific phenotypes. Since many OSA sufferers are already familiar with positive airway pressure machines, we designed an OMT protocol involving the modification of such a machine to deliver negative airway pressure.  We hypothesized that a three-month trial of using this protocol while awake would reduce the signs and symptoms of OSA. Methods: Fifteen adults with OSA enrolled for 30-minute sessions/three days a week for a three-month trial of “upper airway muscle physical therapy” while awake. Overnight sleep studies were performed before and after the intervention to determine each subject’s apnea hypopnea index (AHI), the primary outcome measure. Negative airway pressure application was determined by estimation of each subject’s one-repetition maximum (an exercise physiology measure of strength capacity). Exercise sessions consisted of subjects breathing against this pressure for a series of repetitions, and sets. Results: While the mean post study AHI was slightly improved (-4.3 ± 12.0 [ -10.9, 2.3], mean ± standard deviation, 95% confidence interval), it was not statistically significant.  The results were similar when the AHI was divided by the sleep state (REM vs. non-REM).  The nadir saturation was also essentially unchanged. The eight subjects with mild or moderate OSA (AHI < 30) showed similar results. Conclusions: Though there was no significant reduction in AHI in this small cohort, the methods elucidate a new daytime use for a machine with which many OSA sufferers are familiar. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02109731 (registered on April 10th 2015)

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to learn dexterous motor skills is a fundamental aspect of human behavior. However, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms for dexterous skill learning are unclear. Advancing our understanding of motor skill learning requires the integration of modern neuroscientific techniques with a rigorously characterized dexterous task. The development of automated rodent skilled reaching with paw tracking allows detailed analysis of how reach-to-grasp kinematics evolve during learning. We assessed how both "gross" forelimb and "fine" digit kinematics changed as rats learned skilled reaching. Rats whose success rates increased (learners) consistently reduced the variability in their reach trajectories. Refinement of fine digit control generally continued after consistency in gross hand transport to the pellet plateaued. Interestingly, most rats whose success rates did not increase (non-learners) also converged on consistent reach kinematics. Some non-learners, however, maintained substantial variability in hand and digit trajectories throughout training. These results suggest that gross and fine motor components of dexterous skill are, on average, learned over different timescales. Nonetheless, there is significant intersubject variability in learning rates as assessed by both reaching success and consistency of reach kinematics.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Frustrative nonreward (FN) is a construct in the Negative Valence Systems domain of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) from the National Institute of Mental Health. An organism&rsquo;s response to frustrating situations (e.g., inability to obtain an expected reward) has broad implications for a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders. The current project developed a first of its kind rat operant behavioral model of FN based loosely on the human Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). The current study shows that individual differences in FN for sucrose pellets are consistent across sessions at baseline and that the task is sensitive to reward size in male rats. More importantly, high FN behavior for sucrose predicts early "breaking" for intravenous fentanyl self-administration under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. These results solidify frustration/ FN as an important factor for substance use disorders in addition to craving, impulsivity, and habit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical use of antiviral, antibiotic and immunomodulatory drugs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study in Bandung, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evidence of highly effective repurposed drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is insufficient. However, empirical therapy using antiviral, antibiotic and immunomodulatory drugs is massive. Studies evaluating the clinical use of these drugs in Indonesia are sparse. Methods: We performed a retrospective study using medical records of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from July 2020 to March 2021 in Bandung, Indonesia. Data were collected at relevant timelines: age, sex, comorbid condition, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and hematology at admission; antiviral, antibiotic, and immunomodulator treatment during hospitalization; length of stay hospitalization (LOS) and death at discharge. Clinical use of the drug regimens included dose, frequency, and duration of therapy. The main outcome of hospitalization care was LOS and death. Results: Out of 249 patients, 43.3% had a comorbid condition, 74.7% had non-severe COVID-19 (SpO2 ≥ 90%), and almost all received antiviral or antibiotic agents. Remdesivir was the most frequent drug composing various antiviral regimens. Patients receiving a combination of remdesivir and favipiravir had lower SpO2 compared to those receiving oseltamivir (p=0.01). The short LOS was associated with remdesivir alone (p=0.03), the combination of favipiravir and oseltamivir (p=0.01), and the combination of intravenous levofloxacin and ceftriaxone (p<0.0001). Immunomodulatory drugs (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, tocilizumab) were used in 47.1% of patients with low SpO2 (p=0.001). Its use was associated with prolonged LOS (p=0.0043). The increased risk of death in patients treated with the combination of remdesivir and favipiravir (OR 4.1;95%CI 1.4-12.2), and immunomodulatory drugs (OR 6.2; 95%CI 1.7-23.3) was confounded by the baseline characteristics of older age, comorbid condition, SpO2 level, and low lymphocyte number. Conclusions: Some treatment regimens were associated with short LOS, but there were drug regimens which might increase the risk of death. Further study should control the clinical conditions of COVID-19 patients at admission to confirm the outcome of death following drug therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The network structure affects the fixation probability when it couples to the birth-death dynamics in finite population</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Ali Dehghani, Amir Hossein Darooneh, Mohammad Kohandel</p>

The study of evolutionary dynamics on graphs is an interesting topic for researchers in various fields of science and mathematics. In systems with finite population, different model dynamics are distinguished by their effects on two important quantities: fixation probability and fixation time. The isothermal theorem declares that the fixation probability is the same for a wide range of graphs and it only depends on the population size. This has also been proved for more complex graphs that are called complex networks. In this work, we propose a model that couples the population dynamics to the network structure and show that in this case, the isothermal theorem is being violated. In our model the death rate of a mutant depends on its number of neighbors, and neutral drift holds only in the average. We investigate the fixation probability behavior in terms of the complexity parameter, such as the scale-free exponent for the scale-free network and the rewiring probability for the small-world network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Determining travel fluxes in epidemic areas</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daipeng Chen, Yuyi Xue, Yanni Xiao</p>

Infectious diseases attack humans from time to time and threaten the lives and survival of people all around the world. An important strategy to prevent the spatial spread of infectious diseases is to restrict population travel. With the reduction of the epidemic situation, when and where travel restrictions can be lifted, and how to organize orderly movement patterns become critical and fall within the scope of this study. We define a novel diffusion distance derived from the estimated mobility network, based on which we provide a general model to describe the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases with a random diffusion process and a deterministic drift process of the population. We consequently develop a multi-source data fusion method to determine the population flow in epidemic areas. In this method, we first select available subregions in epidemic areas, and then provide solutions to initiate new travel flux among these subregions. To verify our model and method, we analyze the multi-source data from mainland China and obtain a new travel flux triggering scheme in the selected 29 cities with the most active population movements in mainland China. The testable predictions in these selected cities show that reopening the borders in accordance with our proposed travel flux will not cause a second outbreak of COVID-19 in these cities. The finding provides a methodology of re-triggering travel flux during the weakening spread stage of the epidemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial heterogeneity enhance robustness of large multi-species ecosystems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susanne Pettersson, Martin Nilsson Jacobi</p>

Understanding ecosystem stability and functioning is a long-standing goal in theoretical ecology, with one of the main tools being dynamical modelling of species abundances. With the help of spatially unresolved (well-mixed) population models and equilibrium dynamics, limits to stability and regions of various ecosystem robustness have been extensively mapped in terms of diversity (number of species), types of interactions, interaction strengths, varying interaction networks (for example plant-pollinator, food-web) and varying structures of these networks. Although many insights have been gained, the impact of spatial extension is not included in this body of knowledge. Recent studies of spatially explicit modelling on the other hand have shown that stability limits can be crossed and diversity increased for systems with spatial heterogeneity in species interactions and/or chaotic dynamics. Here we show that such crossing and diversity increase can appear under less strict conditions. We find that the mere possibility of varying species abundances at different spatial locations make possible the preservation or increase in diversity across previous boundaries thought to mark catastrophic transitions. In addition, we introduce and make explicit a multitude of different dynamics a spatially extended complex system can use to stabilise. This expanded stabilising repertoire of dynamics is largest at intermediate levels of dispersal. Thus we find that spatially extended systems with intermediate dispersal are more robust, in general have higher diversity and can stabilise beyond previous stability boundaries, in contrast to well-mixed systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A phylogenomic framework for charting the diversity and evolution of giant viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frank O. Aylward, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, Anh D. Ha, Eugene V. Koonin</p>

Large DNA viruses of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota have recently emerged as important members of ecosystems around the globe that challenge traditional views of viral complexity. Numerous members of this phylum that cannot be classified within established families have recently been reported, and there is presently a strong need for a robust phylogenomic and taxonomic framework for these viruses. Here, we report a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of the Nucleocytoviricota, present a set of giant virus orthologous groups (GVOGs) together with a benchmarked reference phylogeny, and delineate a hierarchical taxonomy within this phylum. We show that the majority of Nucleocytoviricota diversity can be partitioned into 6 orders, 32 families, and 344 genera, substantially expanding the number of currently recognized taxonomic ranks for these viruses. We integrate our results within a taxonomy that has been adopted for all viruses to establish a unifying framework for the study of Nucleocytoviricota diversity, evolution, and environmental distribution.

                Background COVID-19 has drastically dampened human activities since early 2020. Studies have shown that this has resulted in changes in air temperature and humidity. Since lightning activities are dependent on air temperature and humidity, this study is conducted to evaluate the correlation between the intensity of lightning activities with the atmospheric changes, and investigates the changes, in lightning activities due to atmospheric changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The hypothesis was tested through a t-test and Pearson’s correlation study. The variation trend of lightning strikes count (LSC) in Europe and Oceania during the five months COVID-19 lockdown period (March – July) compared to the same period in the previous five years from 2015 to 2019 is investigated. Results Statistical analysis shows the LSC in Europe and Oceania during the lockdown period dropped significantly by more than 50% and 44% respectively compared to the same period in previous five years. Furthermore, LSC was found to be positively correlated with air temperature and relative humidity in Europe. However, in Oceania, LSC seems to be only positively correlated with air temperature but negatively correlated with relative humidity. Conclusions This study seems to suggest that lightning activities have significantly changed during this pandemic due to reduction in human activities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the data access control using blockchain for healthcare domain [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Unauthorized access to data is one of the most significant privacy issues that hinder most industries from adopting big data technologies. Even though specific processes and structures have been put in place to deal with access authorization and identity management for large databases nonetheless, the scalability criteria are far beyond the capabilities of traditional databases. Hence, most researchers are looking into other solutions, such as big data management. Methods: In this paper, we firstly study the strengths and weaknesses of implementing cryptography and blockchain for identity management and authorization control in big data, focusing on the healthcare domain. Subsequently, we propose a decentralized data access and sharing system that preserves privacy to ensure adequate data access management under the blockchain. In addition, we designed a blockchain framework to resolve the decentralized data access and sharing system privacy issues, by implementing a public key infrastructure model, which utilizes a signature cryptography algorithm (elliptic curve and signcryption). Lastly, we compared the proposed blockchain model to previous techniques to see how well it performed. Results: We evaluated the blockchain on four performance metrics which include throughput, latency, scalability, and security. The proposed blockchain model was tested using a sample of 5000 patients and 500,000 observations. The performance evaluation results further showed that the proposed model achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing approaches when the workload varies up to 10,000 transactions. Discussion: This research reviews the importance of blockchains as they provide infinite possibilities to individuals, companies, and governments.

                Background: This study aimed to determine whether people living in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia would prefer to continue the practice of physical distancing after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or to return to their previous way of life. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to October 2020 in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. A pre-tested questionnaire was sent electronically through social media. Data on participants’ demographics and their perspectives regarding post-pandemic physical distancing were collected. The calculated sample size was 1,066; however, the total number of responses included in the analysis was 989. Results: The average age of the participants was 31.15±11.93 years. There were 435 men and 554 women in the study. Participants showed significantly high levels of disagreement with statements indicating that they were willing to use public transportation (61%), attend social gatherings (36%), and hug relatives or colleagues (40%) after the pandemic (p<0.001); however, 43% agreed that they would spend time with family or friends (p<0.001). The level of education was also found to be significantly related to the responses, and the level of disagreement increased as the level of education increased (p<0.001). Conclusions: One-third of the study participants planned to continue engaging in physical distancing even after the current pandemic. This clearly indicates that our lives are not returning to how they were before the pandemic. However, it cannot be concluded whether or not this behavior will prevail in the long run. If so, it may greatly affect some businesses and perhaps some social norms and values as well.

                Background: The sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) is a freshwater fish from the Loricariidae family, and is considered an invasive species in Indonesia. The fish is usually neglected and discarded. Its protein hydrolysate is the product of the breakdown of proteins into amino acids through the hydrolysis of acids, bases, or enzymes. Therefore, this study aims to determine the hydrolysate characteristics of sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) proteins, produced with different pH and hydrolysis durations. Methods: The hydrolysis was carried out with variable pH (control, 5, 7, 9) and hydrolysis durations (12 and 24 hours) in three replicates. Results: The hydrolysis duration, pH, and interaction of both variables had significant effects (p<0.05) on the parameters of yield, antioxidant activity, degree of hydrolysis, protein levels, and ash content. Similarly, the moisture content, hydrolysis duration, and pH were significantly affected (p<0.05), while their interactions were not (p>0.05). The pH treatment had a significant effect on fat content (p<0.05), while the hydrolysis length and the interaction between the two had no significant effect (p>0.05). Based on this study, the best resulting production of fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) from sailfin catfish were a for a combination of pH 9 and a hydrolysis duration of 24 hours. The characteristics of FPH produced were as follows: a yield of 57.39%, antioxidant activity 63.99%, degree of hydrolysis 40.67%, water content 7.28%, ash content 7.63%, fat content 5.10%, protein content 34.51%, molecular weight 6.14 -118.17 KDa, total essential amino acids 49.30%, and nonessential amino acids 50.71%. Conclusions: Two factors affected FPH characteristics in sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis). The best processing conditions to obtain optimal characteristics for FPH were a yield of 57.39%, antioxidant levels of 63.99%, a DH of 40.67%, a moisture content of 7.28%, ash content of 7.63%, fat content of 5.10%, and protein content of 34.51%.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Promise of nucleic acid therapeutics for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nucleic acid therapeutics have been attracting attention as novel drug discovery modalities for intractable diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review provides an overview of the current status and prospects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, the results of a phase I/II study using the antisense oligonucleotides Tofersen to treat familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 mutation have been reported. Intrathecal Tofersen administration resulted in a 36% reduction in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another report described two patients with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 treated with an adeno-associated virus encoding a microRNA targeting superoxide dismutase 1. The first patient, who possessed the fast progressive mutant A5V, received a single intrathecal infusion. Although the patient died of respiratory arrest 16 months after treatment, autopsy findings showed a reduction of &gt;90% in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the spinal cord. Clinical trials on antisense oligonucleotide therapies targeting other major amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causative genes, <i>Fused in sarcoma</i> and <i>chromosome 9 open reading frame 72</i>, are ongoing. To attenuate the pathology of TDP-43, strategies targeting regulators of TDP-43 (ataxin 2) and proteins downstream of TDP-43 (stathmin 2) by antisense oligonucleotides are being developed. The advent of nucleic acid therapeutics has enabled to specifically attack the molecules in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathological cascade, expanding the options for therapeutic targets.</p>

                In the cell nucleus, radial genome organization relative to the nuclear lamina exhibits both cell type–specific variability and evolutionarily conserved distribution. A recent study by Ahanger, Delgado et al. explores the in vivo spatial distribution of the genome in the brain and identifies conserved genomic localization across mammalian species that are correlated with gene expression states.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The many dimensions of human hippocampal organization and (dys)function</a></h4>

              
                The internal organization of hippocampal formation has been studied for more than a century. Although early accounts emphasized its subfields along the medial–lateral axis, findings in recent decades have highlighted also the anterior-to-posterior (i.e., longitudinal) axis as a key contributor to this brain region’s functional organization. Hence, understanding of hippocampal function likely demands characterizing both medial-to-lateral and anterior-to-posterior axes, an approach that has been concretized by recent advances in in vivo parcellation and gradient mapping techniques.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Olfactory landmarks and path integration converge to form a cognitive spatial map</a></h4>

              
                The recognition of a spatial landmark by its sensory features poses a problem for neural circuits. Fischler-Ruiz, et al. show how this problem is solved when mice use odor cues to navigate in the dark. In the hippocampus, path integration imposes spatial meaning on odor cues, thereby creating new landmarks.
