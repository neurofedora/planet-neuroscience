              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Optimal Surgical Extent for Memory and Seizure Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postoperative memory decline is an important consequence of anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the extent of resection may be a modifiable factor. This study aimed to define optimal resection margins for cognitive outcome while maintaining a high rate of postoperative seizure freedom.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study evaluated the resection extent on postoperative structural MRI using automated voxel-based methods and manual measurements in 142 consecutive patients with unilateral drug refractory TLE (74 left, 68 right TLE) who underwent standard ATLR.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxel-wise analyses revealed that postsurgical verbal memory decline correlated with resections of the posterior hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, whereas larger resections of the fusiform gyrus were associated with worsening of visual memory in left TLE. Limiting the posterior extent of left hippocampal resection to 55% reduced the odds of significant postoperative verbal memory decline by a factor of 8.1 (95% CI 1.5–44.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Seizure freedom was not related to posterior resection extent, but to the piriform cortex removal after left ATLR. In right TLE, variability of the posterior extent of resection was not associated with verbal and visual memory decline or seizures after surgery.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The extent of surgical resection is an independent and modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and seizures after left ATLR. Adapting the posterior extent of left ATLR might optimize postoperative outcome, with reduced risk of memory impairment while maintaining comparable seizure-freedom rates. The current, more lenient, approach might be appropriate for right ATLR. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Promise of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nucleic acid therapeutics have been attracting attention as novel drug discovery modalities for intractable diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review provides an overview of the current status and prospects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, the results of a phase I/II study using the antisense oligonucleotides Tofersen to treat familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 mutation have been reported. Intrathecal Tofersen administration resulted in a 36% reduction in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another report described 2 patients with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 treated with an adeno-associated virus encoding a microRNA targeting superoxide dismutase 1. The first patient, who possessed the fast progressive mutant A5V, received a single intrathecal infusion. Although the patient died of respiratory arrest 16 months after treatment, autopsy findings showed a reduction of &gt;90% in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the spinal cord. Clinical trials on antisense oligonucleotide therapies targeting other major amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causative genes, fused in sarcoma and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72, are ongoing. To attenuate the pathology of TDP-43, strategies targeting regulators of TDP-43 (ataxin 2) and proteins downstream of TDP-43 (stathmin 2) by antisense oligonucleotides are being developed. The advent of nucleic acid therapeutics has enabled to specifically attack the molecules in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathological cascade, expanding the options for therapeutic targets.

                Brain circuit development involves tremendous structural formation and rearrangement of dendrites, axons, and the synaptic connections between them. Direct studies of neuronal morphogenesis are now possible through recent developments in multiple technologies, including single-neuron labeling, time-lapse imaging in intact tissues, and 4D rendering software capable of tracking neural growth over periods spanning minutes to days. These methods allow detailed quantification of structural changes of neurons over time, called dynamic morphometrics, providing new insights into fundamental growth patterns, underlying molecular mechanisms, and the intertwined influences of external factors, including neural activity, and intrinsic genetic programs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-timescale biological learning algorithms train spiking neuronal network motor control</a></h4>

              
                Biological learning operates at multiple interlocking timescales, from long evolutionary stretches down to the relatively short time span of an individual's life. While each process has been simulated individually as a basic learning algorithm in the context of spiking neuronal networks (SNNs), the integration of the two has remained limited. In this study, we first train SNNs separately using individual model learning using spike-timing dependent reinforcement learning (STDP-RL) and evolutionary (EVOL) learning algorithms to solve the CartPole reinforcement learning (RL) control problem. We then develop an interleaved algorithm inspired by biological evolution that combines the EVOL and STDP-RL learning in sequence. We use the NEURON simulator with NetPyNE to create an SNN interfaced with the CartPole environment from OpenAI's Gym. In CartPole, the goal is to balance a vertical pole by moving left/right on a 1-D plane. Our SNN contains multiple populations of neurons organized in three layers: sensory layer, association/hidden layer, and motor layer, where neurons are connected by excitatory (AMPA/NMDA) and inhibitory (GABA) synapses. Association and motor layers contain one excitatory (E) population and two inhibitory (I) populations with different synaptic time constants. Each neuron is an event-based integrate-and-fire model with plastic connections between excitatory neurons. In our SNN, the environment activates sensory neurons tuned to specific features of the game state. We split the motor population into subsets representing each movement choice. The subset with more spiking over an interval determines the action. During STDP-RL, we supply intermediary evaluations (reward/punishment) of each action by judging the effectiveness of a move (e.g., moving the CartPole to a balanced position). During EVOL, updates consist of adding together many random perturbations of the connection weights. Each set of random perturbations is weighted by the total episodic reward it achieves when applied independently. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm after training and through the creation of sensory/motor action maps that delineate the network's transformation of sensory inputs into higher-order representations and eventual motor decisions. Both EVOL and STDP-RL training produce SNNs capable of moving the cart left and right and keeping the pole vertical. Compared to the STDP-RL and EVOL algorithms operating on their own, our interleaved training paradigm produced enhanced robustness in performance, with different strategies revealed through analysis of the sensory/motor mappings. Analysis of synaptic weight matrices also shows distributed vs clustered representations after the EVOL and STDP-RL algorithms, respectively. These weight differences also manifest as diffuse vs synchronized firing patterns. Our modeling opens up new capabilities for SNNs in RL and could serve as a testbed for neurobiologists aiming to understand multi-timescale learning mechanisms and dynamics in neuronal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Contributions of Eye Gaze Fixations and Target-Lure Similarity to Behavioral and fMRI Indices of Pattern Separation and Pattern Completion</a></h4>

              
                Pattern separation and pattern completion are generally studied in humans using mnemonic discrimination tasks such as the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) where participants identify similar lures and repeated items from a series of images. Failures to correctly discriminate lures are thought to reflect a failure of pattern separation and a propensity toward pattern completion. Recent research has challenged this perspective, suggesting that poor encoding rather than pattern completion accounts for the occurrence of false alarm responses to similar lures. In two experiments, participants completed a continuous recognition task version of the MST while eye movement (Experiment 1 and 2) and fMRI data (Experiment 2) were collected. While we replicated the result that fixation counts at study predicted accuracy on lure trials, we found that target-lure similarity was a much stronger predictor of accuracy on lure trials across both experiments. Lastly, we found that fMRI activation changes in the hippocampus were significantly correlated with the number of fixations at study for correct but not incorrect mnemonic discrimination judgments when controlling for target-lure similarity. Our findings indicate that while eye movements during encoding predict subsequent hippocampal activation changes, mnemonic discrimination performance is better described by pattern separation and pattern completion processes that are influenced by target-lure similarity than simply poor encoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct neurocognitive bases for social trait judgments of faces in autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social processes, interactions, and communication. Yet, the neurocognitive bases underlying these difficulties are unclear. Here, we triangulated the trans-diagnostic approach to personality, social trait judgments of faces, and neurophysiology to investigate (1) the relative position of autistic traits in a comprehensive social-affective personality space and (2) the distinct associations between the social-affective personality dimensions and social trait judgment from faces in individuals with ASD and neurotypical individuals. We collected personality and facial judgment data from a large sample of online participants (N = 89 self-identified ASD; N = 308 neurotypical controls). Factor analysis with 33 sub-scales of 10 social-affective personality questionnaires identified a 4-dimensional personality space. This analysis revealed that ASD and control participants did not differ significantly along the personality dimensions of empathy and prosociality, antisociality, or social agreeableness. However, the associations between these dimensions and judgments of facial trustworthiness and warmth differed across groups. Neurophysiological data also indicated that ASD and control participants might rely on distinct neuronal representations for judging trustworthiness and warmth from faces. These results suggest that the atypical association between social-affective personality and social trait judgment from faces may contribute to the social and affective difficulties associated with ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Constructing threat probability, fear behaviour, and aversive prediction error in the brainstem.</a></h4>

              
                When faced with potential threat we must estimate its probability, respond advantageously, and leverage experience to update future estimates. Threat estimates are the proposed domain of the forebrain, while behaviour is elicited by the brainstem. Yet, the brainstem is also a source of prediction error, a learning signal to acquire and update threat estimates. Neuropixels probes allowed us to record single-unit activity across a 21-region brainstem axis during probabilistic fear discrimination. Against a backdrop of widespread threat probability and behaviour signaling, a dorsally-based brainstem network rapidly signaled threat probability. Remapping of neuronal function following shock outcome gave rise to brainstem networks signaling prediction error on multiple timescales. The results reveal construction of threat probability, behaviour, and prediction error along a single brainstem axis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oscillatory population-level activity of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons sculpts sleep structure</a></h4>

              
                Dorsal raphe (DR) 5HT neurons are involved in regulating sleep/wake transitions. Previous studies demonstrated that single unit activity of DR 5HT neurons is high during wakefulness, decreases during non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and ceases during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, characteristics of the population level activity of DR 5HT neurons, which can influence the entire brain, are largely unknown. Here we measured population activities of 5 HT neurons in male and female mouse DR across the sleep/wake cycle by a ratiometric fiber photometry system. We found a slow oscillatory activity of compound intracellular Ca2+ signals during NREM sleep. The trough of concave 5HT activity increased along with sleep progression, but the 5HT activity level always returned to that seen in wake periods. When the trough reached the minimum level and remained there, REM sleep initiated. We also found a unique coupling of the oscillatory 5HT activity and EEG power fluctuation, suggesting that EEG fluctuation is a proxy for 5HT activity. Optogenetic activation of 5HT neurons during NREM sleep triggered a high EMG power and induced wakefulness. Optogenetic inhibition induced REM sleep or sustained NREM with an EEG power increase and EEG fluctuation. These manipulations demonstrated a causal role of DR 5HT neurons in sculpting sleep/wake structure. We also observed EEG fluctuations in human males during NREM sleep, implicating the existence of 5HT oscillatory activity in humans. We propose that NREM sleep is not a monotonous state, but that it is dynamically regulated by the oscillatory population activity of DR 5HT neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Designing and comparing cleaning pipelines for TMS-EEG data: a theoretical overview and practical example</a></h4>

              
                Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) is growing in popularity as a method for probing the reactivity and connectivity of neural circuits in basic and clinical research. However, using EEG to measure the neural responses to TMS is challenging due to the unique artifacts introduced by combining the two techniques. In this paper, we overview the artifacts present in TMS-EEG data and the offline cleaning methods used to suppress these unwanted signals. We then describe how open science practices, including the development of open-source toolboxes designed for TMS-EEG analysis (e.g., TESA - the TMS-EEG signal analyser), have improved the availability and reproducibility of TMS-EEG cleaning methods. We provide theoretical and practical considerations for designing TMS-EEG cleaning pipelines and then give an example of how to compare different pipelines using TESA. We show that changing even a single step in a pipeline designed to suppress decay artifacts results in TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) with small differences in amplitude and spatial topography. The variability in TEPs resulting from the choice of cleaning pipeline has important implications for comparing TMS-EEG findings between research groups which use different online and offline approaches. Finally, we discuss the challenges of validating cleaning pipelines and recommend that researchers compare outcomes from TMS-EEG experiments using multiple pipelines to ensure findings are not related to the choice of cleaning methods. We conclude that the continued improvement, availability, and validation of cleaning pipelines is essential to ensure TMS-EEG reaches its full potential as a method for studying human neurophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The P600, but not N400, is modulated by sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                The functional significance of the two prominent language-related ERP components N400 and P600 is still under debate. It has recently been suggested that one important dimension along which the two vary, is in terms of automaticity versus attentional control, with N400 amplitudes reflecting more automatic and P600 amplitudes reflecting more controlled aspects of sentence comprehension. The availability of executive resources necessary for controlled processes depends on sustained attention, which fluctuates over time. Here, we thus tested whether P600 and N400 amplitudes depend on the level of sustained attention. We re-analyzed EEG and behavioral data from a sentence processing task by Sassenhagen & Bornkessel-Schlesewsky (2015, Cortex), which included sentences with morphosyntactic and semantic violations. Participants read sentences phrase by phrase and indicated whether a sentence contained any type of anomaly as soon as they had the relevant information. To quantify periods of high versus low sustained attention, we extracted a moving reaction time coefficient of variation over the entire course of the task. We found that the P600 amplitude was significantly larger during periods of low reaction time variability (high sustained attention) than in periods of high reaction time variability (low sustained attention). In contrast, the amplitude of the N400 was not affected by reaction time variability. These results thus suggest that the P600 component is sensitive to sustained attention while the N400 component is not, which provides independent evidence for accounts suggesting that P600 amplitudes reflect more controlled and N400 amplitudes more automatic aspects of sentence comprehension.

                We introduce Reset networks, which are compositions of several neural networks - typically several levels of CNNs - where possibly non-spatial outputs at one level are reshaped into spatial inputs for the next level. We demonstrate that Reset networks exhibit emergent topographic organization for numbers, as well as for visual categories taken from CIFAR-100.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Frontal but not parietal cortex is required for decisions under risk</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in frontal and parietal cortex encode task variables during decision-making, but causal manipulations of the two regions produce strikingly different results. For example, silencing the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in rats and monkeys produces minimal effects in perceptual decisions requiring integration of sensory evidence, but silencing frontal cortex profoundly impairs the same decisions. Here, we tested, for the first time, the causal roles of the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) and PPC in economic choice under risk. On each trial, rats chose between a lottery and a small but guaranteed surebet. The magnitude of the lottery was independently varied across trials and was indicated to the rat by the pitch of an auditory cue. As in perceptual decisions, both unilateral and bilateral PPC muscimol inactivations produced weak effects. FOF inactivations produced substantial changes in behavior even though our task had no working memory component. We quantified control and bilateral inactivation behavior with a multi-agent model consisting of a mixture of a 'rational' utility-maximizing agent (U=V{rho}) with two `habitual' agents that either choose surebet or lottery. Silencing PPC produced no significant shifts in any parameters relative to controls. Effects of FOF silencing were best explained by a decrease in {rho}, the exponent of the utility function. This effect was parsimoniously explained by a dynamical model where the FOF is part of network that performs sensory-to-value transformations.

                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used in several FDA-approved treatments and, increasingly, to treat neurological disorders in off-label uses. However, the mechanism by which TMS causes physiological change is unclear, as are the origins of response variability in the general population. Ideally, objective in vivo biomarkers could shed light on these unknowns and eventually inform personalized interventions. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is a form of TMS which has been observed to reduce motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for 60 minutes or longer post-stimulation, although the consistency of this effect and its mechanism continue to be under debate. Here, we use glutamate-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (gluCEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra-high magnetic field (7T) to measure changes in glutamate concentration at the site of cTBS. We find that gluCEST signal in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the brain generally decreases in response to cTBS, whereas consistent changes were not detected in the contralateral or in subjects receiving a sham stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxygenated hemoglobin signal provides greater predictive performance of experimental condition than de-oxygenated</a></h4>

              
                Continuous-wave functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging provides an estimate of relative changes in oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin content, from which regional neural activity is inferred. The relation between both signals is governed by neurovascular coupling mechanisms. However, the magnitude of concentration changes and the contribution of noise sources to each chromophore is unique. Subsequently, it is not apparent if either chromophore signal practically provides greater information about the underlying neural state and relation to an experimental condition. To assess this question objectively, we applied a machine-learning approach to four datasets and evaluated which hemoglobin signal best differentiated between experimental conditions. To further ensure the objective nature of the analysis, the algorithm utilized all samples from the epoched data rather than pre-selected features. Regardless of experimental task, brain region, or stimulus, the oxygenated hemoglobin signal was better able to differentiate between conditions than the de-oxygenated signal. Incorporating both signals into the analysis provided no additional improvement over oxygenated hemoglobin alone. These results indicate that oxyhemoglobin is the most informative fNIRS signal in relation to experimental condition.

                One of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the abnormal cerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta. Non-invasive monitoring of amyloid-beta deposits enables monitoring of treatment effects and understanding of the disease mechanism in the brain of disease animal models. Previous fluorescence imaging of has been mainly based on 2D diffuse fluoresence imaging and two-photon imaging with small field-of-view. Here we utilized a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) pipeline assisted with curcumin derivative CRANAD-2 for detecting the amyloid-beta; accumulation in arcAb mouse model of Alzheimer amyloidosis in 3D. A homebuilt FMT system was used for data acquisition, and a customized software platform was employed to enable the integration of anatomical information from MRI for assisting the FMT image reconstruction. To validate the multi-modal FMT-MRI method, conventional fluorescence reflectance imaging was conducted in the same conditions. Concordance in the time course of fluoresence intensity after intravenous injection of CRANAD-2 in the brain was observed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of visualizing amyloid-beta; deposition in 3D using a multi-modal MRI-FMT method. This multimodal imaging method can provide complementary information of anatomical and molecular information thus facilitating future mechanistic studies and monitoring of putative treatments targeting amyloid-beta; in disease animal models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Putting the theory into 'burstlet theory': A biophysical model of bursts and burstlets in the respiratory preBötzinger complex</a></h4>

              
                Inspiratory breathing rhythms arise from synchronized neuronal activity in a bilaterally distributed brainstem structure known as the preBotzinger complex (preBotC). In in vitro slice preparations containing the preBotC, extracellular potassium must be elevated above physiological levels (to 7-9mM) to observe regular rhythmic respiratory motor output in the hypoglossal nerve to which the preBotC projects. Reexamination of how extracellular K+ affects preBotC neuronal activity has revealed that low amplitude oscillations persist at physiological levels. These oscillatory events are sub-threshold from the standpoint of transmission to motor output and are dubbed burstlets. Burstlets arise from synchronized neural activity in a rhythmogenic neuronal subpopulation within the preBotC that in some instances may fail to recruit the larger network events, or bursts, required to generate motor output. The fraction of subthreshold preBotC oscillatory events (burstlet fraction) decreases sigmoidally with increasing extracellular potassium. These observations underlie the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Experimental and computational studies have suggested that recruitment of the non-rhythmogenic component of the preBotC population requires intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and activation of a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current. In this computational study, we show how intracellular calcium dynamics driven by synaptically triggered Ca2+ influx as well as Ca2+ release/uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum in conjunction with a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current can explain all of the key observations underlying the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Thus, we provide a mechanistic basis to unify the experimental findings on rhythm generation and motor output recruitment in the preBotC.

                Two key problems that span biological and industrial neural network research are how networks can be trained to generalize well and to minimize destructive interference between tasks. Both hinge on credit assignment, the targeting of specific network weights for change. In artificial networks, credit assignment is typically governed by gradient descent. Biological learning is thus often analyzed as a means to approximate gradients. We take the complementary perspective that biological learning rules likely confer advantages when they aren't gradient approximations. Further, we hypothesized that noise correlations, often considered detrimental, could usefully shape this learning. Indeed, we show that noise and three-factor plasticity interact to compute directional derivatives of reward, which can improve generalization, robustness to interference, and multi-task learning. This interaction also provides a method for routing learning quasi-independently of activity and connectivity, and demonstrates how biologically inspired inductive biases can be fruitfully embedded in learning algorithms.

                Relatively little is known regarding the interaction between encoding-related neural activity and sleep-based memory consolidation. One suggestion is that a function of encoding-related theta power may be to 'tag' memories for subsequent processing during sleep. This study aimed to extend previous work on the relationships between sleep spindles, slow oscillation-spindle coupling and task-related theta activity with a combined Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) and nap paradigm. This allowed us to examine the influence of task- and sleep-related oscillatory activity on the recognition of both encoded list words and associative theme words. Thirty-three participants (29 females, mean age = 23.2 years) learned and recognised DRM lists separated by either a 2hr wake or sleep period. Mixed-effects modelling revealed the sleep condition endorsed more associative theme words and fewer list words in comparison to the wake group. Encoding related theta power was also found to influence sleep spindle density, and this interaction was predictive of memory outcomes. The influence of encoding-related theta was specific to sleep spindle density, and did not appear to influence the strength of slow oscillation-spindle coupling as it relates to memory outcomes. The finding of interactions between wakeful and sleep oscillatory-related activity in promoting memory and learning has important implications for theoretical models of sleep-based memory consolidation.

                Restoration of proprioception with neurotechnology is critical to improve effectiveness of robotic neuro-prostheses. Unfortunately, after initial enthusiasm clinical results showed that unlike touch, proprioception could not be reliably induced. Here we show that concurrent activation of multiple sensory modalities may trigger unwanted sensory regulation mechanisms that disrupt proprioception. We recorded intra-spinal neural activity induced by stimulation of proprioceptive afferents from the radial nerve in three monkeys. Then, we superimposed stimulation of the radial nerve cutaneous branch and quantified its impact on spinal neural activity via population analysis. Proprioceptive pulses produced robust neural trajectories in the neural manifold that were disrupted by concurrent stimulation of cutaneous afferents. This disruption correlated with a reduction of afferent volleys and multi-unit activity both in the spinal cord and somatosensory cortex. Our results suggest that limited specificity not only impacts localization of artificial percepts, but also their nature to an extent that was never considered.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of external stimulation on functional networks in the aging healthy human brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the brain changes occurring during aging can provide new insights for developing treatments that alleviate or reverse cognitive decline. Neurostimulation techniques have emerged as potential treatments for brain disorders and to improve cognitive functions. Nevertheless, given the ethical restrictions of neurostimulation approaches, in silico perturbation protocols based on causal whole-brain models are fundamental to gaining a mechanistic understanding of brain dynamics. Furthermore, this strategy could serve as a more specific biomarker relating local activity with global brain dynamics. Here, we used a large resting-state fMRI dataset divided into middle-aged (N=310, aged < 65 years) and older adults (N=310, aged >= 65) to characterize brain states in each group as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space, each with a probabilistic occurrence and frequency. Then, we fitted the PMS to a whole-brain model and applied in silico stimulations with different intensities in each node to force transitions from the brain states of the older group to the middle-age group. We found that the precuneus, a brain area belonging to the default mode network and the rich club, was the best stimulation target. These findings might have important implications for designing neurostimulation interventions to revert the effects of aging on whole-brain dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-organization of in vitro neuronal assemblies drives to complex network topology</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent self-organization plays an important role in the formation of specific and stereotyped connectivity patterns in neural circuits. By combining neuronal cultures, tools with approaches from network neuroscience and information theory, we can study how complex network topology emerges from local neuronal interactions. We constructed effective connectivity networks using a transfer entropy analysis of electrophysiological signals recorded from rat embryo dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures between 6 and 35 days in vitro to investigate how the neuronal network topology evolves during maturation. The methodology for constructing the networks considered the synapse delay and addressed the influence of firing rate and population bursts as well as spurious effects on the inference of connections. We found that the number of links in the networks grew over the course of development, shifting from a segregated to a more integrated architecture. As part of this progression, three significant aspects of complex network topology emerged. In agreement with previous in silico and in vitro studies, a small-world architecture was detected, largely due to strong clustering among neurons. Additionally, the networks developed in a modular community topology, with most modules comprising nearby neurons. Finally, highly active neurons acquired topological characteristics that made them important nodes to the network and integrators of communities. These findings leverage new insights into how neuronal effective network topology relates to neuronal assembly self-organization mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Biophysical Model of Nonquantal Transmission at the Vestibular Hair Cell-Calyx Synapse: KLV currents Modulate Fast Electrical and Slow K+ potentials in the Synaptic Cleft</a></h4>

              
                Vestibular hair cells transmit information about head position and motion across synapses to primary afferent neurons. At some of these synapses, the afferent neuron envelopes the hair cell, forming an enlarged synaptic terminal referred to as a calyx. The vestibular hair cell-calyx synapse supports nonquantal transmission (NQT), a neurotransmitter-independent mechanism that is exceptionally fast. The underlying biophysical mechanisms that give rise to NQT are not fully understood. Here we present a computational model of NQT that integrates morphological and electrophysiological data. The model predicts that NQT involves two processes: changes in cleft K+ concentration, as previously recognized, and very fast changes in cleft electrical potential. A significant finding is that changes in cleft electrical potential are faster than changes in [K+] or quantal transmission. The electrical potential mechanism thus provides a basis for the exceptional speed of neurotransmission between type I hair cells and primary neurons and explains experimental observations of fast postsynaptic currents. The [K+] mechanism increases the gain of NQT. Both processes are mediated by current flow through low-voltage-activated K+ (KLV) channels located in both pre-synaptic (hair cell) and post-synaptic (calyx inner face) membranes. The model further demonstrates that the calyx morphology is necessary for NQT; as calyx height is increased, NQT increases in size, speed and efficacy at depolarizing the afferent neuron. We propose that the calyx evolved to enhance NQT and speed up signals that drive vestibular reflexes essential for stabilizing the eyes and neck and maintaining balance during rapid and complex head motions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Passive Exposure Sparsifies Neural Activity in the Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                A notable feature of neural activity is sparseness - namely, that only a small fraction of neurons in a local circuit have high activity at any moment. Not only is sparse neural activity observed experimentally in most areas of the brain, but sparseness has been proposed as an optimization or design principle for neural circuits. Sparseness can increase the energy efficiency of the neu- ral code as well as allow for beneficial computations to be carried out. But how does the brain achieve sparse- ness? Here, we found that when neurons in the primary visual cortex were passively exposed to a set of images over several days, neural responses became more sparse. Sparsification was driven by a decrease in the response of neurons with low or moderate activity, while highly active neurons retained similar responses. We also observed a net decorrelation of neural activity. These changes sculpt neural activity for greater coding efficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Algorithmic Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Models</a></h4>

              
                Experimental data-based parameter search for Hodgkin-Huxley-style (HH) neuron models is a major challenge for neuroscientists and neuroengineers. Current search strategies are often computationally expensive, are slow to converge, have difficulty handling nonlinearities or multimodalities in the objective function, or require good initial parameter guesses. Most important, many existing approaches lack quantification of uncertainties in parameter estimates even though such uncertainties are of immense biological significance. We propose a novel method for parameter inference and uncertainty quantification in a Bayesian framework using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. This approach incorporates prior knowledge about model parameters (as probability distributions) and aims to map the prior to a posterior distribution of parameters informed by both the model and the data. Furthermore, using the adaptive parallel tempering strategy for MCMC, we tackle the highly nonlinear, noisy, and multimodal loss function, which depends on the HH neuron model. We tested the robustness of our approach using the voltage trace data generated from a 9-parameter HH model using five levels of injected currents (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 nA). Each test consisted of running the ground truth with its respective currents to estimate the model parameters. To simulate the condition for fitting a frequency-current (F-I) curve, we also introduced an aggregate objective that runs MCMC against all five levels simultaneously. We found that MCMC was able to produce many solutions with acceptable loss values (e.g., for 0.0 nA, 889 solutions were within 0.5% of the best solution and 1,595 solutions within 1% of the best solution). Thus, an adaptive parallel tempering MCMC search provides a "landscape" of the possible parameter sets with acceptable loss values in a tractable manner. Our approach is able to obtain an intelligently sampled global view of the solution distributions within a search range in a single computation. Additionally, the advantage of uncertainty quantification allows for exploration of further solution spaces, which can serve to better inform future experiments.

	<p>(1) The consistency and magnitude of the prevalence of Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) individuals are undetermined, limiting efficient detection of cases. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of CHR-P individuals systematically assessed in the general population or clinical samples. (2) PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant (PROSPERO: CRD42020168672) meta-analysis of multiple databases until 21/01/21: a random-effects model meta-analysis, heterogeneity analysis, publication bias and quality assessment, sensitivity analysis—according to the gold-standard CHR-P and pre-screening instruments—leave-one-study-out analyses, and meta-regressions were conducted. (3) 35 studies were included, with 37,135 individuals tested and 1554 CHR-P individuals identified (median age = 19.3 years, Interquartile range (IQR) = 15.8–22.1; 52.2% females, IQR = 38.7–64.4). In the general population (k = 13, n = 26,835 individuals evaluated), the prevalence of the CHR-P state was 1.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.0–2.9%). In clinical samples (k = 22, n = 10,300 individuals evaluated), the prevalence of the CHR-P state was 19.2% (95% CI = 12.9–27.7%). Using a pre-screening instrument was associated with false negatives (5.6%, 95% CI = 2.2–13.3%) and a lower CHR-P prevalence (11.5%, 95% CI = 6.2–20.5%) compared to using CHR-P instruments only (28.5%, 95% CI = 23.0–34.7%, p = 0.003). (4) The prevalence of the CHR-P state is low in the general population and ten times higher in clinical samples. The prevalence of CHR-P may increase with a higher proportion of females in the general population and with a younger population in clinical samples. The CHR-P state may be unrecognized in routine clinical practice. These findings can refine detection and preventive strategies.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease with available treatments only marginally slowing progression or improving survival. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation in the C9ORF72 gene is the most commonly known genetic cause of both sporadic and familial cases of ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The C9ORF72 expansion mutation produces five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), and while the mechanistic determinants of DPR-mediated neurotoxicity remain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport and increased DNA damage contributes to pathology. Therefore, characterizing these disturbances and determining the relative contribution of different DPRs is needed to facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for C9ALS/FTD. To this end, we generated a series of nucleocytoplasmic transport “biosensors”, composed of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), fused to different classes of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs). Using these biosensors in conjunction with automated microscopy, we investigated the role of the three most neurotoxic DPRs (PR, GR, and GA) on seven nuclear import and two export pathways. In addition to other DPRs, we found that PR had pronounced inhibitory effects on the classical nuclear export pathway and several nuclear import pathways. To identify compounds capable of counteracting the effects of PR on nucleocytoplasmic transport, we developed a nucleocytoplasmic transport assay and screened several commercially available compound libraries, totaling 2714 compounds. In addition to restoring nucleocytoplasmic transport efficiencies, hits from the screen also counteract the cytotoxic effects of PR. Selected hits were subsequently tested for their ability to rescue another C9ALS/FTD phenotype—persistent DNA double strand breakage. Overall, we found that DPRs disrupt multiple nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways and we identified small molecules that counteract these effects—resulting in increased viability of PR-expressing cells and decreased DNA damage markers in patient-derived motor neurons. Several HDAC inhibitors were validated as hits, supporting previous studies that show that HDAC inhibitors confer therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative models.</p>

	<p>In memory, representations of spatial features are stored in different reference frames; features relative to our position are stored egocentrically and features relative to each other are stored allocentrically. Accessing these representations engages many cognitive and neural resources, and so is susceptible to age-related breakdown. Yet, recent findings on the heterogeneity of cognitive function and spatial ability in healthy older adults suggest that aging may not uniformly impact the flexible use of spatial representations. These factors have yet to be explored in a precisely controlled task that explicitly manipulates spatial frames of reference across learning and retrieval. We used a lab-based virtual reality task to investigate the relationship between object–location memory across frames of reference, cognitive status, and self-reported spatial ability. Memory error was measured using Euclidean distance from studied object locations to participants’ responses at testing. Older adults recalled object locations less accurately when they switched between frames of reference from learning to testing, compared with when they remained in the same frame of reference. They also showed an allocentric learning advantage, producing less error when switching from an allocentric to an egocentric frame of reference, compared with the reverse direction of switching. Higher MoCA scores and better self-assessed spatial ability predicted less memory error, especially when learning occurred egocentrically. We suggest that egocentric learning deficits are driven by difficulty in binding multiple viewpoints into a coherent representation. Finally, we highlight the heterogeneity of spatial memory performance in healthy older adults as a potential cognitive marker for neurodegeneration, beyond normal aging.</p>

	<p>Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are experiencing severe mental distress. Thus, during the last year, drastic changes occurred in everyday life of every human being. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns (loneliness, anxiety, depression, or insomnia) have developed. The objective of this study was to explore the anxiety, perceived stress, and resilience in a population presenting at the general practitioner, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected between February and April 2021 and 440 individuals who presented to the general practitioner were evaluated. Concerning anxiety level, almost half of the respondents (49,3%, N = 217) scored above the threshold value on the anxiety scale (mild intensity 38.6%, moderate intensity 9.9%, severe intensity 0.8%). Having a low level of resilience, as well as experiencing a high level of stress, are both predictive of the occurrence of high anxiety (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, r = −0.551 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, r = 0.622, respectively). Furthermore, resilience is negatively related to perceived stress (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, r = −0.676). It is critical in the current crisis to recognize those at risk of developing mental illnesses, taking into consideration the various socioeconomic classes, as well as to maintain and improve the general public’s mental health using appropriate psychological interventions.</p>

	<p>The Intelligibility in Context Scale (ICS) is a widely used, efficient tool for describing a child’s speech intelligibility. Few studies have explored the relationship between ICS scores and transcription intelligibility scores, which are the gold standard for clinical measurement. This study examined how well ICS composite scores predicted transcription intelligibility scores among children with cerebral palsy (CP), how well individual questions from the ICS differentially predicted transcription intelligibility scores, and how well the ICS composite scores differentiated between children with and without speech motor impairment. Parents of 48 children with CP, who were approximately 13 years of age, completed the ICS. Ninety-six adult naïve listeners provided orthographic transcriptions of children’s speech. Transcription intelligibility scores were regressed on ICS composite scores and individual item scores. Dysarthria status was regressed on ICS composite scores. Results indicated that ICS composite scores were moderately strong predictors of transcription intelligibility scores. One individual ICS item differentially predicted transcription intelligibility scores, and dysarthria severity influenced how well ICS composite scores differentiated between children with and without speech motor impairment. Findings suggest that the ICS has potential clinical utility for children with CP, especially when used with other objective measures of speech intelligibility.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Studies in animals have demonstrated a strong relationship between cortical and hippocampal activity, and autonomic tone. However, the extent, distribution, and nature of this relationship have not been investigated with intracranial recordings in humans during sleep. Cortical and hippocampal population neuronal firing was estimated from high  band activity (HG) from 70 to 110 Hz in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from 15 subjects (nine females) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Autonomic tone was estimated from heart rate variability (HRV). HG and HRV were significantly correlated in the hippocampus and multiple cortical sites in NREM stages N1&ndash;N3. The average correlation between HG and HRV could be positive or negative across patients given anatomic location and sleep stage and was most profound in lateral temporal lobe in N3, suggestive of greater cortical activity associated with sympathetic tone. Patient-wide correlation was related to  band activity (1&ndash;4 Hz), which is known to be correlated with high  activity during sleep. The percentage of statistically correlated channels was weaker in N1 and N2 as compared with N3, and was strongest in regions that have previously been associated with autonomic processes, such as anterior hippocampus and insula. The anatomic distribution of HRV-HG correlations during sleep did not reproduce those usually observed with positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during waking. This study aims to characterize the relationship between autonomic tone and neuronal firing rate during sleep and further studies are needed to investigate finer temporal resolutions, denser coverages, and different frequency bands in both waking and sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sharing Happy Stories Increases Interpersonal Closeness: Interpersonal Brain Synchronization as a Neural Indicator</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Our lives revolve around sharing emotional stories (i.e., happy and sad stories) with other people. Such emotional communication enhances the similarity of story comprehension and neural across speaker-listener pairs. The theory of Emotions as Social Information Model (EASI) suggests that such emotional communication may influence interpersonal closeness. However, few studies have examined speaker-listener interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) during emotional communication and whether it is associated with meaningful aspects of the speaker-listener interpersonal relationship. Here, one speaker watched emotional videos and communicated the content of the videos to 32 people as listeners (happy/sad/neutral group). Both speaker and listeners&rsquo; neural activities were recorded using EEG. After listening, we assessed the interpersonal closeness between the speaker and listeners. Compared with the sad group, sharing happy stories showed a better recall quality and a higher rating of interpersonal closeness. The happy group showed higher IBS in the frontal cortex and left temporoparietal cortex than the sad group. The relationship between frontal IBS and interpersonal closeness was moderated by sharing happy/sad stories. Exploratory analysis using support vector regression (SVR) showed that the IBS could also predict the ratings of interpersonal closeness. These results suggest that frontal IBS could serve as an indicator of whether sharing emotional stories facilitate interpersonal closeness. These findings improve our understanding of emotional communication among individuals that guides behaviors during interpersonal interactions.</p>

                <p>by Diego Barra Avila, Juan R. Melendez-Alvarez, Xiao-Jun Tian</p>

The Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and degeneration disorders. The regulation of YAP/TAZ levels is controlled by a complex regulatory network, where several feedback loops have been identified. However, it remains elusive how these feedback loops contain the YAP/TAZ levels and maintain the system in a healthy physiological state or trap the system in pathological conditions. Here, a mathematical model was developed to represent the YAP/TAZ regulatory network. Through theoretical analyses, three distinct states that designate the one physiological and two pathological outcomes were found. The transition from the physiological state to the two pathological states is mechanistically controlled by coupled bidirectional bistable switches, which are robust to parametric variation and stochastic fluctuations at the molecular level. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the regulation and dysregulation of YAP/TAZ levels in tissue state transitions.

                <p>by Xiaoxuan Wu, Kakit Kong, Wenlei Xiao, Feng Liu</p>

The collective behavior of the nuclear array in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos during nuclear cycle (NC) 11 to NC14 is crucial in controlling cell size, establishing developmental patterns, and coordinating morphogenesis. After live imaging on <i>Drosophila</i> embryos with light sheet microscopy, we extract the nuclear trajectory, speed, and internuclear distance with an automatic nuclear tracing method. We find that the nuclear speed shows a period of standing waves along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis after each metaphase as the nuclei collectively migrate towards the embryo poles and partially move back. And the maximum nuclear speed dampens by 28%-45% in the second half of the standing wave. Moreover, the nuclear density is 22–42% lower in the pole region than the middle of the embryo during the interphase of NC12-NC14. To find mechanical rules controlling the collective motion and packing patterns of the nuclear array, we use a deep neural network (DNN) to learn the underlying force field from data. We apply the learned spatiotemporal attractive force field in the simulations with a particle-based model. And the simulations recapitulate nearly all the observed characteristic collective behaviors of nuclear arrays in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discriminative feature of cells characterizes cell populations of interest by a small subset of genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeru Fujii, Kazumitsu Maehara, Masatoshi Fujita, Yasuyuki Ohkawa</p>

Organisms are composed of various cell types with specific states. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the functions of organs and tissues, cell types have been classified and defined by identifying specific marker genes. Statistical tests are critical for identifying marker genes, which often involve evaluating differences in the mean expression levels of genes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG)-based analysis has been the most frequently used method of this kind. However, in association with increases in sample size such as in single-cell analysis, DEG-based analysis has faced difficulties associated with the inflation of P-values. Here, we propose the concept of discriminative feature of cells (DFC), an alternative to using DEG-based approaches. We implemented DFC using logistic regression with an adaptive LASSO penalty to perform binary classification for discriminating a population of interest and variable selection to obtain a small subset of defining genes. We demonstrated that DFC prioritized gene pairs with non-independent expression using artificial data and that DFC enabled characterization of the muscle satellite/progenitor cell population. The results revealed that DFC well captured cell-type-specific markers, specific gene expression patterns, and subcategories of this cell population. DFC may complement DEG-based methods for interpreting large data sets. DEG-based analysis uses lists of genes with differences in expression between groups, while DFC, which can be termed a discriminative approach, has potential applications in the task of cell characterization. Upon recent advances in the high-throughput analysis of single cells, methods of cell characterization such as scRNA-seq can be effectively subjected to the discriminative methods.

                <p>by Adrienne C. Kinney, Sean Current, Joceline Lega</p>

We present artificial neural networks as a feasible replacement for a mechanistic model of mosquito abundance. We develop a feed-forward neural network, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network, and a gated recurrent unit network. We evaluate the networks in their ability to replicate the spatiotemporal features of mosquito populations predicted by the mechanistic model, and discuss how augmenting the training data with time series that emphasize specific dynamical behaviors affects model performance. We conclude with an outlook on how such equation-free models may facilitate vector control or the estimation of disease risk at arbitrary spatial scales.

                The interactivity and ubiquity of digital technologies are exerting a significant impact on the knowledge creation in information technology (KC-IT) projects. According to the literature, the critical relevance of KC-IT is highly associated with digital innovation (DI) for organisational success. However, DI is not yet a fully-fledged research subject but is an evolving corpus of theory and practise that draws from a variety of social science fields. Given the preceding setting, this study explores the interaction of KC-IT with DI. This work provides a systemic literature review (SLR) to examine the literature in KC-IT and its connection to DI. A SLR of 527 papers from 2001 to 2021 was performed across six online databases. The review encompasses quantitative and qualitative studies on KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Three major gaps were found in the SLR. Firstly, only 57 (0.23%) papers were found to examine the association between KC and IT projects. These works were analysed for theories, type of papers, KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Secondly, the convergence reviews indicate that scarce research has examined TMS and trust in KC-IT as factors. Thirdly, only 0.02% (5) core papers appeared in the search relevant to KC in IT projects to accelerate DI. The majority of the papers examined were not linked to DI. A significant gap also exists in these areas. These findings warrant the attention of the research community.

                Introduction: Unauthorized access to data is one of the most significant privacy issues that hinder most industries from adopting big data technologies. Even though specific processes and structures have been put in place to deal with access authorization and identity management for large databases nonetheless, the scalability criteria are far beyond the capabilities of traditional databases. Hence, most researchers are looking into other solutions, such as big data management. Methods: In this paper, we firstly study the strengths and weaknesses of implementing cryptography and blockchain for identity management and authorization control in big data, focusing on the healthcare domain. Subsequently, we propose a decentralized data access and sharing system that preserves privacy to ensure adequate data access management under the blockchain. In addition, we designed a blockchain framework to resolve the decentralized data access and sharing system privacy issues, by implementing a public key infrastructure model, which utilizes a signature cryptography algorithm (elliptic curve and signcryption). Lastly, we compared the proposed blockchain model to previous techniques to see how well it performed. Results: We evaluated the blockchain on four performance metrics which include throughput, latency, scalability, and security. The proposed blockchain model was tested using a sample of 5000 patients and 500,000 observations. The performance evaluation results further showed that the proposed model achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing approaches when the workload varies up to 10,000 transactions. Discussion: This research reviews the importance of blockchains as they provide infinite possibilities to individuals, companies, and governments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synchronous online learning during movement control order in higher education institutions: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Higher education institutions (HEI) are not spared from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The closure of campuses because of the movement control order (MCO) to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 has forced HEIs to adopt online learning, especially synchronous online learning (SOL). Although teaching and learning can be continued via SOL, retaining students’ interest and sustaining their engagement have not been sufficiently explored. This study presents a systematic review of the research pertaining to SOL associated with students’ interest and engagement in HEIs during the MCO environment. Methods: Five major online databases, i.e., EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus and Springer were searched to collect relevant papers published between 1st January 2010 to 15th June 2021 including conference proceedings, peer-reviewed papers and dissertations. Papers written in the English language, based in full-fledged universities, and with these five keywords: (i) synchronous online learning, (ii) engagement, (iii) interest, (iv) MCO/Covid-19 and (v) HEI, were included. Papers focussing on synchronous and asynchronous online learning in schools and colleges were excluded. Each paper was reviewed by two reviewers in order to confirm the eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: We found 31 papers of which six papers were related to SOL, engagement and interest in HEIs in the MCO environment. Our review presents three major findings: (i) limited research has been conducted on SOL associated with students’ engagement and interest, (ii) studies related to the context of HEIs in the MCO environment are limited, and (iii) the understanding of the new phenomena through qualitative research is insufficient. We highlight the SOL alignment with students’ engagement, interest, style preference, learner interaction effectiveness, behavior and academic performance. Conclusions: We believe that the findings of this study are timely and require attention from the research community.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Theory of mind (ToM) seems to be affected in multiple sclerosis (MS). MRI studies suggested a role of the amygdala in social cognitive performances. Therefore, we explored the role of the amygdala network in ToM using a multimodal MRI approach. In MS, patients with impaired ToM showed contradictory dysexecutive neuropsychological profile. Therefore, we compared neural networks involved in ToM and executive functions (EFs). Twenty patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 15 matched healthy controls were selected. ToM (Faux Pas test and mind stories) and EFs were assessed within and outside the scanner. All subjects underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests. Multimodal MRI with structural (diffusion imaging) and functional (resting-state and task-based) sequences was used to analyze the role and connections of the amygdala in ToM functioning. Cognitive and ToM performances were similar between patients and controls. Resting-state data revealed decreased connectivity of the left amygdala with frontal areas in patients compared to controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). During the task-based functional MRI, patients demonstrated increased connectivity between the amygdala and several cerebellar and left temporal regions (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The microstructural alterations between the left amygdala and left temporal regions were associated with increased functional connectivity within the same pathway (<i>r</i> = 0.74; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). No overlap was observed between functional networks involved in ToM and EFs. Our study demonstrates more connectivity recruitment between the amygdala and cerebellar and temporal regions in MS patients to reach preserved ToM performance. Microstructural abnormalities have been related to this compensatory network. Finally, different networks were involved in EFs and ToM.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neurobiology of the lateral septum: regulation of social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are essential for mammalian life and are regulated by evolutionary conserved neuronal mechanisms. An individual’s internal state, experiences, and the nature of the social stimulus are critical for determining apt responses to social situations. The lateral septum (LS) – a structure of the basal forebrain – integrates abundant cortical and subcortical inputs, and projects to multiple downstream regions to generate appropriate behavioral responses. Although incoming cognitive information is indispensable for contextualizing a social stimulus, neuromodulatory information related to the internal state of the organism significantly influences the behavioral outcome as well.

                The ability to predict the dynamics of objects, linking applied force to motion, underlies our capacity to perform many of the tasks we carry out on a daily basis. Thus, a fundamental question is how the dynamics of the myriad objects we interact with are organized in memory. Using a custom-built three-dimensional robotic interface that allowed us to simulate objects of varying appearance and weight, we examined how participants learned the weights of sets of objects that they repeatedly lifted. We find strong support for the novel hypothesis that motor memories of object dynamics are organized categorically, in terms of families, based on covariation in their visual and mechanical properties. A striking prediction of this hypothesis, supported by our findings and not predicted by standard associative map models, is that outlier objects with weights that deviate from the family-predicted weight will never be learned despite causing repeated lifting errors.

                Mutations or genetic variation in noncoding regions of the genome harbouring cis-regulatory elements (CREs), or enhancers, have been widely implicated in human disease and disease risk. However, our ability to assay the impact of these DNA sequence changes on enhancer activity is currently very limited because of the need to assay these elements in an appropriate biological context. Here, we describe a method for simultaneous quantitative assessment of the spatial and temporal activity of wild-type and disease-associated mutant human CRE alleles using live imaging in zebrafish embryonic development. We generated transgenic lines harbouring a dual-CRE dual-reporter cassette in a pre-defined neutral docking site in the zebrafish genome. The activity of each CRE allele is reported via expression of a specific fluorescent reporter, allowing simultaneous visualisation of where and when in development the wild-type allele is active and how this activity is altered by mutation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sex differences in learning from exploration</a></h4>

              
                Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes could set the stage for individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. While value-based decision making processes in particular have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences, the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often show variable or minimal differences across sexes. Computational tools allow us to uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. Here, we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless 2-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get 'stuck' in exploration once they had started. Female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Capping protein regulates endosomal trafficking by controlling F-actin density around endocytic vesicles and recruiting RAB5 effectors</a></h4>

              
                Actin filaments (F-actin) have been implicated in various steps of endosomal trafficking, and the length of F-actin is controlled by actin capping proteins, such as CapZ, which is a stable heterodimeric protein complex consisting of a and β subunits. However, the role of these capping proteins in endosomal trafficking remains elusive. Here, we found that CapZ docks to endocytic vesicles via its C-terminal actin-binding motif. CapZ knockout significantly increases the F-actin density around immature early endosomes, and this impedes fusion between these vesicles, manifested by the accumulation of small endocytic vesicles in CapZ-knockout cells. CapZ also recruits several RAB5 effectors, such as Rabaptin-5, to RAB5-positive early endosomes via its N-terminal domain, and this further activates RAB5. Collectively, our results indicate that CapZ regulates endosomal trafficking by controlling actin density around early endosomes and recruiting RAB5 effectors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enrichment of SARM1 alleles encoding variants with constitutively hyperactive NADase in patients with ALS and other motor nerve disorders</a></h4>

              
                SARM1, a protein with critical NADase activity, is a central executioner in a conserved programme of axon degeneration. We report seven rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human <i>SARM1</i> variant alleles in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other motor nerve disorders that alter the SARM1 auto-inhibitory ARM domain and constitutively hyperactivate SARM1 NADase activity. The constitutive NADase activity of these seven variants is similar to that of SARM1 lacking the entire ARM domain and greatly exceeds the activity of wild-type SARM1, even in the presence of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), its physiological activator. This rise in constitutive activity alone is enough to promote neuronal degeneration in response to otherwise non-harmful, mild stress. Importantly, these strong gain-of-function alleles are completely patient-specific in the cohorts studied and show a highly significant association with disease at the single gene level. These findings of disease-associated coding variants that alter SARM1 function build on previously reported genome-wide significant association with ALS for a neighbouring, more common <i>SARM1</i> intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to support a contributory role of SARM1 in these disorders. A broad phenotypic heterogeneity and variable age-of-onset of disease among patients with these alleles also raises intriguing questions about the pathogenic mechanism of hyperactive SARM1 variants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The critical role of the ventral temporal lobe in word retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in word retrieval are a hallmark of a variety of neurological illnesses spanning from dementia to traumatic injuries. The role of the dominant temporal lobe in fluent naming has been characterized by lesional analyses, functional imaging, and intracranial recordings, but limitations of each of these measures preclude a clear assessment of which specific constituent of the temporal lobe is critical for naming. We studied a large cohort of patients undergoing surgical resections or laser ablations of the dominant temporal lobe for medically intractable epilepsy (n=95). These techniques are exceedingly effective for seizure control but often result in language declines, particularly in confrontation naming, which can be socio-economically disabling. We used a multivariate voxel-based lesion symptom mapping analysis to localize brain regions significantly associated with visual object naming deficits. We observed that posterior inferior temporal regions, centered around the middle fusiform gyrus, were significantly associated with a decline in confrontation naming. Furthermore, we found that the posterior margin of anterior temporal lobectomies was linearly correlated to a decline in visual naming with a clinically significant decline occurring once the resection extended 6 cm from the anterior tip of the temporal lobe. We integrated these findings with electrocorticography during naming in a subset of this population and found that the majority of cortical regions whose resection was associated with a significant decline overlapped with regions that were functionally most active prior to articulation. Importantly, these loci coincide with the sites of susceptibility artifacts during echo-planar imaging, which explains why this region has not previously been implicated. Taken together, these data highlight the crucial contribution of the posterior ventral temporal cortex in lexical access and its important role in the pathophysiology of anomia following temporal lobe resections. Surgical strategies, including the use of laser ablation to target the medial temporal lobe as well as microsurgical approaches, should attempt to preserve this region to mitigate postoperative language deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spotlight of attention turns from rhythmic exploration-exploitation to a stable exploitation state</a></h4>

              
                While traditional studies claim that visuospatial attention stays fixed at one location at a time, recent research has rather shown that attention rhythmically fluctuates between different locations at rates of prominent brain rhythms. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of this fluctuation and, particularly, whether it changes over time. Thus, we addressed this question by investigating how visuospatial attention behaves over space and time. We recorded electroencephalographic activity of twenty-seven human participants while they performed a visuospatial cueing task, where attention was covertly oriented to the left or right visual field. In order to decode the spatial locus of attention from neural activity, we trained and tested a classifier on every timepoint of the orienting period, from the attentional cue to stimulus onset. This resulted in one temporal generalization matrix per participant, which was time-frequency decomposed to identify the sampling rhythm. Finally, a searchlight analysis was conducted to reveal the brain regions responsible for attention allocation. Our results show a dynamic evolution of the attentional spotlight, distinguishing between two states. In an early time window, attention explored both cued and uncued hemifield rhythmically at ~10 Hz. In a later time window attention focused on the cued hemifield. Classification was driven by occipital sources, while frontal regions exclusively became involved just before the spotlight settled onto the cued location. Together, our results define attentional sampling as a quasi-rhythmic dynamic process characterized by an initial rhythmic exploration-exploitation state, which is followed by a stable exploitation state.

                Background: Variation in the longitudinal course of childhood attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) coincides with neurodevelopmental maturation of brain structure and function. Prior work has attempted to determine how alterations in white matter (WM) relate to changes in symptom severity, but much of that work has been done in smaller cross-sectional samples using voxel-based analyses. Using standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods, we previously showed WM alterations were associated with ADHD symptom remission over time in a longitudinal sample of probands, siblings, and unaffected individuals. Here, we extend this work by further assessing the nature of these changes in WM microstructure by including an additional follow-up measurement (aged 18-34 years), and using the more physiologically informative fixel-based analysis (FBA). Methods: Data were obtained from 139 participants over 3 clinical and 2 follow-up DWI waves, and analyzed using FBA in regions-of-interest based on prior findings. We replicated previously reported significant models and extended them by adding another time-point, testing whether changes in combined and hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) continuous symptom scores are associated with fixel metrics at follow-up. Results: Clinical improvement in HI symptoms over time was associated with more fiber density at follow-up in the left corticospinal tract (lCST) (tmax=1.092, standardized effect[SE]=0.044, pFWE=0.016), and improvement in combined symptoms over time was associated with more fiber cross-section at follow-up in the lCST (tmax=3.775, SE=0.051, pFWE=0.019). Conclusions: Aberrant white matter development involves both lCST micro- and macrostructural alterations and its path may be moderated by preceding symptom trajectory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effortless integration of probabilistic visual input</a></h4>

              
                Prominent theories of perception suggest that the brain builds probabilistic models of the world, assessing the statistics of the visual input to inform this construction. However, the evidence for this idea is often based on simple impoverished stimuli, and the results have often been discarded as an illusion reflecting simple "summary statistics" of visual inputs. Here we show that the visual system represents probabilistic distributions of complex heterogeneous stimuli. Importantly, we show how these statistical representations are integrated with representations of other features and bound to locations, and can therefore serve as building blocks for object and scene processing. We uncover the organization of these representations at different spatial scales by showing how expectations for incoming features are biased by neighboring locations. We also show that there is not only a bias, but also a skew in the representations, arguing against accounts positing that probabilistic representations are discarded in favor of simplified summary statistics (e.g., mean and variance). In sum, our results reveal detailed probabilistic encoding of stimulus distributions, representations that are bound with other features and to particular locations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An insight into new glycotherapeutic in glial inflammation: Understanding the role of glycosylation from acute to chronic phase of inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Glycosylation plays a critical role during inflammation and glial scar formation upon spinal cord injury (SCI) disease progression. Astrocytes and microglia are involved in this cascade to modulate the inflammation and tissue remodelling from acute to chronic phases. Therefore, understating the glycan changes in these glial cells is paramount. Herein a lectin microarray was undertaken using a cytokine-driven inflammatory MGC model, revealing considerable differential glycosylation from the acute to the chronic phase in a cytokine-combination generated inflamed MGC model. It was found that several N- and O-linked glycans associated with glia during SCI were differentially regulated. Pearson's correlation hierarchical clustering showed that groups were separated into several clusters, illustrating the heterogenicity among the control, cytokine combination, and LPS treated groups and the day on which treatment was given. Control and LPS treatments were observed to be in dense clusters. This was further confirmed with lectin immunostaining in which GalNAc, GlcNAc, mannose, fucose and sialic acid-binding residues were detected in astrocytes and microglia. However, this modification (upregulation of sialic acid expression) was inhibited by the sialyltransferase inhibitor which indeed modulates the mitochondrial functions. The present study is the first functional investigation of glycosylation modulation in a MGC (MGC) model which elucidates the role of the glycome in neuroinflammation and identified potential therapeutic targets for future glycol- therapeutics in neuroinflammation

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slow fluctuations in ongoing brain activity decrease in amplitude with ageing yet their impact on task-related evoked responses is dissociable from behaviour</a></h4>

              
                In humans, ageing is characterized by decreased brain signal variability and increased behavioural variability. To understand how reduced brain variability segregates with increased behavioural variability, we investigated the association between reaction time variability, evoked brain responses and ongoing brain signal dynamics, in young (N = 36) and older adults (N = 39). We studied the electroencephalogram (EEG) and pupil size fluctuations to characterize the cortical and arousal responses elicited by a cued go/no-go task. Evoked responses were strongly modulated by slow (< 2 Hz) fluctuations of the ongoing signals, which presented reduced power in the older participants. Although variability of the evoked responses was lower in the older participants, once we adjusted for the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations, evoked responses were equally variable in both groups. Moreover, the modulation of the evoked responses caused by the ongoing signal fluctuations had no impact on reaction time, thereby explaining why although ongoing brain signal variability is decreased in older individuals, behavioural variability is not. Finally, we showed that adjusting for the effect of the ongoing signal was critical to unmask the link between neural responses and behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential replay for reward and punishment paths predicts approach and avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Planning is thought to involve neural replay, where states relevant to a task goal are rapidly reactivated in sequence. It remains unclear if, during planning, replay of a path relates to an actual prospective choice. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we studied participants while they planned to either approach or avoid an uncertain environment that contained paths leading to reward and to punishment. We show significant planning-related forward sequential replay with state-to-state transitions in the range of 20 to 90 ms. Replay of rewarding paths was boosted prior to a decision to avoid, and attenuated prior to a decision to approach. Crucially, a trial-by-trial bias in replaying punishing paths predicted an irrational choice to approach when a prospective environment was more risky, an effect that was particularly marked in more anxious participants. The findings reveal a coupling between the content of forwards replay and rational choice behaviour, such that replay prioritises an online representation of potential reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The influence of somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials on concurrent transcranial-magnetic stimulation electroencephalography recordings</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked potentials (TEPs) can be used to index cortical excitability. However, it remains unclear to what extent TEPs reflect somatosensory and auditory-evoked potentials which arise from the scalp sensation and click of the TMS coil, as opposed to transcranial stimulation of cortical circuits. Objectives: The present study had two aims; a) to determine the extent to which sensory potentials contaminate TEPs using a spatially matched sham condition, and b) to determine whether sensory potentials reflect auditory or somatosensory potentials alone, or a combination of the two. Methods: Twenty healthy participants received active or sham stimulation, with the latter consisting of the click of a sham coil combined with scalp electrical stimulation. Earplugs/headphones were used to suppress the TMS click noise. Two additional control conditions i) electrical stimulation alone and ii) auditory stimulation alone were included in a subset of 13 participants. Results: Signals from active and sham stimulation were correlated in spatial and temporal domains, especially >70ms post-stimulation. Relative to auditory or electrical stimulation alone, combined (sham) stimulation resulted in a) larger evoked responses b) stronger correlations with active stimulation and c) a signal that could not be explained by the linear sum of electrical and auditory stimulation alone. Conclusions: Sensory potentials can confound data interpretations of TEPs at timepoints >70ms post-TMS, while earlier timepoints appear reflective of cortical excitability. Furthermore, contamination of TEPs cannot be explained by auditory or somatosensory potentials alone, but instead reflects a non-linear interaction between both sources. Future studies may benefit from controlling for sensory contamination using sham conditions that are spatially matched to active TMS, and which consist of combined auditory and somatosensory stimulation.

                We report a novel subthreshold non-invasive brain stimulation approach that we refer to as kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation, or kTMP. kTMP is a magnetic induction method that delivers kHz-frequency cortical E-fields and, through amplitude modulation of the kHz carrier frequency, may mimic E-fields at physiological frequencies. To evaluate the efficacy of kTMP, we used suprathreshold TMS to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in a peripheral muscle, comparing the amplitude of the MEPs before and after kTMP stimulation. In Experiment 1, we used non-modulated kTMP with an E-field amplitude of 2 V/m over motor cortex. Ten minutes of kTMP stimulation resulted in an increase in cortical excitability in a frequency-specific manner. We replicated this effect in Experiment 2 and found that amplitude-modulation at 20 Hz produced an additional boost in cortical excitability. The only percept associated with kTMP is a faint auditory tone, making kTMP ideal for double-blind experimentation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trajectory of rich club properties in structural brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Many organizational principles of structural brain networks are established before birth and undergo considerable developmental changes afterwards. These include the topologically central hub regions and a densely connected rich club. While several studies have mapped developmental trajectories of brain connectivity and brain network organization across childhood and adolescence, comparatively little is known about subsequent development over the course of the lifespan. Here, we present a cross-sectional analysis of structural brain network development in N = 8,066 participants aged 5 to 80 years. Across all brain regions, structural connectivity strength followed an 'inverted-U'-shaped trajectory with vertex in the early 30s. Connectivity strength of hub regions showed a similar trajectory and the identity of hub regions remained stable across all age groups. While connectivity strength declined with advancing age, the organization of hub regions into a rich club did not only remain intact but became more pronounced, presumingly through a selected sparing of relevant connections from age-related connectivity loss. The stability of rich club organization in the face of overall age-related decline is consistent with a 'first come, last served' model of neurodevelopment, where the first principles to develop are the last to decline with age. Rich club organization has been shown to be highly beneficial for communicability and higher cognition. A resilient rich club might thus be protective of a functional loss in late adulthood and represent a neural reserve to sustain cognitive functioning in the aging brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired oligodendrocyte maturation is an early feature in SCA3 disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant ATXN3, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease in two selectively vulnerable brain regions, the cerebellum and brainstem. The most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These results reflect a toxic gain of function mechanism, as ATXN3 knockout mice do not exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is not simply a disease of neurons and the search for therapeutic strategies and disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 pathogenesis.

                The hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory. Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the in-vivo human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where, within the hippocampus, these cortical areas preferentially connect. Our results were striking in showing that different parts of the hippocampus preferentially connect with distinct cortical areas. Furthermore, we provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field by unveiling how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in-vivo and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal dependent memory systems in the human brain. This detailed characterization of how specific portions of the hippocampus anatomically connect with cortical brain regions may promote a better understanding of its role in cognition and we emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Not so fast: Limited validity of deep convolutional neural networks as in silico models for human naturalistic face processing</a></h4>

              
                Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification can rival and even exceed human-level performance. The relationships between internal representations learned by DCNNs and those of the primate face processing system are not well understood, especially in naturalistic settings. We developed the largest naturalistic dynamic face stimulus set in human neuroimaging research (700+ naturalistic video clips of unfamiliar faces) and used representational similarity analysis to investigate how well the representations learned by high-performing DCNNs match human brain representations across the entire distributed face processing system. DCNN representational geometries were strikingly consistent across diverse architectures and captured meaningful variance among faces. Similarly, representational geometries throughout the human face network were highly consistent across subjects. Nonetheless, correlations between DCNN and neural representations were very weak overall--DCNNs captured 3% of variance in the neural representational geometries at best. Intermediate DCNN layers better matched visual and face-selective cortices than the final fully-connected layers. Behavioral ratings of face similarity were highly correlated with intermediate layers of DCNNs, but also failed to capture representational geometry in the human brain. Our results suggest that the correspondence between intermediate DCNN layers and neural representations of naturalistic human face processing is weak at best, and diverges even further in the later fully-connected layers. This poor correspondence can be attributed, at least in part, to the dynamic and cognitive information that plays an essential role in human face processing but is not modeled by DCNNs. These mismatches indicate that current DCNNs have limited validity as in silico models of dynamic, naturalistic face processing in humans.

                The neocortex can be viewed as a tapestry consisting of variations of rather stereotypical local cortical microcircuits. Hence understanding how these microcircuits compute holds the key to understanding brain function. Intense research efforts over several decades have culminated in a detailed model of a generic cortical microcircuit in the primary visual cortex from the Allen Institute. We are presenting here methods and first results for understanding computational properties of this large-scale data-based model. We show that it can solve a standard image-change-detection task almost as well as the living brain. Furthermore, we unravel the computational strategy of the model and elucidate the computational role of diverse subtypes of neurons. Altogether this work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific potential of a methodology based on close interaction of detailed data and large-scale computer modelling for understanding brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hidden temporal structure of the ongoing task impacts detection strategy and is reflected in pupillary dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Estimating temporal regularities in incoming sensory inputs supports optimal decisions in noisy environments. In particular, inferred temporal structure can ease the detection of likely target events. Here we postulated that timely urgency signals can adapt subjects' decision-making to the ongoing task temporal structure, possibly through neuromodulatory tone. To test this hypothesis, we used an auditory change detection task in which targets followed a block-based temporal contingency, unbeknownst to participants. False alarm occurrences were driven by the distribution of target timings, indicating that participants adapted their behavior to the ongoing temporal structure. Task-evoked pupillary responses were larger for blocks with earliest target timings, and correlated with individual subjects' behavioral adaptation. Individual pupil responses matched an urgency signal extracted from a decision model fitted to behavior. This work demonstrates that internal temporal expectation can be tracked through pupillary dynamics, suggesting a role of neuromodulatory systems in context-dependent modulation of decision variable dynamics.

                Intracranial recordings from the human amygdala and the hippocampus during an emotional memory encoding and discrimination task reveal increased awake sharp-wave/ripples (aSWR) after encoding of emotional compared to neutral stimuli. Further, post-encoding aSWR-locked memory reinstatement in the amygdala and the hippocampus was predictive of later memory discrimination. These findings provide electrophysiological evidence that post-encoding aSWRs enhance memory for emotional events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sharing individualised template MRI data for MEG source reconstruction: a solution for open data while keeping subject confidentiality</a></h4>

              
                The increasing requirements for adoption of FAIR data management and sharing original research data from neuroimaging studies can be at odds with protecting the anonymity of the research participants due to the person-identifiable anatomical features in the data. We propose a solution to this dilemma for anatomical MRIs used in MEG source analysis. In MEG analysis, the channel-level data is reconstructed to the source-level using models derived from anatomical MRIs. Sharing data, therefore, requires sharing the anatomical MRI to replicate the analysis. The suggested solution is to replace the individual anatomical MRIs with individualised warped templates that can be used to carry out the MEG source analysis and that provide sufficient geometrical similarity to the original participants' MRIs. First, we demonstrate how the individualised template warping can be implemented with one of the leading open-source neuroimaging analysis toolboxes. Second, we compare results from four different MEG source reconstruction methods performed with an individualised warped template to those using the participant's original MRI. While the source reconstruction results are not numerically identical, there is a high similarity between the results for single dipole fits, dynamic imaging of coherent sources beamforming, and atlas-based virtual channel beamforming. There is a moderate similarity between minimum-norm estimates, as anticipated due to this method being anatomically constrained and dependent on the exact morphological features of the cortical sheet. We also compared the morphological features of the warped template to those of the original MRI. These showed a high similarity in grey matter volume and surface area, but a low similarity in the average cortical thickness and the mean folding index within cortical parcels. Taken together, this demonstrates that the results obtained by MEG source reconstruction can be preserved with the warped templates, whereas the anatomical and morphological fingerprint is sufficiently altered to protect the anonymity of research participants. In cases where participants consent to sharing anatomical MRI data, it remains preferable to share the original defaced data with an appropriate data use agreement. In cases where participants did not consent to share their MRIs, the individualised warped MRI template offers a good compromise in sharing data for reuse while retaining anonymity for those research participants.

                Social deficit is a major feature of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined neuronal discharge characteristics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of IRSp53-mutant mice, which show social deficits, during social approach. IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons displayed an increase in baseline neuronal firing and decreases in variability and dynamic range of firing rates and burst firing during social and non-social target approaches compared to wild-type controls. As a consequence, their firing activity was less differential between social and non-social targets. In addition, there was a decrease in the proportion of excitatory mPFC neurons encoding social information but not that of those encoding non-social information. These results suggest that insufficient neuronal activity dynamics may underlie impaired cortical encoding of social information and social behaviors in IRSp53-mutant mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus-induced narrow-band gamma oscillations in humans can be recorded using open-hardware low-cost EEG amplifier</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus-induced narrow-band gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) in human electro - encephalograph (EEG) have been linked to attentional and memory mechanisms and are abnormal in mental health conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. This suggests that gamma oscillations could be valuable both as a research tool and an inexpensive, non-invasive biomarker for disease evaluation. However, since the absolute power in EEG decreases rapidly with increasing frequency following a "1/f" power law, and the gamma band includes line noise frequency, these oscillations are highly susceptible to instrument noise. Previous studies that recorded stimulus-induced gamma oscillations used expensive research-grade EEG amplifiers to address this issue. While low-cost EEG amplifiers have become popular in Brain Computer Interface applications that mainly rely on low-frequency oscillations (<30 Hz) or steady-state-visually-evoked-potentials, whether they can also be used to measure stimulus-induced gamma oscillations is unknown. We recorded EEG signals using a low-cost, open-source amplifier (OpenBCI) and a traditional, research-grade amplifier (Brain Products GmbH) in male (N = 6) and female (N = 5) subjects (22-29 years) while they viewed full-screen static gratings that are known to induce gamma oscillations. OpenBCI recordings showed gamma response in almost all the subjects who showed a gamma response in Brain Products recordings, and the spectral and temporal profiles of these responses in alpha (8-13 Hz) and gamma bands were highly correlated between OpenBCI and Brain Products recordings. These results suggest that low-cost amplifiers can potentially be used in stimulus induced gamma response detection, making its research, and application in medicine more accessible.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Affinity Scores: An Individual-centric Fingerprinting Framework for Neuropsychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Background: Population-centric frameworks of biomarker identification for psychiatric disorders focus primarily on comparing averages between groups and assume that diagnostic groups are (1) mutually-exclusive, and (2) homogeneous. There is a paucity of individual-centric approaches capable of identifying individual-specific fingerprints across multiple domains. To address this, we propose a novel framework, combining a range of biopsychosocial markers, including brain structure, cognition, and clinical markers, into higher-level fingerprints, capable of capturing intra-illness heterogeneity and inter-illness overlap. Methods: A multivariate framework was implemented to identify individualised patterns of brain structure, cognition and clinical markers based on affinity to other participants in the database. First, individual-level affinity scores defined a neighbourhood for each participant across each measure based on variable-specific hop sizes. Next, diagnostic verification and classification algorithms were implemented based on multivariate affinity score profiles. To perform affinity-based classification, data were divided into training and test samples, and 5-fold nested cross-validation was performed on the training data. Affinity-based classification was compared to weighted K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classification. K-means clustering was used to create clusters based on multivariate affinity score profiles. The framework was applied to the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB) dataset. Results: Individualised affinity scores provided a fingerprint of brain structure, cognition, and clinical markers, which described the affinity of an individual to the representative groups in the dataset Diagnostic verification capability was moderate to high depending on the choice of multivariate affinity metric. Affinity score-based classification achieved a high degree of accuracy in the training, nested cross-validation and prediction steps, and outperformed KNN classification in the training and test datasets. Conclusion: Affinity scores demonstrate utility in two keys ways: (1) Early and accurate diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders, whereby an individual can be grouped within a diagnostic category/ies that best matches their fingerprint, and (2) identification of biopsychosocial factors that most strongly characterise individuals/disorders, and which may be most amenable to intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Micro-state-based neural decoding of speech categorization using Bayesian non-parametrics</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the many-to-many mapping between patterns of functional brain connectivity and discrete behavioral responses is critical for speech-language processing. We present a microstate-based analysis of EEG recordings to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics of neural activities that underly rapid speech categorization decisions. We implemented a data driven approach using Bayesian non-parametrics to capture the mapping between EEG and the speed of listeners phoneme identification [i.e., response time (RT)] during speech labeling tasks. Based on our empirical analyses, we show task-relevant events such as resting-state, stimulus coding, auditory-perceptual object (category) formation, and response selection can be explained using patterns of micro-state dwell-time and are decodable as unique time segments during speech perception. State-dependent activities localize to a fronto-temporo-parietal circuit (superior temporal, supramarginal, inferior frontal gyri) exposing a core decision brain network (DN) underlying rapid speech categorization. Furthermore, RTs were inversely proportional to the frequency of state transitions, such that the rate of change between brain microstates was higher for trials with slower compared to faster RTs. Our findings imply that during rapid speech perception, higher uncertainty producing prolonged RTs (slower decision-making) is associated with staying in the DN longer compared lower RTs (faster decisions). We also show that listeners perceptual RTs are highly sensitive to individual differences. Our computational method opens a new avenue in segmentation and dynamic brain connectivity for modeling neuroimaging data and understanding task-related cognitive events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The output of interneurons in the primary visual cortex is best reflected by pre-synaptic activity, not somatic activity</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in 2-photon calcium-imaging in awake mice have made it possible to study the effect of different behavioural states on cortical circuitry. Many studies assume that somatic activity can be used as a measure for neuronal output. We set out to test the validity of this assumption by comparing somatic activity with the pre-synaptic activity of VIP (Vasoactive intestinal peptide)- and SST (Somatostatin)-positive interneurons in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We used mice expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators in VIP/SST-interneurons across the whole cell (VIP/SST:GCaMP6f) or confined to pre-synapses (VIP/SST:SyGCaMP5). Mice were exposed to a full-field visual stimulation protocol consisting of 60-second-long presentations of moving Gabor gratings (0.04 cpd, 2 Hz) alternated by 30 seconds of grey screen. During imaging, mice were placed on an air-suspended Styrofoam ball, allowing them to run voluntarily. We compared neural activity during three 4-second time-windows: Before visual stimulation (-4 to 0 sec), during the initial onset (1 to 5 sec) and at the end of the stimulation (56 to 60 sec.). These were further compared while the mice were stationary and while they were voluntarily locomoting. Unlike VIP-somas, VIP-pre-synapses showed strong suppressive responses to the visual stimulus. Furthermore, VIP-somas were positively correlated with locomotion, whereas in VIP-synapses we observed a split between positive and negative correlations. In addition, a similar but weaker distinction was found between SST-somas and pre-synapses. The excitatory effect of locomotion in VIP-somas increased over the course of the visual stimulus but this property was only shared with the positively correlated VIP-pre-synapses. The remaining negatively correlated pre-synapses showed no relation to the overall activity of the Soma. Our results suggest that when making statements about the involvement of interneurons in V1 layer 2/3 circuitry it is crucial to measure from synaptic terminals as well as from somas.

                Feature-based attention supports the selection of goal-relevant stimuli by enhancing the visual processing of attended features. A defining property of feature-based attention is that it modulates visual processing beyond the focus of spatial attention. Previous work has reported such spatially-global effects for low-level features such as color and orientation, as well as for faces. Here, using fMRI, we provide evidence for spatially-global attentional modulation for human bodies. Participants were cued to search for one of six object categories in two vertically-aligned images. Two additional, horizontally-aligned, images were simultaneously presented but were never task-relevant across three experimental sessions. Analyses time-locked to the objects presented in these task-irrelevant images revealed that responses evoked by body silhouettes were modulated by the participants' top-down attentional set, becoming more body-selective when participants searched for bodies in the task-relevant images. These effects were observed both in univariate analyses of the body-selective cortex and in multivariate analyses of the object-selective visual cortex. Additional analyses showed that this modulation reflected response gain rather than a bias induced by the cues, and that it reflected enhancement of body responses rather than suppression of non-body responses. Finally, the features of early layers of a convolutional neural network trained for object recognition could not be used to accurately categorize body silhouettes, indicating that the fMRI results were unlikely to reflect selection based on low-level features. These findings provide the first evidence for spatially-global feature-based attention for human bodies, linking this modulation to body representations in high-level visual cortex.

                mGlu3 receptors control the sleep/wake architecture which plays a role in the glutamatergic pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Interestingly, mGlu3 receptors expression is decreased in the brain of schizophrenic patients. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptors at the cell membrane. Subcellular receptor localization is strongly dependent on protein-protein interactions. Here we show that mGlu3 interacts with PICK1 and that their binding is important for receptor surface expression and function. Disruption of their interaction via an mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide or an inhibitor of the PDZ domain of PICK1 altered the functional expression of mGlu3 receptors. Consequently, we investigated whether disruption of the mGlu3-PICK1 interaction affects hippocampal theta oscillations in vitro and in vivo. We found a decreased frequency of theta oscillations in organotypic hippocampal slices, similar to what previously observed in mGlu3 -/- mice. In addition, hippocampal theta power was reduced during REM sleep, NREM sleep and wake states after intra-ventricular administration of the mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide. Targeting the mGlu3-PICK1 complex could thus be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetrical choice-related ensemble activity in direct and indirect-pathway striatal neurons drives perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Action selection during decision-making depends on the basal ganglia circuits that comprise the direct and indirect pathways known to oppositely control movement. However, the mechanism for coordinating these opponent pathways during decision-making remains unclear. We address this by employing deep-brain two-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulations of the direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) in the posterior striatum during an auditory decision-making behavior. We show that while dSPNs and iSPNs play opposite causal roles during decision-making, each subtype contains divergent ensembles preferring different choices. The ensembles in dSPNs show stronger contralateral dominance than those in iSPNs manifested by higher-level activation and synchronization. Consistent with this asymmetrical contralateral dominance, optogenetic disinhibition of both pathways promoted contralateral choices. A computational model incorporating the striatal ensemble asymmetry recapitulated the causal behavioral effects. Our results uncover the asymmetry between opponent SPN ensembles as a circuit mechanism for action selection during decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lonely in the dark: trauma memory and sex-specific dysregulation of amygdala reactivity to fear signals</a></h4>

              
                Loneliness exacerbates psychological distress and increases the risk of psychopathology after trauma exposure. The prevalence of trauma-associated disorders varies substantially between sexes, and accumulating evidence indicates sex-specific effects of loneliness. However, it is still unclear whether a lack of social connectedness affects trauma-induced intrusions and the neural processing of fear signals. Moreover, it is uncertain, whether loneliness plays a different role in women and men. We used a prestratification strategy and recruited n=47 (n=20 women) healthy individuals with high loneliness and n=35 controls (n=18 women). Participants were exposed to an experimental trauma and evoked intrusive thoughts in daily life were monitored for three consecutive days. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural habituation to fearful faces and fear learning (conditioning and extinction) prior to trauma exposure. The total number of intrusions and amygdala reactivity in neural fear processing served as the primary study outcomes. Our results revealed a significant interaction between loneliness and sex such that loneliness was associated with more intrusions in men, but not in women. A similar pattern emerged at the neural level, with both reduced amygdala habituation to repeated fearful faces and amygdala hyperreactivity during the conditioning of fear signals in lonely men, but not in women. Our findings indicate that loneliness may confer vulnerability to intrusive memories after trauma exposure in healthy men and that this phenotype relates to altered limbic processing of fear signals. Collectively, interventions targeting social connectedness may mitigate the sequelae of traumatic experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison of seven modelling algorithms for GABA-edited 1H-MRS</a></h4>

              
                Edited MRS sequences are widely used for studying GABA in the human brain. Several algorithms are available for modelling these data, deriving metabolite concentration estimates through peak fitting or a linear combination of basis spectra. The present study compares seven such algorithms, using data obtained in a large multi-site study. GABA-edited (GABA+, TE = 68 ms MEGA-PRESS) data from 222 subjects at 20 sites were processed via a standardised pipeline, before modelling with FSL-MRS, Gannet, AMARES, QUEST, LCModel, Osprey and Tarquin, using standardised vendor-specific basis sets (for GE, Philips and Siemens) where appropriate. After referencing metabolite estimates (to water or creatine), systematic differences in scale were observed between datasets acquired on different vendors' hardware, presenting across algorithms. Scale differences across algorithms were also observed. Using the correlation between metabolite estimates and voxel tissue fraction as a benchmark, most algorithms were found to be similarly effective in detecting differences in GABA+. An inter-class correlation across all algorithms showed single-rater consistency for GABA+ estimates of around 0.38, indicating moderate agreement. Upon inclusion of a basis set component explicitly modelling the macromolecule signal underlying the observed 3.0 ppm GABA peaks, single-rater consistency improved to 0.44. Correlation between discrete pairs of algorithms varied, and was concerningly weak in some cases. Our findings highlight the need for consensus on appropriate modelling parameters across different algorithms, and for detailed reporting of the parameters adopted in individual studies to ensure reproducibility and meaningful comparison of outcomes between different studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Flip-flop neuron - A memory efficient alternative for solving challenging sequence processing and decision making problems</a></h4>

              
                Sequential decision making tasks that require information integration over extended durations of time are challenging for several reasons including the problem of vanishing gradients, long training times and significant memory requirements. To this end we propose a neuron model fashioned after the JK flip-flops in digital systems. A flip-flop is a sequential device that can store state information of the previous history. We incorporate the JK flip-flop neuron into several deep network architectures and apply the networks to difficult sequence processing problems. The proposed architectures include flip-flop neural networks (FFNNs), bidirectional flip-flop neural networks (BiFFNNs), convolutional flip-flop neural networks (ConvFFNNs), and bidirectional convolutional flip-flop neural networks (BiConvFFNNs). Learning rules of proposed architectures have also been derived. We have considered the most popular benchmark sequential tasks like signal generation, sentiment analysis, handwriting generation, text generation, video frame prediction, lung volume prediction, and action recognition to evaluate the proposed networks. Finally, we compare the results of our networks with the results from analogous networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neurons on the same sequential tasks. Our results show that the JK flip-flop networks outperform the LSTM networks significantly or marginally on all the tasks, with only half of the trainable parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The sleep EEG envelope: a novel, neuronal firing-based human biomarker</a></h4>

              
                Sleep EEG reflects instantaneous voltage differences relative to a reference, while its spectrum reflects the degree to which it is comprised of oscillations at various frequencies. In contrast, the envelope of the sleep EEG reflects the instantaneous amplitude of oscillations at specific frequencies, and its spectrum reflects the rhythmicity of the occurrence of these oscillations. The ordinary sleep EEG and its spectrum have been extensively studied and its individual stability and relationship to various demographic characteristics, psychological traits and pathologies is well known. In contrast, the envelope spectrum has not been extensively studied before. In two studies, we explored the generating mechanisms and utility of studying the envelope of the sleep EEG. First, we used human invasive data from cortex-penetrating microelectrodes and subdural grids to demonstrate that the sleep EEG envelope spectrum reflects local neuronal firing. Second, we used a large database of healthy volunteers to demonstrate that the scalp EEG envelope spectrum is highly stable within individuals, especially in NREM sleep, and that it is affected by age and sex. Multivariate models based on a learning algorithm could predict both age (r=0.6) and sex (r=0.5) with considerable accuracy from the EEG envelope spectrum. With age, oscillations characteristically shifted from a 4-5 second rhythm to higher rhythms. The envelope spectrum was not associated with general cognitive ability (IQ). Our results demonstrate that the sleep envelope spectrum is a promising, neuronal firing-based biomarker of various demographic and disease-related phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial OPA1 deficiency causes reversible defects in adult neurogenesis-associated spatial memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are integrative hubs central to cellular adaptive pathways. Such pathways are critical in highly differentiated post-mitotic neurons, the plasticity of which sustains brain function. Consequently, defects in mitochondrial dynamics and quality control appear instrumental in neurodegenerative diseases and may also participate in cognitive impairments. To directly test this hypothesis, we analyzed cognitive performances in a mouse mitochondria-based disease model, due to haploinsufficiency in the mitochondrial optic-atrophy-type-1 (OPA1) protein. While in Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA) models, the known main symptoms are late onset visual deficits, we discovered early impairments in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory attributable to defects in adult neurogenesis. Moreover, less connected hippocampal adult-born neurons showed a decrease in mitochondrial content. Remarkably, modulating mitochondrial function through voluntary exercise or pharmacological treatment restored spatial memory. Altogether, our study identifies a crucial role for OPA1-dependent mitochondrial functions in adult neurogenesis, and thus in hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions. More generally, our findings show that adult neurogenesis is highly sensitive to mild mitochondrial defects, generating impairments in spatial memory that can be detected at an early stage and counterbalanced by physical exercise and pharmacological targeting of mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, early amplification of mitochondrial function appears beneficial for late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploratory methods for high-performance EEG speech decoding</a></h4>

              
                State-of-the-art technologies in neural speech decoding utilize data collected from microwires or microarrays implanted directly into the cerebral cortex. Yet as a tool accessible only to individuals with implanted electrodes, speech decoding from devices of this nature is severely limited in its implementation, and cannot be considered a viable solution for widespread application. Speech decoding from non-invasive EEG signals can achieve relatively high accuracy (70-80%), but only from very small classification tasks, with more complex tasks typically yielding a limited (20-50%) classification accuracy. We propose a novel combination of technologies in which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is first applied to augment the neural signals of interest, producing a greater signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG data. Next, delay differential analysis (DDA) -- a cutting-edge computational method based on nonlinear dynamics -- is implemented to capture the widest range of information available in the neural signal, by incorporating both linear and nonlinear dynamics.

	<p>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a neuromodulation procedure that is currently studied for the purpose of improving cognitive function in various diseases. A few studies have shown positive effects of tACS in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying tACS has not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of tACS in five familial AD mutation (5xFAD) mouse models. We prepared twenty 4-month-old mice and divided them into four groups: wild-type mice without stimulation (WT-NT group), wild-type mice with tACS (WT-T group), 5xFAD mice without stimulation (AD-NT group), and 5xFAD mice with tACS (AD-T group). The protocol implemented was as follows: gamma frequency 200 μA over the bilateral frontal lobe for 20 min over 2 weeks. The following tests were conducted: excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) recording, Western blot analysis (cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) proteins, phosphorylated CREB proteins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and parvalbumin) to examine the synaptic plasticity. The EPSP was remarkably increased in the AD-T group compared with in the AD-NT group. In the Western blot analysis, the differences among the groups were not significant. Hence, tACS can affect the long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission in mice models of AD.</p>

	<p>Studies comparing organized (O) and unresolved/disorganized (UD) attachment have consistently shown structural and functional brain abnormalities, although whether and how attachment patterns may affect resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) is still little characterized. Here, we investigated RSFC of temporal and limbic regions of interest for UD attachment. Participants’ attachment was classified via the Adult Attachment Interview, and all participants underwent clinical assessment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 11 UD individuals and seven matched O participants during rest. A seed-to-voxel analysis was performed, including the anterior and the posterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral insula, amygdala and hippocampus as seed regions. No group differences in the clinical scales emerged. Compared to O, the UD group showed lower RSFC between the left amygdala and the left cerebellum (lobules VIII), and lower functional coupling between the right hippocampus and the posterior portion of the right middle temporal gyrus. Moreover, UD participants showed higher RSFC between the right amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings suggest RSFC alterations in regions associated with encoding of salient events, emotion processing, memories retrieval and self-referential processing in UD participants, highlighting the potential role of attachment experiences in shaping brain abnormalities also in non-clinical UD individuals.</p>

	<p>The insula plays a critical role in many neuropsychological disorders. Research investigating its neurochemistry with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been limited compared with cortical regions. Here, we investigate the within-session and between-session reproducibility of metabolite measurements in the insula on a 3T scanner. We measure N-acetylaspartate + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA), creatine + phosphocreatine (tCr), glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine (tCho), myo-inositol (Ins), glutamate + glutamine (Glx), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in one cohort using a j-edited MEGA-PRESS sequence. We measure tNAA, tCr, tCho, Ins, and Glx in another cohort with a standard short-TE PRESS sequence as a reference for the reproducibility metrics. All participants were scanned 4 times identically: 2 back-to-back scans each day, on 2 days. Preprocessing was done using LCModel and Gannet. Reproducibility was determined using Pearson’s r, intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficients of variation (CV%), and Bland–Altman plots. A MEGA-PRESS protocol requiring averaged results over two 6:45-min scans yielded reproducible GABA measurements (CV% = 7.15%). This averaging also yielded reproducibility metrics comparable to those from PRESS for the other metabolites. Voxel placement inconsistencies did not affect reproducibility, and no sex differences were found. The data suggest that MEGA-PRESS can reliably measure standard metabolites and GABA in the insula.</p>

	<p> Voluntary force modulation is defined as the ability to tune the application of force during motion. However, the mechanisms behind this modulation are not yet fully understood. In this study, we examine muscle activity under various resistance levels at a fixed cycling speed. The main goal of this research is to identify significant changes in muscle activation related to the real-time tuning of muscle force. This work revealed significant motor adaptations of the main muscles utilized in cycling as well as positive associations between the force level and the temporal and spatial inter-cycle stability in the distribution of sEMG activity. From these results, relevant biomarkers of motor adaptation could be extracted for application in clinical rehabilitation to increase the efficacy of physical therapy.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathologies has distinctive stage-specific effects on the structural and functional brain networks along the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum. A more comprehensive account of both types of brain network may provide a better characterization of the stage-specific effects of Aβ pathologies. A potential candidate for this joint characterization is the coupling between the structural and functional brain networks (SC-FC coupling). We therefore investigated the effect of Aβ accumulation on global SC-FC coupling in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and healthy controls. Patients with MCI were dichotomized according to their level of Aβ pathology seen in 18F-flutemetamol PET-CT scans—namely, Aβ-negative and Aβ-positive. Our results show that there was no difference in global SC-FC coupling between different cohorts. During the prodromal AD stage, there was a significant negative correlation between the level of Aβ pathology and the global SC-FC coupling of MCI patients with positive Aβ, but no significant correlation for MCI patients with negative Aβ. During the AD dementia stage, the correlation between Aβ pathology and global SC-FC coupling in patients with AD was positive. Our results suggest that Aβ pathology has distinctive stage-specific effects on global coupling between the structural and functional brain networks along the AD continuum.</p>

	<p>A difficulty in encoding spatial information in an egocentric (i.e., body-to-object) and especially allocentric (i.e., object-to-object) manner, and impairments in executive function (EF) are typical in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD). Since executive functions are involved in spatial encodings, it is important to understand the extent of their reciprocal or selective impairment. To this end, AD patients, aMCI and healthy elderly people had to provide egocentric (What object was closest to you?) and allocentric (What object was closest to object X?) judgments about memorized objects. Participants&#039; frontal functions, attentional resources and visual-spatial memory were assessed with the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), the Trail Making Test (TMT) and the Corsi Block Tapping Test (forward/backward). Results showed that ADs performed worse than all others in all tasks but did not differ from aMCIs in allocentric judgments and Corsi forward. Regression analyses showed, although to different degrees in the three groups, a link between attentional resources, visuo-spatial memory and egocentric performance, and between frontal resources and allocentric performance. Therefore, visuo-spatial memory, especially when it involves allocentric frames and requires demanding active processing, should be carefully assessed to reveal early signs of conversion from aMCI to AD.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate whole-brain spontaneous activities changes in patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), and to evaluate the relationships between these brain alterations and their neuropsychological assessments. Thirty-one patients with VaMCI and thirty-one healthy controls (HCs) underwent structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological assessments. The functional alterations were determined by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and degree centrality (DC). The gray matter volume (GMV) changes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between the structural and functional changes of brain regions and neuropsychological assessments. The VaMCI group had significantly lower scores in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and higher scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Compared to the HCs, the VaMCI group exhibited GM atrophy in the right precentral gyrus (PreCG) and right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). VaMCI patients further exhibited significantly decreased brain activity within the default mode network (DMN), including the bilateral precuneus (PCu), angular gyrus (AG), and medial frontal gyrus (medFG). Linear regression analysis revealed that the decreased ALFF was independently associated with lower MoCA scores, and the GM atrophy was independently associated with higher HAMD scores. The current finding suggested that aberrant spontaneous brain activity in the DMN might subserve as a potential biomarker of VaMCI, which may highlight the underlying mechanism of cognitive decline in cerebral small vessel disease.</p>

	<p>Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in epilepsy surgery patients has a long history of functional brain mapping and seizure triggering. Here, we review its findings when applied to the insula in order to map the insular functions, evaluate its local and distant connections, and trigger seizures. Clinical responses to insular DCS are frequent and diverse, showing a partial segregation with spatial overlap, including a posterior somatosensory, auditory, and vestibular part, a central olfactory-gustatory region, and an anterior visceral and cognitive-emotional portion. The study of cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) has shown that the anterior (resp. posterior) insula has a higher connectivity rate with itself than with the posterior (resp. anterior) insula, and that both the anterior and posterior insula are closely connected, notably between the homologous insular subdivisions. All insular gyri show extensive and complex ipsilateral and contralateral extra-insular connections, more anteriorly for the anterior insula and more posteriorly for the posterior insula. As a rule, CCEPs propagate first and with a higher probability around the insular DCS site, then to the homologous region, and later to more distal regions with fast cortico-cortical axonal conduction delays. Seizures elicited by insular DCS have rarely been specifically studied, but their rate does not seem to differ from those of other DCS studies. They are mainly provoked from the insular seizure onset zone but can also be triggered by stimulating intra- and extra-insular early propagation zones. Overall, in line with the neuroimaging studies, insular DCS studies converge on the view that the insula is a multimodal functional hub with a fast propagation of information, whose organization helps understand where insular seizures start and how they propagate.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>For proper execution of goal-directed behaviors, individuals require both a general representation of the goal and an ability to monitor their own progress toward that goal. Here, we examine how dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a region pivotal for forming associations among stimuli, actions, and outcomes, encodes the execution of goal-directed action sequences that require self-monitoring of behavior. We trained rats to complete a sequence of at least five consecutive lever presses (without visiting the reward port) to obtain a reward and recorded the activity of individual cells in DMS while rats performed the task. We found that the pattern of DMS activity gradually changed during the execution of the sequence, permitting accurate decoding of sequence progress from neural activity at a population level. Moreover, this sequence-related activity was blunted on trials where rats did not complete a sufficient number of presses. Overall, these data suggest a link between DMS activity and the execution of behavioral sequences that require monitoring of ongoing behavior.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) that is localized within neurons and plays crucial roles in RNA metabolism. Its importance in neuronal functioning is underscored from the study of its pathogenic features in many neurodegenerative diseases where neuronal hnRNP A1 is mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in loss of hnRNP A1 function. Here, we model hnRNP A1 loss-of-function by siRNA-mediated knock-down in differentiated Neuro-2a cells. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by gene ontology (GO) analyses, we show that hnRNP A1 is involved in important biological processes, including RNA metabolism, neuronal function, neuronal morphology, neuronal viability, and stress granule (SG) formation. We further confirmed several of these roles by showing that hnRNP A1 knock-down results in a reduction of neurite outgrowth, increase in cell cytotoxicity and changes in SG formation. In summary, these findings indicate that hnRNP A1 loss-of-function contributes to neuronal dysfunction and cell death and implicates hnRNP A1 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background: Both smoked and smokeless tobacco use have deleterious effects on most major organ systems including the reproductive system. We conducted a systematic review on smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and reproductive outcomes among women. Methods: We searched Pubmed, ProQuest, Cochrane, Wiley and Emerald databases for studies involving smokeless tobacco use in women with any or a combination of three conditions: infertility, menstrual disorders and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Eligibility criteria included English language publications from 1st January 1990 - 31st October 2020. CADIMA software used for filtering the studies and modified SIGN checklist for the quality assessment. The findings are reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. The AXIS and ROBIN E tool were used for assessment of risk of bias. Results: In total, three studies addressed our research question. Two studies addressed infertility (prospective cohort: n=501, cross sectional: n=192) of which, the cross-sectional study compared the mean cotinine levels between those with infertility, menstrual disorders and PID. This study also explored the association between SLT and PID. PID was the most common gynecological complaint. Women with PID had significantly higher urinary cotinine levels = 24.95±12.259) ng/ ml (p=0.0144). Mean urinary cotinine in women with menstrual complaints was 19.32±10.29 ng/ml.  The other study used population-based sampling of 501 couples who attempted pregnancy (enrolled in the LIFE Study).  Results showed that only 2% (n=28) of men and none of the women used smokeless tobacco.  Compared with never users of tobacco, smoking by females was individually associated with longer time-to-pregnancy;  smoking among males remained significant when modeling partners together. Conclusions: Available studies exploring associations between SLT and reproductive outcomes are inconclusive due to limitations in the study methodologies. More studies with robust study designs are required from low- and middle-income countries with high prevalence of SLT use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferred expression regulator activities suggest genes mediating cardiometabolic genetic signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason W. Hoskins, Charles C. Chung, Aidan O’Brien, Jun Zhong, Katelyn Connelly, Irene Collins, Jianxin Shi, Laufey T. Amundadottir</p>

Expression QTL (eQTL) analyses have suggested many genes mediating genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals but most GWAS signals still lack compelling explanatory genes. We have leveraged an adipose-specific gene regulatory network to infer expression regulator activities and phenotypic master regulators (MRs), which were used to detect activity QTLs (aQTLs) at cardiometabolic trait GWAS loci. Regulator activities were inferred with the VIPER algorithm that integrates enrichment of expected expression changes among a regulator’s target genes with confidence in their regulator-target network interactions and target overlap between different regulators (i.e., pleiotropy). Phenotypic MRs were identified as those regulators whose activities were most important in predicting their respective phenotypes using random forest modeling. While eQTLs were typically more significant than aQTLs in <i>cis</i>, the opposite was true among candidate MRs in <i>trans</i>. Several GWAS loci colocalized with MR <i>trans</i>-eQTLs/aQTLs in the absence of colocalized <i>cis</i>-QTLs. Intriguingly, at the 1p36.1 BMI GWAS locus the <i>EPHB2 cis</i>-aQTL was stronger than its <i>cis</i>-eQTL and colocalized with the GWAS signal and 35 BMI MR <i>trans</i>-aQTLs, suggesting the GWAS signal may be mediated by effects on <i>EPHB2</i> activity and its downstream effects on a network of BMI MRs. These MR and aQTL analyses represent systems genetic methods that may be broadly applied to supplement standard eQTL analyses for suggesting molecular effects mediating GWAS signals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparative genomic analysis reveals varying levels of mammalian adaptation to coronavirus infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sean B. King, Mona Singh</p>

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, is of zoonotic origin. Evolutionary analyses assessing whether coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 infected ancestral species of modern-day animal hosts could be useful in identifying additional reservoirs of potentially dangerous coronaviruses. We reasoned that if a clade of species has been repeatedly exposed to a virus, then their proteins relevant for viral entry may exhibit adaptations that affect host susceptibility or response. We perform comparative analyses across the mammalian phylogeny of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in order to uncover evidence for selection acting at its binding interface with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We uncover that in rodents there is evidence for adaptive amino acid substitutions at positions comprising the ACE2-spike interaction interface, whereas the variation within ACE2 proteins in primates and some other mammalian clades is not consistent with evolutionary adaptations. We also analyze aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for the human coronavirus 229E, a virus that causes the common cold, and find evidence for adaptation in primates. Altogether, our results suggest that the rodent and primate lineages may have had ancient exposures to viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Perspectives for the reconstruction of 3D chromatin conformation using single cell Hi-C data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pavel I. Kos, Aleksandra A. Galitsyna, Sergey V. Ulianov, Mikhail S. Gelfand, Sergey V. Razin, Alexander V. Chertovich</p>

Construction of chromosomes 3D models based on single cell Hi-C data constitute an important challenge. We present a reconstruction approach, DPDchrom, that incorporates basic knowledge whether the reconstructed conformation should be coil-like or globular and spring relaxation at contact sites. In contrast to previously published protocols, DPDchrom can naturally form globular conformation due to the presence of explicit solvent. Benchmarking of this and several other methods on artificial polymer models reveals similar reconstruction accuracy at high contact density and DPDchrom advantage at low contact density. To compare 3D structures insensitively to spatial orientation and scale, we propose the Modified Jaccard Index. We analyzed two sources of the contact dropout: contact radius change and random contact sampling. We found that the reconstruction accuracy exponentially depends on the number of contacts per genomic bin allowing to estimate the reconstruction accuracy in advance. We applied DPDchrom to model chromosome configurations based on single-cell Hi-C data of mouse oocytes and found that these configurations differ significantly from a random one, that is consistent with other studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The meaning of significant mean group differences for biomarker discovery</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eva Loth, Jumana Ahmad, Chris Chatham, Beatriz López, Ben Carter, Daisy Crawley, Bethany Oakley, Hannah Hayward, Jennifer Cooke, Antonia San José Cáceres, Danilo Bzdok, Emily Jones, Tony Charman, Christian Beckmann, Thomas Bourgeron, Roberto Toro, Jan Buitelaar, Declan Murphy, Guillaume Dumas</p>

Over the past decade, biomarker discovery has become a key goal in psychiatry to aid in the more reliable diagnosis and prognosis of heterogeneous psychiatric conditions and the development of tailored therapies. Nevertheless, the prevailing statistical approach is still the mean group comparison between “cases” and “controls,” which tends to ignore within-group variability. In this educational article, we used empirical data simulations to investigate how effect size, sample size, and the shape of distributions impact the interpretation of mean group differences for biomarker discovery. We then applied these statistical criteria to evaluate biomarker discovery in one area of psychiatric research—autism research. Across the most influential areas of autism research, effect size estimates ranged from small (<i>d</i> = 0.21, anatomical structure) to medium (<i>d</i> = 0.36 electrophysiology, <i>d</i> = 0.5, eye-tracking) to large (<i>d</i> = 1.1 theory of mind). We show that in normal distributions, this translates to approximately 45% to 63% of cases performing within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the typical range, i.e., they do not have a deficit/atypicality in a statistical sense. For a measure to have diagnostic utility as defined by 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity, Cohen’s <i>d</i> of 1.66 is required, with still 40% of cases falling within 1 SD. However, in both normal and nonnormal distributions, 1 (skewness) or 2 (platykurtic, bimodal) biologically plausible subgroups may exist despite small or even nonsignificant mean group differences. This conclusion drastically contrasts the way mean group differences are frequently reported. Over 95% of studies omitted the “on average” when summarising their findings in their abstracts (“autistic people have deficits in X”), which can be misleading as it implies that the group-level difference applies to all individuals in that group. We outline practical approaches and steps for researchers to explore mean group comparisons for the discovery of stratification biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attention controls multisensory perception via 2 distinct mechanisms at different levels of the cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ambra Ferrari, Uta Noppeney</p>

To form a percept of the multisensory world, the brain needs to integrate signals from common sources weighted by their reliabilities and segregate those from independent sources. Previously, we have shown that anterior parietal cortices combine sensory signals into representations that take into account the signals’ causal structure (i.e., common versus independent sources) and their sensory reliabilities as predicted by Bayesian causal inference. The current study asks to what extent and how attentional mechanisms can actively control how sensory signals are combined for perceptual inference. In a pre- and postcueing paradigm, we presented observers with audiovisual signals at variable spatial disparities. Observers were precued to attend to auditory or visual modalities prior to stimulus presentation and postcued to report their perceived auditory or visual location. Combining psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and Bayesian modelling, we demonstrate that the brain moulds multisensory inference via 2 distinct mechanisms. Prestimulus attention to vision enhances the reliability and influence of visual inputs on spatial representations in visual and posterior parietal cortices. Poststimulus report determines how parietal cortices flexibly combine sensory estimates into spatial representations consistent with Bayesian causal inference. Our results show that distinct neural mechanisms control how signals are combined for perceptual inference at different levels of the cortical hierarchy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of astroglia-like cardiac nexus glia that are critical regulators of cardiac development and function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina L. Kikel-Coury, Jacob P. Brandt, Isabel A. Correia, Michael R. O’Dea, Dana F. DeSantis, Felicity Sterling, Kevin Vaughan, Gulberk Ozcebe, Pinar Zorlutuna, Cody J. Smith</p>

Glial cells are essential for functionality of the nervous system. Growing evidence underscores the importance of astrocytes; however, analogous astroglia in peripheral organs are poorly understood. Using confocal time-lapse imaging, fate mapping, and mutant genesis in a zebrafish model, we identify a neural crest–derived glial cell, termed nexus glia, which utilizes Meteorin signaling via Jak/Stat3 to drive differentiation and regulate heart rate and rhythm. Nexus glia are labeled with <i>gfap</i>, <i>glast</i>, and <i>glutamine synthetase</i>, markers that typically denote astroglia cells. Further, analysis of single-cell sequencing datasets of human and murine hearts across ages reveals astrocyte-like cells, which we confirm through a multispecies approach. We show that cardiac nexus glia at the outflow tract are critical regulators of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system. These data establish the crucial role of glia on cardiac homeostasis and provide a description of nexus glia in the PNS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mobile banking adoption and usage among Generation Y Malaysians [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: By 2018, Malaysian mobile banking services made the third-largest amount of banking transactions, following credit card and Internet banking. In addition, it significantly contributes to the banking industry by providing easier transactions to banking consumers. This study examined factors affecting the intention to use, and the actual use of mobile banking services in Malaysia. Methods: Two main theories of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (extended version, UTAUT2), and the model of perceived risk, were used to propose a modified framework. Based on the non-probability sampling method, the data were collected from 504 respondents. The data vas analyzed using SPSS and PLS-SEM to derive the findings. Results: The study's findings revealed that the independent variables could explain 55.3% of the variance in mobile banking use and 60.3% of variance in intention to use variables. Moreover, it demonstrated that common factors that have significantly affected the actual use and intention to use mobile banking were habit, facilitating condition, and interface design quality. In contrast, perceived risk and intention to use were found to only have significant impacts on the use of mobile banking, while effort expectancy was found to only have a significant impact on the intention to use. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide significant new knowledge on mobile banking, from which mobile banking providers and interface designers can develop potential solutions to increase the usage of mobile banking services in Malaysia. However, using a qualitative method, the proposed model could only explain 55% of actual use and 60% of intentional use. Thus, additional variables and qualitative techniques may help increase the understanding on the actual use and intention to use.

                Background: Supracondylar humeral fracture (SHF) is the most common type of fracture in children. Moreover, lateral and posterior surgical approaches are the most frequently chosen approaches for open reduction surgery in displaced SHF when C-arm is unavailable. However, previous literature showed mixed findings regarding functional and cosmetic outcomes. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has compared these two procedures.  Methods: Our protocol was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021213763). We conducted a comprehensive electronic database search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract, followed by full-text reading and study selection based on eligibility criteria. The quality of the selected studies was analyzed with the ROBINS-I tool. Meta-analysis was carried out to compare the range of motion (functional outcome) and cosmetic outcome according to Flynn’s criteria. This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA and Cochrane handbook guidelines.  Results: Our initial search yielded 163 studies, from which we included five comparative studies comprising 231 children in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.69, 95% CI [0.97-2.93]) and good (OR 1.12, 95% CI [0.61-2.04]) functional outcomes and less likely to result in fair (OR 0.84, 95% CI [0.34-2.13]) and poor (OR 0.42, 95% CI [0.1-1.73]) functional outcomes compared to the posterior approach. In terms of cosmetic results, both approaches showed mixed findings. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.11, 95% CI [0.61-2.02]) and fair (OR 1.18, 95% CI [0.49-2.80]) but less likely to result in good (OR 0.79, 95% CI [0.40-1.55]) cosmetic outcomes. However, none of these analyses were statistically significant (p> 0.05).  Conclusion: Lateral and posterior surgical approaches resulted in satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcomes. The two approaches are comparable for treating SHF in children when evaluated with Flynn’s criteria.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of disease modifying therapies on immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Four hundred seventy-three people with MS provided one or more dried blood spot samples. Information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccine history, medical, and drug history were extracted from questionnaires and medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody titers were partitioned into tertiles with people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modeling to explore the effect of vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type, and lymphocyte count on vaccine response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio = 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.06, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01–0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All other drugs did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Both time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly associated with the response to the vaccination. The vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. Preliminary data on cellular T-cell immunity showed 40% of seronegative subjects had measurable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some disease modifying therapies convey risk of attenuated serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural circuit for flexible control of persistent behavioral states</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to their environments, animals must generate behaviors that are closely aligned to a rapidly changing sensory world. However, behavioral states such as foraging or courtship typically persist over long time scales to ensure proper execution. It remains unclear how neural circuits generate persistent behavioral states while maintaining the flexibility to select among alternative states when the sensory context changes. Here, we elucidate the functional architecture of a neural circuit controlling the choice between roaming and dwelling states, which underlie exploration and exploitation during foraging in <i>C. elegans</i>. By imaging ensemble-level neural activity in freely-moving animals, we identify stereotyped changes in circuit activity corresponding to each behavioral state. Combining circuit-wide imaging with genetic analysis, we find that mutual inhibition between two antagonistic neuromodulatory systems underlies the persistence and mutual exclusivity of the neural activity patterns observed in each state. Through machine learning analysis and circuit perturbations, we identify a sensory processing neuron that can transmit information about food odors to both the roaming and dwelling circuits and bias the animal towards different states in different sensory contexts, giving rise to context-appropriate state transitions. Our findings reveal a potentially general circuit architecture that enables flexible, sensory-driven control of persistent behavioral states.

                Agricultural soil harbors a diverse microbiome that can form beneficial relationships with plants, including the inhibition of plant pathogens. <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. are one of the most abundant bacterial genera in the soil and rhizosphere and play important roles in promoting plant health. However, the genetic determinants of this beneficial activity are only partially understood. Here, we genetically and phenotypically characterize the <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> population in a commercial potato field, where we identify strong correlations between specialized metabolite biosynthesis and antagonism of the potato pathogens <i>Streptomyces scabies</i> and <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Genetic and chemical analyses identified hydrogen cyanide and cyclic lipopeptides as key specialized metabolites associated with <i>S. scabies</i> inhibition, which was supported by <i>in planta</i> biocontrol experiments. We show that a single potato field contains a hugely diverse and dynamic population of <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria, whose capacity to produce specialized metabolites is shaped both by plant colonization and defined environmental inputs.

                Little is known about how neural representations of natural sounds differ across species. For example, speech and music play a unique role in human hearing, yet it is unclear how auditory representations of speech and music differ between humans and other animals. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we measured responses in ferrets to a set of natural and spectrotemporally matched synthetic sounds previously tested in humans. Ferrets showed similar lower-level frequency and modulation tuning to that observed in humans. But while humans showed substantially larger responses to natural vs. synthetic speech and music in non-primary regions, ferret responses to natural and synthetic sounds were closely matched throughout primary and non-primary auditory cortex, even when tested with ferret vocalizations. This finding reveals that auditory representations in humans and ferrets diverge sharply at late stages of cortical processing, potentially driven by higher-order processing demands in speech and music.

                The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and median raphe nucleus (MR) contain populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that regulate diverse behavioral functions. However, their whole-brain input-output circuits remain incompletely elucidated. We used viral tracing combined with fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography to generate a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of inputs and outputs of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the DR and MR. We found that these neurons received inputs from similar upstream brain regions. The glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus had divergent projection patterns with differences in critical brain regions. Specifically, MR glutamatergic neurons projected to the lateral habenula through multiple pathways. Correlation and cluster analysis revealed that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus received heterogeneous inputs and sent different collateral projections. This connectivity atlas further elucidates the anatomical architecture of the raphe nuclei, which could facilitate better understanding of their behavioral functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hydrogen sulfide blocks HIV rebound by maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental challenge in HIV eradication is to understand how the virus establishes latency, maintains stable cellular reservoirs, and promotes rebound upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in HIV latency and reactivation. We show that reactivation of HIV-1 is associated with down-regulation of the key H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme cystathionine-g-lyase (CTH) and reduction in endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S. Genetic silencing of CTH disrupts redox homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and remodels the transcriptome of latent cells to trigger HIV reactivation. Chemical complementation of CTH activity using a slow-releasing H<sub>2</sub>S donor, GYY4137, suppressed HIV reactivation and diminished virus replication. Mechanistically, GYY4137 blocked HIV reactivation by inducing the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF-kB, and recruiting the epigenetic silencer, YY1, to the HIV promoter. In latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from ART-suppressed human subjects, GYY4137 in combination with ART prevented viral rebound and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 exhibited no adverse influence on proviral content or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, indicating that diminished viral rebound is due to a loss of transcription rather than a selective loss of infected cells. In summary, this work provides mechanistic insight into H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated suppression of viral rebound and suggests exploration of H<sub>2</sub>S donors to maintain HIV in a latent form.

                Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. Even though great advances in the last decades have allowed better delineation of its pathogenetic mechanisms, its cellular and molecular bases are still poorly understood. To evaluate the consequences of chromosome aneuploidy on the hippocampus, we analyzed single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of the DS mouse model Ts65Dn. Our data revealed abnormal cell composition specifically of the Ts65Dn dentate gyrus and of specific subtypes of interneurons, without major changes in CA1 or CA3. We found that trisomy results in a highly cell-type specific global alteration of the transcriptome and detected previously undefined differentially expressed genes in specific neuronal populations. We identified the long-non-coding gene Snhg11 to be specifically downregulated in the trisomic dentate gyrus and provide evidence for its involvement in hippocampal-dependent cognitive phenotypes, possibly contributed by impaired adult neurogenesis.

                Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus of global concern. ZIKV infection of the central nervous system has been linked to a variety of clinical syndromes, including microcephaly in fetuses and rare but serious neurologic disease in adults. However, the potential for ZIKV to influence brain physiology and host behavior following recovery from apparently mild or subclinical infection is less well understood. Furthermore, though deficits in cognitive function are well-documented following recovery from neuroinvasive viral infection, the potential impact of ZIKV on other host behavioral domains has not been thoroughly explored. In our study, we performed transcriptomic profiling of primary neuron cultures following ZIKV infection, which revealed altered expression of key genes associated with major psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Gene ontology enrichment analysis also revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with fundamental neurobiological processes, including neuronal development, neurotransmission, and others. These alterations to neurologic gene expression were also observed in the brain in vivo using an immunocompetent mouse model of ZIKV infection. Mechanistic studies identified TNF- signaling via TNFR1 as a major regulatory mechanism controlling ZIKV-induced changes to neurologic gene expression. Our studies reveal that cell-intrinsic innate immune responses to ZIKV infection profoundly shape neuronal transcriptional profiles, highlighting the need to further explore associations between ZIKV infection and disordered host behavioral states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain state and cortical layer-specific mechanisms underlying perception at threshold</a></h4>

              
                Identical stimuli can be perceived or go unnoticed across successive presentations, producing divergent behavioral readouts despite similarities in sensory input. We hypothesized that fluctuations in neurophysiological states in the sensory neocortex, which could alter cortical processing at the level of neural subpopulations, underlies this perceptual variability. We analyzed cortical layer-specific electrophysiological activity in visual area V4 during a cued attention task. We find that hit trials are characterized by a larger pupil diameter and lower incidence of microsaccades, indicative of a behavioral state with increased arousal and perceptual stability. Target stimuli presented at perceptual threshold evoke elevated multi-unit activity in V4 neurons in hit trials compared to miss trials, across all cortical layers. Putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons are strongly positively modulated in the input (IV) and deep (V & VI) layers of the cortex during hit trials. Excitatory neurons in the superficial cortical layers exhibit lower variability in hit trials. Deep layer neurons are less phase-locked to low frequency rhythms in hits. Hits are also characterized by greater interlaminar coherence between the superficial and deep layers in the pre-stimulus period, and a complementary pattern between the input layer and both the superficial and deep layers in the stimulus-evoked period. Taken together, these results indicate that a state of elevated levels of arousal and perceptual stability allow enhanced processing of sensory stimuli, which contributes to hits at perceptual threshold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Complementary population codes in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus during associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Memories are multifaceted and layered, incorporating external stimuli and internal states, and at multiple levels of resolution. Although the hippocampus is essential for memory, it remains unclear if distinct aspects of experience are encoded within different hippocampal subnetworks during learning. By tracking the same dCA1 or vCA1 neurons across cue-outcome learning, we find detailed and externally based (stimulus identity) representations in dCA1, and broad and internally based (stimulus relevance) signals in vCA1 that emerge with learning. These dorsoventral differences were observed regardless of cue modality or outcome valence, and representations within each region were largely stable for days after learning. These results identify how the hippocampus encodes associative memories, and show that hippocampal ensembles not only link experiences, but also imbue relationships with meaning and highlight behaviorally relevant information. Together, these complementary dynamics across hippocampal subnetworks allow for rich, diverse representation of experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The natural frequencies of the resting human brain: an MEG-based atlas</a></h4>

              
                Brain oscillations are considered to play a pivotal role in neural communication. However, detailed information regarding the typical oscillatory patterns of individual brain regions is surprisingly scarce. In this study we applied a multivariate data-driven approach to create an atlas of the natural frequencies of the resting human brain on a voxel-by-voxel basis. We analysed resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 128 healthy adult volunteers obtained from the Open MEG Archive (OMEGA). Spectral power was computed in source space in 500 ms steps for 82 frequency bins logarithmically spaced from 1.7 to 99.5 Hz. We then applied k-means clustering to detect characteristic spectral profiles and to eventually identify the natural frequency of each voxel. Our results revealed a region-specific organisation of intrinsic oscillatory activity, following both a medial-to-lateral and a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing frequency. In particular, medial fronto-temporal regions were characterised by slow rhythms (delta/theta). Posterior regions presented natural frequencies in the alpha band, although with differentiated generators in the precuneus and in sensory-specific cortices (i.e., visual and auditory). Somatomotor regions were distinguished by the mu rhythm, while the lateral prefrontal cortex was characterised by oscillations in the high beta range (>20 Hz). Importantly, the brain map of natural frequencies was highly replicable in two independent subsamples of individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive atlas of ongoing oscillatory activity performed to date. Furthermore, the identification of natural frequencies is a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the functional architecture of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anticipatory dynamics in the human brain guide foraging for primary rewards</a></h4>

              
                Foraging is a fundamental food-seeking behavior in a wide range of species that enables survival in an uncertain world. During foraging, behavioral agents constantly face a trade-off between staying in their current location or exploring another. Despite ethological generality and importance of foraging, it remains unclear how the human brain guides continuous decision in such situations. Here we show that anticipatory activity dynamics in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and hippocampus underpin foraging for primary rewards. While functional MRI was performed, humans foraged for real liquid rewards available after tens of seconds, and continuous decision during foraging was tracked by a dynamic pattern of brain activity that reflected anticipation of a future reward. When the dynamic anticipatory activity in the aPFC was enhanced, humans remained in their current environment, but when this activity diminished, they explored a new environment. Moreover, the anticipatory activity in the aPFC and hippocampus was associated with distinct decision strategies: aPFC activity was enhanced in humans adopting an exploratory strategy, whereas those remaining stationary showed enhanced activity in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that anticipatory dynamics in the fronto-hippocampal mechanisms underlie continuous decision-making during human foraging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Mechanisms of Learning are Critically Dependent on Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep supports memory consolidation as well as next-day learning. The Active Systems account of offline consolidation suggests that sleep-associated memory processing paves the way for new learning, but empirical evidence in support of this idea is scarce. Using a within-subjects, crossover design, we assessed behavioural and electrophysiological indices of episodic encoding after a night of sleep or total sleep deprivation in healthy adult humans (aged 18-25 years), and investigated whether the behavioural measures were predicted by the overnight consolidation of episodic associations formed the previous day. Sleep supported memory consolidation and next-day learning, as compared to sleep deprivation. However, the magnitude of this sleep-associated consolidation benefit did not significantly predict the ability to form novel memories after sleep. Interestingly, sleep deprivation prompted a qualitative change in the neural signature of encoding: whereas 12-20 Hz beta desynchronization - an established EEG marker of successful encoding - was observed after sleep, sleep deprivation disrupted beta desynchrony during successful learning. Taken together, our findings suggest that effective learning mechanisms are critically dependent on sleep, but not necessarily sleep-associated consolidation.

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain’s evoked and induced electrical activity from the scalp. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, are increasingly being applied to EEG data for pattern analysis, group membership classification, and brain-computer interface purposes. This study aimed to systematically review recent advances in ML and DL supervised models for decoding and classifying EEG signals. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques used for EEG signal preprocessing and feature extraction. To this end, several academic databases were searched to explore relevant studies from the year 2000 to the present. Our results showed that the application of ML and DL in both mental workload and motor imagery tasks has received substantial attention in recent years. A total of 75% of DL studies applied convolutional neural networks with various learning algorithms, and 36% of ML studies achieved competitive accuracy by using a support vector machine algorithm. Wavelet transform was found to be the most common feature extraction method used for all types of tasks. We further examined the specific feature extraction methods and end classifier recommendations discovered in this systematic review.</p>

	<p>In the present study, we investigated if individuals with neurogenic speech sound impairments of three types, Parkinson’s dysarthria, apraxia of speech, and aphasic phonological impairment, accommodate their speech to the natural speech rhythm of an auditory model, and if so, whether the effect is more significant after hearing metrically regular sentences as compared to those with an irregular pattern. This question builds on theories of rhythmic entrainment, assuming that sensorimotor predictions of upcoming events allow humans to synchronize their actions with an external rhythm. To investigate entrainment effects, we conducted a sentence completion task relating participants’ response latencies to the spoken rhythm of the prime heard immediately before. A further research question was if the perceived rhythm interacts with the rhythm of the participants’ own productions, i.e., the trochaic or iambic stress pattern of disyllabic target words. For a control group of healthy speakers, our study revealed evidence for entrainment when trochaic target words were preceded by regularly stressed prime sentences. Persons with Parkinson’s dysarthria showed a pattern similar to that of the healthy individuals. For the patient groups with apraxia of speech and with phonological impairment, considerably longer response latencies with differing patterns were observed. Trochaic target words were initiated with significantly shorter latencies, whereas the metrical regularity of prime sentences had no consistent impact on response latencies and did not interact with the stress pattern of the target words to be produced. The absence of an entrainment in these patients may be explained by the more severe difficulties in initiating speech at all. We discuss the results in terms of clinical implications for diagnostics and therapy in neurogenic speech disorders.</p>

	<p>We aim to investigate whether EEG dynamics differ in adults with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) and ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) compared with healthy subjects during the performance of an innovative cognitive task, Aristotle’s valid and invalid syllogisms, and how these differences correlate with brain regions and behavioral data for each subject. We recorded EEGs from 14 scalp electrodes (channels) in 21 adults with ADHD, 21 with ASD, and 21 healthy, normal subjects. The subjects were exposed in a set of innovative cognitive tasks (inducing varying cognitive loads), Aristotle’s two types of syllogism mentioned above. A set of 39 questions were given to participants related to valid–invalid syllogisms as well as a separate set of questionnaires, in order to collect a number of demographic and behavioral data, with the aim of detecting shared information with values of a feature extracted from EEG, the multiscale entropy (MSE), in the 14 channels (‘brain regions’). MSE, a nonlinear information-theoretic measure of complexity, was computed to extract a feature that quantifies the complexity of the EEG. Behavior-Partial Least Squares Correlation, PLSC, is the method to detect the correlation between two sets of data, brain, and behavioral measures. -PLSC, a variant of PLSC, was applied to build a functional connectivity of the brain regions involved in the reasoning tasks. Graph-theoretic measures were used to quantify the complexity of the functional networks. Based on the results of the analysis described in this work, a mixed 14 × 2 × 3 ANOVA showed significant main effects of&amp;amp;nbsp;group factor and brain region* syllogism&amp;amp;nbsp;factor, as well as a significant brain region* group interaction. There are significant differences between the means of MSE (complexity) values at the 14 channels of the members of the ‘pathological’ groups of participants, i.e., between ASD and ADHD, while the difference in means of MSE between both ASD and ADHD and that of the control group is not significant. In conclusion, the valid–invalid type of syllogism generates significantly different complexity values, MSE, between ASD and ADHD. The complexity of activated brain regions of ASD participants increased significantly when switching from a valid to an invalid syllogism, indicating the need for more resources to ‘face’ the task escalating difficulty in ASD subjects. This increase is not so evident in both ADHD and control. Statistically significant differences were found also in the behavioral response of ASD and ADHD, compared with those of control subjects, based on the principal brain and behavior saliences extracted by PLSC. Specifically, two behavioral measures, the emotional state and the degree of confidence of participants in answering questions in Aristotle’s valid–invalid syllogisms, and one demographic variable, age, statistically and significantly discriminate the three groups’ ASD. The seed-PLC generated functional connectivity networks for ASD, ADHD, and control, were ‘projected’ on the regions of the Default Mode Network (DMN), the ‘reference’ connectivity, of which the structural changes were found significant in distinguishing the three groups. The contribution of this work lies in the examination of the relationship between brain activity and behavioral responses of healthy and ‘pathological’ participants in the case of cognitive reasoning of the type of Aristotle’s valid and invalid syllogisms, using PLSC, a machine learning approach combined with MSE, a nonlinear method of extracting a feature based on EEGs that captures a broad spectrum of EEGs linear and nonlinear characteristics. The results seem promising in adopting this type of reasoning, in the future, after further enhancements and experimental tests, as a supplementary instrument towards examining the differences in brain activity and behavioral responses of ASD and ADHD patients. The application of the combination of these two methods, after further elaboration and testing as new and complementary to the existing ones, may be considered as a tool of analysis in helping detecting more effectively such types of disorders.</p>

	<p>System-specific brain responses—time-locked to rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep—are characteristically widespread, with robust and clear activation in the primary visual cortex and other structures involved in multisensory integration. This pattern suggests that REMs underwrite hierarchical processing of visual information in a time-locked manner, where REMs index the generation and scanning of virtual-world models, through multisensory integration in dreaming—as in awake states. Default mode network (DMN) activity increases during rest and reduces during various tasks including visual perception. The implicit anticorrelation between the DMN and task-positive network (TPN)—that persists in REM sleep—prompted us to focus on DMN responses to temporally-precise REM events. We timed REMs during sleep from the video recordings and quantified the neural correlates of REMs—using functional MRI (fMRI)—in 24 independent studies of 11 healthy participants. A reanalysis of these data revealed that the cortical areas exempt from widespread REM-locked brain activation were restricted to the DMN. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a modest temporally-precise REM-locked decrease—phasic deactivation—in key DMN nodes, in a subset of independent studies. These results are consistent with hierarchical predictive coding; namely, permissive deactivation of DMN at the top of the hierarchy (leading to the widespread cortical activation at lower levels; especially the primary visual cortex). Additional findings indicate REM-locked cerebral vasodilation and suggest putative mechanisms for dream forgetting.</p>

	<p>Background: as the most common malignancy of the central nervous system, low-grade glioma (LGG) patients suffered a poor prognosis. Tumor microenvironment, especially immune components, plays an important role in the progression of tumors. Thus, it is critical to explore the key immune-related genes, a comprehensive understanding of the TME in LGG helps us find novel cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: the GPSM3 expression level and the correlations between clinical characteristics and GPSM3 levels were analyzed with the data from CGGA and TCGA dataset. Univariate and multivariate cox regression model were built to predict the prognosis of LGG patients with multiple factors. Then the correlation between GPSM3 with immune cell infiltration was explored by ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and TIMER2.0. At last, the correlation analyzed between GPSM3 expression and immune checkpoint related genes were also analyzed. Results: GPSM3 expression was overexpressed in LGG and negatively correlated to the GPSM3 DNA methylation. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that GPSM3 expression was an independent prognostic factor in LGG patients. Functional characterization of GPSM3 revealed that it was associated with many immune processes to tumor cells. GPSM3 expression was positive related to the immune score, Stromal scores and ESTIMATE scores, but negative related to the Tumor purity. Immune features in the TME of GPSM3-high LGG group is characterized by a higher infiltrating of regulatory T cells, neutrophils, macrophages M2, and a lower proportion of monocytes than to the GPSM3-low group. Furthermore, GPSM3 expression exhibited significant correlations with the immune checkpoint-related genes, especially PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4 and TIM3. Conclusions: these findings proved that GPSM3 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapy target for LGG.</p>

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are used in clinical and cognitive neuroscience to induce a mild magnetic or electric field in the brain to modulate behavior and cortical activation. Despite the great body of literature demonstrating promising results, unexpected or even paradoxical outcomes are sometimes observed. This might be due either to technical and methodological issues (e.g., stimulation parameters, stimulated brain area), or to participants’ expectations and beliefs before and during the stimulation sessions. In this narrative review, we present some studies showing that placebo and nocebo effects, associated with positive and negative expectations, respectively, could be present in NIBS trials, both in experimental and in clinical settings. The lack of systematic evaluation of subjective expectations and beliefs before and after stimulation could represent a caveat that overshadows the potential contribution of placebo and nocebo effects in the outcome of NIBS trials.</p>

	<p>An increasing number of people around the world communicate in more than one language, resulting in them having to make decisions in a foreign language on a daily basis. Interestingly, a burgeoning body of literature suggests that people’s decision-making is affected by whether they are reasoning in their native language (NL) or their foreign language (FL). According to the foreign language effect (FLe), people are less susceptible to bias in many decision-making tasks and more likely to display utilitarian cost-benefit analysis in moral decision-making when reasoning in a FL. While these differences have often been attributed to a reduced emotionality in the FL, an emerging body of literature has started to test the extent to which these could be attributable to increased deliberation in the FL. The present study tests whether increased deliberation leads to a FLe on cognitive reflection in a population of older adults (Mage = 65.1), from the successful aging project in Umeå, Sweden. We explored whether performance on a 6-item version of the cognitive reflection test (CRT) adapted to Swedish would differ between participants for whom Swedish was their NL and those for whom Swedish was their FL. The CRT is a task designed to elicit an incorrect, intuitive answer. In order to override the intuitive answer, one requires engaging in deliberative, analytical thinking to determine the correct answer. Therefore, we hypothesized that if thinking in a FL increases deliberation, then those performing the task in their FL would exhibit higher accuracy rates than those performing in their NL. Our results showed that age and level of education predicted performance on the task but performance on the CRT did not differ between the NL and the FL groups. In addition, in the FL group, proficiency in the FL was not related to performance in the CRT. Our results, therefore, do not provide evidence that thinking in a FL increases deliberation in a group of older adults performing a logical reasoning task that is not typically associated with an emotional connotation.</p>

                Quantitative transcriptional control is essential for physiological and developmental processes in many organisms. Transcriptional output is influenced by cotranscriptional processes interconnected to chromatin regulation, but how the functions of different cotranscriptional regulators are integrated is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is cotranscriptionally repressed by...

                Cancer precision medicine implies identification of tumor-specific vulnerabilities associated with defined oncogenic pathways. Desmoid tumors are soft-tissue neoplasms strictly driven by Wnt signaling network hyperactivation. Despite this clearly defined genetic etiology and the strict and unique implication of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, no specific molecular targets for these tumors have been...
