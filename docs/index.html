              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14107">Inward rectifier potassium channels interact with calcium channels to promote robust and physiological bistability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dorsal horn, projection neurons play a significant role in pain processing by transmitting sensory stimuli to supraspinal centers during nociception. Following exposure to intense noxious stimuli, a sensitization process occurs to adapt the dorsal horn functional state. Notably, projection neurons can display a switch in firing pattern from tonic firing to plateau potentials with sustained afterdischarges. For afterdischarges to manifest after this switch, the neuron must develop bistability, which characterizes the ability to show resting or spiking at the same input current depending on the context. In numerous instances, neuronal bistability arises through voltage-gated calcium channels. However, computational studies have demonstrated a trade-off between bistability and the plausibility of its resting states if calcium channels are counterbalanced with voltage-gated potassium channels. Current knowledge leaves a gap in understanding the underlying mechanisms by which robust bistability, plateau potentials, and sustained afterdischarges emerge in neurons via calcium channels. In this study, we used a conductance-based model to explore the mechanisms by which L-type calcium (CaL) channels can achieve bistability when combined with either M-type potassium (KM) channels or inward-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. Unlike KM channels, Kir channels enhance bistability. Combined with CaL channels, KM and Kir channels promote different types of bistability, with distinct robustness, and function. An analysis of their inward/outward properties revealed that their distinct steady-state currents explain this contrast. Altogether, the complementary of CaL and Kir channels creates a reliable possible pathway for central sensitization in the dorsal horn.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13674">FabuLight-ASD: Unveiling Speech Activity via Body Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.13674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in multimodal environments is crucial for various applications, from video conferencing to human-robot interaction. This paper introduces FabuLight-ASD, an advanced ASD model that integrates facial, audio, and body pose information to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Our model builds upon the existing Light-ASD framework by incorporating human pose data, represented through skeleton graphs, which minimises computational overhead. Using the Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, renowned for reliable face and body bounding box annotations, we demonstrate FabuLight-ASD's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Achieving an overall mean average precision (mAP) of 94.3%, FabuLight-ASD outperforms Light-ASD, which has an overall mAP of 93.7% across various challenging scenarios. The incorporation of body pose information shows a particularly advantageous impact, with notable improvements in mAP observed in scenarios with speech impairment, face occlusion, and human voice background noise. Furthermore, efficiency analysis indicates only a modest increase in parameter count (27.3%) and multiply-accumulate operations (up to 2.4%), underscoring the model's efficiency and feasibility. These findings validate the efficacy of FabuLight-ASD in enhancing ASD performance through the integration of body pose data. FabuLight-ASD's code and model weights are available at https://github.com/knowledgetechnologyuhh/FabuLight-ASD.

                arXiv:2411.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.

                arXiv:2411.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic image generation is no longer just of interest to researchers, but also to practitioners. However, current models are sensitive to the settings used and automatic optimization methods often require human involvement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ComfyGI, a novel approach to automatically improve workflows for image generation without the need for human intervention driven by techniques from genetic improvement. This enables image generation with significantly higher quality in terms of the alignment with the given description and the perceived aesthetics. On the performance side, we find that overall, the images generated with an optimized workflow are about 50% better compared to the initial workflow in terms of the median ImageReward score. These already good results are even surpassed in our human evaluation, as the participants preferred the images improved by ComfyGI in around 90% of the cases.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14196">Uncertainty Quantification in Working Memory via Moment Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans possess a finely tuned sense of uncertainty that helps anticipate potential errors, vital for adaptive behavior and survival. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study applies moment neural networks (MNNs) to explore the neural mechanism of uncertainty quantification in working memory (WM). The MNN captures nonlinear coupling of the first two moments in spiking neural networks (SNNs), identifying firing covariance as a key indicator of uncertainty in encoded information. Trained on a WM task, the model demonstrates coding precision and uncertainty quantification comparable to human performance. Analysis reveals a link between the probabilistic and sampling-based coding for uncertainty representation. Transferring the MNN's weights to an SNN replicates these results. Furthermore, the study provides testable predictions demonstrating how noise and heterogeneity enhance WM performance, highlighting their beneficial role rather than being mere biological byproducts. These findings offer insights into how the brain effectively manages uncertainty with exceptional accuracy.

                arXiv:2311.16141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to the energy-efficient and multiplication-free characteristics. Despite these advantages, deploying large-scale SNNs on edge hardware is challenging due to limited resource availability. Network pruning offers a viable approach to compress the network scale and reduce hardware resource requirements for model deployment. However, existing SNN pruning methods cause high pruning costs and performance loss because they lack efficiency in processing the sparse spike representation of SNNs. In this paper, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience and the high biological plausibility of SNNs, we explore and leverage criticality to facilitate efficient pruning in deep SNNs. We firstly explain criticality in SNNs from the perspective of maximizing feature information entropy. Second, We propose a low-cost metric for assess neuron criticality in feature transmission and design a pruning-regeneration method that incorporates this criticality into the pruning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher performance than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with up to 95.26\% reduction of pruning cost. The criticality-based regeneration process efficiently selects potential structures and facilitates consistent feature representation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12116">Unsupervised End-to-End Training with a Self-Defined Target</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.12116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07245">Ecology, Spatial Structure, and Selection Pressure Induce Strong Signatures in Phylogenetic Structure</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.07245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary dynamics are shaped by a variety of fundamental, generic drivers, including spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure. These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP) exhibit sensorimotor disturbances, with proprioception impairment considered an important aspect. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a novel inertial sensor-based electrogoniometer (KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg;) for cervical spine (CS) proprioception measurement in patients with NSCNP. Methods: The within-day intra-rater reliability of CS proprioception and its association with patient demographics and clinical status were examined in fifty-nine patients with NSCNP, aged between 25&amp;amp;ndash;65 years, recruited from primary care. CS proprioception was examined via angle reproduction, in angles set mid-range in the available CS range of motion (ROM) in each motion direction. The clinical status evaluation comprised the maximum and average pain intensity in the last week, disability, fear of movement/re-injury, catastrophizing, neck awareness, and CS-ROM. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1), standard error of the measurement (SEM), and minimum detectable change (MDC95%). Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s R assessed between-measures associations. Results: CS proprioception reliability was good (ICC2,1 = 0.75&amp;amp;ndash;0.89), with low measurement error (SEM = 1.38&amp;amp;ndash;3.02&amp;amp;deg; and MDC95% = 3.83&amp;amp;ndash;8.38&amp;amp;deg;). Correlations between participants&amp;amp;rsquo; CS proprioception and their clinical status or demographics were not significant. Conclusions: The reliability of CS proprioception assessment with the KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg; was good in a sample of mildly to moderately disabled patients with CNP and thus deemed suitable for further research in this field.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                Background The impact and changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis affect the patient’s fulfilment and quality of life. Objective This study aims to thoroughly investigate the experiences of end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This research uses a qualitative descriptive approach with in-depth interview methods. Participants numbered 15 people from Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital and Hasanuddin University Hospital, which were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Result There are three themes produced in this research: 1) various responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) various impacts, and 3) coping mechanisms developed. Conclusion These findings indicate that patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo hemodialysis have attempted to build adaptive coping strategies in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they still need support from healthcare providers in the hemodialysis unit to overcome various problems and impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hemodialysis nurses are expected to be able to carry out holistic assessments and continuous evaluation in order to provide comprehensive nursing care to meet patient needs for hemodialysis in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1403/v1?src=rss">Mental health status of caregivers of cancer patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The global prevalence of cancer is rapidly increasing, and patients often require ancillary non-clinical care during treatment. Caregivers, in turn, experience several mental health challenges as they fulfil their responsibilities. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among caregivers of cancer patients at a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar; and explore the psychosocial factors contributing to their mental health. Methods For objective 1, a cross-sectional study design was employed to collect data from 230 caregivers accompanying cancer patients who attended a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha during February-April 2024. A licensed version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate the levels of anxiety and depression, while the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used to assess stress. For objective 2, ten in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers, then recorded, transcribed and translated for thematic analysis. Results The prevalence of anxiety, depression and perceived stress among caregivers was found to be 45.2%, 43.4% and 44.8%, respectively. ‘Being the sole caregiver’ was identified as a significant predictor of caregivers’ mental health, affecting levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Further, qualitative analysis identified factors like social support, financial hardships, emotional toll, personal wellbeing, communication with healthcare provider and transportation as key contributors to caregivers’ mental health decline. Conclusion Caregivers of cancer patients face significant mental health challenges that need focused attention. Integrating informal social networks, counselling services, creating support groups and offering financial assistance into cancer care programs can help address their needs.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                <p>Neuroinflammation can lead to chronic maladaptive pain affecting millions of people worldwide. Neurotransmitters, cytokines, and ion channels are implicated in neuroimmune cell signaling, but their roles in specific behavioral responses are not fully elucidated. Voltage-gated Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in skin controls rapid and transient heat hypersensitivity induced by intradermal (i.d.) capsaicin via IL-1a cytokine signaling. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are not, however, involved in mechanical hypersensitivity that developed in the i.d. capsaicin animal model. Here, we show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are also critical for heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. complete Freund adjuvant (CFA). i.d. CFA, a model of chronic neuroinflammation, involves ongoing cytokine signaling for days leading to pronounced edema and hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in the skin was required for the full development and week-long time course of heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. CFA, but paw edema and mechanical hypersensitivity were independent of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. CFA induced increases in several cytokines in hindpaw fluid including IL-6 which was also dependent on Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. Using IL-6&ndash;specific neutralizing antibodies in vivo, we show that IL-6 contributes to heat hypersensitivity and that neutralizing both IL-1a and IL-6 was even more effective at reducing the magnitude and duration of CFA-induced heat hypersensitivity. Our findings demonstrate a functional link between Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity and the release of IL-6 in the skin and show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels have a privileged role in the induction and maintenance of heat hypersensitivity during chronic forms of neuroinflammation in the skin.</p>

                Background Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) approach is considered as one of the minimally invasive interventions. The success of restoration depends on various clinical factors like material, patient and operator factor. Conjoint analysis is a technique for measuring individual’s preference structures via systematical variations of products attributes in an experimental design. Aim Assess Pedodontists’ perception of non-clinical factors and investigate influence of child’s age, level of cooperation and vulnerability status on their decisions to perform Atraumatic Restorative Approach (ART) approach using hypothetical patient scenario’s and conjoint design. Materials and methods A cross-sectional exploratory survey using a web-based questionnaire was performed among Pedodontists registered as life members under Indian Association of Pedodontic and Preventive Dentistry. Self-designed structured scenario-based questionnaire was prepared and validated. Three non-clinical factors Age of child, Cooperation level and Vulnerability status were considered. Using orthogonal design, SPSS software nine profiles were created randomly along with two holdouts. Final study proforma consisted of three sections with description of eleven clinical scenarios. It was administered to participants using Google forms. Using SPSS conjoint software relative utilities for each factor on decision for using ART was estimated. Results Four hundred and thirty-two pedodontists had completed the survey (35.9%). Pedodontists considered vulnerability status of the child as the most important factor for their decision to use ART treatment. For the vulnerability status, the factor vulnerable had the greatest utility (-0.364) compared to non-vulnerable factor (0.364). For cooperation level, factor uncooperative had greater utility (-0.343), as compared to moderately cooperative (0.066) and uncooperative (0.277). For the age factor, the age of 4 years had the greatest utility (-0.175) compared with age 6 (-0.013) and age 12 (0.19). Conclusion The most preferred scenario by pedodontists to consider ART as treatment of choice was child belonging to vulnerable section, being very young and uncooperative.

                Consumer satisfaction is an outcome of business marketing activities, bridging the buying and usage phases with subsequent consequences such as attitude changes, recurring purchases, and brand loyalty. Most studies have utilized variations of the disconfirmation paradigm, which posits that satisfaction is influenced by the degree and type of disconfirmation experienced and initial expectations. Despite the importance of satisfaction, there remains a paucity of evidence on the cause and effect leading to expectation-confirmation and disconfirmation paradigm. This paper explores the reasons and the key factors in the perspectives of the relevant literature and aims to identify the intention of confirmation and disconfirmation in satisfaction theories. This conceptual paper also suggests various critical analyses based on the arguments for and against the paradigm in customer satisfaction. Consequently, the paper seeks to examine existing gaps in the literature regarding customer satisfaction theories for business sustainability and decision making, which may need to be more concise in the satisfaction generation process.

                Background Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly morbid disease. Chemotherapy for NSCLC lacks specificity and efficacy mainly because of drug resistance. The current study aimed to explore computational tools to target allosteric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sites and screen for the top molecules in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. Methods Molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamic studies revealed that acenocoumarol and silodosin are the top two allosteric EGFR inhibitors. They were further tested for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, and gene expression by qPCR, western blotting, A549 cell xenograft anti-proliferative activity, and tumor regression efficacy analysis. Results Acenocoumarol and silodosin exhibited cytotoxicity in A549 and IMR-90 cells at concentrations below 50 and 80 μM, respectively. Acenocoumarol and silodosin induced S-phase and G2/M-phase arrest in A549 cells in the cell cycle analysis. Both drugs showed early apoptosis at their IC50 doses (acenocoumarol 50 μM and silodosin 25 μM). KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) gene regulation in A549 cells was confirmed using qPCR. KRAS and ERK2 activities were quantified by western blot analysis. In the xenograft study, tumor size, body weight, and organ weight were significantly attenuated by the test drugs compared with the standard cisplatin. Immunoblotting and western blot results of the A549-xenograft tissue indicated downregulation of KRAS and ERK2. Furthermore, the test drugs have upregulated caspase-3 gene expression. Conclusion The drugs acenocoumarol and silodosin downregulate KRAS and ERK2 both in cell line and in Xenograft model. KRAS and ERK2 are associated with EGFR inhibition. Hence, acenocoumarol and silodosin can be further explored for repurposing studies in human trials.

Measles is an important infectious disease system both for its burden on public health and as an opportunity for studying nonlinear spatio-temporal disease dynamics. Traditional mechanistic models often struggle to fully capture the complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in measles outbreaks. In this paper, we first develop a high-dimensional feed-forward neural network model with spatial features (SFNN) to forecast endemic measles outbreaks and systematically compare its predictive power with that of a classical mechanistic model (TSIR). We illustrate the utility of our model using England and Wales measles data from 1944-1965. These data present multiple modeling challenges due to the interplay between metapopulations, seasonal trends, and nonlinear dynamics related to demographic changes. Our results show that while the TSIR model yields similarly performant short-term (1 to 2 biweeks ahead) forecasts for highly populous cities, our neural network model (SFNN) consistently achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) across other forecasting windows. Furthermore, we show that our spatial-feature neural network model, without imposing mechanistic assumptions <i>a priori</i>, can uncover gravity-model-like spatial hierarchy of measles spread in which major cities play an important role in driving regional outbreaks. We then turn our attention to integrative approaches that combine mechanistic and machine learning models. Specifically, we investigate how the TSIR can be utilized to improve a state-of-the-art approach known as Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks (PINN) which explicitly combines compartmental models and neural networks. Our results show that the TSIR can facilitate the reconstruction of latent susceptible dynamics, thereby enhancing both forecasts in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and parameter inference of measles dynamics within the PINN. In summary, our results show that appropriately designed neural network-based models can outperform traditional mechanistic models for short to long-term forecasts, while simultaneously providing mechanistic interpretability. Our work also provides valuable insights into more effectively integrating machine learning models with mechanistic models to enhance public health responses to measles and similar infectious disease systems.

We combine an off-lattice agent-based mathematical model and experimentation to explore filamentous growth of a yeast colony. Under environmental stress, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> yeast cells can transition from a bipolar (sated) to unipolar (pseudohyphal) budding mechanism, where cells elongate and bud end-to-end. This budding asymmetry yields spatially non-uniform growth, where filaments extend away from the colony centre, foraging for food. We use approximate Bayesian computation to quantify how individual cell budding mechanisms give rise to spatial patterns observed in experiments. We apply this method of parameter inference to experimental images of colonies of two strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, in low and high nutrient environments. The colony size at the transition from sated to pseudohyphal growth, and a forking mechanism for pseudohyphal cell proliferation are the key features driving colony morphology. Simulations run with the most likely inferred parameters produce colony morphologies that closely resemble experimental results.

                <p>by Yaoda Xu</p>

The key to adaptive visual processing lies in the ability to maintain goal-directed visual representation in the face of distraction. In visual working memory (VWM), distraction may come from the coding of distractors or other concurrently retained targets. This fMRI study reveals a common representational geometry that our brain uses to combat both types of distractions in VWM. Specifically, using fMRI pattern decoding, the human posterior parietal cortex is shown to orthogonalize the representations of different streams of information concurrently coded in VWM, whether they are targets and distractors, or different targets concurrently held in VWM. The latter is also seen in the human occipitotemporal cortex. Such a representational geometry provides an elegant and simple solution to enable independent information readout, effectively combating distraction from the different streams of information, while accommodating their concurrent representations. This representational scheme differs from mechanisms that actively suppress or block the encoding of distractors to reduce interference. It is likely a general neural representational principle that supports our ability to represent information beyond VWM in other situations where multiple streams of visual information are tracked and processed simultaneously.

                <p>by Román Zapién-Campos, Florence Bansept, Arne Traulsen</p>

How can we figure out how the different microbes interact within microbiomes? To combine theoretical models and experimental data, we often fit a deterministic model for the mean dynamics of a system to averaged data. However, in the averaging procedure a lot of information from the data is lost—and a deterministic model may be a poor representation of a stochastic reality. Here, we develop an inference method for microbiomes based on the idea that both the experiment and the model are stochastic. Starting from a stochastic model, we derive dynamical equations not only for the average, but also for higher statistical moments of the microbial abundances. We use these equations to infer distributions of the interaction parameters that best describe the biological experimental data—improving identifiability and precision. The inferred distributions allow us to make predictions but also to distinguish between fairly certain parameters and those for which the available experimental data does not give sufficient information. Compared to related approaches, we derive expressions that also work for the relative abundance of microbes, enabling us to use conventional metagenome data, and account for cases where not a single host, but only replicate hosts, can be tracked over time.

                <p>by Cécile Courret, Lucas W. Hemmer, Xiaolu Wei, Prachi D. Patel, Bryce J. Chabot, Nicholas J. Fuda, Xuewen Geng, Ching-Ho Chang, Barbara G. Mellone, Amanda M. Larracuente</p>

Centromeres reside in rapidly evolving, repeat-rich genomic regions, despite their essential function in chromosome segregation. Across organisms, centromeres are rich in selfish genetic elements such as transposable elements and satellite DNAs that can bias their transmission through meiosis. However, these elements still need to cooperate at some level and contribute to, or avoid interfering with, centromere function. To gain insight into the balance between conflict and cooperation at centromeric DNA, we take advantage of the close evolutionary relationships within the <i>Drosophila simulans</i> clade—<i>D</i>. <i>simulans</i>, <i>D</i>. <i>sechellia</i>, and <i>D</i>. <i>mauritiana—</i>and their relative, <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i>. Using chromatin profiling combined with high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization on stretched chromatin fibers, we characterize all centromeres across these species. We discovered dramatic centromere reorganization involving recurrent shifts between retroelements and satellite DNAs over short evolutionary timescales. We also reveal the recent origin (<240 Kya) of telocentric chromosomes in <i>D</i>. <i>sechellia</i>, where the X and fourth centromeres now sit on telomere-specific retroelements. Finally, the Y chromosome centromeres, which are the only chromosomes that do not experience female meiosis, do not show dynamic cycling between satDNA and TEs. The patterns of rapid centromere turnover in these species are consistent with genetic conflicts in the female germline and have implications for centromeric DNA function and karyotype evolution. Regardless of the evolutionary forces driving this turnover, the rapid reorganization of centromeric sequences over short evolutionary timescales highlights their potential as hotspots for evolutionary innovation.

                <p>by Anantu Sunil, Olivia Pedroncini, Andreas T. Schaefer, Tobias Ackels</p>

Odors are transported by seemingly chaotic plumes, whose spatiotemporal structure contains rich information about space, with olfaction serving as a gateway for obtaining and processing this spatial information. Beyond tracking odors, olfaction provides localization and chemical communication cues for detecting conspecifics and predators, and linking external environments to internal cognitive maps. In this Essay, we discuss recent physiological, behavioral, and methodological advancements in mammalian olfactory research to present our current understanding of how olfaction can be used to navigate the environment. We also examine potential neural mechanisms that might convert dynamic olfactory inputs into environmental maps along this axis. Finally, we consider technological applications of odor dynamics for developing bio-inspired sensor technologies, robotics, and computational models. By shedding light on the principles underlying the processing of odor dynamics, olfactory research will pave the way for innovative solutions that bridge the gap between biology and technology, enriching our understanding of the natural world.

                Background Many antidiabetic medications with distinct modes of action are available, The sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are among the most recent oral antihyperglycemic medications. The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin, a biguanide medication, as the first option for oral control of type 2 diabetes because it has demonstrated promise in this regard. Aim of the study To evaluate and compare the effects of metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors on general urine parameters in T2DM patients from Iraq. Method a prospective cohort study where 101 adult patients of both sexes aged under 70 years and newly diagnosed with T2DM, patients were divided into two groups, Metformin group (n=52), where metformin was prescribed as monotherapy by the clinician and SGLT-2 inhibitors group (n=49) where either dapagliflozin or empagliflozin were prescribed by the clinician, general urine examination was done for each patient in the first contact and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results The mean age was 57±9 years for the metformin group and 54±9 years for the SGLT-2 inhibitors group. There was no significant difference in leukocytes, erythrocytes, or epithelial cell counts between the metformin group and the SGLT2 inhibitor group before and after 12 weeks of treatment. There was a significant difference (p-value =0.043) in leukocytes and a non-significant difference in erythrocytes and epithelial cell counts before and after treatment in the SGLT-2 inhibitors group. Conclusions Diabetic patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors treatment demonstrated higher leukocyte count than metformin group patients, an indicator and predictor for higher susceptibility to urinary tract infections.

                Background The zoonotic infection caused by tapeworms Echinococcus is a neglected tropical disease in poor regions with limited access to suitable sanitary conditions. Hydatid cysts produced by Echinococcus granulosus use fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABP) to obtain the fatty acids and cholesterol necessary for their survival from the host.

Results This research has enabled us to clarify the EgFABP1 isoforms identified in the database, suggesting their potential involvement in diverse cellular activities of Echinococcus granulosus. Conversely, examining the global and local chemical reactivity of 14 fatty acids revealed that liposolubility is contingent upon the degree of unsaturation in the FAs. Additionally, FAs exhibited acceptable levels of oral absorption and bioavailability. The binding of EgFABP1 with FAs analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation showed us that these are highly stable, where the best affinity was with docosahexaenoic acid. Conclusions Our results suggest that the action of fatty acids could play an interesting role in detecting early Echinococcus granulosus.

                Neurodegenerative disorders represent a leading cause of disability among the elderly population, and Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent. Emerging evidence suggests a frequent co-occurrence of circadian disruption and PD. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear: is circadian disruption a cause, consequence, or a parallel feature of the disease that shares the same root cause? This review seeks to address this question by highlighting and discussing clinical evidence and findings from experiments using vertebrate and invertebrate animal models. While research on causality is still in its early stages, the available data suggest reciprocal interactions between PD progression and circadian disruption.

                The algorithm of the prefrontal working memory system on sequence memory tasks is not well understood, whereas it is well understood for the hippocampal episodic memory system. This work shows a mathematical duality between working and episodic sequence memory. This leads to a computational understanding of sequence working memory—as structured activity slots. This theory algorithmically explains recurrent neural network (RNN) and prefrontal representations during sequence memory tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96953">The actomyosin system is essential for the integrity of the endosomal system in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei</a></h4>

              
                The actin cytoskeleton is a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic cells, yet its complexity varies across different taxa. In the parasitic protist <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, a rudimentary actomyosin system consisting of one actin gene and two myosin genes has been retained despite significant investment in the microtubule cytoskeleton. The functions of this highly simplified actomyosin system remain unclear, but appear to centre on the endomembrane system. Here, advanced light and electron microscopy imaging techniques, together with biochemical and biophysical assays, were used to explore the relationship between the actomyosin and endomembrane systems. The class I myosin (TbMyo1) had a large cytosolic pool and its ability to translocate actin filaments in vitro was shown here for the first time. TbMyo1 exhibited strong association with the endosomal system and was additionally found on glycosomes. At the endosomal membranes, TbMyo1 colocalised with markers for early and late endosomes (TbRab5A and TbRab7, respectively), but not with the marker associated with recycling endosomes (TbRab11). Actin and myosin were simultaneously visualised for the first time in trypanosomes using an anti-actin chromobody. Disruption of the actomyosin system using the actin-depolymerising drug latrunculin A resulted in a delocalisation of both the actin chromobody signal and an endosomal marker, and was accompanied by a specific loss of endosomal structure. This suggests that the actomyosin system is required for maintaining endosomal integrity in <i>T. brucei</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99303">Sequential replacement of PSD95 subunits in postsynaptic supercomplexes is slowest in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                The concept that dimeric protein complexes in synapses can sequentially replace their subunits has been a cornerstone of Francis Crick’s 1984 hypothesis, explaining how long-term memories could be maintained in the face of short protein lifetimes. However, it is unknown whether the subunits of protein complexes that mediate memory are sequentially replaced in the brain and if this process is linked to protein lifetime. We address these issues by focusing on supercomplexes assembled by the abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95, which plays a crucial role in memory. We used single-molecule detection, super-resolution microscopy and MINFLUX to probe the molecular composition of PSD95 supercomplexes in mice carrying genetically encoded HaloTags, eGFP, and mEoS2. We found a population of PSD95-containing supercomplexes comprised of two copies of PSD95, with a dominant 12.7 nm separation. Time-stamping of PSD95 subunits in vivo revealed that each PSD95 subunit was sequentially replaced over days and weeks. Comparison of brain regions showed subunit replacement was slowest in the cortex, where PSD95 protein lifetime is longest. Our findings reveal that protein supercomplexes within the postsynaptic density can be maintained by gradual replacement of individual subunits providing a mechanism for stable maintenance of their organization. Moreover, we extend Crick’s model by suggesting that synapses with slow subunit replacement of protein supercomplexes and long-protein lifetimes are specialized for long-term memory storage and that these synapses are highly enriched in superficial layers of the cortex where long-term memories are stored.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91648">Genetic requirement of dact1/2 to regulate noncanonical Wnt signaling and calpain 8 during embryonic convergent extension and craniofacial morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Wnt signaling plays crucial roles in embryonic patterning including the regulation of convergent extension (CE) during gastrulation, the establishment of the dorsal axis, and later, craniofacial morphogenesis. Further, Wnt signaling is a crucial regulator of craniofacial morphogenesis. The adapter proteins Dact1 and Dact2 modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through binding to Disheveled. However, the distinct relative functions of Dact1 and Dact2 during embryogenesis remain unclear. We found that <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> genes have dynamic spatiotemporal expression domains that are reciprocal to one another suggesting distinct functions during zebrafish embryogenesis. Both <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> contribute to axis extension, with compound mutants exhibiting a similar CE defect and craniofacial phenotype to the <i>wnt11f2</i> mutant. Utilizing single-cell RNAseq and an established noncanonical Wnt pathway mutant with a shortened axis (<i>gpc4</i>), we identified <i>dact1/2</i>-specific roles during early development. Comparative whole transcriptome analysis between wildtype and <i>gpc4</i> and wildtype and <i>dact1/2</i> compound mutants revealed a novel role for <i>dact1/2</i> in regulating the mRNA expression of the classical calpain <i>capn8</i>. Overexpression of <i>capn8</i> phenocopies <i>dact1/2</i> craniofacial dysmorphology. These results identify a previously unappreciated role of <i>capn8</i> and calcium-dependent proteolysis during embryogenesis. Taken together, our findings highlight the distinct and overlapping roles of <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> in embryonic craniofacial development, providing new insights into the multifaceted regulation of Wnt signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96085">ACK1 and BRK non-receptor tyrosine kinase deficiencies are associated with familial systemic lupus and involved in efferocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, the pathophysiology and genetic basis of which are incompletely understood. Using a forward genetic screen in multiplex families with SLE, we identified an association between SLE and compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) <i>ACK1</i> and <i>BRK</i>. Experimental blockade of ACK1 or BRK increased circulating autoantibodies in vivo in mice and exacerbated glomerular IgG deposits in an SLE mouse model. Mechanistically, NRTKs regulate activation, migration, and proliferation of immune cells. We found that the patients’ <i>ACK1</i> and <i>BRK</i> variants impair efferocytosis, the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells, in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived macrophages, which may contribute to SLE pathogenesis. Overall, our data suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies are associated with human SLE and impair efferocytosis in macrophages.

">Machine Learning Identifies Genes Linked to Neurological Disorders Induced by Equine Encephalitis viruses (EEV), Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), and Organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA)</a></h4>

              
                Venezuelan, eastern, and western equine encephalitis viruses (collectively referred to as equine encephalitis viruses---EEV) cause serious neurological diseases and are a significant threat to the civilian population and the warfighter. Likewise, organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA) are highly toxic chemicals that pose serious health threats of neurological deficits to both military and civilian personnel around the world. Consequently, only a select few approved research groups are permitted to study these dangerous chemical and biological warfare agents. This has created a significant gap in our scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological diseases. Valuable insights may be gleaned by drawing parallels to other extensively researched neuropathologies, such as traumatic brain injuries (TBI). By examining combined gene expression profiles, common and unique molecular characteristics may be discovered, providing new insights into medical countermeasures (MCMs) for TBI, EEV infection and OPNA neuropathologies and sequelae. In this study, we collected transcriptomic datasets for neurological disorders caused by TBI, EEV, and OPNA injury, and implemented a framework to normalize and integrate gene expression datasets derived from various platforms. Effective machine learning approaches were developed to identify critical genes that are associated, either shared among the three neuropathologies or to either TBI, EEV, and OPNA. With the aid of deep neural networks, we were able to extract important association signals for accurate prediction of different neurological disorders by using integrated gene expression datasets of VEEV, OPNA, and TBI samples. Gene ontology and pathway analyses further identified neuropathologic features with specific gene product attributes and functions, shedding light on the fundamental biology of these neurological disorders. Collectively, we highlight a workflow to analyze published transcriptomic data using machine learning, which can be used for both identification of gene biomarkers that are unique to specific neurological conditions, as well as genes shared across multiple neuropathologies. These shared genes could serve as potential neuroprotective drug targets for conditions like EEV, TBI, and OPNA.

">Regional heterogeneities of oligodendrocytes determine biased distribution pattern of Ranvier nodes along single axons in sound localization circuit</a></h4>

              
                Distribution of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, significantly influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. The patterns of nodal distribution are not necessarily uniform but vary across brain regions and even along individual axons. Although various factors could contribute to these patterns, the complexity arising from multicellular interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons has left the underlying regulatory mechanisms unclear. In this study, we identified the factors contributing to the emergence of a biased nodal distribution pattern along single axons using the chick brainstem auditory circuit as a model, in which the distance between adjacent nodes (internodal length) varies along the axons of avian cochlear nucleus neurons in a region-dependent manner, thereby enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length and oligodendrocyte morphology, either, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes determines the biased nodal distribution pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.

">Global and local nature of cortical slow waves</a></h4>

              
                Explaining the macroscopic activity of a recorded neuronal population from its known microscopic properties still poses a great challenge, not just because of the many local agents that shape the output of a circuit, but due to the impact of long-range connections from other brain regions. Here we use a computational model to explore how local and global components of a network shape the Slow Wave Activity (SWA). We performed a sensitivity analysis of multiple cellular and synaptic features in models of isolated and connected networks. This allowed us to explore how the interaction of local properties and long-range connections shape the SWA of a population and its neighbors, as well as how the sequential propagation of active Up states lead to the emergence of preferred modes of propagation. We described relevant features of cortical Up states that are modulated by stiff combinations of parameters of the local circuit as opposed to other that are sensitive to the level of excitability of the whole network and the input coming from neighbor populations. We found that while manipulations in the synaptic excitatory/inhibitory balance can create local changes, cellular components that modulate the excitability or adaptation of a population have a long-range effect that leads to changes in neighbor populations too. Additionally, our simulations guided in vivo experiments that showed how heterogeneities in excitability between cortical areas can determine the directionality of travelling waves during SWA. We expect these results to motivate future research exploring and comparing cortical circuits through the analysis of their Up states.

">Oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei bidirectionally modulate food intake</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide produced in the paraventricular (PVH) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus. Either peripheral or central administration of OT suppresses food intake through reductions in meal size. However, pharmacological approaches do not differentiate whether observed effects are mediated by OT neurons located in the PVH or in the SON. To address this, we targeted OT neuron-specific designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in either the PVH or SON in rats, thus allowing for evaluation of food intake following selective activation of OT neurons separately in each nucleus. Results revealed that DREADDs-mediated excitation of PVH OT neurons reduced consumption of both standard chow and a high fat high sugar diet (HFHS) via reductions in meal size. On the contrary, SON OT neuron activation had the opposite effect by increasing both standard chow and liquid sucrose consumption, with the former effect mediated by an increase in meal size. To further examine the physiological role of OT neurons in eating behavior, a viral-mediated approach was used to silence synaptic transmission of OT neurons separately in either the PVH or SON. Results from these studies revealed that PVH OT neuron silencing significantly increased consumption of HFHS by increasing meal size whereas SON OT neuron silencing reduced chow consumption by decreasing meal size. Collectively these data reveal that PVH and SON OT neurons differentially modulate food intake by either increasing or decreasing satiation signaling, respectively.

">Soma-centered control of synaptic autophagy by Rab39-regulated anterograde trafficking of Atg9</a></h4>

              
                Presynaptic terminals can be located far from the neuronal cell body and are thought to independently regulate protein and organelle turnover. In this work, we report a soma-centered mechanism that regulates autophagy-driven protein turnover at distant presynaptic terminals in Drosophila. We show that this system is regulated by Rab39, whose human homolog is mutated in Parkinson's disease. Although Rab39 is localized in the soma, its loss of function causes increased autophagy at presynaptic terminals, resulting in faster synaptic protein turnover and neurodegeneration. Using a large-scale unbiased genetic modifier screen, we identified genes encoding cytoskeletal and axonal organizing proteins, including Shortstop (Shot), as suppressors of synaptic autophagy. We demonstrate that Rab39 controls Shot- and Unc104/KIF1a-mediated transport of autophagy-related Atg9 vesicles to synapses. Under starvation conditions, Rab39 in the soma shifts its localization from endosomes to lysosomes, thereby controlling the availability of Atg9 vesicles for trafficking to synapses. Our findings indicate that Rab39-mediated trafficking in the soma orchestrates a cross-compartmental mechanism that regulates the abundance of autophagy at synapses.

">Beta burst characteristics and coupling within the sensorimotor cortical-subthalamic nucleus circuit in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bursts of exaggerated subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta activity contribute to clinical impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD). Few studies have explored the characteristics and coupling of bursts across the sensorimotor cortical-STN circuit. Objective: We sought to (1) establish the characteristics of sensorimotor cortical and STN bursts during naturalistic behaviours, and (2) determine the predictability of STN bursts from motor cortical recordings. Methods: We analysed 1,478 hours of wirelessly streamed bilateral sensorimotor cortical and STN recordings from 5 PD patients. Results: STN bursts were longer than cortical bursts and had shorter inter-burst intervals. Long bursts (>200ms) in both structures displayed temporal overlap (>30%), with an estimated cortico-STN conduction delay of 8ms. Furthermore, approximately 27% of all STN bursts were preceded by a cortical burst. Conclusion: Cortical beta bursts tend to precede STN beta bursts, with short delays. However, subcortical mechanisms are also likely to contribute to STN burst initiation and propagation.

">Nanoparticles loaded with a CSF1R antagonist selectively depletes microglial cells and modulates inflammation in spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is a principal event occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI). M1-like microglia are key players in the inflammatory response after injury. We hypothesize that the depletion of this microglia subtype would result in a more pro-resolutive environment, favorable to SCI repair. The colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) antagonist PLX5622 has been used to deplete microglia in the central nervous system. Although PLX5622 can freely cross the blood-brain barrier after systemic administration, the low drug concentration within the SCI site hampers its effectiveness. Additionally, systemic administration of PLX5622 in the scope of SCI treatment can induce side effects due to off-target accumulation. In this study, we specifically depleted M1-like microglia by designing polymeric nanoparticles loaded with PLX5622 (PLX NPs) to locally treat spinal cord contusion. PLX NP was prepared using a microfluidic-assisted approach showing high encapsulation efficiency (approx. 84%), nanosized dimensions (100 nm), and batch-to-batch reproducibility. PLX NP displayed selective activity in depleting M1-like microglial cells in both resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mixed microglial cell models compared with the free drug counterparts while preserving non-targeted glial cells. Furthermore, locally administered PLX NP downregulated proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}), increasing the M2/M1-like microglia ratio, thus reducing inflammation in a SCI contusion model. Our data support the hypothesis that local treatment with PLX NPs, a formulation with a high translational value, reduces neuroinflammation, with potential applications in SCI and central nervous system inflammatory diseases.

">Semantic integration demands modulate large-scale network interactions in the brain</a></h4>

              
                The ability to integrate semantic information into the context of a sentence is essential for human communication. Several studies have shown that the predictability of a final keyword based on the sentence context influences semantic integration on the behavioral, neurophysiological, and neural level. However, the architecture of the underlying network interactions for semantic integration across the lifespan remains unclear. In this study, 32 healthy participants (30-75 years) performed an auditory cloze probability task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), requiring lexical decisions on the sentence's final words. Semantic integration demands were implicitly modulated by presenting sentences with expected, unexpected, anomalous, or pseudoword endings. To elucidate network interactions supporting semantic integration, we combined univariate task-based fMRI analyses with seed-based connectivity and between-network connectivity analyses. Behavioral data revealed typical semantic integration effects, with increased integration demands being associated with longer response latencies and reduced accuracy. Univariate results demonstrated increased left frontal and temporal brain activity for sentences with higher integration demands. Between-network interactions highlighted the role of task-positive and default mode networks for sentence processing with increased semantic integration demands. Furthermore, increasing integration demands led to a higher number of behaviorally relevant network interactions, suggesting that the increased between-network coupling becomes more relevant for successful task performance as integration demands increase. Our findings elucidate the complex network interactions underlying semantic integration across the aging continuum. Stronger interactions between various task-positive and default mode networks correlated with more efficient processing of sentences with increased semantic integration demands. These results may inform future studies with healthy old and clinical populations.

">The human claustrum activates across multiple cognitive tasks</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control, the ability to manage information during purposeful actions, is crucial for everyday functioning and can become impaired in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. The claustrum, a subcortical brain structure, has recently been implicated in functional mechanisms underlying cognitive control. A current theory on the claustrum's function, the Network Instantiation in Cognitive Control (NICC) model, proposes that the claustrum acts as a cortical network hub synchronizing distant parts of the brain to optimize task performance across cognitive domains. Testing this in this study, we examined the claustrum signal within a dataset (n = 55) that includes functional MRI (fMRI) of healthy participants engaged in four well-established cognitive tasks: the Stroop task, AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT), cued task-switching, and Sternberg working memory task. Bilateral claustrum activation was observed during certain conditions and trial phases of all four tasks, particularly during active use of cognitive control, and coinciding with task-positive cortical network activations. These findings provide further support for the NICC model of claustrum function, demonstrating claustrum activation across multiple cognitive tasks, and potentially paving the way for new insights into how cognitive processes can become compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Elevated EGR1 Binding at Enhancers in Excitatory Neurons Correlates with Neuronal Subtype-Specific Epigenetic Regulation</a></h4>

              
                Brain development and neuronal cell specification are accompanied with epigenetic changes to achieve diverse gene expression regulation. Interacting with cell-type specific epigenetic marks, transcription factors bind to different sets of cis-regulatory elements in different types of cells. Currently, it remains largely unclear how cell-type specific gene regulation is achieved for neurons. In this study, we generated epigenetic maps to perform comparative histone modification analysis between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We found that neuronal cell-type specific histone modifications are enriched in super enhancer regions containing abundant EGR1 motifs. Further CUT&RUN data validated that more EGR1 binding sites can be detected in excitatory neurons and primarily located in enhancers. Integrative analysis revealed that EGR1 binding is strongly correlated with various epigenetic markers for open chromatin regions and associated with distinct gene pathways with neuronal subtype-specific functions. In inhibitory neurons, the majority of genomic regions hosting EGR1 binding sites become accessible at early embryonic stages. In contrast, the super enhancers in excitatory neurons hosting EGR1 binding sites gained their accessibility during postnatal stages. This study highlights the significance of transcription factor binding to enhancer regions, which may play a crucial role in establishing cell-type specific gene regulation in neurons.

">Measuring flicker induced vasodilation at a high spatial and temporal resolution in the human retina.</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is a crucial process in which blood flow is dynamically adjusted to meet the metabolic demands of active neurons. In this study, we introduce an innovative method for in-vivo imaging of retinal blood vessel dilation in response to visible light stimulation, offering insights into the functional regulation of retinal blood flow. Using high-resolution, high-speed phase contrast imaging, we continuously monitored retinal vessel dynamics in eight healthy subjects, capturing precise temporal and spatial changes in vessel size under both stimulated and baseline conditions. We have measured a significant vessel dilation of 5.2% +/- 1.6% (4.4 um +/- 1.3 um) during flicker-stimulation compared to a dilation of 2.5% +/- 1% (2.1 um +/- 0.9 um) without stimulation. The flexibility of our method also allowed for the exploration of various acquisition and stimulation settings, broadening possibilities for investigating neurovascular coupling in the retina. This work not only enhances our understanding of neurovascular coupling but also has the potential to identify new biomarkers for vision-impairing conditions and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Neural signatures of temporal anticipation in human cortex represent event probability density</a></h4>

              
                Temporal prediction is a fundamental function of neural systems. Recent advances suggest that humans anticipate future events by calculating probability density functions, rather than hazard rates. However, direct neural evidence for this mechanism is lacking. We recorded neural activity using magnetoencephalography as participants anticipated auditory and visual events distributed in time. We show that temporal anticipation, measured as reaction times, approximates the event probability density function, but not hazard rate. Temporal anticipation manifests as spatiotemporally patterned activity in three anatomically and functionally distinct parieto-temporal and sensorimotor cortical areas. In both audition and vision, each of these areas revealed a marked neural signature of anticipation: Prior to sensory cues, activity in a specific frequency band of neural oscillations, spanning alpha and beta ranges, encodes the event probability density function. Strikingly, these neural signals predicted reaction times to imminent sensory cues. These results show that supra-modal representations of probability density across cortex underlie the anticipation of future events.

">Exploring the Neural Basis and Validity of Ordinal Emotion Representation through EEG</a></h4>

              
                Accurately measuring emotion is a major challenge in advancing the understanding of human emotion and developing emotional artificial intelligence. In many existing studies, participants' emotional ratings in interval scales are considered the true reflection of their emotional experiences. However, recent research suggests that ordinal annotations of emotions can more accurately capture the emotional expression process, providing a potential method for more precise emotion measurement. However, our understanding of the characteristics and validity of this new form of emotion representation is still relatively lacking. In particular, there is a lack of research using neural signals to explore the validity and neural basis of ordinal emotion representation. In this study, we used a video-elicited EEG dataset (n = 123) to identify the neural basis of ordinal emotion representation and demonstrate its validity from a neural perspective. Furthermore, we explored various characteristics of ordinal emotion representation, showing how it is superior to the interval form. First, we conducted inter-situation representational similarity analysis (RSA) and inter-subject RSA to test the degree to which ordinal representation captures both group commonalities and individual differences of emotion. Next, we investigated the characteristics of ordinal representation under different combinations of emotion items, including uni-variate and multivariate emotions, positive and negative emotions. Our results show that both group commonalities and inter-subject variations in EEG features are better explained by ordinal emotion representations than by interval ones. Multivariate ordinal representations showed better inter-subject reliability and higher representational similarity with EEG features compared to univariate counterparts, highlighting the co-occurrence nature of human emotions. Compared to negative emotions, ordinal representation showed greater improvements for positive emotions, suggesting that the complexity of positive emotions is well captured by ordinal representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that multivariate ordinal emotion ratings provide a more accurate measure of real emotional experience, which is crucial for enabling machines to precisely understand and express human emotions.

">Pupillometry and Whole-Brain c-Fos Mapping Uncover Multimodal Mirror Mechanisms in Emotional Contagion Networks of Mice</a></h4>

              
                Emotional contagion (ECo) represents a fundamental form of empathy. In this study, we used pupillometry to quantify ECo by assessing pupil responses of a mouse watching another mouse receive a tail shock. Pupil dilation effectively measured both direct and vicarious emotional response thresholds at the individual level through psychometric curve analysis. The pupillary ECo response diminished when the observer could not see the demonstrator, suggesting a multisensory process involving vision. Viewing videos of tail-shocked mice was sufficient to elicit a pupil response in the observer. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed a broad network of 88 brain regions activated during ECo, with all areas activated in the demonstrator also engaged in the observer. Additionally, in certain brain regions, correlated activation was detected between each observer-demonstrator pair, indicating that ECo promotes a shared neural state. These findings advance our understanding of the neural basis of empathy, with implications for analyzing neuropsychiatric disorder models.

                Secreted proteins mediate intercellular communication throughout the lives of multicellular organisms. However, due to the lack of new technology for secreted protein capturing, the progress of "secretomics" lags behind. Here, we report a two-step secretome enrichment method (tsSEM) combining unnatural amino acid labeling and click chemistry-based biorthogonal reaction, which enables in vitro secretome profiling in the presence of serum. Using this novel method, we systematically investigated the secretome of human iPSCs-derived astrocytes (iAst) in different disease models and identified a panel of astrocyte-secreted proteins that are responsible for its non-cell autonomous toxicity under disease conditions. Furthermore, we validated two astrocytes-derived novel neurotrophic proteins, FAM3C and KITLG, which we identified from disease models, and found that they could boost neurite outgrowth, protect neurons, and promote neural progenitor proliferation. Our study highlights the utility of secretome profiling of iAst and demonstrates its applications in disease study and target identification and validation in drug development.

">Development of Non-Spatial Grid-Like Neural Codes Predicts Inference and Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Piaget's theory emphasizes children develop structured knowledge schemas for assimilating new concepts, yet the neural mechanisms and their link to intelligence remain unclear. In 203 participants aged 8-25 years, we investigated how maturation of neural representations of a two-dimensional knowledge map supports inferential reasoning and assimilation. We found that grid-cell-like neural codes in the entorhinal cortex (EC) strengthen with age, forming structured representations in non-spatial conceptual spaces. This maturation is directly linked to improved inferential reasoning. These grid-like codes support the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in encoding distance relationships between concepts. As participants assimilated new information, they integrated it into existing grid patterns in the EC. Furthermore, maturation of these neural codes predicts real-world intelligence measures, particularly in abstract reasoning. Our findings show that the development of non-spatial grid-like neural codes underpins inference and knowledge assimilation, providing a neural basis for cognitive development and linking cellular neuroscience with intelligence.

">Humidity-dependent structural adaptations of Drosophila melanogaster hygrosensilla</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how organisms detect environmental humidity remains a fundamental problem in sensory biology. While specialized sensory neurons in insect antennae can detect changes in humidity, the mechanism underlying this ability is not fully understood. Here, we present an integrated approach combining precise humidity control, rapid cryo-preservation, and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to investigate the ultrastructure of hygrosensilla in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. We developed a deep learning-based segmentation pipeline to analyze three-dimensional structural features of sensilla exposed to different humidity conditions at stable temperature. Our analysis reveals consistent differences in sensilla width between high (80% RH) and low (26% RH) humidity conditions across all chambers of the sacculus. Additionally, we identified chamber-specific patterns in sensilla tapering, indicating specialized structural adaptations across different sensilla populations. The observed structural changes suggest a potential role for mechanical transduction in humidity sensing. This study establishes a technical framework for high-resolution analysis of sensory organs while providing new insights into the structural basis of humidity detection. Our findings advance our understanding of how specialized sensory organs might transduce environmental signals into neural responses.

">Opposite-sex pairing alters social interaction-induced GCaMP and dopamine activity in the insular cortex of male prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is a monogamous rodent species which displays selective social behaviors to conspecifics after establishing a pair bonded relationship, specifically partner-directed affiliation and stranger-directed aggression. This social selectivity relies on the ability of an individual to respond appropriately to a social context and requires salience detection and valence assignment. The anterior insular cortex (aIC) has been implicated in stimulus processing and categorization across a variety of contexts and is well-situated to integrate environmental stimuli and internal affective states to modulate complex goal-directed behaviors and social decision-making. Surprisingly, the contribution of the aIC to the expression of pair bond-induced social selectivity in prairie voles has been drastically understudied. Here we examined whether neural activity and gene expression in the aIC change in response to opposite-sex pairing and/or as a function of pairing length in male prairie voles. Opposite-sex pairing was characterized by changes to calcium and dopamine (DA) transients in the aIC that corresponded with the display of social selectivity across pair bond maturation. Furthermore, D1 and D2 receptor mRNA expression was significantly higher in males after 48 hrs of cohabitation with a female partner compared to same-sex housed males, and D2 mRNA remained significantly higher in males with a female partner compared to same-sex housed males after a week of cohabitation. Together, these results implicate a role for DA and its receptors in the aIC across the transition from early- to late-phase pair bonding.

">Neural networks simulating short-term memory of two inputs with varying commonality</a></h4>

              
                The activity and connectivity of neurons in the primate brain underlying behavior cannot yet be completely specified, but neural networks provide complete models of the connectivity and activity that performs specific tasks and provide insight into the neural computations performed by the primate brain (Fetz and Shupe 2003). Studies of neurons in the monkey cortex have shown that short-term memory of sensory events may be mediated by sustained neural activity. Short-term memory tasks have been modeled with dynamic neural networks using a single continuous variable and a gate input to create a sample-and-hold (SAH) function (Zipser 1991; Maier 2003). Networks trained to perform these short-term memory tasks develop hidden unit activity which resembles that of cortical neurons in monkeys performing memory tasks. We here extend the investigation of single-input SAH networks to networks computing SAH for two continuous-variable inputs that have varying degrees of common mode signal. Results provide insights into computational mechanisms of associative short-term memory of sensory signals with common mode components, such as visual inputs to the two eyes, auditory inputs to the ears and proprioceptive input from multiple muscle spindle afferents. We also examined the attractor states that these SAH networks eventually reach after sufficiently long delay periods and found that these were determined by the shapes of the input-output functions of the hidden units rather than network architecture.

">Gaze when walking to grasp an object in the presence of obstacles</a></h4>

              
                People generally look at positions that are important for their current actions, such as objects they intend to grasp. What if there are obstacles on their path to such objects? We asked participants to walk into a room and pour the contents of a cup placed on a table into another cup elsewhere on the table. There were two small obstacles on the floor between the door and the table. There was a third obstacle on the table near the target cup. Participants mainly looked at the items on the table, but as they approached and entered the room they often looked at the floor near the obstacles, although there was nothing particularly informative to see there. They relied on peripheral vision and memory of where they had seen obstacles to avoid kicking the obstacles. From well before participants crossed the obstacles, they primarily looked at the object that they intended to grasp. We conclude that people look at positions at which they plan to interact with the environment in a specific manner, rather than at items that constrain such interactions.

">Differential Engagement of Associative-Limbic and Sensorimotor Regions of the Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia in Explicit vs. Implicit Emotional Processing</a></h4>

              
                Emotional prosody processing involves multiple brain regions, but the specific roles of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in explicit (conscious) and implicit (incidental) tasks are not well known or understood. This study investigated how the cerebellum and basal ganglia contribute to explicit (emotion categorization) and implicit (gender categorization) processing of emotional prosody. Twenty-eight healthy French-speaking participants underwent high-resolution functional MRI while performing a vocal emotion processing task under such implicit and explicit conditions. Behavioral data analyses indicated greater accuracy in the gender discrimination task (implicit processing). Neuroimaging partially supported our hypothesis according to which explicit emotion processing yielded increased activations in associative-limbic regions (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus, Crus I and caudate) linked to higher-order functions, while implicit emotion processing engaged sensorimotor regions (primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex) and areas associated with automatic processing (putamen, posterior insula, cerebellar lobules VIIIa-b and IX). Unexpected activity during task conditions suggest motor preparation effects and more complex brain network dynamics. These results challenge modular views of brain function and highlight the need to consider emotional processing as complex, dynamic, network-based interactions.

">SIGNAL: Dataset for Semantic and Inferred Grammar Neurological Analysis of Language</a></h4>

              
                Recently, the idea of comparison of models' representations and human brain signals has been a topic of several works. Consequently, several datasets with text data and EEG representations have been published. However, most of the datasets are based on normal reading task with grammatical sentences. At the same time, in the interpretability studies of LLMs, more and more attention is paid to thoroughly designed linguistic tasks based on acceptability measures. In this paper, we present SIGNAL, a dataset for Semantic and Inferred Grammar Neurological Analysis of Language. Our dataset contains a group of sentences with a combination of a fully acceptable sentence and a grammatically or/and semantically incongruent sentences. The dataset has been approved by native speakers and later used for an EEG experiment. In total, our dataset contains recordings of 21 participants, each of whom read 600 sentences. In addition, we present a pilot study where we compare EEG analysis with simple probing experiments.

">Slow and fast gamma oscillations show phase-amplitude coupling with distinct high-frequency bands in macaque primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations (25-70 Hz) can be induced in the visual cortex by presenting stimuli like gratings. Large stimuli produce two distinct gamma oscillations in primate primary visual cortex (V1) - slow (25-40 Hz) and fast (40-70 Hz), possibly due to different interneuronal networks. While fast-gamma has been shown to strongly lock spikes, slow-gamma does not, and hence its role in cortical processing is unclear. Here, we studied potential influence of gamma rhythms on neural activity using phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). We recorded spikes, local field potential and electrocorticogram (ECoG) from V1 of two adult female monkeys while presenting stimuli that simultaneously induced both gamma rhythms, and developed a novel method that reduces the influence of spike-related-transient on PAC. Interestingly, while fast-gamma showed coupling with frequencies above 150 Hz, reflecting spike-locking, slow-gamma showed PAC in a distinct frequency range between 80-150 Hz, which was especially prominent in ECoG. PAC varied with orientation and spatial frequency in the same way as power in the respective frequency bands, confirming dissociation in the coupling of the two gamma rhythms. Thus, fast-gamma could be more involved in spike-locking, while slow-gamma could represent a modulatory signal acting by amplitude modulation between 80-150 Hz at a more global scale.

">Axonal transcriptome reveals upregulation of PLK1 as a protective mechanism in response to increased DNA damage in FUSP525L spinal motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the gene FUSED IN SARCOMA (FUS) are among the most frequently occurring genetic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Early pathogenesis of FUS-ALS involves impaired DNA damage response and axonal degeneration. However, it is still poorly understood how these gene mutations lead to selective spinal motor neuron (MN) degeneration and how nuclear and axonal phenotypes are linked. To specifically address this, we applied a compartment specific RNA-sequencing approach using microfluidic chambers to generate axonal as well as somatodendritic compartment-specific profiles from isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived MNs. We demonstrate high purity of axonal and soma fractions and show that the axonal transcriptome is unique and distinct from that of somas including significantly fewer number of transcripts. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in axons were mainly enriched in key pathways like RNA metabolism and DNA damage, complementing our knowledge of early phenotypes in ALS pathogenesis and known functions of FUS. In addition, we demonstrate a strong enrichment for cell cycle associated genes including significant upregulation of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in FUSP525L mutant MNs. PLK1 was increased upon DNA damage induction and PLK1 inhibition further increased the number of DNA damage foci in etoposide-treated cells, an effect that was diminished in case of FUS mutant MNs. In contrast, inhibition of PLK1 increased late apoptotic or necrosis-induced neuronal cell death in mutant neurons. Taken together, our findings provide insights into compartment-specific transcriptomics in human FUS-ALS MNs and we propose that specific upregulation of PLK1 might represent an early event in the pathogenesis of ALS, possibly modulating DNA damage response and other associated pathways.

">Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms alter neural cell fate specification in EPM1 Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular milieu, including extracellular vesicles (EVs), plays a pivotal role in brain development by regulating neural processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In this study, we sought to elucidate the pathogenesis of progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1 (EPM1), a disease caused by mutations in the CSTB gene, using cerebral organoids (COs) derived from EPM1 patient cells. The results demonstrate that EPM1 COs display increased electrophysiological activity and a disrupted excitatory/inhibitory balance. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of ventral EPM1-COs revealed an abnormal specification of progenitor fate, with a shift toward dorsal neuron identities at the expense of inhibitory interneurons. In addition, pathological alterations in EV biogenesis and cargo were identified, including aberrant Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, which may disrupt cortical patterning. These findings suggest that both intrinsic progenitor identity shifts and extrinsic EV-mediated signaling contribute to EPM1 pathology. Our study highlights potential therapeutic strategies mediated by EVs as a novel approach to mitigate disease progression.

">Expectation Violations as an Effective Alternative to Complex Mentalizing in Novel Communication</a></h4>

              
                Effective communication in the absence of a shared language is a fundamental challenge, often addressed through complex cognitive mechanisms such as Theory of Mind, which allows individuals to infer others' intentions and beliefs. However, this process is cognitively demanding and may not always be necessary. In this study, we propose that a more parsimonious cognitive mechanism-expectancy violations-can serve as an efficient alternative for communication in novel interactions. We tested this in the Tacit Communication Game, where we simulated Sender behavior using four computational models: the Surprise model based on expectancy violations and three levels of Theory of mind. After human Receivers interacted with these simulated Senders, we assessed the effectiveness of communication by analyzing accuracy and reaction times. Our results revealed that Receivers paired with the Surprise model achieved accuracy rates comparable to those interacting with the most complex Theory of mind model and exhibited more human-like message patterns. Additionally, models associated with higher accuracies also resulted in faster reaction times, indicating a reduced cognitive load. These findings challenge the necessity of complex mentalizing strategies in novel human interactions and suggest that an intuitive mechanism of expectancy violation may be a more plausible cognitive mechanism, while also providing quick responses.

">The balance stabilising benefit of social touch: influence of an individual's age and the partner's relative body characteristics</a></h4>

              
                Interpersonal touch (IPT) is a successful strategy to support the stability of and individual's body balance during a multitude of activities in daily life, including physical education and therapy. Despite common practice, however, the influence of an individual's anthropometry and other personal characteristics, such as age, balancing skills, motor experience, and sex as well as interindividual differences in these characteristics between interaction partners on the balance stabilising benefit of social touch is unknown. We assessed an individual's balance stability and change due to IPT provision during single-legged stance in 72 pairs (age range 4 to 63 years) under four sensory conditions: with or without vision in combination with IPT or without. Two participant subgroups were created: one of more vulnerable with low stability and one of more stable, mature participants. Best fitting multiple linear regression models, including moderating variables, for explaining the benefit of IPT in each visual condition indicated that without vision, an individual's benefit of IPT was determined by their balancing skill and the partner-related difference in balancing skill but not by any other factors or partner-related differences. Especially vulnerable individuals improved considerably with IPT when vision was unavailable. With vision complementing IPT, however, an individual's age-dependent motor developmental potential became an additional moderating factor. These findings indicate that the extent to which IPT is benefitting mutual balance stabilisation does not depend on biomechanical factors. Instead, the IPT benefit emerges as a product of both partner's sensorimotor capabilities moderated by a person's motor developmental potential when visual feedback could be utilised. We discuss a theoretical framework that accounts for the observed dependencies of the effect of haptic social support on balance control.

">Mora-ERP-based RNN-Transformer for decoding single-trial EEGs during silent Japanese speeches</a></h4>

              
                We developed a method for decoding single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) during silent Japanese speeches. In order to cope with problems that there would be always noises in single-trial EEGs, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used which could reproduce signals under noises. Each of silent-mora-related potentials and the single-trial EEG minus the event-related potential (ERP) were assigned to the signal and the noise, respectively, with reference to the averaging principle. Next, in our Transformer, dot product between the RNN output and the single-trial EEG after positional encoding then Softmax with Loss yielded probabilities of moras, each of which consists of silent Japanese words, phrases or part of sentences. The present decoding was completed by tracing the maximal probability at each block representing time. Average mora error rates (MERs) on pretrained and validated performances for the patient was as low as 1.5 % and 0 %, respectively. The performance for the testing would be refined by many single-trial EEGs during silent Japanese speeches obtained by EEG Web interfaces. This method might be applied to other mora languages.

">Visuoinertial and visual feedback in online steering control</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration has primarily been studied in static environments, where optimal integration relies on the precision of the respective sensory modalities. However, in numerous situations, sensory information is dynamic and changes over time, due to changes in our bodily state and the surrounding environment. Given that different sensory modalities have different delays, this suggests that optimal integration may not solely depend on sensory precision but may also be affected by the delays associated with each sensory system. To investigate this hypothesis, participants (n = 22, 16 female) engaged in a continuous steering task. Participants sat on a motion platform facing a screen that displayed a cartoonish traffic scene, featuring a car traveling along a road. In the visuoinertial condition, where vestibular and somatosensory feedback were available, they were tasked with counteracting an external multi-frequency perturbation signal, which laterally perturbed the platform and the car, such that the car was kept within the center of the road. In the visual condition, the visual car was perturbed, while the motion platform remained stationary. We show that participants compensate better for the perturbation in the visuoinertial than the visual condition, particularly in the high frequency range of the perturbation. Using computational modelling, we demonstrate that this enhanced performance is partially due to the shorter delay of the vestibular modality. In this condition, participants rely more on the vestibular information, which is less delayed than the more precise but longer delayed, visual information.

">Lactate potentiates NMDA receptor currents via an intracellular redox mechanism targeting cysteines in the C-terminal domain of GluN2B subunits: implications for synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Through the Astrocyte Neuron Lactate Shuttle, astrocyte-derived lactate fuels the high-energy demands of neurons and acts as a signaling molecule, promoting synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Lactate regulates neuronal excitability and modulates the expression of genes related to synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection, but the molecular mode for these signaling actions is uncertain. Using patch-clamp recordings in cultured cortical neurons, we found that lactate enhances both the amplitude and the inactivation time constant of NMDA receptor currents (INMDAR) evoked by brief applications of glutamate and glycine. Not reproduced by HCAR1 agonists, this modulation depends on monocarboxylate transporters and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating the requirement for lactate entry and metabolic conversion into pyruvate and NADH formation within neurons. Disruption of intracellular calcium dynamics or inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a NMDAR-associated kinase linking Ca2+ signal to long-term potentiation (LTP), significantly diminishes the effects of lactate on INMDAR. We identified two redox-sensitive cysteine-containing sequences in the intrinsically disordered intracellular C-terminal domain of the GluN2B subunit that play a role in the potentiation of NMDAR by lactate. In a compelling set of experiments using HEK cells, we observed that the presence of functional CaMKII and GluN2B-containing NMDARs is necessary for the lactate-enhancing effects. Mutations in GluN2B that prevent CaMKII binding or redox regulation via cysteines abrogate the modulatory action of lactate. Immunoprecipitation experiments in neurons attest that lactate increases the association between CaMKII and GluN2B. This interaction is crucial for the potentiation of INMDAR amplitude by lactate. Proximity ligation assays between GluN2B and the postsynaptic density marker PSD-95 revealed that lactate induced an accumulation of GluN2B in dendritic spines, an effect that was prevented by a CaMKII peptide inhibitor. These results highlight a mechanistic pathway whereby lactate boosts NMDAR function through intracellular metabolic conversion and redox-sensitive interactions requiring CaMKII, establishing a link between astrocyte metabolism and synaptic modulation in neurons.

	<p>This paper presents the basis for LoGlo PDT, a new treatment for glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is currently treated with maximal safe resection, temozolomide, and ionizing irradiation. Mortality in 2024 remains over 80% within several years from diagnosis. Oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is an FDA/EMA approved drug that is selectively taken up by malignant cells, including by glioblastoma. In photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma, intense intraoperative light causes glioblastoma tissue that has taken up 5-ALA to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. The requirement for intense light flux has restricted photodynamic treatment to a single one-hour intraoperative session. We analyze here published data showing that external light, illuminating the entire intact scalp, can attain low &amp;amp;mu;W/cm2 flux several cm into intact brain that would be sufficient to mediate 5-ALA photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma if the light and 5-ALA are delivered continuously over 24 h. At the core of LoGlo PDT regimen is the dataset showing that, for a given fluence, as the duration of PDT light delivery goes down, light intensity (flux) delivered must go up to achieve the same glioblastoma cell cytotoxicity as would a weaker light (lower flux) delivered over a longer time. Thus, a repetitive, noninvasive PDT of glioblastoma using an external light source may be possible. We analyze 5-ALA cellular physiology to show that three non-oncology drugs, ciprofloxacin, deferiprone, and telmisartan, can be repurposed to increase light energy capture after 5-ALA, thereby increasing photodynamic treatment&amp;amp;rsquo;s glioblastoma cell cytotoxicity. The LoGlo PDT approach uses both drug augmentation and prolonged ultra-low noninvasive transcranial light delivery for a repetitive, noninvasive 5-ALA photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 1% of population over age 60. It is defined by motor and nonmotor symptoms including a spectrum of cognitive impairments known as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease dementia (PDD). Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for PDD is rivastigmine, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase increasing the level of acetylcholine in the brain. Due to its limited efficacy and side effect profile, rivastigmine is often not prescribed, leaving patients with no treatment options. PD has several derangements in neurotransmitter pathways (dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, kynurenine pathway (KP), acetylcholine, &amp;amp;alpha;7 nicotinic receptor, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors) and rivastigmine is only partially effective as it only targets one pathway. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of tryptophan metabolism, affects the pathophysiology of PDD in multiple ways. Both galantamine (&amp;amp;alpha;7 nicotinic receptor) and memantine (antagonist of the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor) are KYNA modulators. When used in combination, they target multiple pathways. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with each drug alone for PD have failed, the combination of galantamine and memantine has demonstrated a synergistic effect on cognitive enhancement in animal models. It has therapeutic potential that has not been adequately assessed, warranting future randomized controlled trials. In this review, we summarize the KYNA-centric model for PD pathophysiology and discuss how this treatment combination is promising in improving cognitive function in patients with PDD through its action on KYNA.</p>

	<p>Background: Individualizing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) parameters can improve precision in neuropsychiatric disorders. One important decision for the clinician is the selection of an appropriate montage&amp;amp;mdash;conventional or high-definition (HD)&amp;amp;mdash;to implement dose-controlled tDCS while maintaining the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s safety. Method: The present study simulated tDCS administration using T1-weighted brain images of 50 dementia, 25 depression patients, and 25 healthy individuals for two conventional and HD montages, targeting the regions of interest (ROIs) in the dorsal and ventral pathways that support language processing. For each tDCS configuration, the electric fields at the ROIs and the individualized dose required to achieve the desired current intensity at the target ROI across the subjects were estimated. Linear regression was performed on these parameters. Result: A significant relationship between atrophy and current dose that varies according to the disease was found. The dementia patients with significant brain atrophy required a higher personalized dosage for HD montage, as the current intensity at the target ROIs was lower and more variable than that of conventional montage. For dementia, tDCS individualization is pathway-dependent, wherein HD configuration of the dorsal route requires current dosages above the safety limit (&amp;amp;gt;4 mA) for 46% of individuals. However, there was no significant difference in electrode configurations between the HD and traditional setups for depression and healthy volunteers without significant brain atrophy. Conclusions: HD-tDCS with fixed locations is limited, making conventional tDCS more effective for dose-controlled applications. In patients with atrophy, individualized adjustments based on simulations are needed due to the variable stimulation strength in the ROI.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e0223242024?rss=1">The Icelandic Mutation (APP-A673T) Is Protective against Amyloid Pathology In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>A previous epidemiological study in Northern Europe showed that the A673T mutation (Icelandic mutation) in the amyloid precursor protein gene (<I>APP</I>) can protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the effect of the A673T mutation on APP processing has been investigated primarily in vitro, its in vivo impact has not been evaluated. This is mainly because most existing AD mouse models carry the Swedish mutation. The Swedish and Icelandic mutations are both located near the &beta;-cleavage site, and each mutation is presumed to have the opposite effect on &beta;-cleavage. Therefore, in the AD mouse models with the Swedish mutation, its effects could compete with the effects of the Icelandic mutation. Here, we introduced the A673T mutation into <I>App</I> knock-in mice devoid of the Swedish mutation (<I>App<sup>G-F</sup></I> mice) to avoid potential deleterious effects of the Swedish mutation and generated <I>App<sup>G-F-A673T</sup></I> mice. APP-A673T significantly downregulated &beta;-cleavage and attenuated the production of A&beta; and amyloid pathology in the brains of these animals. The Icelandic mutation also reduced neuroinflammation and neuritic alterations. Both sexes were studied. This is the first successful demonstration of the protective effect of the Icelandic mutation on amyloid pathology in vivo. Our findings indicate that specific inhibition of the APP-BACE1 interaction could be a promising therapeutic approach. Alternatively, the introduction of the disease-protective mutation such as APP-A673T using in vivo genome editing technology could be a novel treatment for individuals at high risk for AD, such as familial AD gene mutation carriers and <I>APOE</I> 4 carriers.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e0359242024?rss=1">Kernels of Motor Memory Formation: Temporal Generalization in Bimanual Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In daily life, we coordinate both simultaneous and sequential bimanual movements to manipulate objects. Our ability to rapidly account for different object dynamics suggests there are neural mechanisms to quickly deal with them. Here we investigate how actions of one arm can serve as a contextual cue for the other arm and facilitate adaptation. Specifically, we examine the temporal characteristics that underlie motor memory formation and recall, by testing the contextual effects of prior, simultaneous, and post contralateral arm movements in both male and female human participants. To do so, we measure their temporal generalization in three bimanual interference tasks. Importantly, the timing context of the learned action plays a pivotal role in the temporal generalization. While motor memories trained with post adaptation contextual movements generalize broadly, motor memories trained with prior contextual movements exhibit limited generalization, and motor memories trained with simultaneous contextual movements do not generalize to prior or post contextual timings. This highlights temporal tuning in sensorimotor plasticity: different training conditions yield substantially different temporal generalization characteristics. Since these generalizations extend far beyond any variability in training times, we suggest that the observed differences may stem from inherent differences in the use of prior, current, and post adaptation contextual information in the generation of natural behavior. This would imply differences in the underlying neural circuitry involved in learning and executing the corresponding coordinated bimanual movements.</p>

                <p>Merkel cell&ndash;neurite complexes (MNCs) are enriched in touch-sensitive areas, including whisker hair follicles and the glabrous skin of the rodent's paws, where tactile stimulation elicits slowly adapting type 1 (SA1) tactile impulses to encode for the sense of touch. Recently, we have shown with rodent whisker hair follicles that SA1 impulses are generated through fast excitatory synaptic transmission at MNCs and driven by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). However, it is currently unknown whether, besides whisker hair follicles, ASICs also play an essential role in generating SA1 impulses from MNCs of other body parts in mammals. In the present study, we attempted to address this question by using the skin&ndash;nerve preparations made from the hindpaw glabrous skin and tibial nerves of both male and female rodents and applying the pressure-clamped single&ndash;fiber recordings. We showed that SA1 impulses elicited by tactile stimulation to the rat hindpaw glabrous skin were largely diminished in the presence of amiloride and diminazene, two ASIC channel blockers. Furthermore, using the hindpaw glabrous skin and tibial nerve preparations made from the mice genetically deleted of ASIC3 channels (ASIC3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>), we showed that the frequency of SA1 impulses was significantly lower in ASIC3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice than in littermate wild-type ASIC3<sup>+/+</sup> mice, a result consistent with the pharmacological experiments with ASIC channel blockers. Our findings suggest that ASIC channels are essential for generating SA1 impulses to underlie the sense of touch in the glabrous skin of rodent hindpaws.</p>

                <p>The human auditory cortex is organized according to the timing and spectral characteristics of speech sounds during speech perception. During listening, the posterior superior temporal gyrus is organized according to onset responses, which segment acoustic boundaries in speech, and sustained responses, which further process phonological content. When we speak, the auditory system is actively processing the sound of our own voice to detect and correct speech errors in real time. This manifests in neural recordings as suppression of auditory responses during speech production compared with perception, but whether this differentially affects the onset and sustained temporal profiles is not known. Here, we investigated this question using intracranial EEG recorded from seventeen pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with medication-resistant epilepsy while they performed a reading/listening task. We identified onset and sustained responses to speech in the bilateral auditory cortex and observed a selective suppression of onset responses during speech production. We conclude that onset responses provide a temporal landmark during speech perception that is redundant with forward prediction during speech production and are therefore suppressed. Phonological feature tuning in these "onset suppression" electrodes remained stable between perception and production. Notably, auditory onset responses and phonological feature tuning were present in the posterior insula during both speech perception and production, suggesting an anatomically and functionally separate auditory processing zone that we believe to be involved in multisensory integration during speech perception and feedback control.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e1173242024?rss=1">A Dynamic Link between Respiration and Arousal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Viewing brain function through the lens of other physiological processes has critically added to our understanding of human cognition. Further advances though may need a closer look at the interactions between these physiological processes themselves. Here we characterize the interplay of the highly periodic, and metabolically vital respiratory process and fluctuations in arousal neuromodulation, a process classically seen as nonperiodic. In the data from three experiments (<I>N</I> = 56 / 27 / 25 women and men), we tested for covariations in respiratory and pupil size (arousal) dynamics. After substantiating a robust coupling in the largest dataset, we further show that coupling strength decreases during task performance compared with rest and that it mirrors a decreased respiratory rate when participants take deeper breaths. Taken together, these findings suggest a stronger link between respiratory and arousal processes than previously thought. Moreover, these links imply a stronger coupling during periods of rest, and the effect of respiratory rate on the coupling suggests a driving role. As a consequence, studying the role of neuromodulatory arousal on cortical function may also need to consider respiratory influences.</p>

                <p>The primary cilium, a single microtubule-based organelle protruding from the cell surface and critical for neural development, also functions in adult neurons. While some dorsal root ganglion neurons elaborate a primary cilium, whether it is expressed by and functional in nociceptors is unknown. Recent studies have shown the role of Hedgehog, whose canonical signaling is primary cilium dependent, in nociceptor sensitization. We establish the presence of primary cilia in soma of rat nociceptors, where they contribute to mechanical threshold, prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>)-induced hyperalgesia, and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN). Intrathecal administration of siRNA targeting <I>Ift88</I>, a primary cilium-specific intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein required for ciliary integrity, resulted in attenuation of <I>Ift88</I> mRNA and nociceptor primary cilia. Attenuation of primary cilia was associated with an increase in mechanical nociceptive threshold in vivo and decrease in nociceptor excitability in vitro, abrogation of hyperalgesia, and nociceptor sensitization induced by both a prototypical pronociceptive inflammatory mediator PGE<SUB>2</SUB> and paclitaxel CIPN, in a sex-specific fashion. siRNA targeting <I>Ift52</I>, another IFT protein, and knockdown of NompB, the <I>Drosophila Ift88</I> ortholog, also abrogated CIPN and reduced baseline mechanosensitivity, respectively, providing independent confirmation for primary cilia control of nociceptor function. Hedgehog-induced hyperalgesia is attenuated by <I>Ift88</I> siRNA, supporting the role for primary cilia in Hedgehog-induced hyperalgesia. Attenuation of CIPN by cyclopamine (intradermal and intraganglion), which inhibits Hedgehog signaling, supports the role of Hedgehog in CIPN. Our findings support the role of the nociceptor primary cilium in control of mechanical nociceptive threshold and inflammatory and neuropathic pain, the latter Hedgehog-dependent.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e1353242024?rss=1">Different Subregions of Monkey Lateral Prefrontal Cortex Respond to Abstract Sequences and Their Components</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sequential information permeates daily activities, such as when watching for the correct series of buildings to determine when to get off the bus or train. These sequences include periodicity (the spacing of the buildings), the identity of the stimuli (the kind of house), and higher-order more abstract rules that may not depend on the exact stimulus (e.g., house, house, house, business). Previously, we found that the posterior fundus of area 46 in the monkey lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) responds to rule changes in such abstract visual sequences. However, it is unknown if this region responds to other components of the sequence, i.e., image periodicity and identity, in isolation. Further, it is unknown if this region dissociates from other, more ventral LPFC subregions that have been associated with sequences and their components. To address these questions, we used awake functional magnetic resonance imaging in three male macaque monkeys during two no-report visual tasks. One task contained abstract visual sequences, and the other contained no visual sequences but maintained the same image periodicity and identities. We found the fundus of area 46 responded only to abstract sequence rule violations. In contrast, the ventral bank of area 46 responded to changes in image periodicity and identity, but not changes in the abstract sequence. These results suggest a functional specialization within anatomical substructures of LPFC to signal different kinds of stimulus regularities. This specialization may provide key scaffolding to identify abstract patterns and construct complex models of the world for daily living.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain remains a significant health challenge with limited effective treatments. This study investigates the metabolic changes underlying pain progression and resolution, uncovering a novel compensatory mechanism in sensory neurons. Using the hyperalgesic priming model in male mice, we demonstrate that nerve growth factor (NGF) initially disrupted mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, leading to acute allodynia. Surprisingly, this metabolic disruption persisted even after the apparent resolution of allodynia. We discovered that during the resolution phase, sensory neurons exhibit increased glutamine oxidation and upregulation of the major glutamine transporter ASCT2 in dorsal root ganglia. This compensatory response plays a crucial role in pain resolution, as demonstrated by our experiments. Knockdown of ASCT2 prevents the resolution of NGF-induced allodynia and precipitates the transition to a chronic state. Furthermore, we show that the glutamine catabolite &alpha;-ketoglutarate attenuated glycolytic flux and alleviated allodynia in both acute and chronic phases of the hyperalgesic priming model. The importance of ASCT2 is further confirmed in a translational model, where its knockdown prevented the resolution of allodynia following plantar incision. These findings highlight the pivotal role of metabolic changes in pain resolution and identify ASCT2-mediated glutamine metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain. Understanding these endogenous mechanisms that promote pain resolution can guide the development of novel interventions to prevent the transition pain from acute to chronic.</p>

                <p>Growth hormone (GH) action in the brain regulates neuroendocrine axes, energy and glucose homeostasis, and several neurological functions. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contains numerous neurons that respond to a systemic GH injection by expressing the phosphorylated STAT5, a GH receptor (GHR) signaling marker. However, the potential role of GHR signaling in the LHA is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that ~70% of orexin- and leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing neurons in the LHA are responsive to GH. Male mice carrying inactivation of the <I>Ghr</I> gene in the LHA were generated via bilateral injections of an adeno-associated virus. In <I>ad libitum</I>-fed mice, GHR ablation in LHA neurons did not significantly change energy and glucose homeostasis. Subsequently, mice were subjected to 5&nbsp;d of 40% food restriction. Food restriction decreased body weight, energy expenditure, and carbohydrate oxidation. These effects were similarly observed in control and LHA<sup>GHR</sup> mice. While food-deprived control mice progressively increased ambulatory/exploratory activity and food-seeking behavior, LHA<sup>GHR</sup> mice did not show hyperactivity induced by food restriction. GHR ablation in the LHA reduced the percentage of orexin neurons expressing c-Fos during food restriction. Additionally, an acute GH injection increased the expression of c-Fos in LHA<sup>ORX</sup> neurons. Inactivation of <I>Ghr</I> in LepR-expressing cells did not prevent hyperactivity in food-deprived mice, whereas whole-brain <I>Ghr</I> knock-out mice showed reduced ambulatory activity during food restriction. Our findings indicate that GHR signaling in the LHA regulates the activity of orexin neurons and is necessary to increase food-seeking behavior in food-deprived male mice.</p>

                <p>Humans possess a remarkable ability to rapidly access diverse information from others&rsquo; faces with just a brief glance, which is crucial for intricate social interactions. While previous studies using event-related potentials/fields have explored various face dimensions during this process, the interplay between these dimensions remains unclear. Here, by applying multivariate decoding analysis to neural signals recorded with optically pumped magnetometer magnetoencephalography, we systematically investigated the temporal interactions between invariant and variable aspects of face stimuli, including race, gender, age, and expression. First, our analysis revealed unique temporal structures for each face dimension with high test&ndash;retest reliability. Notably, expression and race exhibited a dominant and stably maintained temporal structure according to temporal generalization analysis. Further exploration into the mutual interactions among face dimensions uncovered age effects on gender and race, as well as expression effects on race, during the early stage (~200&ndash;300&nbsp;ms postface presentation). Additionally, we observed a relatively late effect of race on gender representation, peaking ~350&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the neural dynamics underlying the multidimensional aspects of face perception and illuminate the promising future of utilizing OPM-MEG for exploring higher-level human cognition.</p>

                Background Falls affect 40-70% within the first year and contributing to increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. Dual-task assessments, such as the Walking While Talking (WWT) and Stops Walking While Talking (SWWT) tests, are potential tools for predicting fall risk, but their comparative effectiveness remains underexplored. Methods This cross-sectional study included 68 stroke survivors who completed WWT-Simple (WWT-S), WWT-Complex (WWT-C), and SWWT assessments, as well as the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). Spearman correlations assessed relationships between balance, fear of falling, and dual-task performance. Logistic regression identified predictors of fall risk, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated predictive accuracy. The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results BBS scores were strongly negatively correlated with WWT-S (r = -0.734, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C (r = -0.737, p < 0.0001), indicating poorer balance with slower dual-task completion. Positive correlations were found between WWT-S and FES (r = 0.668, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C and FES (r = 0.610, p < 0.0001), linking slower completion times with higher fear of falling. SWWT was significantly negatively correlated with BBS (r = -0.625, p < 0.0001). WWT tests had higher sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (99%) than SWWT (sensitivity = 68.9%; specificity = 91.3%). Logistic regression identified SWWT (Positive) as a significant predictor of fall risk (p = 0.009), and ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.911, indicating excellent predictive power. Conclusions Findings highlight the superior predictive value of WWT tests over SWWT in assessing fall risk among stroke survivors. Incorporating dual-task measures into clinical practice may enhance fall risk evaluation, supporting targeted stroke rehabilitation.

                Introduction Transomental hernias are a rare type of internal hernia, accounting for less than 1% of all internal hernias. They occur when abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the omentum, leading to bowel obstruction and potential strangulation. We report the case of a young male admitted for the management of an acute bowel obstruction. Case report A 38-year-old male patient with no significant medical or surgical history presented with a proximal bowel obstruction syndrome. Upon physical examination, he exhibited mild abdominal distension, tenderness in the right iliac fossa, and tympanism. Laboratory tests indicated elevated inflammatory markers. An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan suggested the presence of a congenital band or an internal hernia. A laparoscopic procedure was performed, which identified a transomental hernia with a segment of the ileum protruding through an omental defect adjacent to the transverse colon. The herniated loop of small intestine was found to be compromised and gangrenous. Due to the severity of the condition, a midline incision was made to convert the procedure, allowing for resection of the affected segment of the small intestine while preserving 2.5 meters of viable bowel distal to the duodenojejunal junction. The remaining small intestine was exteriorized as a double-barrel ileostomy, and the transomental defect was subsequently repaired. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. Conclusion Although internal hernias account for a relatively small percentage of cases, they are frequently overlooked as a cause of bowel obstruction. Diagnosis this condition is challenging, both clinically and radiologically. Facilitating prompt surgical intervention to mitigate high mortality is essential.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate versus placebo in a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-period cross-over clinical trial in patients with isolated laryngeal dystonia (LD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2021, pausing during the COVID-19 pandemic, at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in 106 patients with alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) and alcohol-non-responsive (EtOH−) LD (53 to receive 1.5g of sodium oxybate first, 53 to receive matching placebo first). The primary outcome was a change from baseline in LD symptom severity 40 minutes after drug intake. Safety was based on vital signs, cognitive function, suicidality, daytime sleepiness, and adverse events. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to study procedures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>

The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits. Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction. One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented, which likely affects models’ generalizability across subtypes. A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb, and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem. Recently, machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, a strategy called multi-task learning (MTL), have been shown to improve predictions. We develop a new model and show that, beyond the boost in performance, MTL also helps address the previous two challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes, and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations. Our analyses, publicly available at https://github.com/iaime/LBUM, can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy.

                <p>by Bastien Berret, Dorian Verdel, Etienne Burdet, Frédéric Jean</p>

Despite our environment often being uncertain, we generally manage to generate stable motor behaviors. While reactive control plays a major role in this achievement, proactive control is critical to cope with the substantial noise and delays that affect neuromusculoskeletal systems. In particular, muscle co-contraction is exploited to robustify feedforward motor commands against internal sensorimotor noise as was revealed by stochastic optimal open-loop control modeling. Here, we extend this framework to neuromusculoskeletal systems subjected to random disturbances originating from the environment. The analytical derivation and numerical simulations predict a characteristic relationship between the degree of uncertainty in the task at hand and the optimal level of anticipatory co-contraction. This prediction is confirmed through a single-joint pointing task experiment where an external torque is applied to the wrist near the end of the reaching movement with varying probabilities across blocks of trials. We conclude that uncertainty calls for impedance control via proactive muscle co-contraction to stabilize behaviors when reactive control is insufficient for task success.

                <p>by Baike She, Rebecca Lee Smith, Ian Pytlarz, Shreyas Sundaram, Philip E. Paré</p>

During pandemics, countries, regions, and communities develop various epidemic models to evaluate spread and guide mitigation policies. However, model uncertainties caused by complex transmission behaviors, contact-tracing networks, time-varying parameters, human factors, and limited data present significant challenges to model-based approaches. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that centers around reproduction number estimates to perform counterfactual analysis, strategy evaluation, and feedback control of epidemics. The framework 1) introduces a mechanism to quantify the impact of the testing-for-isolation intervention strategy on the basic reproduction number. Building on this mechanism, the framework 2) proposes a method to reverse engineer the effective reproduction number under different strengths of the intervention strategy. In addition, based on the method that quantifies the impact of the testing-for-isolation strategy on the basic reproduction number, the framework 3) proposes a closed-loop control algorithm that uses the effective reproduction number both as feedback to indicate the severity of the spread and as the control goal to guide adjustments in the intensity of the intervention. We illustrate the framework, along with its three core methods, by addressing three key questions and validating its effectiveness using data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Purdue University: 1) How severe would an outbreak have been without the implemented intervention strategies? 2) What impact would varying the intervention strength have had on an outbreak? 3) How can we adjust the intervention intensity based on the current state of an outbreak?

                <p>by Hyun Joo Ji, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

Several recent studies have presented evidence that the human gene catalogue should be expanded to include thousands of short open reading frames (ORFs) appearing upstream or downstream of existing protein-coding genes, each of which might create an additional bicistronic transcript in humans. Here we explore an alternative hypothesis that would explain the translational and evolutionary evidence for these upstream ORFs without the need to create novel genes or bicistronic transcripts. We examined 2,199 upstream ORFs that have been proposed as high-quality candidates for novel genes, to determine if they could instead represent protein-coding exons that can be added to existing genes. We checked for the conservation of these ORFs in four recently sequenced, high-quality human genomes, and found a large majority (87.8%) to be conserved in all four as expected. We then looked for splicing evidence that would connect each upstream ORF to the downstream protein-coding gene at the same locus, thus creating a novel splicing variant using the upstream ORF as its first exon. These protein coding exon candidates were further evaluated using protein structure predictions of the protein sequences that included the proposed new exons. We determined that 541 out of 2,199 upstream ORFs have strong evidence that they can form protein coding exons that are part of an existing gene, and that the resulting protein is predicted to have similar or better structural quality than the currently annotated isoform.

                To behave adaptively, the brain must register temporal structure in the environment and use it to organize behavior at multiple timescales. The basal ganglia (BG) are thought to play a key role in such capabilities, learning behavioral programs or policies that associate states, actions, and rewards through time. In particular, the sensorimotor region of the main BG input structure—the dorsolateral striatum (DLS)—integrates somatosensory-, motor-, and reward-related inputs to influence motor outputs and has repeatedly been shown to be necessary for timing and structuring behavior in the seconds-to-minutes range.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94347">Zika virus remodels and hijacks IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex to promote viral replication organelle biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes significant human disease that, with no approved treatment or vaccine, constitutes a major public health concern. Its life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of the viral RNA genome (vRNA) through a fine-tuned equilibrium between vRNA translation, replication, and packaging into new virions, all within virus-induced replication organelles (vROs). In this study, with an RNA interference (RNAi) mini-screening and subsequent functional characterization, we have identified insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a new host dependency factor that regulates vRNA synthesis. In infected cells, IGF2BP2 associates with viral NS5 polymerase and redistributes to the perinuclear viral replication compartment. Combined fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization-based confocal imaging, <i>in vitro</i> binding assays, and immunoprecipitation coupled to RT-qPCR showed that IGF2BP2 directly interacts with ZIKV vRNA 3’ nontranslated region. Using ZIKV sub-genomic replicons and a replication-independent vRO induction system, we demonstrated that IGF2BP2 knockdown impairs <i>de novo</i> vRO biogenesis and, consistently, vRNA synthesis. Finally, the analysis of immunopurified IGF2BP2 complex using quantitative mass spectrometry and RT-qPCR revealed that ZIKV infection alters the protein and RNA interactomes of IGF2BP2. Altogether, our data support that ZIKV hijacks and remodels the IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex to regulate vRO biogenesis and vRNA neosynthesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98922">Muscarinic receptors mediate motivation via preparatory neural activity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Motivation depends on dopamine, but might be modulated by acetylcholine which influences dopamine release in the striatum, and amplifies motivation in animal studies. A corresponding effect in humans would be important clinically, since anticholinergic drugs are frequently used in Parkinson’s disease, a condition that can also disrupt motivation. Reward and dopamine make us more ready to respond, as indexed by reaction times (RT), and move faster, sometimes termed vigour. These effects may be controlled by preparatory processes that can be tracked using electroencephalography (EEG). We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivational effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation [CNV]) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade, although THP reduced the incentive effect. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions; frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. The incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug’s effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity. Taken together, these findings show that a muscarinic blocker impairs motivated action in healthy people, and that medial frontal preparatory neural activity mediates this for RT.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96812">Neurotrophic factor Neuritin modulates T cell electrical and metabolic state for the balance of tolerance and immunity</a></h4>

              
                The adaptive T cell response is accompanied by continuous rewiring of the T cell’s electric and metabolic state. Ion channels and nutrient transporters integrate bioelectric and biochemical signals from the environment, setting cellular electric and metabolic states. Divergent electric and metabolic states contribute to T cell immunity or tolerance. Here, we report in mice that neuritin (<i>Nrn1</i>) contributes to tolerance development by modulating regulatory and effector T cell function. <i>Nrn1</i> expression in regulatory T cells promotes its expansion and suppression function, while expression in the T effector cell dampens its inflammatory response. <i>Nrn1</i> deficiency in mice causes dysregulation of ion channel and nutrient transporter expression in Treg and effector T cells, resulting in divergent metabolic outcomes and impacting autoimmune disease progression and recovery. These findings identify a novel immune function of the neurotrophic factor <i>Nrn1</i> in regulating the T cell metabolic state in a cell context-dependent manner and modulating the outcome of an immune response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100238">The gamma rhythm as a guardian of brain health</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations in brain activity (30–150 Hz) have been studied for over 80 years. Although in the past three decades significant progress has been made to try to understand their functional role, a definitive answer regarding their causal implication in perception, cognition, and behavior still lies ahead of us. Here, we first review the basic neural mechanisms that give rise to gamma oscillations and then focus on two main pillars of exploration. The first pillar examines the major theories regarding their functional role in information processing in the brain, also highlighting critical viewpoints. The second pillar reviews a novel research direction that proposes a therapeutic role for gamma oscillations, namely the gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation (GENUS). We extensively discuss both the positive findings and the issues regarding reproducibility of GENUS. Going beyond the functional and therapeutic role of gamma, we propose a third pillar of exploration, where gamma, generated endogenously by cortical circuits, is essential for maintenance of healthy circuit function. We propose that four classes of interneurons, namely those expressing parvalbumin (PV), vasointestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) take advantage of endogenous gamma to perform active vasomotor control that maintains homeostasis in the neuronal tissue. According to this hypothesis, which we call GAMER (GAmma MEdiated ciRcuit maintenance), gamma oscillations act as a ‘servicing’ rhythm that enables efficient translation of neural activity into vascular responses that are essential for optimal neurometabolic processes. GAMER is an extension of GENUS, where endogenous rather than entrained gamma plays a fundamental role. Finally, we propose several critical experiments to test the GAMER hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93689">Macro-scale patterns in functional connectivity associated with ongoing thought patterns and dispositional traits</a></h4>

              
                Complex macro-scale patterns of brain activity that emerge during periods of wakeful rest provide insight into the organisation of neural function, how these differentiate individuals based on their traits, and the neural basis of different types of self-generated thoughts. Although brain activity during wakeful rest is valuable for understanding important features of human cognition, its unconstrained nature makes it difficult to disentangle neural features related to personality traits from those related to the thoughts occurring at rest. Our study builds on recent perspectives from work on ongoing conscious thought that highlight the interactions between three brain networks – ventral and dorsal attention networks, as well as the default mode network. We combined measures of personality with state-of-the-art indices of ongoing thoughts at rest and brain imaging analysis and explored whether this ‘tri-partite’ view can provide a framework within which to understand the contribution of states and traits to observed patterns of neural activity at rest. To capture macro-scale relationships between different brain systems, we calculated cortical gradients to describe brain organisation in a low-dimensional space. Our analysis established that for more introverted individuals, regions of the ventral attention network were functionally more aligned to regions of the somatomotor system and the default mode network. At the same time, a pattern of detailed self-generated thought was associated with a decoupling of regions of dorsal attention from regions in the default mode network. Our study, therefore, establishes that interactions between attention systems and the default mode network are important influences on ongoing thought at rest and highlights the value of integrating contemporary perspectives on conscious experience when understanding patterns of brain activity at rest.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96893">Motor neurons are dispensable for the assembly of a sensorimotor circuit for gaze stabilization</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor reflex circuits engage distinct neuronal subtypes, defined by precise connectivity, to transform sensation into compensatory behavior. Whether and how motor neuron populations specify the subtype fate and/or sensory connectivity of their pre-motor partners remains controversial. Here, we discovered that motor neurons are dispensable for proper connectivity in the vestibular reflex circuit that stabilizes gaze. We first measured activity following vestibular sensation in pre-motor projection neurons after constitutive loss of their extraocular motor neuron partners. We observed normal responses and topography indicative of unchanged functional connectivity between sensory neurons and projection neurons. Next, we show that projection neurons remain anatomically and molecularly poised to connect appropriately with their downstream partners. Lastly, we show that the transcriptional signatures that typify projection neurons develop independently of motor partners. Our findings comprehensively overturn a long-standing model: that connectivity in the circuit for gaze stabilization is retrogradely determined by motor partner-derived signals. By defining the contribution of motor neurons to specification of an archetypal sensorimotor circuit, our work speaks to comparable processes in the spinal cord and advances our understanding of principles of neural development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91988">Extramacrochaetae regulates Notch signaling in the Drosophila eye through non-apoptotic caspase activity</a></h4>

              
                Many cell fate decisions are determined transcriptionally. Accordingly, some fate specification is prevented by Inhibitor of DNA-binding (Id) proteins that interfere with DNA binding by master regulatory transcription factors. We show that the <i>Drosophila</i> Id protein Extra macrochaetae (Emc) also affects developmental decisions by regulating caspase activity. Emc, which prevents proneural bHLH transcription factors from specifying neural cell fate, also prevents homodimerization of another bHLH protein, Daughterless (Da), and thereby maintains expression of the <i>Death-Associated Inhibitor of Apoptosis</i> (<i>diap1</i>) gene. Accordingly, we found that multiple effects of <i>emc</i> mutations on cell growth and on eye development were all caused by activation of caspases. These effects included acceleration of the morphogenetic furrow, failure of R7 photoreceptor cell specification, and delayed differentiation of non-neuronal cone cells. Within <i>emc</i> mutant clones, Notch signaling was elevated in the morphogenetic furrow, increasing morphogenetic furrow speed. This was associated with caspase-dependent increase in levels of Delta protein, the transmembrane ligand for Notch. Posterior to the morphogenetic furrow, elevated Delta cis-inhibited Notch signaling that was required for R7 specification and cone cell differentiation. Growth inhibition of <i>emc</i> mutant clones in wing imaginal discs also depended on caspases. Thus, <i>emc</i> mutations reveal the importance of restraining caspase activity even in non-apoptotic cells to prevent abnormal development, in the <i>Drosophila</i> eye through effects on Notch signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89543">Spatial and temporal distribution of ribosomes in single cells reveals aging differences between old and new daughters of Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Lineages of rod-shaped bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> exhibit a temporal decline in elongation rate in a manner comparable to cellular or biological aging. The effect results from the production of asymmetrical daughters, one with a lower elongation rate, by the division of a mother cell. The slower daughter compared to the faster daughter, denoted respectively as the old and new daughters, has more aggregates of damaged proteins and fewer expressed gene products. We have examined further the degree of asymmetry by measuring the density of ribosomes between old and new daughters and between their poles. We found that ribosomes were denser in the new daughter and also in the new pole of the daughters. These ribosome patterns match the ones we previously found for expressed gene products. This outcome suggests that the asymmetry is not likely to result from properties unique to the gene expressed in our previous study, but rather from a more fundamental upstream process affecting the distribution of ribosomal abundance. Because damage aggregates and ribosomes are both more abundant at the poles of <i>E. coli</i> cells, we suggest that competition for space between the two could explain the reduced ribosomal density in old daughters. Using published values for aggregate sizes and the relationship between ribosomal number and elongation rates, we show that the aggregate volumes could in principle displace quantitatively the amount of ribosomes needed to reduce the elongation rate of the old daughters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97954">NE contribution to rebooting unconsciousness caused by midazolam</a></h4>

              
                The advent of midazolam holds profound implications for modern clinical practice. The hypnotic and sedative effects of midazolam afford it broad clinical applicability. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the modulation of altered consciousness by midazolam remain elusive. Herein, using pharmacology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, fiber photometry, and gene knockdown, this in vivo research revealed the role of locus coeruleus (LC)-ventrolateral preoptic nucleus noradrenergic neural circuit in regulating midazolam-induced altered consciousness. This effect was mediated by α1 adrenergic receptors. Moreover, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA-R) represents a mechanistically crucial binding site in the LC for midazolam. These findings will provide novel insights into the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the recovery of consciousness after midazolam administration and will help guide the timing of clinical dosing and propose effective intervention targets for timely recovery from midazolam-induced loss of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96695">Genetic stability of Mycobacterium smegmatis under the stress of first-line antitubercular agents</a></h4>

              
                The sustained success of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> as a pathogen arises from its ability to persist within macrophages for extended periods and its limited responsiveness to antibiotics. Furthermore, the high incidence of resistance to the few available antituberculosis drugs is a significant concern, especially since the driving forces of the emergence of drug resistance are not clear. Drug-resistant strains of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> can emerge through de novo mutations, however, mycobacterial mutation rates are low. To unravel the effects of antibiotic pressure on genome stability, we determined the genetic variability, phenotypic tolerance, DNA repair system activation, and dNTP pool upon treatment with current antibiotics using <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. Whole-genome sequencing revealed no significant increase in mutation rates after prolonged exposure to first-line antibiotics. However, the phenotypic fluctuation assay indicated rapid adaptation to antibiotics mediated by non-genetic factors. The upregulation of DNA repair genes, measured using qPCR, suggests that genomic integrity may be maintained through the activation of specific DNA repair pathways. Our results, indicating that antibiotic exposure does not result in de novo adaptive mutagenesis under laboratory conditions, do not lend support to the model suggesting antibiotic resistance development through drug pressure-induced microevolution.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing constant mutation. New strains vary in neuropathogenicity and the neurological spectrum of disease. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and clinical characteristics of neurological manifestations during the Omicron dominance among hospitalized patients, including the differences between three subsequent periods. Methods: This retrospective single-center study included 426 hospitalized adults with confirmed COVID-19 divided into three periods (O1, O2, and O3) dependent on the dominance of Omicron subvariants in Poland. Demographic and clinical data, in particular neurological manifestations, were collected and compared. Results: The median age of the group was 74, older in subsequent (later) periods. The number of patients with a history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination increased with the duration of the pandemic. The severity of COVID-19 became lower in successive periods. Neurological manifestations were observed in 55.4% of patients, and the most frequent were delirium, headache, myalgia, dizziness, cerebrovascular diseases, and encephalopathy. In subsequent periods of Omicron dominance, a higher frequency of neurological manifestations such as delirium, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and encephalopathy was observed. Headache or myalgia was related to a shorter hospitalization while delirium, cerebrovascular diseases, and ischemic stroke were linked with an increased risk of death. Conclusions: The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 presents a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations. Although there is an improvement in the survival rate of patients with COVID-19, the frequency of neurological manifestations increases. The occurrence of delirium, cerebrovascular diseases, and ischemic stroke results in higher mortality.</p>

	<p>Background: Alcohol dependence is associated with several neuropsychological abnormalities, such as increased impulsivity or attentional bias towards drug-related stimuli. However, it is debated whether these abnormalities are on the decline after long-term abstinence from alcohol. Inpatient rehabilitation treatment enables the longitudinal investigation of such variables during a long, largely secured, period of abstinence. Methods: This study involved alcohol-dependent patients consecutively admitted for a duration of 14&amp;amp;ndash;26 weeks to an inpatient rehabilitation treatment center located in a hospital specializing in substance use disorders. Craving and impulsivity were assessed with the means of two questionnaires (e.g., OCDS-G and BIS-11); conversely, attentional bias and problems with inhibition were measured with the help of two computer-based experiments (e.g., dot&amp;amp;ndash;probe task and stop&amp;amp;ndash;signal&amp;amp;ndash;reaction task). Investigations were conducted at entry, after 6 weeks, and during the last two weeks of the inpatient treatment. Results: A total of 130 patients with alcohol dependence (mean age 43.3 years; 78.5% male) completed the first, N = 102 the second, and N = 83 the final assessment. Over the whole period of inpatient treatment, there was a significant decrease in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; scores for both craving (t(83) = 7.8, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and impulsivity (t(82) = &amp;amp;minus;3.75, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, t(82) = 4.4, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, there were no significant changes regarding attentional bias (t(82) = 0.16, p = 0.494) and inhibitory control (t(76) = 0.04, p = 0.482) scores. Conclusions: Neuropsychological abnormalities associated with alcohol dependence might persist even after a long abstinence period. The decrease in both craving and impulsivity levels may be explained by the protected, alcohol-free, hospital environment; however, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; risk of post-discharge relapse may remain high, as the basic neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol dependence may persist for long periods, and possibly for more than 3&amp;amp;ndash;6 months.</p>

	<p>Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene, leading to cholestanol accumulation in various tissues, including peripheral nerves. Polyneuropathy is an underrecognized feature with considerable variability in clinical presentation and neurophysiological findings in CTX. This review assesses the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic methodologies of polyneuropathy in CTX, exploring its underlying mechanisms and potential treatment outcomes. A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Virtual Health Library databases with search terms related to CTX and polyneuropathy. A total of 892 articles were initially identified, with 59 selected for in-depth analysis. The review focused on studies examining peripheral nerve involvement in CTX, including nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and nerve ultrasound. Polyneuropathy in CTX was observed in 50% to 77.7% of patients across multiple case series. Neurophysiological findings varied, with reports of axonal, demyelinating, and mixed polyneuropathies. Clinical presentation included lower limb atrophy, pes cavus, and distal weakness, with sensory symptoms less frequently reported. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) showed potential in improving nerve conduction parameters, although the response was variable and dependent on the timing of intervention. Polyneuropathy in CTX presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its heterogeneous presentation and varying neurophysiological findings. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Peripheral nerve ultrasound is a promising diagnostic tool, complementing traditional neurophysiological assessments. Further research is needed to standardize protocols and explore the full therapeutic potential of CDCA in managing CTX-related polyneuropathy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The cyberball paradigm has been used in numerous neuroimaging studies to elicit activation in neural substrates of social exclusion, which have been interpreted in terms of activity associated with &amp;amp;ldquo;social pain&amp;amp;rdquo;. The objectives of the study were to assess not only the replicability but also the specificity of the areas activated by this paradigm. Methods: Functional imaging with arterial spin labeling, an approach to image longer mental states. Results: We replicated findings of previous meta-analyses of this paradigm in the inferior frontal gyrus and ventral cingular cortex. However, these areas were also active in a watch condition (in which participants were not excluded), although less so. Conclusions: These findings relativize a simple and specific interpretation of these areas as the neural substrates of social exclusion and social pain, as in previous studies. In a broader experimental context, similar activations have been reported by neuroimaging studies when semantic disambiguation and evaluation of action goals are required, an interpretation that may also apply to the effects elicited by this paradigm.</p>

	<p>Background: Astrocytoma, an IDH-mutant is a common primary brain tumor. Total surgical resection is not feasible due to peritumoral infiltration mediated by extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Methods: This study aimed at determining the expression pattern of ECM molecules in different prognostic groups of WHO grade 2 and grade 3 patients and identifying the effect of onco-radiotherapy on tumor cell invasion of grade 3 patients. Gene and protein expression of ECM molecules was determined by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: In the different prognostic groups of grade 2 tumors HMMR, IDH-1, MKI-67, PDGF-A and versican, in grade 3 tumors integrin &amp;amp;alpha;-3, and in both groups integrin &amp;amp;alpha;-3 and IDH-1 mRNA expression was significantly different. Regarding protein expression, only integrin &amp;amp;alpha;V expression changed significantly in the prognostic groups of grade 2 tumors. Conclusions: Based on the invasion spectrum determined by this joint gene and protein expression analysis, there was a sensitivity of 87.5% and a negative predictive value of 88.9% regarding the different prognostic groups of grade 2 astrocytoma. For grade 3 tumors, the applied standard oncotherapeutic modalities apparently lacked significant anti-invasive effects.</p>

	<p>Background: In safety-critical environments, human error is a leading cause of accidents, with the loss of situation awareness (SA) being a key contributing factor. Accurate SA assessment is essential for minimizing such risks and ensuring operational safety. Traditional SA measurement methods have limitations in dynamic real-world settings, while physiological signals, particularly EEG, offer a non-invasive, real-time alternative for continuous SA monitoring. However, the reliability of SA measurement based on physiological signals depends on the accuracy of SA labeling. Objective: This study aims to design an effective SA measurement paradigm specific to high-speed train driving, investigate more accurate physiological signal-based SA labeling methods, and explore the relationships between SA levels and key physiological metrics based on the developed framework. Methods: This study recruited 19 male high-speed train driver trainees and developed an SA measurement paradigm specific to high-speed train driving. A method combining subjective SA ratings and task performance was introduced to generate accurate SA labels. Results: The results of statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of this paradigm in inducing SA level changes, revealing significant relationships between SA levels and key physiological metrics, including eye movement patterns, ECG features (e.g., heart rate variability), and EEG power spectral density across theta, alpha, and beta bands. Conclusions: This study supports the use of multimodal physiological signals for SA assessment and provides a theoretical foundation for future applications of SA monitoring in railway operations, contributing to enhanced operational safety.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-415/v3?src=rss">Knowledge of misconduct amid North-African post-graduate dental students: A cross sectional study [version 3; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of misconduct (KoM) level in this population is lacking. This brief report assessed KoM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey with 11 questions on KoM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoM. Results The mean±SD KoM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). Conclusion This study identified a low-level of KoM among North-African PGDSs. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoM in this population.

[version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Interest in alternative sources of tubers and legumes has increased in recent years because of the constant search for raw materials that provide bioactive compounds with antioxidant potential benefits for consumers. The functionality of new raw materials is sought through physical and/or chemical modifications to develop and innovate new foods. The objective of this study was to characterize taro (TF) (Colocasia esculenta) and sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) flours, obtained by the wet (SIF-WM) and defatted method (SIF-DM), as an alternative for the formulation of new functional foods. Methods The free polyphenols of the different mixtures were analyzed, and the antioxidant properties of the extracts obtained were measured using ABTS.* (2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). The ABTS radical method, which reacts with the phenolic compounds of the food matrix, using Trolox as a standard. The blends were subjected to pasting analysis, flow profile tests, determination of viscoelastic properties (temperature sweep). Characterization of common microorganisms in these foods was performed. Results The highest protein value was obtained in the sacha inchi flour obtained by the defatted method (72.62%). The majority of components in taro were carbohydrates (85.4%). About antioxidant and determination of free polyphenols, taro flour obtained values of 2.71 μmol ET/g and 7.47 mg EAG/g, higher than sacha inchi flours. In the rheological analysis (pasting properties, flow profile, and viscoelasticity), we observed that adding taro flour in different mixtures increases the viscosity peak and a lower breakdown, while there was an increase in setback. Except for defatted sacha flour, the others presented a flow index >1 before heating, showing a dilatant fluid behavior. The presence of taro flour improves gel formation and stability. Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella were present in the taro flour. Conclusions The flours analyzed represent a raw material with great potential for the development of products such as protein snacks due to the contribution of sacha inchi, with good expansion due to taro starch, and naturally gluten-free for people with celiac disease.

                Background One of the main goals of the government is to ensure a development that would enhance the living standard of the people in the society. In this regard, capital expenditure that would promote infrastructure is most desired. However, in Nigeria, the government spends more on administrative cost (recurrent expenditure) than capital expenditure. Under such condition, contributions to economic growth and national development become an illusion. Methods This study employed Augmented Dickey Fuller Test (ADF) with Bound testing procedure, time series data that covers the period from 1990 to 2020 in Nigeria were used. Results The result from the analysis showed that governmental expenditure has a significant effect on the national development of Nigeria. All the variables have a long-run relationship with economic growth (RGDP), according to the ARDL model’s results. If the government poor policies on education, health services, and infrastructure etc. are addressed, in the long-run, Nigeria will achieve monumental development. Conclusion The study adopted indices such as expenditure on Social and Community Services, Economic Services and Administrative Services to reflect the dynamics of government expenditure coupled with the yearly data garnered from the Central Bank of Nigeria spanning from 1990 to 2020.

                Rationale The efficacy of vaccination programs, particularly for diseases like HPV, hinges on widespread acceptance and uptake within communities. However, vaccine hesitancy and inadequate healthcare infrastructure pose significant barriers to achieving optimal vaccination coverage in Nigeria. Recognizing the pivotal role of community engagement in overcoming these challenges, this study aims to explore the potential of leveraging the ward health system (WHS) to enhance HPV vaccination acceptance in Nigeria. Objective The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of community-based approaches facilitated by the WHS on HPV vaccination demand and acceptance in Nigeria. Specifically, the study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of ward development committees (WDCs) in mobilizing communities, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and fostering positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination. Method A comprehensive search strategy using various scholarly search engines and sources was employed to gather relevant material. Keywords such as “Boosting Community Engagement” and “Leveraging Ward Health System Approach” guided the search process. Methodical content analysis was used to examine the texts, focusing on identifying emerging trends in community engagement related to HPV vaccination. Discourse analysis further explored the linguistic features of scholarly publications to reveal implicit content through critical thinking. This rigorous approach aimed to extract trustworthy data aligning with the study’s goals, providing a robust foundation for enhancing HPV vaccination strategies in Nigeria. Results The results of the study provide comprehensive insights into the effectiveness of community-based interventions facilitated by the WHS in driving HPV vaccination demand and acceptance. Quantitative data offer valuable information on vaccination coverage rates and factors influencing vaccine acceptance, while qualitative findings provide deeper insights into community perceptions and the role of the WHS in addressing vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions Based on the findings, conclusions drawn regarding the effectiveness of leveraging the WHS to enhance HPV vaccination acceptance in Nigeria. The study highlights the importance of community engagement and the potential of the WHS in overcoming barriers to vaccination uptake. Recommendations The study conclude with recommendations for policymakers, healthcare providers, and community leaders on strategies to optimize the role of the WHS in promoting HPV vaccination acceptance. Recommendations include strengthening WDC functionality, enhancing community outreach efforts, and fostering partnerships to support vaccination programs. Significance Statement This study holds significance as it addresses a critical gap in understanding the role of community-based approaches, particularly through the WHS, in promoting HPV vaccination acceptance in Nigeria. By providing evidence-based insights and recommendations, the study aims to inform policy and practice, ultimately assisting Nigeria in achieving universal health coverage and better health outcomes.

                Background The growing incidence of chronic diseases such as cancer and the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms constitute one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, it is critical to search for new therapeutic alternatives. Moringa oleifera is a plant well known for the properties of its phytocomponents and its role has been analyzed in a variety of fields, from medicine to biotechnology. Methods In this work, the biological activity of Moringa oleifera in human health was explored through a review of 129 original articles published between 2010 and 2021 related to antitumor activity and its potential uses against chronic and infectious diseases. Results Moringa oleifera extracts showed antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antihypertensive and cytoprotective properties at neuronal, hepatic, renal and cardiac levels. Besides, cytotoxic effects, apoptotic and antiploriferative activity against several cancer cell lines has been demonstrated. On the other hand, the antimicrobial potential of M. oleifera was also evidenced, especially against multidrug-resistant strains. Conclusions Hence, it is supported that there is a wide range of clinical entities in which Moringa oleifera exhibits significant biological activity that could contribute to counteracting metabolic, infectious and chronic diseases in a similar or improved way to the drugs traditionally used.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1388/v1?src=rss">Traditional opal mining practice in Ethiopia, challenges and its economic impact on rural households: the case of wollo opal mining [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The discovery spurred further exploration, leading to the expansion of opal mining into neighboring districts. Numerous cooperative groups, composed of small-scale miners, traditionally explore, develop, and extract significant amounts of rough opal gemstones. This study tries to investigate the challenges and economic impacts of traditional opal mining practice in wollo province of Ethiopia. Methods The study used in this study is primary data collected from rural households, which are living in five districts of north wollo zone, in Amhara regional state. The data was collected using field observation, focus grouped discussion, interview, and questionnaire from sampled households. The study uses both descriptive and econometric methods of data analysis to achieve its objective. Results Among the challenges of traditional opal mining, primitive way of exploring and extraction, limited access to market and low institutional support in terms of training and finance are identified. The probit model reveals that, increased education, access to training, and access to credit positively influence the likelihood of engaging in opal mining. The ESR model shows that, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) indicates that participating in opal mining increases monthly income by 31,380 ETB, while the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU) shows a potential income increase of 31,625 ETB for non-miners if they engaged in mining. Conclusion The study identifies three main categories of challenges faced by traditional opal miners: exploration and extraction issues, market limitations, and regulatory and institutional shortcomings. Exploration and extraction challenges include the lack of modern mining tools and knowledge, as well as difficult terrain, leading to inefficient and hazardous mining practices. Market-related challenges involve limited access to broader markets and lack of value addition, resulting in miners selling raw opals at significantly lower prices compared to polished ones.

                <p>by Dan Liu, Francesca Young, Kieran D. Lamb, David L. Robertson, Ke Yuan</p>

Predicting virus-host associations is essential to determine the specific host species that viruses interact with, and discover if new viruses infect humans and animals. Currently, the host of the majority of viruses is unknown, particularly in microbiomes. To address this challenge, we introduce EvoMIL, a deep learning method that predicts the host species for viruses from viral sequences only. It also identifies important viral proteins that significantly contribute to host prediction. The method combines a pre-trained large protein language model (ESM) and attention-based multiple instance learning to allow protein-orientated predictions. Our results show that protein embeddings capture stronger predictive signals than sequence composition features, including amino acids, physiochemical properties, and DNA k-mers. In multi-host prediction tasks, EvoMIL achieves median F1 score improvements of 10.8%, 16.2%, and 4.9% in prokaryotic hosts, and 1.7%, 6.6% and 11.5% in eukaryotic hosts. EvoMIL binary classifiers achieve impressive AUC over 0.95 for all prokaryotic hosts and range from roughly 0.8 to 0.9 for eukaryotic hosts. Furthermore, EvoMIL identifies important proteins in the prediction task. We found them capturing key functions in virus-host specificity.

                <p>by Evandro Konzen, Richard J. Delahay, Dave J. Hodgson, Robbie A. McDonald, Ellen Brooks Pollock, Simon E. F. Spencer, Trevelyan J. McKinley</p>

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has significant socio-economic and welfare impacts on the cattle industry in parts of the world. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, disease control is complicated by the presence of infection in wildlife, principally the European badger. Control strategies tend to be applied to whole populations, but better identification of key sources of transmission, whether individuals or groups, could help inform more efficient approaches. Mechanistic transmission models can be used to better understand key epidemiological drivers of disease spread and identify high-risk individuals and groups if they can be adequately fitted to observed data. However, this is a significant challenge, especially within wildlife populations, because monitoring relies on imperfect diagnostic test information, and even under systematic surveillance efforts (such as capture-mark-recapture sampling) epidemiological events are only partially observed.
To this end we develop a stochastic compartmental model of bTB transmission, and fit this to individual-level data from a unique > 40-year longitudinal study of 2,391 badgers using a recently developed individual forward filtering backward sampling algorithm. Modelling challenges are further compounded by spatio-temporal meta-population structures and age-dependent mortality. We develop a novel estimator for the individual effective reproduction number that provides quantitative evidence for the presence of superspreader badgers, despite the population-level effective reproduction number being less than one. We also infer measures of the hidden burden of infection in the host population through time; the relative likelihoods of competing routes of transmission; effective and realised infectious periods; and longitudinal measures of diagnostic test performance. This modelling framework provides an efficient and generalisable way to fit state-space models to individual-level data in wildlife populations, which allows identification of high-risk individuals and exploration of important epidemiological questions about bTB and other wildlife diseases.

Animals can adapt their preferences for different types of reward according to physiological state, such as hunger or thirst. To explain this ability, we employ a simple multi-objective reinforcement learning model that learns multiple values according to different reward dimensions such as food or water. We show that by weighting these learned values according to the current needs, behaviour may be flexibly adapted to present preferences. This model predicts that individual dopamine neurons should encode the errors associated with some reward dimensions more than with others. To provide a preliminary test of this prediction, we reanalysed a small dataset obtained from a single primate in an experiment which to our knowledge is the only published study where the responses of dopamine neurons to stimuli predicting distinct types of rewards were recorded. We observed that in addition to subjective economic value, dopamine neurons encode a gradient of reward dimensions; some neurons respond most to stimuli predicting food rewards while the others respond more to stimuli predicting fluids. We also proposed a possible implementation of the model in the basal ganglia network, and demonstrated how the striatal system can learn values in multiple dimensions, even when dopamine neurons encode mixtures of prediction error from different dimensions. Additionally, the model reproduces the instant generalisation to new physiological states seen in dopamine responses and in behaviour. Our results demonstrate how a simple neural circuit can flexibly guide behaviour according to animals’ needs.

Understanding the sequence and timing of brain functional network development at the beginning of human life is critically important from both normative and clinical perspectives. Yet, we presently lack rigorous examination of the longitudinal emergence of human brain functional networks over the birth transition. Leveraging a large, longitudinal perinatal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set, this study models developmental trajectories of brain functional networks spanning 25 to 55 weeks of post-conceptual gestational age (GA). The final sample includes 126 fetal scans (GA = 31.36 ± 3.83 weeks) and 58 infant scans (GA = 48.17 ± 3.73 weeks) from 140 unique subjects. In this study, we document the developmental changes of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) over the birth transition, evident at both network and graph levels. We observe that growth patterns are regionally specific, with some areas showing minimal RSFC changes, while others exhibit a dramatic increase at birth. Examples with birth-triggered dramatic change include RSFC within the subcortical network, within the superior frontal network, within the occipital-cerebellum joint network, as well as the cross-hemisphere RSFC between the bilateral sensorimotor networks and between the bilateral temporal network. Our graph analysis further emphasized the subcortical network as the only region of the brain exhibiting a significant increase in local efficiency around birth, while a concomitant gradual increase was found in global efficiency in sensorimotor and parietal-frontal regions throughout the fetal to neonatal period. This work unveils fundamental aspects of early brain development and lays the foundation for future work on the influence of environmental factors on this process.

                <p>by Charles W. Dickey, Ilya A. Verzhbinsky, Sophie Kajfez, Burke Q. Rosen, Christopher E. Gonzalez, Patrick Y. Chauvel, Sydney S. Cash, Sandipan Pati, Eric Halgren</p>

In the neocortex, ~90 Hz ripples couple to ~12 Hz sleep spindles on the ~1 Hz Down-to-Up state transition during non-rapid eye movement sleep. This conjunction of sleep waves is critical for the consolidation of memories into long-term storage. The widespread co-occurrences of ripples (“co-ripples”) may integrate information across the neocortex and hippocampus to facilitate consolidation. While the thalamus synchronizes spindles and Up states in the cortex for memory, it is not known whether it may also organize co-ripples. Using human intracranial recordings during NREM sleep, we investigated whether cortico-cortical co-ripples and hippocampo-cortical co-ripples are either: (1) driven by directly projected thalamic ripples; or (2) coordinated by propagating thalamic spindles or Up states. We found ripples in the anterior and posterior thalamus, with similar characteristics as hippocampal and cortical ripples, including having a center frequency of ~90 Hz and coupling to local spindles on the Down-to-Up state transition. However, thalamic ripples rarely co-occur or phase-lock with cortical or hippocampal ripples. By contrast, spindles and Up states that propagate from the thalamus strongly coordinate co-ripples in the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, thalamo-cortical spindles and Up states, rather than thalamic ripples, may provide input facilitating spatially distributed co-rippling that integrates information for memory consolidation during sleep in humans.

                <p>Oropouche virus (OROV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) in the <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> genus and <i>Peribunyaviridae</i> viral family that is endemic to parts of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It has recently emerged in Cuba, and travel-imported cases are recently being reported in the United States and Europe. Typically maintained in a sylvatic cycle between certain forest sloths, non-human primates, birds, and mosquitoes, OROV disease outbreaks can occur in an urban cycle between certain biting midges and/or mosquitoes and humans. Clinically, approximately 60% of infections are symptomatic with an abrupt fever and non-specific influenza-like illness within 3 to 10 days. Many initial OROV infections can present similarly to chikungunya, dengue, and Zika virus infections. Interestingly, OROV infections can follow a biphasic course with recurrence of symptoms approximately 1 week after initial symptom onset. Concerningly, similar to Zika virus, it appears that vertical transmission of OROV may occur with potentially adverse effects on fetal development including miscarriages. Neuroinvasion of OROV occurs in animal models, and human cases of meningitis, encephalitis, and peri-infectious Guillain-Barré syndrome have all been reported. Diagnosis is either through detection of OROV nucleic acid, OROV immunoglobulin M, or OROV neutralizing antibodies in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. No antiviral treatments are available, and there are no current vaccines. Preventing mosquito and biting midge bites is key. Neurologists should be aware of and report any potential neuroinvasive OROV disease cases to local/state/territorial health departments. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                The success of our actions often depends on what others are doing. How does the brain discern predictions of others’ actions when situations are ambiguous? Recent work by Ma and colleagues suggests that the brain solves this problem by entertaining multiple predictions of others’ actions, ranked by their likelihood.

                When mice run, activity in their primary visual cortex (V1) is strongly modulated. This observation has altered conceptions of a brain region assumed to be a passive image processor. Extensive work has followed to dissect the circuits and functions of running-correlated modulation. However, it remains unclear whether visual processing in primates might similarly change during locomotion. We therefore measured V1 activity in marmosets while they viewed stimuli on a treadmill. In contrast to mouse, running-correlated modulations of marmoset V1 were small and tended to be slightly suppressive. Population-level analyses revealed trial-to-trial fluctuations of shared gain across V1 in both species, but while strongly correlated with running in mice, gain modulations were smaller and more often negatively correlated with running in marmosets. Thus, population-wide fluctuations of V1 may reflect a common feature of mammalian visual cortical function, but important quantitative differences point to distinct consequences for the relation between vision and action in primates versus rodents.

                Antibodies are powerful tools for the therapy and diagnosis of various diseases. In addition to conventional hybridoma-based screening, recombinant antibody-based screening has become a common choice; however, its application is hampered by two factors: (1) screening starts after Ig gene cloning and recombinant antibody production only, and (2) the antibody is composed of paired chains, heavy and light, commonly expressed by two independent expression vectors. Here, we introduce a method for the rapid screening of recombinant monoclonal antibodies by establishing a Golden Gate-based dual-expression vector and in-vivo expression of membrane-bound antibodies. Using this system, we demonstrate the rapid isolation of influenza cross-reactive antibodies with high affinity from immunized mice within 7 days. This system is particularly useful for isolating therapeutic or diagnostic antibodies, for example during foreseen pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97231">Disordered proteins interact with the chemical environment to tune their protective function during drying</a></h4>

              
                The conformational ensemble and function of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are sensitive to their solution environment. The inherent malleability of disordered proteins, combined with the exposure of their residues, accounts for this sensitivity. One context in which IDPs play important roles that are concomitant with massive changes to the intracellular environment is during desiccation (extreme drying). The ability of organisms to survive desiccation has long been linked to the accumulation of high levels of cosolutes such as trehalose or sucrose as well as the enrichment of IDPs, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins or cytoplasmic abundant heat-soluble (CAHS) proteins. Despite knowing that IDPs play important roles and are co-enriched alongside endogenous, species-specific cosolutes during desiccation, little is known mechanistically about how IDP-cosolute interactions influence desiccation tolerance. Here, we test the notion that the protective function of desiccation-related IDPs is enhanced through conformational changes induced by endogenous cosolutes. We find that desiccation-related IDPs derived from four different organisms spanning two LEA protein families and the CAHS protein family synergize best with endogenous cosolutes during drying to promote desiccation protection. Yet the structural parameters of protective IDPs do not correlate with synergy for either CAHS or LEA proteins. We further demonstrate that for CAHS, but not LEA proteins, synergy is related to self-assembly and the formation of a gel. Our results suggest that functional synergy between IDPs and endogenous cosolutes is a convergent desiccation protection strategy seen among different IDP families and organisms, yet the mechanisms underlying this synergy differ between IDP families.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93423">Bacillus velezensis HBXN2020 alleviates Salmonella Typhimurium infection in mice by improving intestinal barrier integrity and reducing inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> is a species of <i>Bacillus</i> that has been widely investigated because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. However, most studies on <i>B. velezensis</i> have focused on the biocontrol of plant diseases, with few reports on antagonizing <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium infections. In this investigation, it was discovered that <i>B. velezensis</i> HBXN2020, which was isolated from healthy black pigs, possessed strong anti-stress and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Importantly, <i>B. velezensis</i> HBXN2020 did not cause any adverse side effects in mice when administered at various doses (1×10<sup>7</sup>, 1×10<sup>8</sup>, and 1×10<sup>9</sup> CFU) for 14 days. Supplementing <i>B. velezensis</i> HBXN2020 spores, either as a curative or preventive measure, dramatically reduced the levels of <i>S.</i> Typhimurium ATCC14028 in the mice’s feces, ileum, cecum, and colon, as well as the disease activity index (DAI), in a model of infection caused by this pathogen in mice. Additionally, supplementing <i>B. velezensis</i> HBXN2020 spores significantly regulated cytokine levels (<i>Tnfa</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il6</i>, and <i>Il10</i>) and maintained the expression of tight junction proteins and mucin protein. Most importantly, adding <i>B. velezensis</i> HBXN2020 spores to the colonic microbiota improved its stability and increased the amount of beneficial bacteria (<i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>). All together, <i>B. velezensis</i> HBXN2020 can improve intestinal microbiota stability and barrier integrity and reduce inflammation to help treat infection by <i>S.</i> Typhimurium.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The current reinforcement learning framework focuses exclusively on performance, often at the expense of efficiency. In contrast, biological control achieves remarkable performance while also optimizing computational energy expenditure and decision frequency. We propose a decision-bounded Markov decision process (DB-MDP) that constrains the number of decisions and computational energy available to agents in reinforcement learning environments. Our experiments demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms struggle within this framework, leading to either failure or suboptimal performance. To address this, we introduce a biologically inspired, temporally layered architecture (TLA), enabling agents to manage computational costs through two layers with distinct timescales and energy requirements. TLA achieves optimal performance in decision-bounded environments and in continuous control environments, matching state-of-the-art performance while using a fraction of the computing cost. Compared to current reinforcement learning algorithms that solely prioritize performance, our approach significantly lowers computational energy expenditure while maintaining performance. These findings establish a benchmark and pave the way for future research on energy and time-aware control.</span>
