<p>Third harmonic generation microscopy, a multiphoton imaging modality, reveals the relative volume or investment (RI) in sensory-related brain regions across development in <i>Danionella dracula</i>, a miniature teleost fish with a body and brain that remains transparent throughout life. RI in higher-order, multimodal integration centers such as the telencephalon increases as juveniles transition to adulthood. By contrast, RI in modality-dominant regions is essentially stable over development, as in the olfactory bulb, or is greatest prior to the juvenile–adult transition, as in the optic tectum.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals integrate information from different sensory modalities as they mature and perform increasingly complex behaviors. This may parallel differential investment in specific brain regions depending on the changing demands of sensory inputs. To investigate developmental changes in the volume of canonical sensory regions, we used third harmonic generation imaging for morphometric analysis of forebrain and midbrain regions from larval through juvenile and adult stages in <i>Danionella dracula</i>, a transparent, miniature teleost fish whose brain is optically accessible throughout its lifespan. Relative to whole-brain volume, increased volume or investment in the telencephalon, a higher order sensory integration center, shows the most dramatic increases between 30–60 days postfertilization (dpf) and again at 90 dpf as animals reach adulthood. The torus longitudinalis (TL), a midbrain visuomotor integration center, also significantly increases between 60 and 90 dpf. In contrast, investment in the midbrain optic tectum (TeO), a retinal-recipient target, progressively decreases from 30 to 90 dpf, whereas investment is relatively consistent across all stages for the midbrain torus semicircularis (TS), a secondary auditory and mechanosensory lateral line center, and the olfactory bulb (OB), a direct target of the olfactory epithelium. In sum, increased investment in higher-order integration centers (telencephalon, TL) occurs as juveniles reach adulthood (60–90 dpf) and exhibit more complex cognitive tasks, whereas investment in modality-dominant regions occurs earlier (TeO) or is relatively consistent across development (TS, OB). Complete optical access throughout <i>Danionella</i>’s lifespan provides a unique opportunity to investigate how changing brain structure over development correlates with changes in connectivity, microcircuitry, or behavior.</p>

Abstract: This article provides an overview of memory competitions, analyzes differences between disciplines and explains current state-of-the-art techniques. Performances have increased dramatically over the past three decades. Nowadays, information processing reaches up to 42 bit/s in short disciplines with most of the time spent on reading, suggesting that mental associations are formed even faster. Records show a remarkable concordance across all time scales: the processing speed depends on memorization time as a power law.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11632">Retinotopic Mechanics derived using classical physics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2109.11632v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a cell$'$s receptive field is a bedrock in systems neuroscience, and the classical static description of the receptive field has had enormous success in explaining the fundamental mechanisms underlying visual processing. Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to probe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the introduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics. At its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive fields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent. Specifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that supports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically inspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\propto \sim 1 /\Delta M$). For example, when the retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in space to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with discounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently introduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using retinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any active visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive fields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose that elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive fields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to future post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would otherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal disruptions is transiently blunted.

Abstract: In this paper we present a concise mathematical description of active inference in discrete time. The main part of the paper serves as a basic introduction to the topic, including a detailed example of the action selection mechanism. The appendix discusses the more subtle mathematical details, targeting readers who have already studied the active inference literature but struggle to make sense of the mathematical details and derivations. Throughout, we emphasize precise and standard mathematical notation, ensuring consistency with existing texts and linking all equations to widely used references on active inference. Additionally, we provide Python code that implements the action selection and learning mechanisms described in this paper and is compatible with pymdp environments.

                arXiv:2504.06354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both biological cortico-thalamic networks and artificial transformer networks use canonical computations to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this work, we propose that the structure of cortico-thalamic circuits is well suited to realize a computation analogous to multihead self-attention, the main algorithmic innovation of transformers. We start with the concept of a cortical unit module or microcolumn, and propose that superficial and deep pyramidal cells carry distinct computational roles. Specifically, superficial pyramidal cells encode an attention mask applied onto deep pyramidal cells to compute attention-modulated values. We show how to wire such microcolumns into a circuit equivalent to a single head of self-attention. We then suggest the parallel between one head of attention and a cortical area. On this basis, we show how to wire cortico-thalamic circuits to perform multihead self-attention. Along these constructions, we refer back to existing experimental data, and find noticeable correspondence. Finally, as a first step towards a mechanistic theory of synaptic learning in this framework, we derive formal gradients of a tokenwise mean squared error loss for a multihead linear self-attention block.

                arXiv:2504.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a mechanism for storing complex patterns within a neural network and subsequently recalling them. This model is based on our work published in 2018(Inazawa, 2018), which we have refined and extended in this work. With the recent advancements in deep learning and large language model (LLM)-based AI technologies (generative AI), it can be considered that methodologies for the learning are becoming increasingly well-established. In the future, we expect to see further research on memory using models based on Transformers (Vaswani, et. al., 2017, Rae, et. al., 2020), but in this paper we propose a simpler and more powerful model of memory and recall in neural networks. The advantage of storing patterns in a neural network lies in its ability to recall the original pattern even when an incomplete version is presented. The patterns we have produced for use in this study have been QR code (DENSO WAVE, 1994), which has become widely used as an information transmission tool in recent years.

                arXiv:2504.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological neural networks are shaped via local plasticity mechanisms can lead to energy-efficient and self-adaptive information processing systems, which promises to mitigate some of the current roadblocks in edge computing systems. While biology makes use of spikes to seamless use both spike timing and mean firing rate to modulate synaptic strength, most models focus on one of the two. In this work, we present a Hebbian local learning rule that models synaptic modification as a function of calcium traces tracking neuronal activity. We show how the rule reproduces results from spike time and spike rate protocols from neuroscientific studies. Moreover, we use the model to train spiking neural networks on MNIST digit recognition to show and explain what sort of mechanisms are needed to learn real-world patterns. We show how our model is sensitive to correlated spiking activity and how this enables it to modulate the learning rate of the network without altering the mean firing rate of the neurons nor the hyparameters of the learning rule. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that showcases how spike timing and rate can be complementary in their role of shaping the connectivity of spiking neural networks.

                arXiv:2504.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization suffers from fragile co-adaptation where brains become over-specialized for particular bodies, hindering their ability to transfer well to others. Evolutionary algorithms tend to discard such low-performing solutions, eliminating promising morphologies. Previous work considered applying MAP-Elites, where niche descriptors are based on morphological features, to promote better search over morphology space. In this work, we show that this approach still suffers from fragile co-adaptation: where a core mechanism of MAP-Elites, creating stepping stones through solutions that migrate from one niche to another, is disrupted. We suggest that this disruption occurs because the body mutations that move an offspring to a new morphological niche break the robots' fragile brain-body co-adaptation and thus significantly decrease the performance of those potential solutions -- reducing their likelihood of outcompeting an existing elite in that new niche. We utilize a technique, we call Pollination, that periodically replaces the controllers of certain solutions with a distilled controller with better generalization across morphologies to reduce fragile brain-body co-adaptation and thus promote MAP-Elites migrations. Pollination increases the success of body mutations and the number of migrations, resulting in better quality-diversity metrics. We believe we develop important insights that could apply to other domains where MAP-Elites is used.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14139">Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.14139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manifold learning techniques play a pivotal role in machine learning by revealing lower-dimensional embeddings within high-dimensional data, thus enhancing both the efficiency and interpretability of data analysis by transforming the data into a lower-dimensional representation. However, a notable challenge with current manifold learning methods is their lack of explicit functional mappings, crucial for explainability in many real-world applications. Genetic programming, known for its interpretable functional tree-based models, has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. Previous research leveraged multi-objective GP to balance manifold quality against embedding dimensionality, producing functional mappings across a range of embedding sizes. Yet, these mapping trees often became complex, hindering explainability. In response, in this paper, we introduce Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel approach that directly penalises tree complexity. Our new method is able to maintain high manifold quality while significantly enhancing explainability and also allows customisation of complexity measures, such as symmetry balancing, scaling, and node complexity, catering to diverse application needs. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that GP-EMaL is able to match the performance of the existing approach in most cases, while using simpler, smaller, and more interpretable tree structures. This advancement marks a significant step towards achieving interpretable manifold learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108">Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.05108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/15/e0204242025?rss=1">Brain-Wide Impacts of Sedation on Spontaneous Activity and Auditory Processing in Larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite their widespread use, we have limited knowledge of the mechanisms by which sedatives mediate their effects on brain-wide networks. This is, in part, due to the technical challenge of observing activity across large populations of neurons in normal and sedated brains. In this study, we examined the effects of the sedative dexmedetomidine, and its antagonist atipamezole, on spontaneous brain dynamics and auditory processing in zebrafish larvae, a stage when sex differentiation has not yet occurred. Our brain-wide, cellular-resolution calcium imaging reveals the brain regions involved in these network-scale dynamics and the individual neurons that are affected within those regions. Further analysis reveals a variety of dynamic changes in the brain at baseline, including marked reductions in spontaneous activity, correlation, and variance. The reductions in activity and variance represent a "quieter" brain state during sedation, an effect inducing highly correlated evoked activity in the auditory system to stand out more than it does in unsedated brains. We also observe a reduction in the persistence of auditory information across the brain during sedation, suggesting that the removal of spontaneous activity leaves the core auditory pathway free of impingement from other nonauditory information. Finally, we describe a less dynamic brain-wide network during sedation, with a higher energy barrier and a lower probability of brain state transitions during sedation. Overall, our brain-wide, cellular-resolution analysis shows that sedation leads to a quieter, more stable, and less dynamic brain and, that against this background, responses across the auditory processing pathway become sharper and more prominent.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/15/e0350252025?rss=1">Takeaways from the First Year of Open Peer Review at JNeurosci</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>The Journal of Neuroscience</I> launched an open peer review (OPR) initiative in late 2023 to enhance transparency and accountability in scientific publishing. Analysis of 740 manuscripts and 1,490 reviews revealed that 81.4% of authors opted to share rebuttal letters, with increasing participation over time (67.6% in Dec 2023 to 94.4% in Aug 2024). Reviewer participation was lower (66.8%) but stable, with higher opt-in rates for longer, higher-quality reviews. Geographical analysis of author and reviewer institutions showed that authors from North American and European institutions had greater OPR opt-in rates, authors from Asian institutions had lower opt-in rates, and reviewers from North American institutions had lower opt-in rates compared with the average rates across regions. Further, analysis of manuscript subdiscipline showed it to be predictive of OPR opt-in rates, e.g., authors of manuscripts in cellular or molecular neuroscience were less likely to opt-in compared with the average across subdisciplines. Overall, OPR acceptance is growing, reflecting a positive shift toward open science.</p>

                <p>Probabilistic reinforcement learning (RL) tasks assay how individuals make decisions under uncertainty. The use of internal models (model-based) or direct learning from experiences (model-free), and the degree of choice stochasticity across alternatives (i.e., exploration), can all be influenced by the state space of the decision-making task. There is considerable individual variation in the balance between model-based and model-free control during decision-making, and this balance is affected by incentive motivation. The effect of variable reward incentives on the arbitration between model-based and model-free learning remains understudied, and individual differences in neural signatures and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of reward on model-free/model-based control are unknown. Here we combined a two-stage decision-making task utilizing differing reward incentives with computational modeling, neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging to address these questions. Results showed the prospect of greater reward decreased exploration of alternative options and increased the balance toward model-based learning. These behavioral effects were replicated across two independent datasets including both sexes. Individual differences in processing speed and analytical thinking style affected how reward altered the dependence on both systems. Using a systems neuroscience-inspired approach to resting-state functional connectivity, we found reduced exploration of the options during the first stage of our task under high relative to low incentives was predicted by increased cross-network coupling between ventral and dorsal RL circuitry. These findings suggest that integrity of functional connections between stimulus valuation (ventral) and action valuation (dorsal) RL networks is associated with changes in the balance between explore&ndash;exploit decisions under changing reward incentives.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/15/e0572242024?rss=1">Distributed Intracranial Activity Underlying Human Decision-making Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Value-based decision&ndash;making involves multiple cortical and subcortical brain areas, but the distributed nature of neurophysiological activity underlying economic choices in the human brain remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the nature of the neurophysiological representation of reward-guided choices, as well as whether they are represented in a subset of reward-related regions or in a more distributed fashion, is unknown. Here, we hypothesize that reward choices, as well as choice-related computations (win probability, risk), are primarily represented in high-frequency neural activity reflecting local cortical processing and that they are highly distributed throughout the human brain, engaging multiple brain regions. To test these hypotheses, we used intracranial recordings from multiple areas (including orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, parietal, cingulate cortices as well as subcortical regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala) from neurosurgical patients of both sexes playing a decision-making game. We show that high-frequency activity (HFA;  and HFA) represents both individual choice-related computations (e.g., risk, win probability) and choice information with different prevalence and regional representation. Choice-related computations are locally and unevenly present in multiple brain regions, whereas choice information is widely distributed and more prevalent and appears later across all regions examined. These results suggest brain-wide reward processing, with local HFA reflecting the coalescence of choice-related information into a final choice, and shed light on the distributed nature of neural activity underlying economic choices in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Auditory deficits are a well-known symptom in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The noncompetitive <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has been used to model sensory and cognitive deficits in nonhuman primates, but its whole-brain effects remain largely unknown. Here we employed ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4&nbsp;T in awake male and female marmoset monkeys (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) to compare brain activations to conspecific vocalizations, scrambled vocalizations, and nonvocal sounds following the administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Our findings reveal a broad suppression of activations across auditory regions following ketamine compared with saline. Additionally, we observed differential effects depending on the type of sound, with notable changes in the mediodorsal thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex, particularly during the processing of vocalizations. These findings suggest a potential overlap between the effects of ketamine and neural disruptions observed in schizophrenia, particularly affecting vocalization processing.</p>

                <p>Seminal studies in animal neuroscience demonstrate that frontostriatal circuits exhibit a ventral&ndash;dorsal functional gradient to integrate neural functions related to reward processing and cognitive control. Prominent neurodevelopmental models posit that heightened reward seeking and risk taking during adolescence result from maturational imbalances between frontostriatal neural systems underlying reward processing and cognitive control. The present study investigated whether the development of ventral (VS) and dorsal (DS) striatal resting-state connectivity (rsFC) networks along this proposed functional gradient relates to putative imbalances between reward and executive systems posited by a dual neural systems theory of adolescent development. One hundred sixty-three participants aged 11&ndash;25&nbsp;years (54% female, 90% white) underwent resting scans at baseline and biennially thereafter, yielding 339 scans across four assessment waves. We observed developmental increases in VS rsFC with brain areas implicated in reward processing (e.g., subgenual cingulate gyrus and medial orbitofrontal cortex) and concurrent decreases with areas implicated in executive function (EF; e.g., ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices). DS rsFC exhibited the opposite pattern. More rapid developmental increases in VS rsFC with reward areas were associated with developmental improvements in reward-based decision-making, whereas increases in DS rsFC with EF areas were associated with improved EF, though each network exhibited some crossover in function. Collectively, these findings suggest that typical adolescent neurodevelopment is characterized by a divergence in ventral and dorsal frontostriatal connectivity that may relate to developmental improvements in affective decision-making and EF.</p>

                <p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the linchpin of nerve-evoked muscle contraction. Broadly, the NMJ transduces nerve action potentials into muscle fiber action potentials (MFAPs). Efficient neuromuscular transmission requires cholinergic signaling, which generates endplate potentials (EPPs), and excitation, the amplification of an EPP by postsynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.4) to generate the MFAP. Compared to the cholinergic component, the signaling pathways that organize Nav1.4 are poorly characterized. Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), in addition to its Ig1 domain-dependent role as the main organizer of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), also binds BMPs via its Ig3 domain and shapes BMP-induced signaling. Using mice lacking the MuSK Ig3 domain ("Ig3-MuSK"), we probed the role of this domain at the NMJ. NMJs formed in Ig3-MuSK animals with pre- and postsynaptic specializations aligned at all ages examined. However, the Ig3-MuSK postsynaptic apparatus was fragmented from an early age. Synaptic electrophysiology showed that spontaneous and nerve-evoked acetylcholine release, AChR density, and endplate currents were comparable at WT and Ig3-MuSK NMJs. However, single fiber electromyography revealed that nerve-evoked MFAPs in Ig3-MuSK muscle were abnormal, exhibiting jitter and blocking. Nerve-evoked compound muscle action potentials and muscle force were also diminished. Finally, Nav1.4 levels were reduced at Ig3-MuSK NMJs, but not extrasynaptically, indicating that the observed excitability defects result from impaired synaptic localization of this ion channel. We propose distinct, domain-specific roles for MuSK at the NMJ: the Ig1 domain mediates agrin-LRP4-mediated AChR localization, while the Ig3 domain maintains postsynaptic Nav1.4 density, conferring the muscle excitability required to amplify cholinergic signals and trigger action potentials.</p>

                <p>The medial pulvinar thalamic nucleus (MPu) is an evolutionary novelty of the primate thalamus, prominently expanded in humans. Piecemeal data from studies in various monkey species indicate that MPu axons reach prefrontal, inferior parietal, cingulate, insular, or temporal areas; however, the precise wiring and functional logic of such brain-wide connections remain obscure. In marmoset monkeys (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) of both sexes, we visualized the axons originated from specific pulvinar domains by means of biotinylated dextran amine microinjections and compared them across multiple cases. In addition, by injecting retrograde tracers in the cortical areas targeted by the pulvinar axons, we investigated the organization of projection cells within MPu and the existence of long-range branched axons. Specific projection motifs reveal a caudal MPu subnucleus that innervates inferior and ventral temporal areas and a rostral MPu subnucleus that innervates temporal, ventral prefrontal, premotor, inferior posterior parietal, and cingulate areas. We demonstrate numerous MPu neurons that innervate through branched axons prefrontal and parietal or prefrontal and temporal areas; other cells with different projection patterns are closely intermingled with them. Our findings support the notion that MPu is a hub of the brain-wide networks that support complex visual and social cognition, sensory-guided reaching, working memory, and attention. Moreover, the finding of long-range branching MPu axons and dense terminal arborizations suggest that MPu cells may regulate functional connectivity among high-level cortical areas at different spatial scales. Besides, the anatomical "ground truth" provided by our study is relevant for functional imaging and distributed network modeling studies.</p>

                <p>Spontaneous neural dynamics manifest across multiple temporal and spatial scales, which are thought to be intrinsic to brain areas and exhibit hierarchical organization across the cortex. In wake, a hierarchy of timescales is thought to naturally emerge from microstructural properties, gene expression, and recurrent connections. A fundamental question is timescales&rsquo; organization and changes in sleep, where physiological needs are different. Here, we describe two measures of neural timescales, obtained from broadband activity and gamma power, which display complementary properties. We leveraged intracranial electroencephalography in 106 human epilepsy patients (48 females) to characterize timescale changes from wake to sleep across the cortical hierarchy. We show that both broadband and gamma timescales are globally longer in sleep than in wake. While broadband timescales increase along the sensorimotor-association axis, gamma ones decrease. During sleep, slow waves can explain the increase of broadband and gamma timescales, but only broadband ones show a positive association with slow-wave density across the cortex. Finally, we characterize spatial correlations and their relationship with timescales as a proxy for spatiotemporal integration, finding high integration at long distances in wake for broadband and at short distances in sleep for gamma timescales. Our results suggest that mesoscopic neural populations possess different timescales that are shaped by anatomy and are modulated by the sleep/wake cycle.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/15/e1846242025?rss=1">Rapid and Stimulus-Specific Deviance Detection in the Human Inferior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Auditory deviance detection, the neural process by which unexpected stimuli are identified within repetitive acoustic environments, is crucial for survival. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in the cortex, recent evidence indicates that it also occurs in subcortical regions, including the inferior colliculus (IC). However, compared with animal studies, research on subcortical deviance detection in humans is often constrained by methodological limitations, leaving several important questions unanswered. This study aims to overcome some of these limitations by employing auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to investigate the earliest neural correlates of deviance detection in humans, with a focus on the IC. We presented healthy participants of either sex with low- and high-frequency chirps in an oddball paradigm and observed significant deviance detection effects in the ABR, specifically when low-frequency chirps were used as deviants within a context of high-frequency standards. These effects manifested as larger and faster ABRs to deviant stimuli, with the strongest responses occurring at higher stimulation rates. Our findings suggest that the human IC exhibits rapid, stimulus-specific deviance detection with differential modulation of response amplitude and latency. The data indicate that the temporal dynamics of novelty detection in humans align well with the data reported in animals, helping to bridge the gap between animal and human research. By uncovering previously unknown characteristics of subcortical deviance detection in humans, this study highlights the value of ABR recordings with excellent temporal resolution in investigating subcortical deviance detection processes.</p>

                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impairments in spatial cognition and memory. The hippocampus is thought to support spatial cognition through the activity of place cells, neurons with spatial receptive fields. Coordinated firing of place cell populations is organized by different oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus during specific behavioral states. Theta rhythms organize place cell populations during awake exploration. Sharp wave-ripples organize place cell population reactivation during waking rest. Here, we examined the coordination of CA1 place cell populations during active behavior and subsequent rest in a rat model of FXS (<I>Fmr1</I> knock-out rats). While the organization of individual place cells by the theta rhythm was normal, the coordinated activation of sequences of place cells during individual theta cycles was impaired in <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out rats. Furthermore, the subsequent replay of place cell sequences was impaired during waking rest following active exploration. Together, these results expand our understanding of how genetic modifications that model those observed in FXS affect hippocampal physiology and suggest a potential mechanism underlying impaired spatial cognition in FXS.</p>

                <p>Determining the brain specializations unique to humans requires directly comparable anatomical information from other primates, especially our closest relatives. Human (<I>Homo sapiens</I>; m/f), chimpanzee (<I>Pan troglodytes</I>; f), and rhesus macaque (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>; m/f) white matter atlases were used to create connectivity blueprints, i.e., descriptions of the cortical gray matter in terms of the connectivity with homologous white matter tracts. This allowed a quantitative comparison of cortical organization across the species. We identified human-unique connectivity profiles concentrated in temporal and parietal cortices and hominid-unique organization in the prefrontal cortex. Functional decoding revealed human-unique hotspots correlated with language processing and social cognition. Overall, our results counter models that assign primacy to the prefrontal cortex for human uniqueness.</p>

                <p>The mammalian cochlea receives efferent feedback from the brain. Many functions for this feedback have been hypothesized, including on short timescales, such as mediating attentional states, and long timescales, such as buffering acoustic trauma. Testing these hypotheses has been impeded by an inability to make direct measurements of efferent effects in awake animals. Here, we assessed the role of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent nerve fibers on cochlear amplification by measuring organ of Corti vibratory responses to sound in both sexes of awake and anesthetized mice. We studied long-term effects by genetically ablating the efferents and/or afferents. Cochlear amplification increased with deafferentation using VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, but only when the efferents were intact, associated with increased activity within OHCs and supporting cells. Removing both the afferents and the efferents using VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> Alpha9<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice did not cause this effect. To test for short-term effects, we recorded sound-evoked vibrations while using pupillometry to measure neuromodulatory brain state. We found no state dependence of cochlear amplification or of the auditory brainstem response. However, state dependence was apparent in the downstream inferior colliculus. Thus, MOC efferents upregulate cochlear amplification chronically with hearing loss, but not acutely with brain state fluctuations. This pathway may partially compensate for hearing loss while mediating associated symptoms, such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.</p>

                <p>The mechanisms through which general anesthetics induce loss of consciousness remain unclear. Previous studies have suggested that dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic (DRN<sup>5-HT</sup>) neurons are involved in inhalational anesthesia, but the underlying neuronal and synaptic mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons in propofol-induced anesthesia in larval zebrafish (sex undetermined at this developmental stage) using a combination of in vivo single-cell calcium imaging, two-photon laser ablation, optogenetic activation, in vivo glutamate imaging, and in vivo whole-cell recording. We found that calcium activity of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons reversibly decreased during propofol perfusion. Ablation of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons prolonged emergence from 30&nbsp;&micro;M propofol anesthesia, while induction times were not affected under concentrations of 1, 3, and 30&nbsp;&micro;M. Additionally, optogenetic activation of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons strongly promoted emergence from propofol anesthesia. Propofol application to DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons suppressed both spontaneous and current injection-evoked spike firing, abolished spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, and decreased membrane input resistance. Presynaptic glutamate release events in DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons were also abolished by propofol. Furthermore, the hyperpolarization of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons caused by propofol was abolished by picrotoxin, a GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist, which shortened emergence time from propofol anesthesia when locally applied to the DRN. Our results reveal that DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons in zebrafish are involved in the emergence from propofol anesthesia by inhibiting presynaptic excitatory glutamate inputs and inducing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated hyperpolarization.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits are refined by strengthening frequently used or advantaged synapses while eliminating redundant connections. In neonatal mice, cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are initially innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs) of similar strength. By postnatal day 7 (P7), one CF, the "winner," is selectively strengthened and begins dendritic translocation by P9, while both "winner" and "loser" CFs temporarily maintain somatic synapses. Although the functional differentiation of CF inputs is well understood, their structural differentiation is less clear. In this study, we examined "winner" CF synapses in dendrites and both "winner" and "loser" synapses in the soma using serial electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in C57BL/6 mice. We found that "winner" CF synapses, both in the soma and dendrites, developed more complex pre- and postsynaptic structures than "loser" CFs, with an expanded area of postsynaptic density. Additionally, "winner" CF synapses expressed significantly higher levels of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Notably, only dendritic "winner" synapses showed increased levels of Rab3-interacting molecule RIM, a key presynaptic regulator of neurotransmitter release. These findings reveal the molecular and structural features that enable "winner" CFs to reinforce their synaptic strength and innervation, allowing them to outcompete other inputs during early development.</p>

                <p>Modulation of neuronal oscillations holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. Nonetheless, conventional stimulation in a continuous open-loop manner can lead to side effects and suboptimal efficiency. Closed-loop strategies such as phase-locked stimulation aim to address these shortcomings by offering a more targeted modulation. While theories have been developed to understand the neural response to stimulation, their predictions have not been thoroughly tested using experimental data. Using a mechanistic coupled oscillator model, we elaborate on two key predictions describing the response to stimulation as a function of the phase and amplitude of ongoing neural activity. To investigate these predictions, we analyze electrocorticogram recordings from a previously conducted study in parkinsonian rats and extract the corresponding phase and amplitude response curves. We demonstrate that the amplitude response to stimulation is strongly correlated to the derivative of the phase response (<I></I> &gt; 0.8) in all animals except one, thereby validating a key model prediction. The second prediction postulates that the stimulation becomes ineffective when the network synchrony is high, a trend that appeared missing in the data. Our analysis explains this discrepancy by showing that the neural populations in parkinsonian rats did not reach the level of synchrony for which the theory would predict ineffective stimulation. Our results highlight the potential of fine-tuning stimulation paradigms informed by mathematical models that consider both the ongoing phase and amplitude of the targeted neural oscillation.</p>

                Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort comparative study of survival rates among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients was carried out between September 1, 2019, and June 30, 2021. A total of 404 patients were in the standard palliative care pain management treatment group (ST), and 87 were in the medicinal cannabis treatment group (CT). Patients with CCA were recruited from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. The cumulative survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were investigated using Cox regression. Results: For ST patients, there was a total follow-up time of 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients the total follow-up time was 476 person-months, with mortality rate of 10.9/ 100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38) for CT. Multivariate analysis showed that CT treatment protocol was associated with a significantly better survival (P value <0.001; median time of CT, 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38); median time of ST, 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95). Therefore, CT had a reduced probability of dying from the disease (HRadj., 0.28 (95% CI: 0.20–0.37) Conclusions: The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients.

                Background Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has a poor prognosis and is a major cause of mortality and suffering in Thailand’s Northeastern (Isaan) Region. Methods This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 72 newly diagnosed CCA patients; 42 patients who received cannabis treatment (CT) and 30 patients who received a standard palliative care treatment (ST). The study was carried out between 1st September 2019 to 31st October 2020. Data were collected from patients from oncology clinics of six hospitals in five provinces of northeast Thailand. The HRQoL was measured at baseline, and at 2 and 4 months after diagnosis by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life questionnaires QLQ-C30, and QLQ-BIL21. The Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare quality of life scores between the two patient groups and Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare within groups QoL scores at pre-treatment, and 2 and 4 month follow-ups. Results Global health status and functional scales, for both groups were high at pre-treatment. At 2 and 4 month follow-up, CT group patients had consistent statistically significantly better Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), and QoL scores, and many symptom scores than the ST group. Conclusions Medicinal cannabis may increase QoL for advanced CCA patients. Our findings support the importance of early access to palliative cannabis care clinic before the terminal and acceleration phase close to death.

                Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a high mortality rate. However, Pancoast tumors, a rare subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), represent an uncommon clinical presentation.

                Background Several scholars defined the concepts of fuzzy soft set theory and their application on decision-making problem. Based on this concept, researchers defined the generalised fuzzy soft set and its applications. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the generalised fuzzy soft set has not been dealing with in the generalised fuzzy soft code set. In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalised fuzzy soft code set and its application. Methods The theory of fuzzy soft sets and its application, generalised fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy codes in different years were studied with various researchers. To derive a generalised fuzzy soft code set, we apply the concepts of generalised fuzzy soft set and a new view of fuzzy codes and its application. A new aspect of this paper is to introduce the definition of generalised fuzzy soft code sets and its application on medical diagnosis and decision-makings. Results Generalised fuzzy soft code is the most powerful and effective extension of fuzzy soft sets that deal with the choice’s parameterized values. It is an extended model of fuzzy soft sets and a new mathematical tool with significant advantages for handling uncertain information and is proposed by combining the concept of fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy code sets. This paper introduces the concept of generalised fuzzy soft code and its properties. Conclusions In this study, we combine generalised fuzzy soft set and a different approach to coding theory to introduce generalisation of fuzzy soft codes. The paper also considers the relation between generalised fuzzy soft code and its application. We discussed the matrix representation of generalised fuzzy soft code. Furthermore, a demonstration example illustrates how the strategy could be effectively applied to various problems.

                Contemporary machine learning models are increasingly becoming restricted by size and subsequent operations per forward pass, demanding increasing compute requirements. Quantization has emerged as a convenient approach to addressing this, in which weights and activations are mapped from their conventionally used floating-point 32-bit numeric representations to lower precision integers. This process introduces significant reductions in inference time and simplifies the hardware requirements. It is a well-studied result that the performance of such reduced precision models is congruent with their floating-point counterparts. However, there is a lack of literature that addresses the performance of quantized models in a perturbed input space, as is common when stress testing regular full-precision models, particularly for real-world deployments. We focus on addressing this gap in the context of 8-bit quantized convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We study three state-of-the-art CNNs: ResNet-18, VGG-16, and SqueezeNet1_1, and subject their floating point and fixed point forms to various noise regimes with varying intensities. We characterize performance in terms of traditional metrics, including top-1 and top-5 accuracy, as well as the F1 score. We also introduce a new metric, the Kullback-Liebler divergence of the two output distributions for a given floating-point/fixed-point model pair, as a means to examine how the model’s output distribution has changed as a result of quantization, which, we contend, can be interpreted as a proxy for model similarity in decision making. We find that across all three models and under each perturbation scheme, the relative error between the quantized and full-precision model was consistently low. We also find that Kullback-Liebler divergence was on the same order of magnitude as the unperturbed tests across all perturbation regimes except Brownian noise, where significant divergences were observed for VGG-16 and SqueezeNet1_1.

                Introduction This case highlights an atypical mild presentation of rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening condition that often presents with severe symptoms. This underlines the importance of maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion to facilitate an early diagnosis and prevent complications. Patient Concerns A 31-year-old man presented with localized left-sided chest pain persisting for one week, coinciding with the resumption of gym training. His medical history was notable for sickle cell traits, and physical examination was unremarkable. Diagnoses, Interventions, and Outcomes Initial investigations such as ECG, CBC, troponin, D-dimer, and chest radiography were reported to be normal. With an atypical presentation, rhabdomyolysis was suspected due to the onset of pain after exercise. The creatine kinase (CK) level was markedly elevated at 20,792 U/L, which confirmed the diagnosis. The patient received aggressive IV hydration, and subsequent clinical follow-up revealed resolution of symptoms and normalization of CK levels. The patient was discharged in stable condition with follow-up advice. Conclusion Clinical suspicion should be emphasized in patients visiting a doctor with symptoms of exercise, despite the lack of classic rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, prompt attention and intervention may prevent such patients from experiencing severe consequences.

                Circular RNAs (circRNAs), once thought to be a result of splicing errors, have been found to be involved in various molecular processes and the pathology of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, circRNA expression was found to be altered by lifestyle habits, such as smoking cigarettes. Past studies have revealed that the rate of smoking remains high in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, we isolated total RNA from uninfected T-cells that have been exposed to cigarette smoke and compared the expression levels of circRNAs to those of T-cells that were not exposed to cigarette smoke. We identified certain circRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated in T-cells when exposed to cigarette smoke. These data indicate that the study of circRNAs is warranted within the context of HIV.

In the mouse distal terminal phalanx (P3), it remains mystery why amputation at less than 33% of the digit results in regeneration, while amputation exceeding 67% leads to non-regeneration. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying this disparity could provide crucial insights for regenerative medicine. In this study, we aim to investigate the tissues within the wound bed to understand the tissue microenvironment associated with regenerative versus non-regenerative outcomes. We employed a P3-specific amputation model in mice, integrated with time-series RNA-seq and a macrophage assay challenged with pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, to explore these mechanisms. Our findings revealed that non-regenerative digits exhibit a greater intense early transcriptional response in the wound bed compared to regenerative ones. Furthermore, early macrophage phenotypes differ distinctly between regenerative and non-regenerative outcomes. Regenerative digits also display unique co-expression modules related to Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (Bmp2). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between regenerative and non-regenerative digits are enriched in targets of several transcription factors, such as HOXA11 and HOXD11 from the HOX gene family, showing a time-dependent pattern of enrichment. These transcription factors, known for their roles in bone regeneration, skeletal patterning, osteoblast activity, fracture healing, angiogenesis, and key signaling pathways, may act as master regulators of the regenerative gene signatures. Additionally, we developed a deep learning AI model capable of predicting post-amputation time and level from RNA-seq data, indicating that the regenerative probability may be “encoded” in the transcriptomic response to amputation.

Abnormal cellular respiration plays a critical role in carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulation of respiratory gene expression across different cancer types remain unclear. Here, we developed a computational framework that provides an analytical approach for exploring the molecular alterations and clinical relevance of respiratory genes in pan-cancer. We identified a total of 53 gene signatures in the three stages of respiration (including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation) through this framework and found that they were broadly differentially expressed and genetically altered across 33 cancer types. Pathway analysis manifested that the expression levels of almost all respiratory gene signatures were remarkably associated with the activation or inhibition of numerous oncogenic pathways, such as metabolism, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Survival analysis highlighted the oncogenic or tumor suppressor potential of the respiratory gene signatures. In particular, <i>VCAN</i> has shown significant oncogenic features in multiple cancer types. Finally, we identified a number of respiratory gene signatures that could be potential therapeutic targets, including <i>VCAN</i>. We also predicted small-molecule compounds targeting respiratory gene signatures or components of pathways regulated by them. Overall, our comprehensive analysis has greatly enhanced the understanding of molecular alterations of respiratory genes in tumorigenesis and progression, and provided insights into developing new therapeutic strategies.

                <p>by Yi Cheng, Xingyu Wang, Qiang Zhang, Renkai Ge, Mei Zhou, Yue Dai</p>

Persistent inward currents (PICs) play a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. These currents are composed of calcium (CaL) and sodium (NaP) components in vertebrate spinal neurons. Recent studies have reported that PICs are expressed in serotonergic neurons (5-HT) in medulla of mice. Multiple patterns of PICs were identified in 5-HT neurons, corresponding to a range of distinct repetitive firing types. The mechanisms underlying formation of these PIC patterns and firing types remain unknown. Using combined modeling and experimental approaches we explored the ionic mechanisms responsible for the PIC patterns and firing types. The whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed on the medullary 5-HT neurons of postnatal day 3–6 mice. A 5-HT neuron model was built based on the membrane properties of the 5-HT neurons and kinetics of voltage-gated channels. Results from physiological experiments and modeling simulations included: (1) PICs in 5-HT neurons were classified into six patterns based on their current trajectory induced by bi-ramp voltage, while repetitive firings were categorized into three types according to their response to bi-ramp current. Modulation of PICs conductance and kinetics altered the PIC patterns and firing types. (2) NaP conductance contributed to amplitude of PICs, whereas the slow inactivation gate (S<sub>gate</sub>) of NaP regulated the PIC patterns and firing types. Increasing S<sub>gate</sub> changed trajectory of PICs from counterclockwise to clockwise and firing types from asymmetrical to symmetric types induced by bi-ramp current. (3) CaL conductance dominated the amplitude of PICs, while CaL kinetics (half-activation voltage and slope) determined inactivation of PICs and prolongation of repetitive firing. (4) The novel finding was that distribution of CaL in distal dendrites modulated the PIC patterns and firing types. This study provides insights into the ionic mechanisms underlying generation of multiple PIC patterns and firing types in 5-HT neurons.

The physical organization of the genome in three-dimensional space regulates many biological processes, including gene expression and cell differentiation. Three-dimensional characterization of genome structure is critical to understanding these biological processes. Direct experimental measurements of genome structure are challenging; computational models of chromatin structure are therefore necessary. We develop an approach that combines a particle-based chromatin polymer model, molecular simulation, and machine learning to efficiently and accurately estimate chromatin structure from <i>indirect</i> measures of genome structure. More specifically, we introduce a new approach where the interaction parameters of the polymer model are extracted from experimental Hi-C data using a graph neural network (GNN). We train the GNN on simulated data from the underlying polymer model, avoiding the need for large quantities of experimental data. The resulting approach accurately estimates chromatin structures across all chromosomes and across several experimental cell lines despite being trained almost exclusively on simulated data. The proposed approach can be viewed as a general framework for combining physical modeling with machine learning, and it could be extended to integrate additional biological data modalities. Ultimately, we achieve accurate and high-throughput estimations of chromatin structure from Hi-C data, which will be necessary as experimental methodologies, such as single-cell Hi-C, improve.

                <p>by Daniela S Santurio, Luciana R C Barros, Ingmar Glauche, Artur c Fassoni</p>

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy holds significant potential for cancer treatment, although disease relapse and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remain as frequent clinical challenges. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the temporal dynamics of CAR-T cell therapy response and CRS, we developed a novel multi-layer mathematical model incorporating antigen-mediated CAR-T cell expansion, antigen-negative resistance, and macrophage-associated cytokine release. Three key mechanisms of macrophage activation are considered: release of damage-associated molecular patterns, antigen-binding mediated activation, and CD40-CD40L contact. The model accurately describes 25 patient time courses with different responses and IL-6 cytokine kinetics. We successfully link the dynamic shape of the response to interpretable model parameters and investigate the influence of CAR-T cell dose and initial tumor burden on the occurrence of cytokine release and treatment outcome. By disentangling the timeline of macrophage activation, the model identified distinct contributions of each activation mechanism, suggesting the CD40-CD40L axis as a major driver of cytokine release and a clinically feasible target to control the activation process and modulate cytokine peak height. Our multi-layer model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between CAR-T cells, tumor cells, and macrophages during therapy.

                <p>by Elsa Ronzier, Prasanna Satpute-Krishnan</p>

The p24-family member, TMED9, has recently emerged as a player in secretory pathway protein quality control (PQC) that influences the trafficking and degradation of misfolded proteins. Here, we show that TMED9 plays a central role in the PQC of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Typically, upon release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone calnexin, misfolded GPI-APs traffic to the Golgi by an ER-export pathway called Rapid ER stress-induced Export (RESET). From the Golgi, they access the plasma membrane where they are rapidly internalized for lysosomal degradation. We used biochemical and imaging approaches in cultured cells to demonstrate that at steady-state, the majority of misfolded GPI-APs reside in the ER in association with calnexin and TMED9. During RESET, they dissociate from calnexin and increase their association with TMED9. Inhibition of TMED9’s function through siRNA-induced depletion or chemical inhibitor, BRD4780, blocked ER-export of misfolded GPI-APs. In contrast, TMED9-inhibition did not prevent ER-export of wild-type GPI-APs, indicating a specific role for TMED9 in GPI-AP PQC. Intriguingly, we discovered that acute treatment with BRD4780 induced a shift in TMED9 localization away from the ER to the downstream Golgi cisternae and blocked the RESET pathway. Upon removal of BRD4780 following acute treatment, TMED9 regained access to the ER where TMED9 was able to associate with the RESET substrate and restore the RESET pathway. These results suggest that TMED9 plays a requisite role in RESET by capturing misfolded GPI-APs that are released by calnexin within the ER and conveying them to the Golgi.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104725">High-resolution deep mutational scanning of the melanocortin-4 receptor enables target characterization for drug discovery</a></h4>

              
                Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) is an emerging method to systematically test the functional consequences of thousands of sequence changes to a protein target in a single experiment. Because of its utility in interpreting both human variant effects and protein structure-function relationships, it holds substantial promise to improve drug discovery and clinical development. However, applications in this domain require improved experimental and analytical methods. To address this need, we report novel DMS methods to precisely and quantitatively interrogate disease-relevant mechanisms, protein-ligand interactions, and assess predicted response to drug treatment. Using these methods, we performed a DMS of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) implicated in obesity and an active target of drug development efforts. We assessed the effects of &gt;6600 single amino acid substitutions on MC4R’s function across 18 distinct experimental conditions, resulting in &gt;20 million unique measurements. From this, we identified variants that have unique effects on MC4R-mediated Gα<sub>s</sub>- and Gα<sub>q</sub>-signaling pathways, which could be used to design drugs that selectively bias MC4R’s activity. We also identified pathogenic variants that are likely amenable to a corrector therapy. Finally, we functionally characterized structural relationships that distinguish the binding of peptide versus small molecule ligands, which could guide compound optimization. Collectively, these results demonstrate that DMS is a powerful method to empower drug discovery and development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101302">Repeated activation of preoptic area recipient neurons in posterior paraventricular nucleus mediates chronic heat-induced negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states</a></h4>

              
                Mental and behavioral disorders are associated with extended period of hot weather as found in heatwaves, but the underlying neural circuit mechanism remains poorly known. The posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) is a hub for emotional processing and receives inputs from the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), the well-recognized thermoregulation center. The present study was designed to explore whether chronic heat exposure leads to aberrant activities in POA recipient pPVT neurons and subsequent changes in emotional states. By devising an air heating paradigm mimicking the condition of heatwaves and utilizing emotion-related behavioral tests, viral tract tracing, in vivo calcium recordings, optogenetic manipulations, and electrophysiological recordings, we found that chronic heat exposure for 3 weeks led to negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states in mice. The pPVT neurons receive monosynaptic excitatory and inhibitory innervations from the POA. These neurons exhibited a persistent increase in neural activity following chronic heat exposure, which was essential for chronic heat-induced emotional changes. Notably, these neurons were also prone to display stronger neuronal activities associated with anxiety responses to stressful situations. Furthermore, we observed saturated neuroplasticity in the POA-pPVT excitatory pathway after chronic heat exposure that occluded further potentiation. Taken together, long-term aberration in the POA to pPVT pathway offers a neurobiological mechanism of emotional and behavioral changes seen in extended periods of hot weather like heatwaves.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102658">Cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum chaperones inhibit wt-p53 to increase cancer cells' survival by refluxing ER-proteins to the cytosol</a></h4>

              
                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential sensing organelle responsible for the folding and secretion of almost one-third of eukaryotic cells' total proteins. However, environmental, chemical, and genetic insults often lead to protein misfolding in the ER, accumulating misfolded proteins, and causing ER stress. To solve this, several mechanisms were reported to relieve ER stress by decreasing the ER protein load. Recently, we reported a novel ER surveillance mechanism by which proteins from the secretory pathway are refluxed to the cytosol to relieve the ER of its content. The refluxed proteins gain new prosurvival functions in cancer cells, thereby increasing cancer cell fitness. We termed this phenomenon <span class="underline">ER</span> to <span class="underline">CY</span>tosol <span class="underline">S</span>ignaling (or ‘<b>ERCYS’</b>). Here, we found that in mammalian cells, ERCYS is regulated by DNAJB12, DNAJB14, and the HSC70 cochaperone SGTA. Mechanistically, DNAJB12 and DNAJB14 bind HSC70 and SGTA - through their cytosolically localized J-domains to facilitate ER-protein reflux. DNAJB12 is necessary and sufficient to drive this phenomenon to increase AGR2 reflux and inhibit wt-p53 during ER stress. Mutations in DNAJB12/14 J-domain prevent the inhibitory interaction between AGR2-wt-p53. Thus, targeting the DNAJB12/14-HSC70/SGTA axis is a promising strategy to inhibit ERCYS and impair cancer cell fitness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104723">Numb provides a fail-safe mechanism for intestinal stem cell self-renewal in adult Drosophila midgut</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell self-renewal often relies on asymmetric fate determination governed by niche signals and/or cell-intrinsic factors but how these regulatory mechanisms cooperate to promote asymmetric fate decision remains poorly understood. In adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut, asymmetric Notch (N) signaling inhibits intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal by promoting ISC differentiation into enteroblast (EB). We have previously shown that epithelium-derived Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) promotes ISC self-renewal by antagonizing N pathway activity (Tian and Jiang, 2014). Here, we show that loss of BMP signaling results in ectopic N pathway activity even when the N ligand Delta (Dl) is depleted, and that the N inhibitor Numb acts in parallel with BMP signaling to ensure a robust ISC self-renewal program. Although Numb is asymmetrically segregated in about 80% of dividing ISCs, its activity is largely dispensable for ISC fate determination under normal homeostasis. However, Numb becomes crucial for ISC self-renewal when BMP signaling is compromised. Whereas neither Mad RNA interference nor its hypomorphic mutation led to ISC loss, inactivation of Numb in these backgrounds resulted in stem cell loss due to precocious ISC-to-EB differentiation. Furthermore, we find that <i>numb</i> mutations resulted in stem cell loss during midgut regeneration in response to epithelial damage that causes fluctuation in BMP pathway activity, suggesting that the asymmetrical segregation of Numb into the future ISC may provide a fail-save mechanism for ISC self-renewal by offsetting BMP pathway fluctuation, which is important for ISC maintenance in regenerative guts.

">Extracellular vesicles released from cortical neurons influence spontaneous activity of recipient neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous structures that cells release into the extracellular space. EVs carry various molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and serve as specialized transporters to influence other cells. In the central nervous system, EVs have been linked to many important processes, including intercellular communication, but molecular details of their physiological functions are not fully understood. Our study aimed to investigate how EVs are released by neuronal cells, and how they affect the neuronal activity of other recipient neurons. We show that mature primary cortical neurons release EVs from both their soma and dendrites. EVs released from neurons closely resemble non-neuronal EVs regarding size and marker proteins and proteomic analyses showed that neuronally released EVs contain proteins typically acting in pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that EVs alter spontaneous activity in target neurons by increasing the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials. In summary, our findings elaborates on the role of EVs in synaptic activity modulation in neurons mediated by glutamate receptors.

">Learning and language in the unconscious human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Consciousness is a fundamental component of cognition, but the degree to which higher-order perception relies on it remains disputed. Here we demonstrate the persistence of learning, semantic processing, and online prediction in individuals under general anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. Using high-density Neuropixels microelectrodes to record neural activity in the human hippocampus while playing a series of tones to anesthetized patients, we found that hippocampal neurons could reliably detect oddball tones. This effect size grew over the course of the experiment (~10 minutes), consistent with learning effects. A biologically plausible recurrent neural network model showed that learning and oddball representation are an emergent property of flexible tone discrimination. Last, when we played language stimuli, single units and ensembles carried information about the semantic and grammatical features of natural speech, even predicting semantic information about upcoming words. Together these results indicate that in the hippocampus, which is anatomically and functionally distant from primary sensory cortices, complex processing of sensory stimuli occurs even in the unconscious state.

">Reward influences movement vigor through multiple motor cortical mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The prospect of greater rewards often invigorates movements. What neural mechanisms support this increase of movement vigor for greater rewards? We had three rhesus monkeys perform reaching movements to targets worth different magnitudes of reward. We recorded neural population activity from primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex, brain areas at the output of cortical processing for voluntary movements, and asked how neural activity mediated the translation of reward into increased vigor. We identified features of neural activity during movement preparation, initiation, and execution that were both correlated with vigor and modulated by reward. We also found that the neural metrics that correlate with different aspects of movement vigor exhibit only limited correlation with one another, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms through which reward modulates vigor. Finally, we note that the majority of reward's modulation of motor cortical activity cannot be accounted for by reward-mediated vigor differences in behavior, indicating that reward modulations within motor cortex may serve roles in addition to affecting vigor. Overall, our results provide insight into the neural mechanisms that link reward-driven motivation to the modulation of the details of movement.

">Transient, early, female-specific increase in cortical glial fibrillary acidic protein distribution in the Syrian hamster model of mild peripheral COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mild-moderate respiratory COVID-19 is commonly associated with a range of neurological symptoms. The mechanisms linking this peripheral disease to cognitive symptoms are thought to include heightened circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators resulting in a leaky blood-brain barrier and increased neuroinflammation (i.e., inflammation taking place in the brain). This can lead to aberrant synaptic transmission and cognitive dysfunction. A key component of neuroinflammation is the reactivity of astrocytes, in a process termed astrogliosis, associated with altered morphology, proliferative capacity, gene expression, and function. Accumulating evidence suggests astrogliosis likely occurs in mild to moderate COVID-19 ; however, there has been limited investigation. In this study, we quantified changes to astrocytes in a Syrian hamster model of mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19. Methods: We used an intranasal inoculation model to produce mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19 in 8-10-week-old male and female Syrian hamsters. We extracted brains at 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 31-days post-inoculation and from uninfected controls, and immunolabelled brain sections with astrocyte- (GFAP and SOX9) and neuron-specific (NEUN) markers. We captured tiled confocal micrographs of entire brain sections and analyzed the resulting signals from five regions of interest: cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, third ventricle, and dorsal striatum. Results: To systematically quantify cell-type-specific labelling for astrogliosis markers, we first developed an unbiased pipeline. We found a transient increase in GFAP signal density in female hamster, specifically in the cortex at 3 days post-inoculation. There were no corresponding changes noted in astrocyte (SOX9), neuron (NEUN) or total cell (Hoechst) numbers. Moreover, there were no changes in male hamsters at any timepoint in any region of interest. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first spatiotemporal insight into astrogliosis in a hamster model of mild to moderate respiratory COVID-19. We identified a transient and sex-specific increase in GFAP signal density, indicative of astrogliosis. Our findings contribute to the literature surrounding sex differences in (neuro)immune responses and add to the growing body of COVID-19 literature, in which sex-specific outcomes are apparent in both human patient populations and rodent experimental models.

">A multi-institutional investigation of psilocybin's effects on mouse behavior</a></h4>

              
                Studies reporting novel therapeutic effects of psychedelic drugs are rapidly emerging. However, the reproducibility and reliability of these findings could remain uncertain for years. Here, we implemented a multi-institutional collaborative approach to define the robust and replicable effects of the psychedelic drug psilocybin on mouse behavior. Five laboratories performed the same experiments to test the acute and persistent effects of psilocybin (2 mg/kg, IP) on various behaviors that psychedelics have been proposed to affect, including anxiety-related approach-avoidance, exploration, sociability, depression-related behaviors, fear extinction, and social reward learning. Through this coordinated approach, we found that psilocybin had several robust and replicable acute effects on mouse behavior, including increased anxiety- and avoidance-related behaviors and decreased fear expression. Surprisingly, however, we found that psilocybin did not have replicable effects 24 hours post psilocybin administration on reducing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors or facilitating fear extinction learning. Additionally, we were unable to observe psilocybin-induced alterations in social preference or social reward learning. Overall, our comprehensive characterization of psilocybin's acute and persistent behavioral effects using ~200 total male and female mice per experiment spread across five independent labs demonstrates with unique certainty several acute drug effects and suggests that psilocybin's persistent effects in mice may be more modest and inconsistent than previously suggested. We believe this unusual multi49 laboratory, highly coordinated research effort serves as a model for facilitating the generation of replicable results and consequently will reduce efforts based on unreliable and spurious results.

">Glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in the human spinal dorsal horn revealed with immunohistochemistry</a></h4>

              
                Primary afferent neurons detect sensory stimuli in the periphery and transmit this information to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it is extensively processed by excitatory and inhibitory spinal controls before being sent to higher brain centres. Immunohistochemical analysis of the synaptic architecture of these spinal circuits has been notoriously difficult in formaldehyde-fixed tissue and often requires antigen retrieval techniques to reveal antigen binding epitopes. To avoid the damage this harsh treatment can induce, studies have used antibodies raised against scaffolding proteins Homer1 and gephyrin, which anchor glutamate and GABA receptors to the membrane, respectively, to identify synaptic associations in rodent spinal cord underlying pain and itch transmission. In contrast, few studies have attempted to visualise spinal cord synapses in the human, partly due to a lack of high-quality tissue with low postmortem intervals. In this study, we reveal both excitatory and inhibitory synapses at a high resolution in human lumbar spinal cord tissue using antibodies to Homer1 and gephyrin and show that the basic organisation of these proteins within the dorsal horn is similar to that seen in the rodent. We show these postsynaptic markers are highly colocalised with glutamate and GABA receptor subunits and are in close apposition to presynaptic markers, confirming their specificity. Finally, we use Homer1-immunolabelling to demonstrate that primary afferents can form complex synaptic arrangements in human. We conclude that these antibodies can be used as reliable tools for the study of the human CNS and we have used them to reveal insight into the microanatomy of somatosensory connections in the human spinal cord that can be expanded upon in future studies.

">FRAZZLED/DCC REGULATES GAP JUNCTION FORMATION AT A DROSOPHILA GIANT SYNAPSE THROUGH TRANSCRIPTION</a></h4>

              
                Loss of function Frazzled/DCC mutants demonstrate that the gene regulates synaptogenesis in the Giant Fiber System of Drosophila. In frazzled loss of function (LOF) mutants, we observe weaker physiology, characterized by longer latencies and reduced response frequencies between the GFs and the motor neurons. These physiological phenotypes are linked to a loss of gap junctions in the GFs, specifically the loss of the shaking-B(neural+16) isoform of innexin in the presynaptic terminal. A GF biophysical computational model is provided to test the role of gap junctions and the function of the Giant Fiber System. We present evidence of Frazzled's role in gap junction regulation by utilizing the UAS-GAL4 system in Drosophila to rescue mutant phenotypes. Expression of various UAS-Frazzled constructs in a Frazzled LOF background was used to dissect the role of different parts of the Frazzled receptor in the assembly of electrical synapses. Driving Frazzled intracellular domain in Frazzled LOF mutants rescued axon pathfinding and synaptogenesis. This is supported by the fact that Frazzled fails to rescue the synaptic function when its transcriptional activation domain is disrupted, as shown by the deletion of the highly conserved intracellular P3 domain or by a construct with a point-mutation in the highly conserved P3 domain known to be required for transcriptional activation. The present work is the first to show how a guidance molecule regulates synaptogenesis through transcriptional regulation of synaptic components.

">Drosophila Modeling Identifies Increased Sleep as a Link Between Insomnia and Cardiovascular Disease</a></h4>

              
                Insomnia is a common sleep disorder associated with negative long-term health outcomes. Mendelian randomization studies have found that insomnia significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To better understand the link between sleep and heart health, we identify genes associated with both insomnia and CVD. We model the disruption of the Drosophila melanogaster orthologs in neurons and cardiac tissue to characterize their cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous role in regulating sleep and cardiac physiology. We identify three genes that function in neurons and the heart to cell-autonomously regulate the function of each tissue. We find that the disruption of insomnia- and CVD-associated Drosophila orthologs in the heart most often lead to increased nighttime sleep. Inversely, disruptions in neurons that lead to increased sleep most often result in an elevated heart rate. To confirm the association between increased sleep and cardiac function, we performed a genetic correlation analysis from human data between long sleep-related traits and adverse cardiac outcomes. Significant correlations were found between most long sleep traits and heart failure, coronary artery disease, or myocardial infarction, reinforcing our findings in the fly linking increased or excessive sleep and altered cardiac health.

">SLC44A1 deficiency impedes myelin development in the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Axon-wrapping myelin sheath is essential for the proper functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Defects in myelination occur in various neurodevelopmental disorders. Human deficiency of the solute carrier 44A1 (SLC44A1) causes a new type of childhood-onset neurodegeneration with leukoencephalopathy. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this devastating disease, and little is known about its pathological mechanisms. In this study we identified that SLC44A1 is enriched in oligodendrocytes and required for myelin development in the CNS of zebrafish and rodents, which is crucial for normal motor coordination and cognitive function. Defective oligodendroglial maturation and myelinogenesis can be visualized by in vivo time-lapse imaging in the spinal cord of zebrafish with Slc44a1b deficiency. Mechanistically, SLC44A1 deficiency disrupts the expression of genes involved in phosphatidylcholine production pathway, and subsequently inhibiting phospholipid biosynthesis and disturbing the lipid composition of myelin sheaths. More importantly, supplementation with citicoline, a natural choline metabolite, restores developmental myelination in SLC44A1-deficient animals. These findings demonstrate that SLC44A1 is essential for CNS myelination and citicoline supplementation represents a potential therapeutic strategy to address the developmental hypomyelination.

                Several members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family have been implicated in the biology of schizophrenia (Ketharanathan et al., 2024). The EGF-related ligand, Betacellulin (BTC), plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells and our group found markedly reduced BTC levels in patients with schizophrenia. Nevertheless, the interplay of affected BTC and its participation in neural specification and neurodevelopment remains elusive. We generated Knockout (KO) - BTC clones from an existing hiPSC line through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated modification. Furthermore, we validated BTC-KO through genotyping/sequencing, FACS and Western Blot. Finally, we demonstrated trilineage differentiation potential in vitro.

">Functional Role for Cas Cytoplasmic Adaptor Proteins During Cortical Axon Pathfinding</a></h4>

              
                Proper neural circuit organization requires individual neurons to project to their targets with high specificity. While several guidance molecules have been shown to mediate axonal fasciculation and pathfinding, less is understood about how neurons intracellularly interpret and integrate these cues. Here we provide genetic evidence that the Crk-Associated Substrate (Cas) family of intracellular adaptor proteins is required for proper fasciculation and guidance of two cortical white matter tracts: the Anterior Commissure (AC) and thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Using a Cas Triple Conditional Knock Out (Cas TcKO) mouse model, we show that Cas proteins are required non-neuronally for TCA projections in a manner that phenocopies the non-neuronal requirement for the {beta}1-integrin receptor. Additional analysis of Cas TcKO mutants reveals a neuronal-autonomous role in AC fasciculation that is not phenocopied in {beta}1-integrin deficient mutants, suggesting that Cas proteins might signal downstream of a different receptor during this axon pathfinding event. These findings implicate Cas proteins as key mediators of cortical axon tract fasciculation and guidance.

">Genetic diversity shapes behavioral outcomes and reveals sex differences in mice exposed to early life stress</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how genetic variability shapes responses to environmental and developmental factors is critical for advancing translational neuroscience. However, most preclinical studies rely on inbred mouse strains that do not capture the genetic complexity of human populations. One key area of translational research focuses on identifying the neural and behavioral consequences of early life trauma. Rodent models of childhood neglect, such as maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW), have been used in isogenic mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6) to identify behavioral domains and neural loci of deficits stemming from exposure to MSEW. To understand how genetic diversity may contribute to the outcomes produced by MSEW, and thus inform future studies on the topic, we utilized the Jackson Laboratory Diversity Outbred (DO) line, a population derived from eight founder strains that exhibit broad genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We first compared MSEW effects on social behavior in DO mice versus B6 mice, because we have previously found social behavior deficits in B6 mice with a history of MSEW. Indeed, we established that MSEW incited social motivation deficits in DO mice, in a sex-specific manner. We then expanded our investigation of DO mice to test MSEW-related changes in anxiety-like behavior, fear learning and expression, and reward-seeking. Results revealed that MSEW produces distinct, sex-specific phenotypes: female DO mice displayed reduced social motivation and elevated anxiety-like behavior, while male DO mice showed attenuated CS-evoked fear expression and diminished reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in MSEW-exposed DO mice, both at baseline and following acute stress. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating genetically diverse models to better capture the nuances of early life adversity-related outcomes relevant to human populations.

">Insights into early cochlear damage induced by potassium channel deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory disorder, caused by genetic mutations and acquired factors like presbycusis and noise exposure. A critical factor in HL development is the dysfunction of potassium (K+) channels, essential for sensory cell function in the organ of Corti (OC). Inner and outer hair cells (IHCs and OHCs) convert sound into electrical signals, while supporting cells (SCs) maintain ionic and structural balance. KCNQ4 channels, located in the basal membrane of OHCs, regulate K+ efflux. Mutations in KCNQ4 are linked to progressive HL (DFNA2), noise-induced hearing loss, and presbycusis, leading to K+ accumulation, cellular stress, and OHC death. Gene editing or pharmacological activation of KCNQ4 has shown potential in partially preventing HL in mouse models. In this study, we demonstrate KCNQ4 deletion disrupts the localization of key proteins like prestin and BK channels, alters OHC organization, and induces apoptosis in sensory and SC. Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) also degenerate over time. Despite these structural changes, noise exposure does not exacerbate OHC damage in our KCNQ4-deficient model. This highlights KCNQ4's role in maintaining ion homeostasis and cochlear function, as its absence triggers widespread dysfunction in the OC. The present study demonstrates that disruptions in a single cell type can have a cascade effect on overall cochlear health. Understanding the molecular and cellular consequences of KCNQ4 mutations is crucial for developing targeted therapies to mitigate progressive HL caused by genetic and environmental factors.

">Identification of a stress-sensitive endogenous opioid-containing neuronal population in the paranigral ventral tegmental area.</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), an endogenous opioid neuropeptide, and its G-protein coupled receptor NOPR have been implicated in motivation, feeding behaviors, and aversion. Stress-induced dysfunction in these states is central to the development of numerous psychiatric disorders, and the N/OFQ-NOPR system's role in reward- and stress-related responses has driven broad interest in NOPR as a therapeutic target for anxiety and depression. However, the impact of stress on N/OFQ signaling in the context of its influence on discrete midbrain reward circuitry remains unknown. To this end, we focused on a possible candidate population of N/OFQ neurons in the paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTAPNOC) that have been shown to act locally on NOPR-containing VTA dopamine neurons to suppress motivation. Here we report and characterize pnVTAPNOC sensitivity to stress exposure and identify a functional excitatory and inhibitory afferent input to this subpopulation from the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Our results indicate that pnVTAPNOC neurons become recruited during exposure to a range of acute stressor types, whereas the GABAergic input from the LH to this population is suppressed by predator odor stress, providing a mechanism for disinhibition of these neurons. These findings suggest that this N/OFQ population in the pnVTA could act as a critical bridge between stress and motivation through interactions with upstream hypothalamic circuitry.

">The precision of hippocampal representations predicts incremental value-learning across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Correctly assigning value to different options and leveraging this information to guide choice is a cornerstone of adaptive decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL) has provided a computational framework to study this process, and neural signals linked to RL have been identified in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. More recently, hippocampal contributions to this kind of value-learning have been proposed, at least under some conditions. Here, we test whether the hippocampus provides a signal of the option's identity that aids in credit assignment when learning about several perceptually similar items, and evaluate how this process differs across the lifespan. A sample of 251 younger and older adults, including a subset (n = 76) with simultaneous fMRI, completed an RL task in which they learned the value of four houses through trial-and-error. Older adults showed decreased choice accuracy, accompanied by reduced neural signaling of value at choice but not feedback. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that the precision with which choice options were represented in the posterior hippocampus during choice predicted accurate decisions across age groups. Interestingly, despite previous evidence for neural de-differentiation in older adults, we found no support for a "blurring" of these stimulus representations in older adults. Rather, we observed reduced connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and the medial PFC in older adults, and this connectivity correlated with choice consistency. Taken together, these findings identify a hippocampal contribution to incremental value learning, and that reductions in incremental value learning in older adults are associated with the reduced transfer of information between the hippocampus and mPFC, rather than the precision of the information in the hippocampus itself.

">Autism-associated Scn2a haploinsufficiency disrupts in vivo dendritic signaling and impairs flexible decision-making</a></h4>

              
                SCN2A is a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorder. Loss-of-function mutations in Scn2a reduce dendritic excitability in neocortical pyramidal cells. However, the impact of Scn2a haploinsufficiency on dendritic signaling in vivo, particularly during behavior, is unknown. In this study, we used two-photon microscopy to image dendritic calcium transients in deep layer pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. Scn2a+/- mice had diminished coupling between apical and proximal dendritic compartments. Pyramidal tract neurons had abnormal event rates, while intratelencephalic neurons had compartment-specific alterations indicative of diminished dendritic integration. In a matching pennies task, Scn2a+/- mice were inflexible in the face of changing competitive pressure. Apical dendritic tuft in IT neurons typically encoded reward and strategy, but these task-specific representations were absent in Scn2a+/- mice. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that Scn2a haploinsufficiency weakens dendritic integration in vivo and disrupts the dendritic encoding of decision variables, potentially contributing to the cognitive rigidity in autism spectrum disorder.
