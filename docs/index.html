              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Methods to study adult hippocampal neurogenesis in humans and across the phylogeny</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus hosts the continuous addition of new neurons throughout life—a phenomenon named adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Here we revisit the occurrence of AHN in more than 110 mammalian species, including humans, and discuss the further validation of these data by single-cell RNAseq and other alternative techniques. In this regard, our recent studies have addressed the long-standing controversy in the field, namely whether cells positive for AHN markers are present in the adult human dentate gyrus (DG). Here we review how we developed a tightly controlled methodology, based on the use of high-quality brain samples (characterized by short postmortem delays and ≤24 h of fixation in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde), to address human AHN. We review that the detection of AHN markers in samples fixed for 24 h required mild antigen retrieval and chemical elimination of autofluorescence. However, these steps were not necessary for samples subjected to shorter fixation periods. Moreover, the detection of labile epitopes (such as Nestin) in the human hippocampus required the use of mild detergents. The application of this strictly controlled methodology allowed reconstruction of the entire AHN process, thus revealing the presence of neural stem cells, proliferative progenitors, neuroblasts, and immature neurons at distinct stages of differentiation in the human DG. The data reviewed here demonstrate that methodology is of utmost importance when studying AHN by means of distinct techniques across the phylogenetic scale. In this regard, we summarize the major findings made by our group that emphasize that overlooking fundamental technical principles might have consequences for any given research field.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A conditional strategy for cell-type specific labeling of endogenous excitatory synapses in Drosophila reveals subsynaptic architecture</a></h4>

              
                Chemical neurotransmission occurs at specialized contacts where presynaptic neurotransmitter release machinery apposes clusters of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors and signaling molecules. A series of elegantly complex events underlies the recruitment of pre- and postsynaptic proteins to sites of neuronal connection and enables the correct three-dimensional synaptic organization that underlies circuit processing and computation. To better study the developmental events of synaptogenesis in individual neurons, we need cell-type specific strategies to visualize the individual proteins at their endogenous levels at synapses. Though such strategies exist for a variety of presynaptic proteins, postsynaptic proteins remain less studied due to a paucity of reagents that allow visualization of endogenous individual postsynapses in a cell-type specific manner. To study excitatory postsynapses, we engineered dlg1[4K], a conditional, epitope-tagged marker of the excitatory postsynaptic density in Drosophila. In combination with binary expression systems, dlg1[4K] effectively labels postsynaptic regions at both peripheral neuromuscular and central synapses in larvae and adults. Using dlg1[4K], we find that distinct rules govern the postsynaptic organization of different adult neuron classes, that multiple binary expression systems can concurrently label pre- and postsynaptic regions of synapses in a cell-type-specific manner, and for the first time, visualize neuronal DLG1 at the neuromuscular junction. These results validate a novel strategy for conditional postsynaptic labeling without the caveats of overexpression and demonstrate new principles of subsynaptic organization. The use of dlg1[4K] marks a notable advancement in studying cell-type specific synaptic organization in Drosophila and the first example of a general postsynaptic marker to complement existing presynaptic strategies.

	<p>Behavioural Activation (BA) is associated with a substantial evidence base for treatment of acute unipolar depression, and has promise as an easily disseminable psychological intervention for bipolar depression. Using a randomised multiple baseline case series design we examined the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted version of BA in a U.K. outpatient sample of 12 adults with acute bipolar depression. Participants were allocated at random to a 3&amp;amp;ndash;8 week wait period before being offered up to 20 sessions of BA. They completed outcome measures at intake, pre- and post-treatment and weekly symptom measures across the study period. Retention in therapy was high (11/12 participants completed the target minimum number of sessions), and all participants returning acceptability measures reported high levels of satisfaction with the intervention. No therapy-related serious adverse events were reported, nor were there exacerbations in manic symptoms that were judged to be a result of the intervention. The pattern of change on outcome measures is consistent with the potential for clinical benefit; six of the nine participants with a stable baseline showed clinically significant improvement on the primary outcome measure. The findings suggest adapted BA for bipolar depression is a feasible and acceptable approach that merits further investigation.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The approval process for MRI safety of implants includes physical observations and an experimental evaluation in artificial settings to simulate the in vivo effect. This contains the observation of temperature changes and artificial current generation by the magnetic field. From these findings, the safety of an implant and its effect on the patient can be estimated. MRI safety is based on an in vivo evaluation of adverse events after the approval process, but an actual analysis of the effect on different tissues is not followed. The effect of MRI scanning in cochlea implantees on their residual hearing as the correlate of the hair cell function is so far unknown, therefore the aim of the present study was to observe the effect of 3 T MRI on the residual hearing of cochlea implantees. Material and Methods: In this prospective study, we performed a 3 T MRI T2 2D MS Drive sequence in eight cochlea-implanted ears. Before and after the MRI scan, a bone conduction pure tone audiogram (BC PTA) was performed. All cochlea implantees had a pre-scanning threshold of low frequency residual hearing between 20 dB and 65 dB. Results: Low frequency mean residual hearing was not affected by the 3 T T2 2D MS Drive sequence. We observed a pre-scanning threshold at 250 Hz of 42.9 (SD 3.9) dB and for 500 Hz 57.1 (SD 6.4) dB. Post-scanning BC PTA was for 250 Hz 42.1 (SD 3.9) dB and for 500 Hz 57.1 (SD 5.7) dB. Conclusion: 3 T MRI scanning has no significant functional effect on the hair cells in cochlea implantees in low frequencies with a T2 2D MS Drive sequence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcriptional Profile of the Developing Subthalamic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small, excitatory nucleus that regulates the output of basal ganglia motor circuits. The functions of the STN and its role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease are now well established. However, some basic characteristics like the developmental origin and molecular phenotype of neuronal subpopulations are still being debated. The classical model of forebrain development attributed the origin of STN within the diencephalon. Recent studies of gene expression patterns exposed shortcomings of the classical model. To accommodate these findings, the prosomeric model was developed. In this concept, STN develops within the hypothalamic primordium, which is no longer a part of the diencephalic primordium. This concept is further supported by the expression patterns of many transcription factors. It is interesting to note that many transcription factors involved in the development of the STN are also involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, the study of neurodevelopmental disorders could provide us with valuable information on the roles of these transcription factors in the development and maintenance of STN phenotype. In this review, we summarize historical theories about the developmental origin of the STN and interpret the gene expression data within the prosomeric conceptual framework. Finally, we discuss the importance of neurodevelopmental disorders for the development of the STN and its potential role in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Cell population dynamics in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Remaining unknowns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus. The distinct developmental steps in the course of adult neurogenesis, including NSC activation, expansion, and neuronal integration, are increasingly well characterized down to the molecular level. However, substantial gaps remain in our knowledge about regulators and mechanisms involved in this biological process. This review highlights three long-standing unknowns. First, we discuss potency and identity of NSCs and the quest for a unifying model of short- and long-term self-renewal dynamics. Next, we examine cell death, specifically focusing on the early demise of newborn cells. Then, we outline the current knowledge on cell integration dynamics, discussing which (if any) neurons are replaced by newly added neurons in the hippocampal circuits. For each of these unknowns, we summarize the trajectory of studies leading to the current state of knowledge. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to fill the remaining gaps by taking advantage of novel technology to reveal currently hidden secrets in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Altered expression response upon repeated gene repression in single yeast cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lea Schuh, Igor Kukhtevich, Poonam Bheda, Melanie Schulz, Maria Bordukova, Robert Schneider, Carsten Marr</p>

Cells must continuously adjust to changing environments and, thus, have evolved mechanisms allowing them to respond to repeated stimuli. While faster gene induction upon a repeated stimulus is known as reinduction memory, responses to repeated repression have been less studied so far. Here, we studied gene repression across repeated carbon source shifts in over 1,500 single <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells. By monitoring the expression of a carbon source-responsive gene, galactokinase 1 (<i>Gal1</i>), and fitting a mathematical model to the single-cell data, we observed a faster response upon repeated repressions at the population level. Exploiting our single-cell data and quantitative modeling approach, we discovered that the faster response is mediated by a shortened repression response delay, the estimated time between carbon source shift and Gal1 protein production termination. Interestingly, we can exclude two alternative hypotheses, i) stronger dilution because of e.g., increased proliferation, and ii) a larger fraction of repressing cells upon repeated repressions. Collectively, our study provides a quantitative description of repression kinetics in single cells and allows us to pinpoint potential mechanisms underlying a faster response upon repeated repression. The computational results of our study can serve as the starting point for experimental follow-up studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Widespread expression of the ancient HERV-K (HML-2) provirus group in normal human tissues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aidan Burn, Farrah Roy, Michael Freeman, John M. Coffin</p>

Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) transcripts are known to be highly expressed in cancers, yet their activity in nondiseased tissue is largely unknown. Using the GTEx RNA-seq dataset from normal tissue sampled at autopsy, we characterized individual expression of the recent HERV-K (HML-2) provirus group across 13,000 different samples of 54 different tissues from 948 individuals. HML-2 transcripts could be identified in every tissue sampled and were elevated in the cerebellum, pituitary, testis, and thyroid. A total of 37 different individual proviruses were expressed in 1 or more tissues, representing all 3 LTR5 subgroups. Nine proviruses were identified as having long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription, 7 of which belonged to the most recent LTR5HS subgroup. Proviruses of different subgroups displayed a bias in tissue expression, which may be associated with differences in transcription factor binding sites in their LTRs. Provirus expression was greater in evolutionarily older proviruses with an earliest shared ancestor of gorilla or older. HML-2 expression was significantly affected by biological sex in 1 tissue, while age and timing of death (Hardy score) had little effect. Proviruses containing intact <i>gag</i>, <i>pro</i>, and <i>env</i> open reading frames (ORFs) were expressed in the dataset, with almost every tissue measured potentially expressing at least 1 intact ORF (<i>gag</i>).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interplay between COVID-19 vaccines and social measures for ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided the clearest path forward to eliminate community spread and thus end the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? Methods: We develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number Rt and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Results: Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. We then investigate the threat of localized outbreaks in low-vaccinated populations that have removed all social intervention mandates, and show that such populations could remain highly susceptible to major outbreaks particularly in the face of more easily transmissible variants.  Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extant social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of chewing-betel habits on blood glucose levels in the Karo ethnic community, Karo district [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The chewing Betel habit is a hereditary tradition from the ancestors of the Batak-Karo tribe, Indonesia. Karo people believe that chewing betel habit is their unifier. The chewing-betel habit process begins with concocting a mixture of ingredients such as betel leaf, lime, gambier, areca nut, and with or without tobacco addition, then chewed slowly. Our previous study showed that gambier extracts (Uncaria gambier Roxb), can reduce blood glucose levels(BGL) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)patients. This study aimed to analyze whether the habit of chewing betel can affect BGL in the Karo ethnic community in the Karo district. Methods: In total, 48 participants from the Karo community were divided into 4 groups (n=12 per group), namely: I. non-T2DM participants without chewing betel habits; II. non-T2DM participants with chewing-betel habit; III. T2DM participants without chewing-betel habit and IV. T2DM participants with chewing-betel habit. The sampling technique was consecutive sampling. The data were collected by interviews and blood sampling (fasting and 2 hours postprandial (2hPP)). The collected data were analyzed by paired t-test, Independent sample t-test, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney with a significance level of p-value <0.05. Results: This study showed that fasting BGL condition in group-I compared to group II (84.33±12.32 vs 81.00±4.84) mg/dl and group-III compared to group-IV (196.25±104.81 vs 150.00±42.45) mg/dl had no significant difference. Also, the BGL of 2hPP condition in group-I compared to group-II (111.25 ±22.62 vs 108.33±18.99) mg/dl, and group-III compared to group-IV (314.92±128.97 vs 229.25±58.26) mg/dl, in statistically there was no difference (p>0.05). Although the data showed that group-III was higher than group-IV. Conclusions: This study concludes that with or without chewing-betel habits affect blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes subjects (Groups III and IV).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptualizing university students’ food choices based on theory of planned behavior [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several students use hostel facilities offered by their colleges and universities while pursuing higher education. A crucial change is witnessed in their food habits during their stay at the campus, which is vastly different from their home experience. Method: The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand food choices of university students, while following the qualitative research methodology and the phenomenological approach. The snowball sampling method is applied to select participants for the study. We selected twenty-six undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing programs in technical and health science from a private university at Udupi with residence in the university campus for two to four years. Interviews with candidates were conducted online and audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results: The transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to obtain themes, which were then conceptualized to develop the model based on theory of planned behavior. The duration of their stay in campus allowed students to gain a perspective on the food events and the food they consumed at university dining facility (UDF) guided by factors, such as taste, price, availability of time(during academic activity), accessibility to healthy food, academic stress and lack of knowledge on nutrition. Two factors emerged from the interviews, one, there was no display in the dining facility about the nutritional value of the food served; and, second, students preferred to dine out on unhealthy food rather than at the university because food from outside the campus , even though unhealthy, was easier on the pocket. Conclusion: The study provides insights into the role of UDF in serving healthy and nutritional food to students for better health and improved academic performance. This work brings to light the relationship between students’ food choices and their impact on academic performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HormonomicsDB: a novel workflow for the untargeted analysis of plant growth regulators and hormones [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolomics is the simultaneous determination of all metabolites in a system. Despite significant advances in the field, compound identification remains a challenge. Prior knowledge of the compound classes of interest can improve metabolite identification. Hormones are a small signaling molecules, which function in coordination to direct all aspects of development, function and reproduction in living systems and which also pose challenges as environmental contaminants. Hormones are inherently present at low levels in tissues, stored in many forms and mobilized rapidly in response to a stimulus making them difficult to measure, identify and quantify.   Methods: An in-depth literature review was performed for known hormones, their precursors, metabolites and conjugates in plants to generate the database and an RShiny App developed to enable web-based searches against the database. An accompanying liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) protocol was developed with retention time prediction in Retip. A meta-analysis of 14 plant metabolomics studies was used for validation.   Results: We developed HormonomicsDB, a tool which can be used to query an untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) dataset against a database of more than 200 known hormones, their precursors and metabolites. The protocol encompasses sample preparation, analysis, data processing and hormone annotation and is designed to minimize degradation of labile hormones. The plant system is used a model to illustrate the workflow and data acquisition and interpretation. Analytical conditions were standardized to a 30 min analysis time using a common solvent system to allow for easy transfer by a researcher with basic knowledge of MS. Incorporation of synthetic biotransformations enables prediction of novel metabolites.   Conclusions: HormonomicsDB is suitable for use on any LC-MS based system with compatible column and buffer system, enables the characterization of the known hormonome across a diversity of samples, and hypothesis generation to reveal knew insights into hormone signaling networks.

                Introduction: Sleep is important in humans, and it is affected by lifestyle changes. Improper sleep leads to serious physiological problems and disorders that occurs in human brain/scalp. These physiological changes and electrical activity of the human brain are recorded as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This paper describes the detection of a major sleep disorder \textit{i.e.}, sleep apnea (SA).  Methods: In this paper, sleep apnea is measured using various artifacts taken from the subjects. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract characteristics from an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal and to detect sleep. This is used to determine whether a person has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or central sleep apnea (CSA). The wavelet technique is used to split the EEG signal into five frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma.  Results: For these five frequency bands, the mean, standard deviation, variance, maximum, minimum, and energy are computed.  Discussion: A sleep problem is detected based on these characteristics.

                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinary discussion. It provides contradictory evidence on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, also which are main reasons for the use of CT and what efforts in psychiatry have been made to reduce, replace and refine it.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quality of life of Jordanian menopausal working and retired women and its associated factors: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Life expectancy of Jordanian women has increased, indicating that the number of women entering menopausal age, during the prime of their working life, will also increase. Therefore, assessments of the quality of life (QoL) of working and retired women and factors associated with overall wellbeing, are essential for the provision of quality services and care. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 200 Jordanian women between the ages of 45 to 60 years old.  The Utian QOL tool was used to assess the quality of life among menopausal women.  Multiple regressions were used to determine predictors for QoL for the whole sample and for each group of working and retired women. Results: The study shows that the total QoL for women was 77.5 ±14.4, with a significant difference (p=.023) in total QoL and the occupational domain (p=.003) between working and retired women. Employed women with fewer chronic diseases and using frequent preventive measures had a higher QoL compared to others. Conclusion: Working itself might be an important indicator for better a quality of life among menopausal women. Better working conditions and more attention from the health care providers for the menopausal changes and the preventive measures could enhance women’s perceived QoL in addition to increasing their productivity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare and often severe disease characterized by central nervous system-restricted inflammatory vasculitis on histopathology. Diagnosis requires brain biopsy for confirmation and is suggested prior to starting immunotherapy when feasible. However, emerging evidence suggests that other neuroinflammatory conditions may have a clinical and radiographic phenotype that mimics small vessel primary angiitis, at times with overlapping pathologic features as well. Such diagnoses, including anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease and central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, can be non-invasively diagnosed with serum antibody or genetic testing that would prompt different monitoring and treatment paradigms. To determine the ultimate diagnosis of patients who were suspected prior to biopsy to have small vessel primary angiitis, we reviewed the clinical, radiographic and pathological features of a cohort of patients at a single center undergoing brain biopsy for non-oncologic indications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical data was retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Pathology and neuroimaging review was conducted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 21 patients over a 19-year time-period, of whom 14 (66.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with entities other than small vessel primary angiitis that would have obviated the need for brain biopsy. Diagnoses included anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease (n=9), central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n=3), anti-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor encephalitis (n=1), and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (n=1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights the importance of pursuing now readily available non-invasive testing for mimicking diagnoses before performing a brain biopsy for suspected small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system.</p>

                Early zygotic transcription in Drosophila embryos takes place entirely during the short S phases of nuclear division cycles. Cho et al. demonstrate that rapid onset of transcription depends on DNA replication in each cycle. Delayed initiation of transcription allows unimpeded elongation of nascent transcripts behind advancing replication forks.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">SMC complexes can traverse physical roadblocks bigger than their ring size</a></h4>

              
                If and how SMC proteins perform DNA loop extrusion on protein-decorated DNA is an ongoing debate. Pradhan et al. show that DNA-binding proteins do not pose barriers to DNA-loop-extruding SMC complexes. Roadblocks larger than the SMC ring size cannot inhibit loop extrusion, which points to a non-topological loop extrusion mechanism.

                Septins are involved in host-pathogen interactions. Aigal et al. show that septins are recruited to the attachment site of P. aeruginosa, which utilizes a surface lectin to bind to the host membrane, resulting in attachment, membrane deformation, and entry. Septins can prevent this invasion process by locally increasing membrane rigidity.

                IL-17RA is the shared co-receptor for several IL-17 family members. Goepfert et al. show that IL-17 induces IL-17RA dimerization, which then drives the formation of a 2:2:2 hexameric signaling assembly with IL-17RC. Furthermore, IL-17RA dimerization potentiates IL-17 signaling in immortalized primary human keratinocytes, compared with cells expressing a dimerization-defective IL-17RA variant.

Mechanistically, they find that the chaperone SCO1 senses copper and activates AMPK by forming the SCO1-LKB1-AMPK complex.

                Tsuneki et al. reveal that central actions of orexin are required for preventing NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under diet-induced obese conditions. In this process, orexin attenuates hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated inflammation via the autonomic nervous system in addition to causing the anti-obese effect via promotion of physical activity.

                Physical and psychological stressors activate neuroendocrine secretion of corticosteroid. Noradrenaline circuits are critical to the neuroendocrine response to physical but not psychological stress. Jiang et al. show that stress-induced corticosteroids decrease noradrenaline sensitivity in the brain, which suppresses the response to subsequent physical stressors but leaves the psychological stress response intact.

                Whether and how neurons can communicate stress to other neurons is poorly understood. Chung et al. demonstrate that oxidative stress in neurons leads to secretion of cell non-autonomous stress signaling protein. This protein, TAILS, induces neuronal resilience against cell stress in recipient cells in an SHH-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-invasive classification of macrophage polarisation by 2P-FLIM and machine learning</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we utilise fluorescence lifetime imaging of NAD(P)H-based cellular autofluorescence as a non-invasive modality to classify two contrasting states of human macrophages by proxy of their governing metabolic state. Macrophages derived from human blood-circulating monocytes were polarised using established protocols and metabolically challenged using small molecules to validate their responding metabolic actions in extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. Large field-of-view images of individual polarised macrophages were obtained using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). These were challenged in real time with small-molecule perturbations of metabolism during imaging. We uncovered FLIM parameters that are pronounced under the action of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), which strongly stratifies the phenotype of polarised human macrophages; however, this performance is impacted by donor variability when analysing the data at a single-cell level. The stratification and parameters emanating from a full field-of-view and single-cell FLIM approach serve as the basis for machine learning models. Applying a random forests model, we identify three strongly governing FLIM parameters, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC) value of 0.944 and out-of-bag (OBB) error rate of 16.67% when classifying human macrophages in a full field-of-view image. To conclude, 2P-FLIM with the integration of machine learning models is showed to be a powerful technique for analysis of both human macrophage metabolism and polarisation at full FoV and single-cell level.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural and thermodynamic analyses of the β-to-α transformation in RfaH reveal principles of fold-switching proteins</a></h4>

              
                The two-domain protein RfaH, a paralog of the universally conserved NusG/Spt5 transcription factors, is regulated by autoinhibition coupled to the reversible conformational switch of its 60-residue C-terminal KOW domain between an α-hairpin and a β-barrel. In contrast, NusG/Spt5-KOW domains only occur in the β-barrel state. To understand the principles underlying the drastic fold switch in RfaH, we elucidated the thermodynamic stability and the structural dynamics of two RfaH- and four NusG/Spt5-KOW domains by combining biophysical and structural biology methods. We find that the RfaH-KOW β-barrel is thermodynamically less stable than that of most NusG/Spt5-KOWs and we show that it is in equilibrium with a globally unfolded species, which, strikingly, contains two helical regions that prime the transition towards the α-hairpin. Our results suggest that transiently structured elements in the unfolded conformation might drive the global folding transition in metamorphic proteins in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lack of ownership of mobile phones could hinder the rollout of mHealth interventions in Africa</a></h4>

              
                Mobile Health interventions, which require ownership of mobile phones, are being investigated throughout Africa. We estimate the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 African countries, identify a relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic (HC), and quantify inequities in ownership. We investigate basic mobile phone (BPs) and smartphones (SPs): SPs can connect to the internet, BPs cannot. We use nationally representative data collected in 2017-2018 from 44,224 individuals in Round 7 of the Afrobarometer surveys. We use Bayesian Multilevel Logistic regression models for our analyses. We find 82% of individuals in the 33 countries own mobile phones: 42% BPs, 40% SPs. Individuals who live close to an HC have higher odds of ownership than those who do not (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.31, Bayesian 95% Highest Posterior Density [HPD] region: 1.24-1.39). Men, compared with women, have over twice the odds of ownership (aOR: 2.37, 95% HPD region: 1.96-2.84). Urban residents, compared with rural residents, have almost three times the odds (aOR: 2.66, 95% HPD region: 2.22-3.18) and, amongst mobile phone owners, nearly three times the odds of owning an SP (aOR: 2.67, 95% HPD region: 2.33-3.10). Ownership increases with age, peaks in 26-40 year olds, then decreases. Individuals under 30 are more likely to own an SP than a BP, older individuals more likely to own a BP than an SP. Probability of ownership decreases with the Lived Poverty Index; however, some of the poorest individuals own SPs. If the digital devices needed for mHealth interventions are not equally available within the population (which we have found is the current situation), rolling out mHealth interventions in Africa is likely to propagate already existing inequities in access to healthcare.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tissue-specific mitochondrial HIGD1C promotes oxygen sensitivity in carotid body chemoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian carotid body arterial chemoreceptors function as an early warning system for hypoxia, triggering acute life-saving arousal and cardiorespiratory reflexes. To serve this role, carotid body glomus cells are highly sensitive to decreases in oxygen availability. While the mitochondria and plasma membrane signaling proteins have been implicated in oxygen sensing by glomus cells, the mechanism underlying their mitochondrial sensitivity to hypoxia compared to other cells is unknown. Here, we identify HIGD1C, a novel hypoxia-inducible gene domain factor isoform, as an electron transport chain Complex IV-interacting protein that is almost exclusively expressed in the carotid body and is therefore not generally necessary for mitochondrial function. Importantly, HIGD1C is required for carotid body oxygen sensing and enhances Complex IV sensitivity to hypoxia. Thus, we propose that HIGD1C promotes exquisite oxygen sensing by the carotid body, illustrating how specialized mitochondria can be used as sentinels of metabolic stress to elicit essential adaptive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibited KdpFABC transitions into an E1 off-cycle state</a></h4>

              
                KdpFABC is a high-affinity prokaryotic K<sup>+</sup> uptake system that forms a functional chimera between a channel-like subunit (KdpA) and a P-type ATPase (KdpB). At high K<sup>+</sup> levels, KdpFABC needs to be inhibited to prevent excessive K<sup>+</sup> accumulation to the point of toxicity. This is achieved by a phosphorylation of the serine residue in the TGES<sub>162</sub> motif in the A domain of the pump subunit KdpB (KdpB<sub>S162-P</sub>). Here, we explore the structural basis of inhibition by KdpB<sub>S162</sub> phosphorylation by determining the conformational landscape of KdpFABC under inhibiting and non-inhibiting conditions. Under turnover conditions, we identified a new inhibited KdpFABC state that we termed E1P tight, which is not part of the canonical Post-Albers transport cycle of P-type ATPases. It likely represents the biochemically described stalled E1P state adopted by KdpFABC upon KdpB<sub>S162</sub> phosphorylation. The E1P tight state exhibits a compact fold of the three cytoplasmic domains and is likely adopted when the transition from high-energy E1P states to E2P states is unsuccessful. This study represents a structural characterization of a biologically relevant off-cycle state in the P-type ATPase family and supports the emerging discussion of P-type ATPase regulation by such states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arguments for the biological and predictive relevance of the proportional recovery rule</a></h4>

              
                The proportional recovery rule (PRR) posits that most stroke survivors can expect to reduce a fixed proportion of their motor impairment. As a statistical model, the PRR explicitly relates change scores to baseline values - an approach that arises in many scientific domains but has the potential to introduce artifacts and flawed conclusions. We describe approaches that can assess associations between baseline and changes from baseline while avoiding artifacts due either to mathematical coupling or regression to the mean. We also describe methods that can compare different biological models of recovery. Across several real datasets in stroke recovery, we find evidence for non-artifactual associations between baseline and change, and support for the PRR compared to alternative models. We also introduce a statistical perspective that can be used to assess future models. We conclude that the PRR remains a biologically relevant model of stroke recovery.

                Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a double-stranded DNA molecule found in various organisms, including humans. In the past few decades, the research on eccDNA has mainly focused on cancers and their associated diseases. Advancements in modern omics technologies have reinvigorated research on eccDNA and shed light on the role of these molecules in a range of diseases and normal cell phenotypes. In this review, we first summarize the formation of eccDNA and its modes of action in eukaryotic cells. We then outline eccDNA as a disease biomarker and reveal its regulatory mechanism. We finally discuss the future prospects of eccDNA, including basic research and clinical application. Thus, with the deepening of understanding and exploration of eccDNAs, they hold great promise in future biomedical research and clinical translational application.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial modeling reveals nuclear phosphorylation and subcellular shuttling of YAP upon drug-induced liver injury</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo signaling pathway controls cell proliferation and tissue regeneration via its transcriptional effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). The canonical pathway topology is characterized by sequential phosphorylation of kinases in the cytoplasm that defines the subcellular localization of YAP and TAZ. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling dynamics of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions are poorly understood. By implementing experimental in vitro data, partial differential equation modeling, as well as automated image analysis, we demonstrate that nuclear phosphorylation contributes to differences between YAP and TAZ localization in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment of hepatocyte-derived cells with hepatotoxic acetaminophen (APAP) induces a biphasic protein phosphorylation eventually leading to nuclear protein enrichment of YAP but not TAZ. APAP-dependent regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP shuttling is not an unspecific cellular response but relies on the sequential induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT, synonym: protein kinase B), as well as elevated nuclear interaction between YAP and AKT. Mouse experiments confirm this sequence of events illustrated by the expression of ROS-, AKT-, and YAP-specific gene signatures upon APAP administration. In summary, our data illustrate the importance of nuclear processes in the regulation of Hippo pathway activity. YAP and TAZ exhibit different shuttling dynamics, which explains distinct cellular responses of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A phenotype-based forward genetic screen identifies Dnajb6 as a sick sinus syndrome gene</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed the generation of a protein trap library made with the gene-break transposon (GBT) in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) that could be used to facilitate novel functional genome annotation towards understanding molecular underpinnings of human diseases (Ichino et al, 2020). Here, we report a significant application of this library for discovering essential genes for heart rhythm disorders such as sick sinus syndrome (SSS). SSS is a group of heart rhythm disorders caused by malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker. Partially owing to its aging-associated phenotypic manifestation and low expressivity, molecular mechanisms of SSS remain difficult to decipher. From 609 GBT lines screened, we generated a collection of 35 zebrafish insertional cardiac (ZIC) mutants in which each mutant traps a gene with cardiac expression. We further employed electrocardiographic measurements to screen these 35 ZIC lines and identified three GBT mutants with SSS-like phenotypes. More detailed functional studies on one of the arrhythmogenic mutants, <i>GBT411</i>, in both zebrafish and mouse models unveiled <i>Dnajb6</i> as a novel SSS causative gene with a unique expression pattern within the subpopulation of sinus node pacemaker cardiomyocytes that partially overlaps with the expression of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel 4 (Hcn4), supporting heterogeneity of the cardiac pacemaker cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Delineating the transcriptional landscape and clonal diversity of virus-specific CD4+ T cells during chronic viral infection</a></h4>

              
                CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic viral infection often acquire a dysfunctional phenotype that is characterized by a progressive loss in Th1 differentiation and function, as well as an upregulation of multiple co-inhibitory receptors. Conversely, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and particularly Tfh cells, gradually increase their production of IL-21 during chronic viral infection, which is critical to sustain humoral immunity and also effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Recent evidence further indicates that a memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population also develops in the face of persistent infection, although how the transcriptional landscape of this subset, along with the Th1 and Tfh cell subsets from chronic infection, differ from their acute infection counterparts remains unclear. Additionally, whether cell-intrinsic factors such as TCR usage influence CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fate commitment during chronic infection has not previously been studied. Herein, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) on virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice infected with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. We identify several transcriptionally distinct states among the Th1, Tfh, and memory-like T cell subsets that form at the peak of chronic infection, including the presence of a previously unrecognized Slamf7<sup>+</sup> subset with cytolytic features, and show that the relative distribution of these populations differs substantially between acute and persistent LCMV infection. Moreover, while the progeny of most T cell clones displays membership within each of these transcriptionally unique populations, overall supporting a one cell-multiple fate model, a small fraction of clones display a biased cell fate decision, suggesting that TCR usage may impact CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell development during chronic viral infection. Importantly, a comparative analysis further reveals both subset-specific and core gene expression programs that are differentially regulated between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to acute and chronic viral infection. Together, these data may serve as a useful framework and allow for a detailed interrogation into the clonal distribution and transcriptional circuits underlying CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation during chronic viral infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular programs of regional specification and neural stem cell fate progression in developing macaque telencephalon</a></h4>

              
                Early telencephalic development involves patterning of the distinct regions and fate specification of the neural stem cells (NSCs). These processes, mainly characterized in rodents, remain elusive in primates and thus our understanding of conserved and species-specific features. Here, we profiled 761,529 single-cell transcriptomes from multiple regions of the prenatal macaque telencephalon. We defined the molecular programs of the early organizing centers and their cross-talk with NSCs, finding primate-biased signaling active in the antero-ventral telencephalon. Regional transcriptomic divergences were evident at early states of neocortical NSC progression and in differentiated neurons and astrocytes, more than in intermediate transitions. Finally, we show that neuropsychiatric disease- and brain cancer-risk genes have putative early roles in the telencephalic organizers' activity and across cortical NSC progression.

                Soluble aggregates of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), often called oligomers, are believed to be principal drivers of neurotoxicity, spreading of pathology, and symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about their structures in human brain. A{beta} oligomers have been defined as aggregates found in supernatants following ultracentrifugation of aqueous extracts. We now report the unexpected presence of abundant A{beta} fibrils in high-speed supernatants from AD brains that were extracted by soaking in aqueous buffer. The fibrils did not appear to form during extract preparation, and their numbers by EM correlated with ELISA quantification of aggregated A{beta}42. Cryo-EM structures of A{beta} fibrils from aqueous extracts were identical to those from sarkosyl-insoluble AD brain homogenates. The fibrils in aqueous extracts were immunolabeled by lecanemab, an A{beta} aggregate-directed antibody reported to improve cognitive outcomes in AD. We conclude that A{beta} fibrils are abundant in aqueous extracts from AD brains and have the same structures as those from amyloid plaques. These findings have implications for understanding the nature of A{beta} oligomers and for designing oligomer-preferring therapeutic antibodies.

                Analogue signaling is the phenomenon by which subthreshold activity in the dendrites and soma of neurons is transmitted down the axon. Although it has been demonstrated in many different preparations, the extent and physiological role of analogue signaling for subthreshold, somatodendritic spontaneous activity have not been studied in detail. In order to address this we performed simultaneous, whole-cell recordings of the soma and axon of young cerebellar interneurons. We show that the somatodendritic spontaneous glutamatergic events are transmitted down the axon for significant distances and produce a measurable change in the voltage of the axonal varicosities. By combining electrophysiological recordings in the culture preparation and in slices, we further show that the analogously transmitted EPSPs can affect GABA release significantly, and that this effect is not due to a modification in the axonal AP shape or amplitude.

                Previous studies in human patients and rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have established neuroprotection of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) by physical exercise, but the precise origin of this neuroprotective effect has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we tested a hypothesis that enhanced activity of DA neurons in SNC results in neuroprotection using the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection model in mice. To increase activity of DA neurons chronically and specifically, we injected an adeno-associated viral vector carrying a step-function luminopsin (SFL) - a fusion protein of light-emitting Gaussia luciferase and light-sensing step-function channelrhodopsin 2 - into SNC ipsilateral to 6-OHDA using the pan-neuronal human synapsin I promoter or the Cre-lox system in transgenic mice expressing the recombinase under control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. Upon application of SFL substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), the luciferase moiety of luminopsin emits bioluminescence which in turn activate the opsin moiety. Daily injection of CTZ for 4 weeks ameliorated a stereotypical behavior, namely ipsiversive rotations, induced by unilateral 6-OHDA. In addition, postmortem immunohistochemistry against TH revealed less severe neurodegeneration of DA neurons compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Furthermore, when mice were pretreated with ANA-12, a selective antagonist for tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), the behavioral improvement and neuroprotective effect were diminished. These results suggest that increased neuronal activity of DA neurons provides neuroprotection against 6-OHDA injury and alleviates its symptoms through the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB pathway.

                Auditory roughness resulting of fast temporal beatings is often studied by summing two pure tones with close frequencies. Interestingly, the tactile counterpart of auditory roughness can be provided through touch with vibrotactile actuators. However, whether auditory roughness could also be perceived through touch, and whether they exhibit similar characteristics is unclear. Here, auditory roughness perception and its tactile counterpart were evaluated using similar two pure tones stimuli. Results revealed similar roughness curves in both modalities suggesting similar sensory processing. This study attests of the relevance of such a paradigm for investing auditory and tactile roughness in a multisensory fashion.

                Visual field maps in human early extrastriate areas (V2 and V3) are traditionally thought to form mirror-image representations which surround the primary visual cortex (V1). According to this scheme, V2 and V3 form nearly symmetrical halves with respect to the calcarine sulcus, with the dorsal halves representing the lower contralateral quadrants, and the ventral halves representing the upper contralateral quadrants. This arrangement is considered to be consistent across individuals, and thus predictable with reasonable accuracy using templates. However, data that deviate from this expected pattern have been observed, but mainly treated as artifactual. Here we systematically investigate individual variability in the visual field maps of human early visual cortex using the large-scale 7T Human Connectome Project (HCP) retinotopy dataset. Our results demonstrate substantial and principled inter-individual variability in early visual retinotopy. Visual field representation in the dorsal portions of V2 and V3 were more variable than their ventral counterparts, including substantial departures from the expected mirror-symmetrical patterns. Surprisingly, only one-third of individuals had maps that conformed to the expected pattern. In addition, retinotopic maps in the left hemisphere were more variable than those in the right hemisphere. Our findings challenge the current view that inter-individual variability in early extrastriate cortex is negligible, and that the dorsal portions of V2 and V3 are roughly mirror images of their ventral counterparts.

                We introduce HumanBrainAtlas, an initiative to construct a highly detailed, open-access atlas of the living human brain that combines high-resolution in vivo MR imaging and detailed segmentations previously possible only in histological preparations. Here, we present and evaluate the first step of this initiative: a comprehensive dataset of two healthy male volunteers reconstructed to a 0.25 mm3 isotropic resolution for T1w, T2w and DWI contrasts. Multiple high-resolution acquisitions were collected for each contrast and each participant, followed by averaging using symmetric group-wise normalisation (Advanced Normalisation Tools). The resulting image quality permits structural parcellations rivalling histology-based atlases, while maintaining the advantages of in vivo MRI. For example, components of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus - difficult or often impossible to identify using standard MRI protocols, can be identified within the present data. Our data are virtually distortion free, fully 3D, and compatible with existing in vivo Neuroimaging analysis tools. The dataset is suitable for teaching and is publicly available via our website (www.hba.neura.edu.au), which also provides data processing scripts. Instead of focusing on coordinates in an averaged brain space, our approach focuses on providing an example segmentation at great detail in the high quality individual brain, this serves as an illustration on what features contrasts and relations can be used to interpret MRI datasets, in research, clinical and education settings.

                The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and immune activation are both pathological events related to the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD). The PD-associated immune response involves both brain and peripheral immune cells, although little is known about the immune proteins relevant for such response. CD163 is a scavenger receptor specifically expressed in the monocytic lineage, but normally not in microglia. Therefore, the presence of CD163 positive cells into the brain in PD rodent models and in PD patients suggest a monocytic infiltration or otherwise ectopic CD163 expression. In addition, changes in CD163 expression profiles observed in PD patients might indicate a role for CD163-expressing cells in the disease. To elucidate the relevance of the CD163 receptor in the a-syn-induced immune events in PD and associated degeneration we injected murine a-syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF), or monomeric a-syn into the striatum of CD163 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. Injection of a-syn PFF in CD163KO females led to impaired early immune responses as revealed by the lack of ability to upregulate MHCII, CD68, GFAP, and promote CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration after a-syn PFF injection. An early and long-lasting sensorimotor impairment was observed in a-syn PFF CD163KO males but not in the females. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CD163 deletion induced phenotypic changes of macrophages and microglia in the brain that potentially impact the motor behavior and neuronal health induced by a-syn in a sex-dependent manner. After 6 months, CD163KO females showed an exacerbated immune response and a-syn pathology associated with autophagic defects, which ultimately led to increased dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Overall, our results support a novel sex-dimorphic neuroprotective role for CD163 in the a-syn-induced neuropathology and immune response.

                Recent studies show significant similarities between the representations humans and deep neural networks (DNNs) generate for faces. However, two critical aspects of human face recognition are overlooked by these networks. First, human face recognition is mostly concerned with familiar faces, which are encoded by visual and semantic information, while current DNNs solely rely on visual information. Second, humans represent familiar faces in memory, but representational similarities with DNNs were only investigated for human perception. To address this gap, we combined visual (VGG-16), visual-semantic (CLIP), and natural language processing (NLP) DNNs to predict human representations of familiar faces in perception and memory. The visual-semantic network substantially improved predictions beyond the visual network, revealing a new visual-semantic representation in human perception and memory. The NLP network further improved predictions of human representations in memory. Thus, a complete account of human face recognition should go beyond vision and incorporate visual-semantic, and semantic representations.

                Adolescent cocaine exposure (ACE) increases the risk of suffering psychiatric disorders including anxiety in later life, which is a big public health concern with limited treating options. Consistent with our previous study, we found that ACE mice exhibited obvious anxiety-like behaviors in their adulthood, which was efficiently suppressed by electro-acupuncture (EA) at acupoints of Baihui (GV 20) and Yintang (GV 29) with stimulus of a mixed frequency of 2/100 Hz for 28 withdrawal days. In the claustrum (CL) of ACE mice, more CaMKII-positive neurons (CaMKIICL) were activated, accompanied with increased expression of dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) on them (D1RCaMKII) and phosphorylated-EKR (p-ERK), p-CREB, and BDNF protein levels. Local blockade of CL D1R by SCH23390 or specific knockdown of CL D1RCaMKII by virus suppressed both anxiety-like behaviors and CaMKIICL activity in ACE mice of adulthood, indicating the critical role of CL D1RCaMKII in ACE-enhanced anxiety. Importantly, EA treatment suppressed CaMKIICL activity and D1RCaMKII staining, along with attenuated levels of p-CREB and BDNF in CL of ACE mice. Collectively, our study for the first time identified a novel molecular mechanism of CL D1RCaMKII and CaMKIICL activity in the process of ACE-increased anxiety in adulthood. Further, by targeting CL D1RCaMKII, EA at acupoints of GV 20 and GV 29 serves as preventative strategy to adolescent drugs exposure-induced anxiety in the later life.

                Tau phosphorylation and aggregation is the final common pathway for neuronal toxicity across multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. We have previously shown that the fetal brain expresses high levels of phosphorylated tau, and even tau aggregates, without apparent toxic effects. The mechanisms for this remarkable resilience, however, remain unclear. In order to identify potential mediators of this resilience, we used bead-linked total tau immunoprecipitation in human fetal, adult, and Alzheimer disease brains. We then used heterologous transfection in HEK 293T cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation, mass photometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to further characterize the interaction of tau with one of our top hits, 14-3-3-beta. We found significant differences between the tau interactome in fetal and AD brain, with little difference between adult and AD. There were significant differences in tau interaction with 14-3-3 family proteins between fetal and AD brain. We then determined that the 14-3-3 isoform with the highest difference, 14-3-3-beta, preferentially interacts with 4R tau in vitro, forming a complex consisting of two 14-3-3-beta, and one tau molecule. NMR studies using 15N-labeled phosphorylated tau showed that the binding site for 14-3-3 was in the microtubule binding region of tau, which is truncated in 3R tau through the exclusion of exon 10. Our findings suggest that there are marked differences between the phospho-tau interactome in fetal and Alzheimer disease brain, including differences in interaction with the critical 14-3-3 family of protein chaperones, which may explain, in part, the resilience of fetal brain to tau toxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A context-dependent switch from sensing to feeling in the primate amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The skin transmits affective signals that integrate into our social vocabulary. As the socio-affective aspects of touch are likely processed in the amygdala, we compared neural responses to social grooming and gentle airflow recorded from the amygdala and the primary somatosensory cortex of non-human primates. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex responded to both types of tactile stimuli. In the amygdala, however, neurons did not respond to individual grooming sweeps even though grooming elicited autonomic states indicative of positive affect. Instead, many showed changes in baseline firing rates that persisted throughout the grooming bout. Such baseline fluctuations were attributed to social context because the presence of the groomer alone could account for the observed changes in baseline activity. It appears, therefore, that during grooming, the amygdala stops responding to external inputs on a short time scale but remains responsive to social context (or the associated affective states) on longer time scales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Weekly dance training over eight months reduces depression and correlates with fMRI brain signals in subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG) for people with Parkinson's Disease: An observational study</a></h4>

              
                Depression affects 280 million people globally and is considered a prodromal feature for increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD). With age-related neurodegeneration on the rise, it's important to consider non-invasive, inexpensive interventions such as dance. Dance has emerged as a complementary treatment that may support adaptive neuroplasticity while diminishing motor and non-motor symptoms including depression. Although dance has been shown to impact brain structures and functions with improvements in motor and psychological symptoms, the neural mechanisms underlying depression/mood remain elusive. Our observational study tracks the relationship between depression scores and functional neuroimaging measures for subgenual cingulate gyrus (SCG). While learning choreography over an 8-month period, 34 dancers [23 people with PD] completed GDS questionnaires before and after their community dance classes. Seventeen of these dancers had BOLD fMRI scans conducted using learning-related protocols to examine underlying neural mechanisms for moving to music over 4 times points of learning. A significant decrease in depression scores correlated with a reduced BOLD signal from SCG, a putative node in the neural network of depression. Conclusions: This is the first study to clearly find a correlation with a neural substrate involved in mood changes as a function of dance for PD. Not only do the results contribute to understanding neural mechanisms involved in adaptive plasticity with a learning task, but they also uncover reduced activity within SCG during longitudinal therapeutic dance interventions. These results are especially illuminating since SCG is a controversial target in deep brain stimulation (DBS) used in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

                Aging is associated with loss of circadian immune responses and circadian gene transcription in peripheral macrophages. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, also show diurnal rhythmicity in regulating local immune responses and synaptic remodeling. To investigate the interaction between aging and microglial circadian rhythmicity, we examined mice deficient in the core clock transcription factor, BMAL1. Aging Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice demonstrated accelerated cognitive decline in association with suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation and increases in immature dendritic spines. C1q deposition at synapses and synaptic engulfment were significantly decreased in aging Bmal1-deficient microglia, suggesting that BMAL1 plays a role in regulating synaptic pruning in aging. In addition to accelerated age-associated hippocampal deficits, Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice also showed deficits in the sleep-wake cycle with increased wakefulness across light and dark phases. These results highlight an essential role of microglial BMAL1 in maintenance of synapse homeostasis in the aging brain.

                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. The advent of approved treatments for this devastating condition has significantly changed SMA patients' life expectancy and quality of life. Nevertheless, these are not without limitations, and research efforts are underway to develop new approaches to be used alone and in combination, to ensure improved and long-lasting benefits for SMA patients. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) are emerging as druggable epigenetic targets, with several small molecule PRMT inhibitors already in clinical trial stage. From a screen of highly potent and selective next generation epigenetic small molecules, we have identified MS023, a potent and selective type I PRMT inhibitor, able to promote SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and increase SMN protein levels in preclinical SMA model, by inhibiting the binding of splicing factor hnRNPA1 to SMN2 pre-mRNA. Treatment of SMA mice with MS023 results in amelioration of the disease phenotype, with strong synergistic amplification of the positive effect when delivered in combination with the SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis revealed that MS023 treatment has very minimal off-target effects and that the added benefit of the combination therapy is mainly attributable to targeting neuroinflammation. Our study warrants further clinical investigation of PRMT inhibition both as a stand-alone and add-on therapy for SMA patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding surprise by retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                The efficient coding hypothesis posits that early sensory neurons transmit maximal information about sensory stimuli, given internal constraints. A central prediction of this theory is that neurons should preferentially encode stimuli that are most surprising. Previous studies suggest this may be the case in early visual areas, where many neurons respond strongly to rare or surprising stimuli. For example, previous research showed that when presented with a rhythmic sequence of full-field flashes, many retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) respond strongly at the instance the flash sequence stops, and when another flash would be expected. This phenomenon is called the `omitted stimulus response'. However, it is not known whether the responses of these cells varies in a graded way depending on the level of stimulus surprise. To investigate this, we presented retinal neurons with extended sequences of stochastic flashes. With this stimulus, the surprise associated with a particular flash/silence, could be quantified analytically, and varied in a graded manner depending on the previous sequences of flashes and silences. Interestingly, we found that RGC responses could be well explained by a simple normative model, which described how they optimally combined their prior expectations and recent stimulus history, so as to encode surprise. Further, much of the diversity in RGC responses could be explained by the model, due to the different prior expectations that different neurons had about the stimulus statistics. These results suggest that even as early as the retina many cells encode surprise, relative to their own, internally generated expectations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Local Hebbian Rule Based Model of Invariant Object Representation and Classification.</a></h4>

              
                Our recognition of an object is consistent across conditions, unaffected by motion, perspective, rotation, and corruption. This robustness is thought to be enabled by invariant object representations, but how the brain achieves it remains unknown. In artificial neural networks, learning to represent objects is simulated as an optimization process. The system reduces discrepancies between actual and desired outputs by updating specific connections through mechanisms such as error backpropagation. These operations are biologically implausible primarily because they require individual connections at all levels to be sensitive to errors found at the late stages of the network. On the other hand, learning in the nervous system occurs locally, and synaptic changes depend only on pre- and post-synaptic activities. It is unclear how local updates translate into coordinated changes across large populations of neurons and lead to sophisticated cognitive functions. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve robust and invariant object representations in naturally observed network architectures using only biologically realistic local learning rules. Adopting operations fundamentally different from current ANN models, unsupervised recurrent networks can learn to represent and categorize objects through sensory experiences without propagating or detecting errors. This white box, fully interpretable networks can extract clean images from their corrupted forms and produce representations prospectively robust against unfamiliar perturbations. Continuous learning does not cause catastrophic forgetting commonly observed in ANNs. Without explicit instructions, the networks can classify objects and represent the identity of 3D objects regardless of perspective, size, or position. These findings have substantial implications for understanding how biological brains achieve invariant object representation and for developing biologically realistic intelligent networks that are efficient and robust.

                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced by all cell types and are found in all tissues and biofluids. EV proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids are a "nano-snapshot" of the parent cell that may be used for novel diagnostics of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, diagnosis of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD), relies on manifestations of late-stage progression, which may furthermore associate with other neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Here, we profiled surface markers and other protein contents of brain-derived extracellular vesicles (bd-EVs) from PD (n= 24), PSP (n=25) and control (n=24). bdEVs displayed tetraspanins and certain microglia, astrocyte, and neuron markers, while quantitative proteomics revealed enrichment of several proteins in PD vs. control and/or PSP, including clathrin heavy chain 1 and 14-3-3 protein gamma. This characterization of EVs in the source tissue provides insights into local dynamics as well as biomarker candidates for investigation in peripheral fluids.

                How is information processed in the cerebral cortex? To answer this question a lot of effort has been undertaken to create novel and to further develop existing neuroimaging techniques. Thus, a high spatial resolution of fMRI devices was the key to exactly localize cognitive processes. Furthermore, an increase in time-resolution and number of recording channels of electro-physiological setups has opened the door to investigate the exact timing of neural activity. However, in most cases the recorded signal is averaged over many (stimulus) repetitions, which erases the fine-structure of the neural signal. Here, we show that an unsupervised machine learning approach can be used to extract meaningful information from electro-physiological recordings on a single-trial base. We use an auto-encoder network to reduce the dimensions of single local field potential (LFP) events to create interpretable clusters of different neural activity patterns. Strikingly, certain LFP shapes correspond to latency differences in different recording channels. Hence, LFP shapes can be used to determine the direction of information flux in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, after clustering, we decoded the cluster centroids to reverse-engineer the underlying prototypical LFP event shapes. To evaluate our approach, we applied it to both neural extra-cellular recordings in rodents, and intra-cranial EEG recordings in humans. Finally, we find that single channel LFP event shapes during spontaneous activity sample from the realm of possible stimulus evoked event shapes. A finding which so far has only been demonstrated for multi-channel population coding.

                Biometric-based personal identification models are generally considered to be accurate and secure because biological signals are too complex and person-specific to be fabricated, and EMG signals, in particular, have been used as biological identification tokens due to their high dimension and non-linearity. We investigate the possibility of effectively attacking EMG-based identification models with biological adversarial input via a novel EMG signal individual style transformer based on a generative adversarial network. EMG hand gesture data from eighteen subjects and three well-recognized deep EMG classifiers were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack methods. The proposed methods achieved an average of 99.41% success rate on confusing identification models and an average of 91.51% success rate on manipulating identification models. These results demonstrate that EMG classifiers based on deep neural networks can be vulnerable to synthetic data attacks. The proof-of-concept results reveal that synthetic EMG biological signals must be considered in biological identification system design across a vast array of relevant biometric systems to ensure personal identification security for individuals and institutions.

                Neural processing of a navigational goal requires the continuous comparison between the current heading and the intended goal direction. While the neural basis underlying the current heading is well-studied in insects, the coding of the goal direction is completely unexplored. Here, we identify for the first time neurons that encode goal direction in the brain of a navigating insect, the monarch butterfly. The spatial tuning of these neurons accurately correlates with the animal's goal direction while being unaffected by compass perturbations. Thus, they specifically encode the goal direction similar to goal neurons described in the mammalian brain. Taken together, a navigation network based on goal-direction and heading-direction neurons generates steering commands that efficiently guides the monarch butterflies to their migratory goal.

                Empathy impairments are an important part of a broader affective impairments defining the youth antisocial phenotype callous-unemotional (CU) traits and the DSM-5 low prosocial emotion (LPE) specifier. While functional connectivity underlying empathy and CU traits have been well studied, less is known about what functional connections underly differences in empathy amongst adolescents qualifying for the LPE specifier. Such information can provide mechanistic distinctions for this clinically relevant specifier. The present study uses connectome-based predictive modeling that uses whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity data to predict cognitive and affective empathy for those meeting the LPE specifier (n= 29) and those that do not (n= 57). Additionally, we tested if models of empathy generalized between groups as well as density differences for each model of empathy between groups. Results indicate the LPE group had lower cognitive and affective empathy as well as higher CU traits and conduct problems. Negative and positive models were identified for affective empathy for both groups, but only the negative model for the LPE and positive model for the normative group reliably predicted cognitive empathy. Models predicting empathy did not generalize between groups. Density differences within the default mode, salience, executive control, limbic, and cerebellar networks were found as well as between the executive control, salience, and default mode networks. And, importantly, connections between the executive control and default mode networks characterized empathy differences the LPE group such that more positive connections characterized cognitive differences and less negative connections characterized affective differences. These findings indicate neural differences in empathy for those meeting LPE criteria that may explain decrements in empathy amongst these youth. These findings support theoretical accounts of empathy decrements in the LPE clinical specifier and extend them to identify specific circuits accounting for variation in empathy impairments. The identified negative models help understand what connections inhibit empathy whereas the positive models reveal what brain patterns are being used to support empathy in those with the LPE specifier. LPE differences from the normative group and could be an appropriate biomarker for predicting CU trait severity. Replication and validation using other large datasets are important next steps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Neurofeedback training on performance in laboratory tasks: A systematic review</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback procedures are attracting increasing attention in the neuroscience community. Based on the principle that participants, through suitable feedback, may learn to affect specific aspects of their brain activity, neurofeedback has been applied to basic research, translational, and clinical science alike. A large segment of the extant empirical research as well as review articles have focused on the extent to which neurofeedback interventions affect mental health outcomes, cognitive capacity, aging, and other complex behaviors. Another segment has aimed to characterize the extent to which neurofeedback affects the targeted neural processes. At this time, there is no current systematic review of the effects of neurofeedback on healthy participants performance in experimental tasks. Such a review is relevant in this rapidly evolving field because changes in experimental task performance are traditionally considered a hallmark of changing neurocognitive processes, often established in neurotypical individuals. This systematic review addresses this gap in the literature using the PRISMA method, building on earlier reviews on the same topic. Empirical studies using EEG or fMRI to alter brain processes linked to established, well-defined cognitive and affective laboratory tasks were reviewed. Substantial variability was found regarding the nature of the control for placebo effects, the implementation of the feedback, and the neural targets of feedback. Importantly, only a minority of the studies reported statistically meaningful effects of neurofeedback on performance in cognitive and affective tasks. Examining effect sizes and p-values in a subset of studies found no evidence for reporting bias, while also not finding systematic relations between study characteristics such as sample size or experimental control on the one hand and efficacy on the other. Implications for future work are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MYT1L is required for suppressing earlier neuronal development programs in the adult mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                In vitro studies indicate the neurodevelopmental disorder gene Myelin Transcription Factor 1 Like (MYT1L) suppresses non-neuronal lineage genes during fibroblast-to-neuron direct differentiation. However, MYT1L's molecular and cellular functions during differentiation in the mammalian brain have not been fully characterized. Here, we found that MYT1L loss leads to up-regulated deep layer (DL) but down-regulated upper layer (UL) neuron gene expression, corresponding to an increased ratio of DL/UL neurons in mouse cortex. To define potential mechanisms, we conducted Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) to map MYT1L binding targets in mouse developing cortex and adult prefrontal cortex (PFC), and to map epigenetic changes due to MYT1L mutation. We found MYT1L mainly binds to open chromatin, but with different transcription factor co-occupancies between promoters and enhancers. Likewise, multi-omic dataset integration revealed that, at promoters, MYT1L loss does not change chromatin accessibility but does increase H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, activating both a subset of earlier neuronal development genes as well as Bcl11b, a key regulator for DL neuron development. Meanwhile, we discovered that MYT1L normally represses the activity of neurogenic enhancers associated with neuronal migration and neuronal projection development by closing chromatin structures and promoting removal of active histone marks. Further, we show MYT1L interacts with SIN3B and HDAC2 in vivo, providing potential mechanisms underlying any repressive effects on histone acetylation and gene expression. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive map of MYT1L binding in vivo and mechanistic insights to how MYT1L facilitates neuronal maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CRF neurons of the BNST promote resilience by blunting the internal experience of aversion.</a></h4>

              
                The Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BNST) has been studied extensively for its role in coordinating what appears to be often opposing adaptive behaviors. However, what is missing in the literature is the link between internal affective states and the adaptive stress behaviors they motivate. Previously, we uncovered a stress window during which neuronal activity of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) expressing neurons of the oval nucleus of the BNST, (BNSTovCRF) maintains resilient behavior through self-sustained activation1. Here, we explore how BNSTovCRF neurons achieve this through shifting the valence of stress contexts to represent a less aversive experience. Using cell-type-selective optogenetics and transgenic Crf-ChR2 mice, we show that BNSTovCRF induces resiliency through dampening the deleterious effects of social defeat encoding, enhancing the positive salience of both appetitive and aversive stimuli, shifting socio-affective bias, and promoting tolerability of non-social physical stress. Adaptive responses to stress typically emanate as a response to negative internal states by external stimuli; here we show that in resilient mice, stressful environments are less aversive than susceptible mice, suggesting a different motivational capacity to endure stress in this group. Thus, we describe a novel role for BNSTovCRF neurons in resisting the emotional effects of cumulative stress by reducing the internal experience of aversion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The open field assay is influenced by room temperature and by drugs that affect core body temperature</a></h4>

              
                The open field assay is used to study anxiety-related traits and anxiolytic drugs in rodents. This assay entails measuring locomotor activity and time spent in the center of a chamber that is maintained at ambient room temperature. However, the ambient temperature in most laboratories varies daily and seasonally and can differ substantially between buildings. Here, we sought to evaluate how varying ambient temperature and core body temperature (CBT) affected open field locomotor activity and center time of wild-type (WT) and Trpm8 knock-out (Trpm8-/-) mice. TRPM8 is an ion channel that detects cool temperatures and is activated by cooling agents, including icilin and menthol. We found that the cooling agent icilin increased CBT and profoundly reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to vehicle controls. Likewise, cooling the ambient temperature to 4{degrees}C reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to Trpm8-/- mice. Conversely, the TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) reduced CBT and increased distance traveled and center time of WT mice when tested at 4{degrees}C. Predictably, the TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) had no effect on CBT or open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. The anxiolytic diazepam reduced CBT in both WT and Trpm8-/- mice. When tested at 4{degrees}C, diazepam increased distance traveled and center time in WT mice but did not alter open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. Our study shows that environmental temperature and drugs that affect CBT can influence locomotor behavior and center time in the open field assay, highlighting temperature (ambient and core) as sources of environmental and physiologic variability in this commonly used behavioral assay.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced Folate Carrier 1 is Present in Retinal Microvessels and Contributes to the Regulation of The Inner Blood Retinal Barrier in Health and Retinal Ischemia</a></h4>

              
                The inner blood-retina barrier (BRB) resembles the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is comprised of a single layer endothelium sealed with tight junctions whose abluminal surface is ensheathed by pericytes. The inner BRB is essential for providing a constant and controlled flow of nutrients and molecules to meet metabolic needs. Accordingly, the inner BRB harbors numerous carriers providing the exchange of molecules between blood and retina. One of these carriers is Reduced Folate Carrier 1 (RFC1), which functions as a folate transporter, and has been one of the most consistently detected genes in cerebral pericytes in a recent meta-analysis. The presence of RFC1 protein and its functions in retinal pericytes and microvessels have been overlooked so far despite the similarities between retinal and cerebral microcirculation. In this report, our purposes were to assess the presence of RFC1 protein in retinal microvessels and surrounding pericytes, and modify to increase or decrease RFC1 levels to explore its roles in healthy and ischemic retinal microvessels. Our analyses on whole mount retinas, and trypsin digest preparations from adult Swiss albino mice with concomitant pericyte and endothelial cell markers have shown the presence of RFC1 protein in the inner BRB and colocalization with pericytes. In vivo modifications of RFC1 expression levels were accomplished by intravitreal delivery of genetic and pharmacological agents. Knocking down RFC1 expression via custom-designed short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in microvascular dysfunction which was presented by the disintegration of tight junction proteins and the main basal membrane protein collagen-4. This was accompanied by extensive endogenous IgG extravasation suggesting impairment in the barrier functions. On the other hand, delivering RFC1 expressing lentiviral vector to overexpress RFC1 in the retina induced immunosignal increase in tight junction proteins and collagen-4 confirming the role of RFC1 in the inner BRB functions. Administration of methotrexate (MTX), the pharmacological competitive inhibitor of folate, resulted in increased levels of RFC1. In retinal ischemia models, one-hour retinal ischemia increased RFC1 levels and decreased collagen-4 and occludin levels. These effects could be partially reversed with pre-treatment by RFC1 expressing lentiviral vector. All these indicate the importance of RFC1 levels in the pathophysiology of retinal ischemia, a prevalent cause of blindness worldwide. In conclusion, our study clarifies the presence of RFC1 in inner BRB and offers a novel perspective on RFC1, other than being a folate carrier, as a regulator of inner BRB in healthy and ischemic retinas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Vogt-Bailey index: a local gradient analysis</a></h4>

              
                In this work, we take a closer look at the Vogt-Bailey (VB) index, proposed in (Bajada et al, 2020) as a tool for studying local functional homogeneity in the human cortex. We interpret the VB index in terms of the minimum ratio cut, a weighted graph cut that indicates whether a network can easily be disconnected into two parts having a comparable number of nodes. In our case, the nodes of the network consist of a brain vertex/voxel and its nearest neighbours, and a given edge is weighted according to the affinity of the nodes it connects (as reflected by the modified Pearson correlation between their fMRI time series). Consequently, the minimum ratio cut quantifies the degree of similarity in local brain activity. We compare the performance of the VB index with that of the Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) algorithm, commonly used to assess whether voxels in close proximity have synchronised fMRI signals, and find that the VB index is uniquely placed to detect sharp changes in the (local) functional organization of the human cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Canonical and Non-Canonical Psychedelic Drugs Induce Common Network Changes in Human Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The neurobiology of the psychedelic experience is not fully elucidated. Identifying common brain network changes induced by both canonical (i.e., acting at the 5-HT2 receptor) and non-canonical psychedelics would provide mechanistic insight into state-specific characteristics. We analyzed whole-brain functional connectivity based on resting-state fMRI data in humans, acquired before and during the administration of nitrous oxide, ketamine, and lysergic acid diethylamide. We report that, despite distinct molecular mechanisms and modes of delivery, all three psychedelics reduced within-network functional connectivity and enhanced between-network functional connectivity. More specifically, all drugs tested increased connectivity between right temporoparietal junction and bilateral intraparietal sulcus as well as between precuneus and left intraparietal sulcus. These regions fall within the posterior cortical hot zone, posited to mediate the content of consciousness. Thus, both canonical and non-canonical psychedelics modulate networks within an area of known relevance for conscious experience, identifying a biologically plausible candidate for their subjective effects.

	<p>The main objective of this study was to demonstrate that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling can be used to study the contribution of covert and overt vascular architecture to the risk for cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell disease (SCD) and to determine the mechanisms of response to therapy such as chronic red blood cell (cRBC) transfusions. We analyzed baseline (screening), pre-randomization and study exit magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) images from 10 (5 each from the transfusion and observation arms) pediatric sickle SCD participants in the silent cerebral infarct transfusion (SIT) trial using CFD modeling. We reconstructed the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and branches and extracted the geometry using 3D Slicer. We cut specific portions of the large intracranial artery to include segments of the internal carotid, middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries such that the vessel segment analyzed extended from the intracranial beginning of the internal carotid artery up to immediately after (~0.25 inches) the middle cerebral artery branching point. Cut models were imported into Ansys 2021R2/2022R1 and laminar and time-dependent flow simulation was performed. Change in time averaged mean velocity, wall shear stress, and vessel tortuosity were compared between the observation and cRBC arms. We did not observe a correlation between time averaged mean velocity (TAMV) and mean transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity at study entry. There was also no difference in change in time average mean velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and vessel tortuosity between the observation and cRBC transfusion arms. WSS and TAMV were abnormal for 2 (developed TIA) out of the 3 participants (one participant had silent cerebral infarctions) that developed neurovascular outcomes. CFD approaches allow for the evaluation of vascular topology and hemodynamics in SCD using MRA images. In this proof of principle study, we show that CFD could be a useful tool and we intend to carry out future studies with a larger sample to enable more robust conclusions.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a challenge for healthcare systems, especially in terms of the care of patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Age is one of the major risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19, most probably due to the presence of comorbidities and inflammations. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 invades nerve endings and olfactory nerves through the binding of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This interaction triggers an inflammatory cascade that results in cognitive impairment. In turn, the isoform of apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE-4&amp;amp;epsilon;) in AD is a risk factor for increased neuroinflammation through microglia activation, increased oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. AD and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with increases in levels of inflammatory markers, as well as increases in levels of APOE-4&amp;amp;epsilon;, ACE2 and oxidative stress. Thus, there is a synergistic relationship between AD and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the social isolation and other health measures resulting from the pandemic have led to a higher level of anxiety and depression among AD patients, a situation which may lead to a decline in cognitive function. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies for keeping the patient calm but active.</p>

	<p>Source activity was extracted from resting-state magnetoencephalography data of 103 subjects aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;60 years. The directionality of information flow was computed from the regional time courses using delay symbolic transfer entropy and phase entropy. The analysis yielded a dynamic source connectivity profile, disentangling the direction, strength, and time delay of the underlying causal interactions, producing independent time delays for cross-frequency amplitude-to-amplitude and phase-to-phase coupling. The computation of the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DoCM) allowed me to estimate the probability distribution of the DoCM independently of phase and amplitude. The results support earlier observations of a posterior-to-anterior information flow for phase dynamics in {&amp;amp;alpha;1, &amp;amp;alpha;2, &amp;amp;beta;, &amp;amp;gamma;} and an opposite flow (anterior to posterior) in &amp;amp;theta;. Amplitude dynamics reveal posterior-to-anterior information flow in {&amp;amp;alpha;1, &amp;amp;alpha;2, &amp;amp;gamma;}, a sensory-motor &amp;amp;beta;-oriented pattern, and an anterior-to-posterior pattern in {&amp;amp;delta;, &amp;amp;theta;}. The DoCM between intra- and cross-frequency couplings (CFC) are reported here for the first time and independently for amplitude and phase; in both domains {&amp;amp;delta;, &amp;amp;theta;, &amp;amp;alpha;1}, frequencies are the main contributors to DoCM. Finally, a novel brain age index (BAI) is introduced, defined as the ratio of the probability distribution of inter- over intra-frequency couplings. This ratio shows a universal age trajectory: a rapid rise from the end of adolescence, reaching a peak in adulthood, and declining slowly thereafter. The universal pattern is seen in the BAI of each frequency studied and for both amplitude and phase domains. No such universal age dependence was previously reported.</p>

	<p>Since depression remains a major public health issue there is a constant need for new and more efficient therapeutic strategies based on the mechanisms involved in the aetiology of depression. Thus, the pathogenic link between depression and inflammation is considered to play a potential key role in the development of such therapies. This review summarizes the results of various pharmacological (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, cytokine inhibitors, corticosteroids, statins, minocycline, N-acetyl cysteine, omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics) and non-pharmacological interventions (electroconvulsive therapy, physical exercise and psychological therapy) and outlines their efficacy and discusses potential challenges. Both conventional and non-conventional anti-inflammatory drugs showed promising results according to the specific group of patients. The pre-existing pro-inflammatory status was, in most cases, a predictor for clinical efficacy and, in some cases, a correlation between clinical improvement and changes in various biomarkers was found. Some of the non-pharmacological interventions (physical exercise and electroconvulsive therapy) have also showed beneficial effects for depressive patients with elevated inflammatory markers. Treatments with anti-inflammatory action may improve clinical outcomes in depression, at least for some categories of patients, thus opening the way for a future personalised approach to patients with unipolar depression regarding the inflammation-related mechanism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Emx1-Cre Is Expressed in Peripheral Autonomic Ganglia That Regulate Central Cardiorespiratory Functions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The Emx1-IRES-Cre transgenic mouse is commonly used to direct genetic recombination in forebrain excitatory neurons. However, the original study reported that Emx1-Cre is also expressed embryonically in peripheral autonomic ganglia, which could potentially affect the interpretation of targeted circuitry contributing to systemic phenotypes. Here, we report that Emx1-Cre is expressed in the afferent vagus nerve system involved in autonomic cardiorespiratory regulatory pathways. Our imaging studies revealed expression of Emx1-Cre driven tdtomato fluorescence in the afferent vagus nerve innervating the dorsal medulla of brainstem, cell bodies in the nodose ganglion, and their potential target structures at the carotid bifurcation such as the carotid sinus and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Photostimulation of the afferent terminals in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) <I>in vitro</I> using Emx1-Cre driven ChR2 reliably evoked EPSCs in the postsynaptic neurons with electrophysiological characteristics consistent with the vagus afferent nerves. In addition, optogenetic stimulation targeting the Emx1-Cre expressing structures identified in this study, such as vagus nerve, carotid bifurcation, and the dorsal medulla surface transiently depressed cardiorespiratory rate in urethane anesthetized mice <I>in vivo</I>. Together, our study demonstrates that Emx1-IRES-Cre is expressed in the key peripheral autonomic nerve system and can modulate cardiorespiratory function independently of forebrain expression. These results raise caution when interpreting systemic phenotypes of Emx1-IRES-Cre conditional recombinant mice, and also suggest the utility of this line to investigate modulators of the afferent vagal system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Perinatal Morphine Exposure Leads to Sex-Dependent Executive Function Deficits and Microglial Changes in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Children exposed prenatally to opioids are at an increased risk for behavioral problems and executive function deficits. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala (AMG) regulate executive function and social behavior and are sensitive to opioids prenatally. Opioids can bind to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate microglia, which may be developmentally important for synaptic pruning. Therefore, we tested the effects of perinatal morphine exposure on executive function and social behavior in male and female mouse offspring, along with microglial-related and synaptic-related outcomes. Dams were injected once daily subcutaneously with saline (<I>n</I> = 8) or morphine (MO; 10 mg/kg; <I>n</I> = 12) throughout pregestation, gestation, and lactation until offspring were weaned on postnatal day 21 (P21). Male MO offspring had impairments in attention and accuracy in the five-choice serial reaction time task, while female MO offspring were less affected. Targeted gene expression analysis at P21 in the PFC identified alterations in microglial-related and TLR4-related genes, while immunohistochemical analysis in adult brains indicated decreased microglial Iba1 and phagocytic CD68 proteins in the PFC and AMG in males, but females had an increase. Further, both male and female MO offspring had increased social preference. Overall, these data demonstrate male vulnerability to executive function deficits in response to perinatal opioid exposure and evidence for disruptions in neuron&ndash;microglial signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Frmpd1 Facilitates Trafficking of G-Protein Transducin and Modulates Synaptic Function in Rod Photoreceptors of Mammalian Retina</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Trafficking of transducin (G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB>) in rod photoreceptors is critical for adaptive and modulatory responses of the retina to varying light intensities. In addition to fine-tuning phototransduction gain in rod outer segments (OSs), light-induced translocation of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> to the rod synapse enhances rod to rod bipolar synaptic transmission. Here, we show that the rod-specific loss of Frmpd1 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 1), in the retina of both female and male mice, results in delayed return of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> from the synapse back to outer segments in the dark, compromising the capacity of rods to recover from light adaptation. Frmpd1 directly interacts with Gpsm2 (G-protein signaling modulator 2), and the two proteins are required for appropriate sensitization of rod-rod bipolar signaling under saturating light conditions. These studies provide insight into how the trafficking and function of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> is modulated to optimize the photoresponse and synaptic transmission of rod photoreceptors in a light-dependent manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Commanding or Being a Simple Intermediary: How Does It Affect Moral Behavior and Related Brain Mechanisms?</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Psychology and neuroscience research have shown that fractioning operations among several individuals along a hierarchical chain allows diffusing responsibility between components of the chain, which has the potential to disinhibit antisocial actions. Here, we present two studies, one using fMRI (Study 1) and one using EEG (Study 2), designed to help understand how commanding or being in an intermediary position impacts the sense of agency and empathy for pain. In the age of military drones, we also explored whether commanding a human or robot agent influences these measures. This was done within a single behavioral paradigm in which participants could freely decide whether or not to send painful shocks to another participant in exchange for money. In Study 1, fMRI reveals that activation in social cognition-related and empathy-related brain regions was equally low when witnessing a victim receive a painful shock while participants were either commander or simple intermediary transmitting an order, compared with being the agent directly delivering the shock. In Study 2, results indicated that the sense of agency did not differ between commanders and intermediary, no matter whether the executing agent was a robot or a human. However, we observed that the neural response over P3 event-related potential was higher when the executing agent was a robot compared with a human. Source reconstruction of the EEG signal revealed that this effect was mediated by areas including the insula and ACC. Results are discussed regarding the interplay between the sense of agency and empathy for pain for decision-making.</p>

                <p>Here, we report the generation and comprehensive characterization of a knock-in mouse model for the hotspot p.Arg87Cys variant of the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2</i>) gene, which was recently identified in individuals diagnosed with West syndrome, a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice recapitulated many neurological and neurobehavioral phenotypes of the patients, including spasm-like movements, microcephaly, and impaired social communication. Age-progressive cytoarchitectural disorganization and gliosis were also identified in the hippocampus of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice. Beyond identifying a decrease in CYFIP2 protein levels in the <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> brains, we demonstrated that the p.Arg87Cys variant enhances ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CYFIP2.</p>

                <p>Risk of sudden death in multiple system atrophy (MSA) is greatest during sleep with unknown mechanisms<b>.</b> We compared nocturnal pulse event frequency in 46 MSA patients and age-sex matched controls undergoing overnight pulse oximetry. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation indices (ODI) and pulse event indices (PEI) were recorded and relationships between pulse oximetry variables and survival were analyzed. MSA patients had lower PEI (3.1 ± 5.3 vs. 12.8 ± 10.8, p &lt;0.001) despite greater hypoxic burden and similar frequency of respiratory events. Nocturnal pulse events were not associated with severity of daytime autonomic failure. Two MSA patients had suspected sudden death, both with severely reduced PEI. MSA patients have fewer nocturnal pulse events compared with controls, despite similar respiratory event frequency, suggesting abnormal cardiac responses to sleep disordered breathing. Whether this contributes to sudden death in MSA requires further study.</p>

                The article presents a dataset on the characteristics of stablecoins. Stablecoins represent a relatively young but increasingly important branch of the cryptocurrency market. Although they all share the same goal of maintaining a stable value in the digital market, they form a highly heterogeneous group. They differ in terms of collateral and stabilization mechanism, peg, availability of the technical documentation, presence on crypto exchanges or age. The dataset is cross-sectional and was created based on internet research. Individual information was collected from websites of the stablecoin projects and a crypto-data aggregator, and to a lesser extent from other auxiliary sources (websites related to finance and cryptocurrencies). The dataset is unique as there are no publicly available databases encompassing the features of stablecoins. It can be used in all stablecoin-related analyses to characterise the examined coins and to investigate the relationship between cryptocurrency market developments and stablecoin features.

                Background: Medicines that are expired or deteriorated within a household must be disposed of in an effective and environmentally friendly manner, to the point that they do not end up being a risk to the community and the environment. To do this, the members of Peruvian households must have the knowledge and the appropriate attitude, together with the necessary tools for the effective disposal of these drugs. For this reason, the research objective is as follows: to evaluates the relationship between the level of knowledge and attitudes on how to dispose of medicines in households in the district of San Juan de Miraflores. Methods: Hypothetical-deductive, quantitative approach, applied type and non-experimental, observational design, for which 385 households in the district of San Juan de Miraflores were surveyed. Results: 48.3% of the respondents have an average level of knowledge of how to dispose of medicines. 93.2% of the respondents have a positive attitude towards the disposal of medicines, and there is a relationship between the level of knowledge and attitude towards the disposal of medicines (P-value = 0.000). Conclusions: Increased knowledge is associated with a better attitude to the disposal of medicines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Phytochemical study of the plant species Bidens pilosa L. (Asteraceae) and Croton floccosus (Euphorbiaceae) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given the chemical richness of medicinal plants (Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus) in Ecuador, they are considered the natural source of numerous medicines. Methods: The leaves were dried at 40°C and 50°C and the extracts were characterized by means of phytochemical screening, verifying the presence of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, reducing sugars, phenols, flavonoids, tannins and saponins. Three extraction processes were carried out, with two solvents of different polarities: hexane and ethanol. The extraction methods that were applied to the leaves of the plants were Soxhlet, ultrasonic bath and maceration, the latter two at room temperature and Soxhlet at the boiling temperature of the solvent. Determination of the total content of phenols and flavonoids is carried out using the Follin-Ciocalteau colorimetric reaction, Quercetin standard, Aluminum Chloride solution measured with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity was performed with the DPPH radical and measured with the same equipment. Results: The highest content of total phenols obtained by employing the Soxhlet method for extraction when the material was dried at 50°C was 48.609 ± 0.370 mg GAE/g of dry sample for Bidens pilosa L. while in the case of Croton floccosus it was 128.212 ± 0.601 mg GAE/g of dry sample obtained from the extraction by means of maceration. Finally, the antioxidant activity against the 1.1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical was determined, and it was found that the Bidens pilosa L. species performed better and responded better to the test, with an IC50 value of 239.33 µg/mL, than Croton floccosus (IC50 of 644.125 µg/mL). Conclusions: The following preliminary phytochemical study of the Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus plants provided important information on the content of secondary metabolites and response to the DPPH radical reported for the first time in Ecuador, which may be future use for medicinal application.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Potential impact of artificial intelligence on the emerging world order [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The fast-paced diffusion of technologies broadly falling under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be shaping the emerging world order in international relations (IR). It is expected that the global AI race will pave the way for another rise and fall of great powers in the international system, similar to the impact caused by the three industrial revolutions of the past. The literature in IR identifies three major powers – namely, the United States of America (USA), China, and Russia, as the leading contenders in this AI race. The ongoing AI-enabled fourth industrial revolution is all the more unique due to the markedly different approaches these three powers have adopted for integrating AI into their military, political, and socio-economic spheres. The AI strategies of these countries further reflect their capabilities and intentions towards how they plan on employing the technology to elevate their prestige and power status in the international system. This paper draws from a historiography of the First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions to study how technological innovations have altered relative power capabilities of nations, triggering a re-ordering of power hierarchies at a systemic level. Drawing from this understanding, it analyses the nature of AI as an emerging technology and assesses whether it can cause systemic alterations. It critically examines and compares the AI strategies of the USA, China, and Russia as leading contenders in the global AI race and outlines their strengths and weaknesses. It further draws from the Adoption Capacity Theory to argue that the AI race may well be determined by the relative capacity of the major institutions in each of these countries to manage and adapt to the disruptions this technology is bound to bring to the fore.

                Background: The aim was to evaluate the antifungal activity of propolis extract against Candida albicans (or C. albicans) in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Methods: The research presents a quantitative approach with an experimental design, with a population of C. albicans strains isolated from patients diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis who were admitted to the Gynecology Service of the Maria del Socorro Clinic, district of Ate, Lima; a sample of 34 strains was chosen in total, considering three repetitions per strain, obtaining 102 experimental units. The antifungal susceptibility test was carried out by the disc diffusion plate method using a single concentration of propolis extract, with fluconazole as a positive control. Results: Propolis extract was shown to inhibit all strains of C. albicans, as was fluconazole, with the effect of the latter being significantly greater than that of the product under investigation. Conclusions: The conclusion is that propolis extract does show antifungal activity against C. albicans in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis.

                Background: Drinking coffee is known to have both positive and negative aftermath on periodontal health. The current study is aiming to systematically review the impact of coffee consumption on periodontal health status. Methods: An article search was carried out in two electronic databases (PUBMED and Web of Sciences). The assessment of the included articles were conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed qualitatively. Result: A total of 10 articles were included in this study. Most (5) of the studies discovered a negative correlation between coffee intake and periodontal health, while 4 other studies found the protective effect of daily coffee consumption against alveolar bone loss. Last, only one study found that coffee intake did not relate with periodontitis. Conclusion: The effect of coffee consumption on periodontal health was fragmented since coffee has complex components that may give either beneficial effects or negative impact on periodontal health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of clinical, histology, TNF-α, and collagen expressions on oral ulcer in rats after treatment with areca nut and chrysanthemum oral gel [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), and F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background: Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, different animal species have been implicated as possible intermediate hosts that could facilitate the transmission of the virus between species. The detection of these hosts has intensified, reporting wild, zoo, farm, and pet animals. The goal of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgG) in domestic dogs and cats and its epidemiological association with the frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Villavicencio, Colombia. Methods: 300 dogs and 135 cats were randomly selected in a two-stage distribution by clusters according to COVID-19 cases (positive RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2) within the human population distributed within the eight communes of Villavicencio. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was applied in order to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in sera samples. Kernel density estimation was used to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 cases with the seropositivity of dogs and cats. Results: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 4.6% (95% CI=3.2-7.4). In canines, 3.67% (95% CI=2.1-6.4) and felines 6.67% (95% CI=3.6-12.18). Kernel density estimation indicated that seropositive cases were concentrated in the southwest region of the city. There was a positive association between SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in pet animals and their habitat in Commune 2 (adjusted OR=5.84; 95% CI=1.1-30.88). Spearman's correlation coefficients were weakly positive (p=0.32) between the ratio of COVID-19 cases in November 2020 and the results for domestic dogs and cats from the eight communes of Villavicencio. Conclusions: In the present research cats were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than dogs. This study provides the first positive results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA serological tests in domestic dogs and cats in Colombia with information about the virus transmission dynamics in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Co-cultures of cerebellar slices from mice with different reelin genetic backgrounds as a model to study cortical lamination [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Reelin has fundamental functions in the developing and mature brain. Its absence gives rise to the Reeler phenotype in mice, the first described cerebellar mutation. In homozygous mutants missing the Reelin gene (reln-/-), neurons are incapable of correctly positioning themselves in layered brain areas such as the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. We here demonstrate that by employing ex vivo cultured cerebellar slices one can reduce the number of animals and use a non-recovery procedure to analyze the effects of Reelin on the migration of Purkinje neurons (PNs). Methods: We generated mouse hybrids (L7-GFPrelnF1/) with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PNs, directly visible under fluorescence microscopy. We then cultured the slices obtained from mice with different reln genotypes and demonstrated that when the slices from reln-/- mutants were co-cultured with those from reln+/- mice, the Reelin produced by the latter induced migration of the PNs to partially rescue the normal layered cortical histology. We have confirmed this observation with Voronoi tessellation to analyze PN dispersion. Results: In images of the co-cultured slices from reln-/- mice, Voronoi polygons were larger than in single-cultured slices of the same genetic background but smaller than those generated from slices of reln+/- animals. The mean roundness factor, area disorder, and roundness factor homogeneity were different when slices from reln-/- mice were cultivated singularly or co-cultivated, supporting mathematically the transition from the clustered organization of the PNs in the absence of Reelin to a layered structure when the protein is supplied ex vivo. Conclusions: Neurobiologists are the primary target users of this 3Rs approach. They should adopt it for the possibility to study and manipulate ex vivo the activity of a brain-secreted or genetically engineered protein (scientific perspective), the potential reduction (up to 20%) of the animals used, and the total avoidance of severe surgery (3Rs perspective).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">abmAnimalMovement: An R package for simulating animal movement using an agent-based model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Animal movement datasets are growing in number and depth, and researchers require a growing number of analytical approaches to adequately answer questions using movement datasets. As the complexity of questions and analyses increase, deciding on the best approach both in terms of study design and analysis can become more difficult. A potential solution is to simulate an array of synthetic datasets under varying study designs and simulation parametrisations to gain insight into the impact of analysis choice(s) in different contexts. The abmAnimalMovement R package provides the means of simulating animal movement for this purpose. The abmAnimalMovement simulations use a discrete time agent-based model and does not require previous movement data as an input. The simulations include a number of key internal and external movement influences, as well as parameters for navigation and mobility capacity of the animal. Internal influences include three predefined behavioural states (e.g., rest, explore, forage) and any number of activity cycles (e.g., diel, seasonal). External influences are implemented via matrices describing landscape characteristics (e.g., shelter quality, foraging resources, movement ease), and predefined points describing shelter sites and points the animal aims to avoid. Navigation capacity is defined by the range the animal can dynamically choose a foraging location to which it is subsequently attracted. Mobility capacity is implemented by user defined distributions, from which step length and turn angles are draw at each time step, governing the possible subsequent locations of the animal. Critically, the navigation capacity (the choice of destination) operates on a different time scale to the mobility capacity, allowing the internal state of the animal to differ from the observed movements. When combined with other emergent properties, such as site fidelity generated via repeated shelter site use, the simulations offer opportunities to test whether movement analyses can accurately recover hidden mechanisms, states, and drivers.

                Background: Infertility remains a significant issue in the world of health. Now Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is widely used to help couples with infertility. In ART diminish ovarian reserve patients have a very low success rate of pregnancy. To help patients with Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR), research is conducted using an animal model. vinylcychlohexene diepoxide (VCD) has ovotoxic effects. This study looked at the use of VCD in inducing targeted DOR conditions in animals (rats), create a model that could be used for future animal studies in infertility. Methods: Adult female Rattus norvegicus were used in this study. All were given VCD injections at 80 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 15 days. An examination of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels will be carried out on days 0,3,5,7, and 15. To mimic IVF process, all rats got an injection of 10 IU of Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) and 10 IU human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) to confirm DOR. Ovarectomy was performed, dominant follicles were taken, denudation was carried out, and the oocytes were cultured for 12 hours. Then, oocytes were assessed through a microscope. Results: Starting from day 5 post VCD induction, there was a significant increase in the FSH level in the group of rats that were induced with the administered VCD dose compared to the control group that experienced normal FSH fluctuations. The FSH concentration reached >50%. It was found that the number of degenerated oocytes had an average of 1.11. Oocytes that were in Germinal-Vesicle (GV) stage had an average of 1.89, while in the Metaphase I (M1) stage the average is 2.882. Lastly, the number of oocytes in the Metaphase (MII) stage which is fully matured had an average of 1.117. Conclusions: VCD can become an important tool for future studies that needs an animal model with DOR.

                Glioblastoma (GBM), a deadly brain tumor, is still one of the few lasting challenges of contemporary oncology. Current therapies fail to significantly improve patient survival due to GBM’s tremendous genetic, transcriptomic, immunological, and sex-dependent heterogeneity. Over the years, clinical differences between males and females were characterized. For instance, higher incidence of GBM in males or distinct responses to cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy between males and females have been noted. However, despite the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, these differences were not further investigated as studies were focused only on exposing the general picture of GBM heterogeneity. Hence, in this study, we summarized the current state of knowledge on GBM heterogeneity exposed by single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics with regard to genetics, immunology, and sex-dependent differences. Additionally, we highlighted future research directions which would fill the gap of knowledge on the impact of patient’s sex on the disease outcome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical equivalence of Trusynth fast® and Vicryl rapide® polyglactin 910 fast absorbing sutures on maternal morbidity experienced by women following episiotomy repair: a single-blind, randomized study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Episiotomy procedure enlarges the vaginal outlet to facilitate childbirth. Polyglactin 910 fast-absorbing sutures are widely used for the repair of episiotomy because of their rapid absorption and less inflammatory response. This study was designed for subjective assessment of perineal pain post-episiotomy repair, with Trusynth Fast® and Vicryl Rapide® polyglactin 910 fast-absorbing sutures. Method: This was a single-blind, randomized, prospective study conducted between January 7, 2021 and July 14, 2021 across two centers in India. Primiparous or multiparous women (18—40 years), who required episiotomy during vaginal delivery were included, and either Trusynth Fast® (n=47) or Vicryl Rapide® (n=49) suture was used for their episiotomy repair. The primary endpoint, perineal pain was assessed with visual analogue scale at all follow-up visits. The secondary endpoints, quantity of local anesthesia, number of sutures used, time to repair episiotomy, intraoperative suture handling, analgesics used, early and late wound complications, wound re-suturing, time to complete healing, presence of residual sutures, return to sexual activity, dyspareunia, and adverse events were also recorded. Results: The study showed no significant difference in perineal pain between the two groups at any visit. A statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in total score of episiotomy healing scale on day 2 (0.13±0.34 versus 0.35±0.56) and swelling on day 2 (8.51 versusversus 28.57%) was noted between Trusynth Fast® and Vicryl Rapide® group. Non-significant difference was observed between the groups regarding anesthesia, number of sutures, time to repair episiotomy, intraoperative suture handling, analgesics, puerperal fever, wound infection, dehiscence, hematoma, urinary incontinence, re-suturing, time to complete healing, return to sexual activity and dyspareunia. Conclusion: Trusynth Fast® suture is clinically equivalent to Vicryl Rapide® suture and can be used for episiotomy repair with minimal risk of perineal pain and wound complications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal noise level for coding with tightly balanced networks of spiking neurons in the presence of transmission delays</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan Timcheck, Jonathan Kadmon, Kwabena Boahen, Surya Ganguli</p>

Neural circuits consist of many noisy, slow components, with individual neurons subject to ion channel noise, axonal propagation delays, and unreliable and slow synaptic transmission. This raises a fundamental question: how can reliable computation emerge from such unreliable components? A classic strategy is to simply average over a population of <i>N</i> weakly-coupled neurons to achieve errors that scale as 1 / N. But more interestingly, recent work has introduced networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that achieve coding errors that scale <i>superclassically</i> as 1/<i>N</i> by combining the principles of predictive coding and fast and tight inhibitory-excitatory balance. However, spike transmission delays preclude such fast inhibition, and computational studies have observed that such delays can cause pathological synchronization that in turn destroys superclassical coding performance. Intriguingly, it has also been observed in simulations that noise can actually <i>improve</i> coding performance, and that there exists some optimal level of noise that minimizes coding error. However, we lack a quantitative theory that describes this fascinating interplay between delays, noise and neural coding performance in spiking networks. In this work, we elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this beneficial role of noise by deriving <i>analytical</i> expressions for coding error as a function of spike propagation delay and noise levels in predictive coding tight-balance networks of LIF neurons. Furthermore, we compute the minimal coding error and the associated optimal noise level, finding that they grow as power-laws with the delay. Our analysis reveals quantitatively how optimal levels of noise can rescue neural coding performance in spiking neural networks with delays by preventing the build up of pathological synchrony without overwhelming the overall spiking dynamics. This analysis can serve as a foundation for the further study of precise computation in the presence of noise and delays in efficient spiking neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling membrane reshaping by staged polymerization of ESCRT-III filaments</a></h4>

ESCRT-III filaments are composite cytoskeletal polymers that can constrict and cut cell membranes from the inside of the membrane neck. Membrane-bound ESCRT-III filaments undergo a series of dramatic composition and geometry changes in the presence of an ATP-consuming Vps4 enzyme, which causes stepwise changes in the membrane morphology. We set out to understand the physical mechanisms involved in translating the changes in ESCRT-III polymer composition into membrane deformation. We have built a coarse-grained model in which ESCRT-III polymers of different geometries and mechanical properties are allowed to copolymerise and bind to a deformable membrane. By modelling ATP-driven stepwise depolymerisation of specific polymers, we identify mechanical regimes in which changes in filament composition trigger the associated membrane transition from a flat to a buckled state, and then to a tubule state that eventually undergoes scission to release a small cargo-loaded vesicle. We then characterise how the location and kinetics of polymer loss affects the extent of membrane deformation and the efficiency of membrane neck scission. Our results identify the near-minimal mechanical conditions for the operation of shape-shifting composite polymers that sever membrane necks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortices encode structural task representations following progressive and interleaved training schedules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sam C. Berens, Chris M. Bird</p>

Memory generalisations may be underpinned by either encoding- or retrieval-based generalisation mechanisms and different training schedules may bias some learners to favour one of these mechanisms over the other. We used a transitive inference task to investigate whether generalisation is influenced by progressive vs randomly interleaved training, and overnight consolidation. On consecutive days, participants learnt pairwise discriminations from two transitive hierarchies before being tested during fMRI. Inference performance was consistently better following progressive training, and for pairs further apart in the transitive hierarchy. BOLD pattern similarity correlated with hierarchical distances in the left hippocampus (HIP) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) following both training schedules. These results are consistent with the use of structural representations that directly encode hierarchical relationships between task features. However, such effects were only observed in the MPFC for recently learnt relationships. Furthermore, the MPFC appeared to maintain structural representations in participants who performed at chance on the inference task. We conclude that humans preferentially employ encoding-based mechanisms to store map-like relational codes that can be used for memory generalisation. These codes are expressed in the HIP and MPFC following both progressive and interleaved training but are not sufficient for accurate inference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Kinetic and data-driven modeling of pancreatic β-cell central carbon metabolism and insulin secretion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Patrick E. Gelbach, Dongqing Zheng, Scott E. Fraser, Kate L. White, Nicholas A. Graham, Stacey D. Finley</p>

Pancreatic β-cells respond to increased extracellular glucose levels by initiating a metabolic shift. That change in metabolism is part of the process of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is of particular interest in the context of diabetes. However, we do not fully understand how the coordinated changes in metabolic pathways and metabolite products influence insulin secretion. In this work, we apply systems biology approaches to develop a detailed kinetic model of the intracellular central carbon metabolic pathways in pancreatic β-cells upon stimulation with high levels of glucose. The model is calibrated to published metabolomics datasets for the INS1 823/13 cell line, accurately capturing the measured metabolite fold-changes. We first employed the calibrated mechanistic model to estimate the stimulated cell’s fluxome. We then used the predicted network fluxes in a data-driven approach to build a partial least squares regression model. By developing the combined kinetic and data-driven modeling framework, we gain insights into the link between β-cell metabolism and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The combined modeling framework was used to predict the effects of common anti-diabetic pharmacological interventions on metabolite levels, flux through the metabolic network, and insulin secretion. Our simulations reveal targets that can be modulated to enhance insulin secretion. The model is a promising tool to contextualize and extend the usefulness of metabolomics data and to predict dynamics and metabolite levels that are difficult to measure <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, the modeling framework can be applied to identify, explain, and assess novel and clinically-relevant interventions that may be particularly valuable in diabetes treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A new computational model illuminates the extraordinary eyes of Phronima</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zahra M. Bagheri, Anna-Lee Jessop, Julian C. Partridge, Karen J. Osborn, Jan M. Hemmi</p>

Vision in the midwater of the open ocean requires animals to perform visual tasks quite unlike those of any other environment. These tasks consist of detecting small, low contrast objects and point sources against a relatively dim and uniform background. Deep-sea animals have evolved many extraordinary visual adaptations to perform these tasks. Linking eye anatomy to specific selective pressures, however, is challenging, not least because of the many difficulties of studying deep-sea animals. Computational modelling of vision, based on detailed morphological reconstructions of animal eyes, along with underwater optics, offers a chance to understand the specific visual capabilities of individual visual systems. Prior to the work presented here, comprehensive models for apposition compound eyes in the mesopelagic, the dominant eye form of crustaceans, were lacking. We adapted a model developed for single-lens eyes and used it to examine how different parameters affect the model’s ability to detect point sources and extended objects. This new model also allowed us to examine spatial summation as a means to improve visual performance. Our results identify a trade-off between increased depth range over which eyes function effectively and increased distance at which extended objects can be detected. This trade-off is driven by the size of the ommatidial acceptance angle. We also show that if neighbouring ommatidia have overlapping receptive fields, spatial summation helps with all detection tasks, including the detection of bioluminescent point sources. By applying our model to the apposition compound eyes of <i>Phronima</i>, a mesopelagic hyperiid amphipod, we show that the specialisations of the large medial eyes of <i>Phronima</i> improve both the detection of point sources and of extended objects. The medial eyes outperformed the lateral eyes at every modelled detection task. We suggest that the small visual field size of <i>Phronima</i>’s medial eyes and the strong asymmetry between the medial and lateral eyes reflect <i>Phronima</i>’s need for effective vision across a large depth range and its habit of living inside a barrel. The barrel’s narrow aperture limits the usefulness of a large visual field and has allowed a strong asymmetry between the medial and lateral eyes. The model provides a useful tool for future investigations into the visual abilities of apposition compound eyes in the deep sea.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A new machine learning method for cancer mutation analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mahnaz Habibi, Golnaz Taheri</p>

It is complicated to identify cancer-causing mutations. The recurrence of a mutation in patients remains one of the most reliable features of mutation driver status. However, some mutations are more likely to happen than others for various reasons. Different sequencing analysis has revealed that cancer driver genes operate across complex pathways and networks, with mutations often arising in a mutually exclusive pattern. Genes with low-frequency mutations are understudied as cancer-related genes, especially in the context of networks. Here we propose a machine learning method to study the functionality of mutually exclusive genes in the networks derived from mutation associations, gene-gene interactions, and graph clustering. These networks have indicated critical biological components in the essential pathways, especially those mutated at low frequency. Studying the network and not just the impact of a single gene significantly increases the statistical power of clinical analysis. The proposed method identified important driver genes with different frequencies. We studied the function and the associated pathways in which the candidate driver genes participate. By introducing lower-frequency genes, we recognized less studied cancer-related pathways. We also proposed a novel clustering method to specify driver modules. We evaluated each driver module with different criteria, including the terms of biological processes and the number of simultaneous mutations in each cancer. Materials and implementations are available at: https://github.com/MahnazHabibi/MutationAnalysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Finding logic models for sustainable marine development that deliver on social equity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yoshitaka Ota, Gerald G. Singh, Timothy Clark, Marleen S. Schutter, Wilf Swartz, Andrés M. Cisneros-Montemayor</p>

Sustainable development is often represented as contributing to desirable outcomes across economic, environmental, and social goals, yet policies and interventions attempting to deliver sustainable development often disagree on the order in which these categories of goals should be addressed. In this Essay, we identify and review 5 approaches (called logic models) for sustainable development in ocean systems based on existing policies and interventions and consider the evidence for their contributions to equity—the ultimate goal of sustainable development according to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Two of the 5 logic models prioritize economic growth and lead to social and environmental benefits, 2 prioritize environmental health as a prerequisite for sustainable economic and social benefits, and the final logic model is community driven and prioritizes social dimensions. Looking towards the 2030 maturation of the SDGs, we will need to understand what models are best suited to deliver on equity gains and prevent future inequities in development and how best to operationalize them.

                <p>by Catherine E. Lovelock, Edward Barbier, Carlos M. Duarte</p>

Mangroves have been converted and degraded for decades. Rates of loss have declined over the past decades, but achieving resilient coastlines requires both conservation and restoration. Here, we outline the challenges for the global restoration of mangroves and what actions could enhance restoration. Ambitious global targets for mangrove restoration, if successful, could deliver global benefits of carbon sequestration, fisheries production, biodiversity, and coastal protection. However, large-scale mangrove planting efforts have often failed, and smaller projects may not deliver landscape-scale benefits, even though they are more suited to community management. Solutions to achieving global targets include reducing risks of large projects and increasing the uptake and effectiveness of smaller projects. Sustainable mangrove restoration requires investment in capacity building in communities and institutions, and mechanisms to match restoration opportunities with prospective supporters and investors. Global reporting standards will support adaptive management and help fully understand and monitor the benefits of mangrove restoration.

Multiomics approaches need to be applied in the central Arctic Ocean to benchmark biodiversity change and to identify novel species and their genes. As part of MOSAiC, EcoOmics will therefore be essential for conservation and sustainable bioprospecting in one of the least explored ecosystems on Earth.

The MOSAiC ice-drift study across the Arctic Ocean is providing unprecedented opportunities to explore one of the least known ecosystems on Earth. In this Community Page, members of the EcoOmics project explain how data from MOSAiC will be used to study unique species, from viruses to multicellular animals.

                <p>by Tiara Moore</p>

Black in Marine Science was founded in 2020 to celebrate black marine scientists, spread environmental awareness, and inspire the next generation of scientific thought leaders. Black in Marine Science began as a week but has become a movement.

After decades of feeling isolated in the field, a group of Black marine scientists and allies came together to create the first ever Black In Marine Science Week. This Perspective discusses how the Black In Marine Science organizing team realized that after the major success of the week and the uncovering of shared experiences of racism, there was much more work to be done.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Five actionable pillars to engage the next generation of leaders in the co-design of transformative ocean solutions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erin V. Satterthwaite, Valeriya Komyakova, Natalia G. Erazo, Louise Gammage, Gabriel A. Juma, Rachel Kelly, Daniel Kleinman, Delphine Lobelle, Rachel Sapery James, Norlaila Binti Mohd Zanuri</p>

Solutions to complex and unprecedented global challenges are urgently needed. Overcoming these challenges requires input and innovative solutions from all experts, including Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs). To achieve diverse inclusion from ECOPs, fundamental changes must occur at all levels—from individuals to organizations. Drawing on insights from across the globe, we propose 5 actionable pillars that support the engagement of ECOPs in co-design processes that address ocean sustainability: sharing knowledge through networks and mentorship, providing cross-boundary training and opportunities, incentivizing and celebrating knowledge co-design, creating inclusive and participatory governance structures, and catalyzing culture change for inclusivity. Foundational to all actions are the cross-cutting principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity. In addition, the pillars are cross-boundary in nature, including collaboration and innovation across sectors, disciplines, regions, generations, and backgrounds. Together, these recommendations provide an actionable and iterative path toward inclusive engagement and intergenerational exchange that can develop ocean solutions for a sustainable future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Reimagining sustainable fisheries</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Jacquet, Daniel Pauly</p>

The current conception of sustainable fisheries focuses on single “stocks” targeted by industrial fisheries to supply growing global markets, including those for fishmeal. Sustainable fisheries should be reimagined to minimize exploitation and prioritize artisanal and subsistence fishing that feeds people.

Wild animals cannot simultaneously be sustainably exploited and supply growing global markets. This Perspective argues that the current definition of ‘sustainable fisheries’ should be reimagined to minimize exploitation and prioritize small-scale artisanal and subsistence fishing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Living in relationship with the Ocean to transform governance in the UN Ocean Decade</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle Bender, Rachel Bustamante, Kelsey Leonard</p>

Humanity’s relationship with the Ocean needs to be transformed to effectively address the multitude of governance crises facing the Ocean, including overfishing, climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. Earth law, including Rights of Nature, provides a pathway to center humanity as a part of Nature and transform our relationship from one of dominion and separateness towards holism and mutual enhancement. Within the Earth law framework, an Ocean-centered approach views humanity as interconnected with the Ocean, recognizes societies’ collective duty and reciprocal responsibility to protect and conserve the Ocean, and puts aside short-term gain to respect and protect future generations of all life and the Ocean’s capacity to regenerate and sustain natural cycles. This Essay presents Ocean-centered governance as an approach to help achieve the 10 challenges for collective impact put forward as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and therefore living in a harmonious relationship with the Ocean.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Advancing the protection of marine life through genomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Madeleine J. H. van Oppen, Melinda A. Coleman</p>

The rapid growth in genomic techniques provides the potential to transform how we protect, manage, and conserve marine life. Further, solutions to boost the resilience of marine species to climate change and other disturbances that characterize the Anthropocene require transformative approaches, made more effective if guided by genomic data. Although genetic techniques have been employed in marine conservation for decades and the availability of genomic data is rapidly expanding, widespread application still lags behind other data types. This Essay reviews how genetics and genomics have been utilized in management initiatives for ocean conservation and restoration, highlights success stories, and presents a pathway forward to enhance the uptake of genomic data for protecting our oceans.

                Background: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which can impact quality of life. In the past decade multiple biologic treatments have been released with encouraging results. Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-23p19. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in psoriasis, but response differences among patient subpopulations have not been extensively reported. Furthermore, patients in real life are often non-eligible for clinical trials and their responses may differ from pivotal studies. Methods: This is a retrospective, observational study of real clinical practice of patients receiving guselkumab treatment in Spain. Patients treated with guselkumab were included between February 2019 to December 2021. This study evaluates the potential differential effect of baseline demographic and disease characteristics on therapeutic responses to guselkumab. We measured effectiveness and survival by the psoriasis area and severity index, the dermatology life quality index as well as Kaplan meier curves, respectively. Categorical and quantitative variables are reported with frequencies, and with mean and standard deviation, respectively. Differences between groups in psoriasis area and severity index and dermatology life quality index, were calculated using a mixed-effects analysis. Survival was calculated using Kaplan meier curves and log-rank tests. Results: A total of 87 patients were included. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and survival of guselkumab attending to demographic characteristics. No differences in psoriasis area and severity index or dermatology life quality index baseline values or therapeutic responses were noted at 52 weeks of follow-up among all the subgroups analysed (age, sex, psoriasis duration, body mass index, and comorbidities). A difference in drug survival was only seen between gender groups. Conclusions: Our research has demonstrated the consistency of guselkumab effectiveness across patient subgroups. No baseline features affected the effectiveness or drug survival of guselkumab, except for lower drug survival in female patients.

in patients with multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ocrelizumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, counteracts induction of humoral immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess if serum ocrelizumab concentration measured at time of vaccination could predict the humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In 52 MS patients, we found ocrelizumab concentration at time of vaccination to be a good predictor for SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-RBD titers after vaccination (comparable to B-cell count). As the course of ocrelizumab concentration may be predicted using pharmacokinetic models, this may be a superior biomarker to guide optimal timing for vaccinations in B-cell depleted MS patients.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate stroke outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke overall and by ethnicity in a population-based, longitudinal study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>First-ever ischemic strokes (2014–2019, n = 1,332) among Mexican American persons (n = 807) and non-Hispanic white persons (n = 525) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project. Data were collected from patient or proxy interviews (baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke) and medical records, including functional (activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living score), neurological (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), cognitive (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination), and quality of life (QOL) outcomes (12-domain Stroke-specific Quality of Life scale). Outcome trajectories were analyzed using multivariable adjusted linear models, with generalized estimating equations to account for within-subject correlations; interactions between ethnicity and time were included to investigate ethnic differences in outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median age was 67 years (interquartile range 58,78), 48.5% were women, and 60.6% were Mexican American persons. For all outcomes, significant improvement was seen between 3 and 6 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for all), with stability between 6 and 12 months. Mexican American persons had significantly worse outcomes compared with non-Hispanic white persons at all time points (3, 6, and 12 months), with the exception of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, which did not differ by ethnicity at 6 and 12 months, and the average change in outcomes did not vary significantly by ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Outcomes were at their worst at 3 months post-stroke, and ethnic disparities were already present, suggesting the need for early assessment and strategies to improve outcomes and possibly reduce disparities. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our aim was to assess the real-world effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter survey compiling retrospective data from 79 PML patients, including 38 published cases and 41 unpublished cases, who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as add-on to standard of care. One-year follow-up data were analyzed to determine clinical outcomes and safety profile. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with 1-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Predisposing conditions included hematological malignancy (n = 38, 48.1%), primary immunodeficiency (n = 14, 17.7%), human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 12, 15.2%), inflammatory disease (n = 8, 10.1%), neoplasm (n = 5, 6.3%), and transplantation (n = 2, 2.5%). Pembrolizumab was most commonly used (n = 53, 67.1%). One-year survival was 51.9% (41/79). PML–immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was reported in 15 of 79 patients (19%). Pretreatment expression of programmed cell death-1 on circulating T cells did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Development of contrast enhancement on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at least once during follow-up (OR = 3.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.20–8.72, <i>p</i> = 0.02) was associated with 1-year survival. Cerebrospinal fluid JC polyomavirus DNA load decreased significantly by 1-month follow-up in survivors compared to nonsurvivors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Thirty-two adverse events occurred among 24 of 79 patients (30.4%), and led to treatment discontinuation in 7 of 24 patients (29.1%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this noncontrolled retrospective study of patients with PML who were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, mortality remains high. Development of inflammatory features or overt PML-IRIS was commonly observed. This study highlights that use of immune checkpoint inhibitors should be strictly personalized toward characteristics of the individual PML patient. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the associations between the allergic triad (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) and risk of dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants comprised 6,785,948 adults aged ≥40 years who participated in a national health examination in 2009 without any history of dementia before baseline. From 2009 to 2017, we prospectively investigated the associations between physician-diagnosed allergic diseases and risk of incident dementia (all-cause, Alzheimer's disease [AD], vascular dementia [VaD]) ascertained using national health insurance claims data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During 8.1 years of follow-up, 260,705 dementia cases (195,739 AD, 32,789 VaD) were identified. Allergic diseases were positively associated with dementia risk. Compared with individuals without allergic diseases, multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause dementia were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–1.22) in those with asthma, 1.10 (95% CI 1.09–1.12) with allergic rhinitis, 1.16 (95% CI 1.11–1.21) with atopic dermatitis, and 1.13 (95% CI 1.12–1.14) with any of these allergies. Similarly, individuals with any of the allergic triad had a higher risk of AD (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.14–1.17) and VaD (HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.06) than those without any allergic disease. As the number of comorbid allergic diseases increased, the risk of dementia increased linearly (<i>P</i>
<sub>trend</sub> ≤ 0.002). Compared with individuals without allergies, those with all three allergic diseases had substantially increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.35–1.75), AD (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.25–1.70), and VaD (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.44–2.75).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia and subtypes, with dose–effect relationships with the severity of allergic diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Awareness and intention to register halal certification of micro and small-scale food enterprises [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper discusses halal awareness of MSE food producers in West Java Province, Indonesia. Halal awareness is the first step toward obtaining halal certificates, which confirm that the product is lawful according to Islamic Sharia. Unfortunately, despite Islam being the religion of most Indonesians, most food sold in the market lacks a halal certificate due to a lack of awareness among food producers about the importance of selling halal-certified foods. Methods: This study aims at measuring the level of halal awareness and the intention of MSE food producers to register halal certification. Halal awareness is assumed to be influenced by knowledge of halal and the food producers’ perception of the benefits of halal certificates. Furthermore, halal awareness, attitudes, and perception of ease of procedures will encourage the intention to register halal certification. An electronic Google Form with a cover letter and a set of questionnaires was distributed to collect data. Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was chosen to evaluate the adopted theoretical models in the exploratory research.. Results: The results show that halal awareness is influenced by knowledge of halal and perception of its benefits. Moreover, halal awareness influences positively the intention to obtain a halal certificate, but the intention is not significantly affected by attitudes to produce halal foods and perception of procedures for obtaining halal certification. This shows that halal awareness will increase the intention to register halal certification. However,  misconceptions about the procedures for obtaining halal certificates keep them from registering. Conclusions: MSE food producers in West Java Province, Indonesia have a good level of awareness about halal food. However, their products are not halal-certified due to the perception of the procedures for obtaining halal certificates are relatively complicated and costly for them.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Feasibility of an intervention for increasing moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) in primary school physical education: a study protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Most primary school Physical Education (PE) has relatively little health-enhancing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). - A promising theory and evidence-based intervention, the ‘SHARP Principles’ model, has been effective in making PE lessons more active in one area of England. This protocol paper explains the rationale for use of the SHARP intervention, and the methods used to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a version of SHARP translated for use in Scotland (SHARP Scotland). Methods: The feasibility of SHARP Scotland will be evaluated by key areas of focus for feasibility studies: Acceptability, Implementation, Integration, Limited Efficacy Testing. A combination of process measures, including observations, session delivery records, accelerometry-data collection, questionnaires, and semi-structured qualitative focus groups with teachers and pupils will be used. The feasibility and suitability of the SHARP Scotland intervention for a future Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will be assessed. The study will involve children from 8-11 years old (Primary 4 to 6) in two schools, one large urban school, and one smaller school; four classes will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (will be taught by class teachers with SHARP approach training), and four classes randomly assigned to the usual-care (standard curriculum) control group (taught by class teachers without SHARP training). Within the 8-week intervention, MVPA in the intervention group will be targeted by encouraging class teachers to deliver their PE classes in more active ways, following SHARP Principles. A maximum of 64 PE lessons delivered in a SHARP way will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion: The outcome of this study will be an assessment of whether applying the SHARP intervention is feasible in Scottish schools. Identification of any modifications to the intervention or evaluation which are required will provide insight for a fully powered effectiveness trial in the future, if appropriate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Polypharmacological drug design opportunities against Parkinson's disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson's disease is an attractive disease model to extend research towards a better understanding of the interrelationship between genes and the environment (exposome) therefore is an ideal model for a polypharmacological approach due to its clinical heterogeneity. Methods: In this paper, we present a series of polypharmacological chemical scaffolds extracted from ChEMBL 30 Database, with two or more targets of PD-related proteins obtained through chemoinformatics methods. This way, we describe the first adaptation of the Dual Activity Difference (DAD) map that allows the direct identification of "dual activity cliffs". Results: We identified 25 antiparkinson small molecules whose pharmacological targets are directed to dopaminergic and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors; 2 small molecules with three pharmacological targets with norepinephrine transporter, dopaminergic D1-D2 and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors; 6 with both targets norepinephrine transporter and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors; 2 small molecules with norepinephrine transporter and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors and 1 with both adenosine A2a and Dopamine D1-D5 receptors. Conclusion: Chemoinformatics methods identified 36 polypharmacological chemical scaffolds related to Parkinson's disease. Demonstrating that the design of polypharmacological drugs is an opportunity in PD.

                Introduction: Indonesia is the country with the highest smoking rate in Southeast Asia and the third-highest globally. Smoking has become one of Indonesia's biggest addiction problems. The goal of this research is to develop smoking behavior intervention based on an implicit approach. Methods: This article contains a two-step study that was part of a comprehensive study on smoking behavior in Indonesia. The first study, applying measurement of Stroop task to 117 male-university-students with results revealed that smoking behavior was associated with attention bias. This result is the basis for developing an implicit approach-based intervention. In the second study, the research aims to develop an intervention by investigating the effects of the experimental retraining by manipulating the automatic-avoidance-action tendencies using an approach-avoidance task (AAT) on 40 male university student smokers that proved to have an attentional bias in the first study. Results: The outcomes of the studies showed that the retraining (six weeks, twice a week) proved to shape the AAT effect and reduce the cigarettes consumption of the smokers. This pilot research becomes initial step to develop smoking cessation interventions in Indonesia using an implicit cognition approach.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Internally generated time in the rodent hippocampus is logarithmically compressed</a></h4>

              
                The Weber-Fechner law proposes that our perceived sensory input increases with physical input on a logarithmic scale. Hippocampal 'time cells' carry a record of recent experience by firing sequentially during a circumscribed period of time after a triggering stimulus. Different cells have'time fields' at different delays up to at least tens of seconds. Past studies suggest that time cells represent a compressed timeline by demonstrating that fewer time cells fire late in the delay and their time fields are wider. This paper asks whether the compression of time cells obeys the Weber-Fechner Law. Time cells were studied with a hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously accounts for the firing pattern at the trial level, cell level, and population level. This procedure allows separate estimates of the within-trial receptive field width and the across-trial variability. After isolating across-trial variability, time field width increased linearly with delay. Further, the time cell population was distributed evenly along a logarithmic time axis. These findings provide strong quantitative evidence that the neural temporal representation in rodent hippocampus is logarithmically compressed and obeys a neural Weber-Fechner Law.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Postsynaptic plasticity of cholinergic synapses underlies the induction and expression of appetitive and familiarity memories in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In vertebrates, several forms of memory-relevant synaptic plasticity involve postsynaptic rearrangements of glutamate receptors. In contrast, previous work indicates that <i>Drosophila</i> and other invertebrates store memories using presynaptic plasticity of cholinergic synapses. Here, we provide evidence for postsynaptic plasticity at cholinergic output synapses from the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom bodies (MBs). We find that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit α5 is required within specific MB output neurons (MBONs) for appetitive memory induction, but is dispensable for aversive memories. In addition, nAChR α2 subunits mediate memory expression and likely function downstream of α5 and the postsynaptic scaffold protein Dlg. We show that postsynaptic plasticity traces can be induced independently of the presynapse, and that <i>in vivo</i> dynamics of α2 nAChR subunits are changed both in the context of associative and non-associative (familiarity) memory formation, underlying different plasticity rules. Therefore, regardless of neurotransmitter identity, key principles of postsynaptic plasticity support memory storage across phyla.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discrete GPCR-triggered endocytic modes enable β-arrestins to flexibly regulate cell signaling</a></h4>

              
                β-arrestins are master regulators of cellular signaling that operate by desensitizing ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the plasma membrane and promoting their subsequent endocytosis. The endocytic activity of β-arrestins is ligand-dependent, triggered by GPCR binding, and increasingly recognized to have a multitude of downstream signaling and trafficking consequences that are specifically programmed by the bound GPCR. However, only one biochemical 'mode' for GPCR-mediated triggering of the endocytic activity is presently known- displacement of the β-arrestin C-terminus (CT) to expose CCP-binding determinants that are masked in the inactive state. Here we revise this view by uncovering a second mode of GPCR-triggered endocytic activity that is independent of the β-arrestin CT and, instead, requires the cytosolic base of the β-arrestin C-lobe (CLB). We further show each of the discrete endocytic modes is triggered in a receptor-specific manner, with GPCRs that bind β-arrestin transiently ('class A') primarily triggering the CLB-dependent mode and GPCRs that bind more stably ('class B') triggering both the CT and CLB -dependent modes in combination. Moreover, we show that different modes have opposing effects on the net signaling output of receptors- with the CLB-dependent mode promoting rapid signal desensitization and the CT-dependent mode enabling prolonged signaling. Together, these results fundamentally revise understanding of how β-arrestins operate as efficient endocytic adaptors while facilitating diversity and flexibility in the control of cell signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying how post-transcriptional noise and gene copy number variation bias transcriptional parameter inference from mRNA distributions</a></h4>

              
                Transcriptional rates are often estimated by fitting the distribution of mature mRNA numbers measured using smFISH (single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization) with the distribution predicted by the telegraph model of gene expression, which defines two promoter states of activity and inactivity. However, fluctuations in mature mRNA numbers are strongly affected by processes downstream of transcription. In addition, the telegraph model assumes one gene copy, but in experiments cells may have two gene copies as cells replicate their genome during the cell cycle. Whilst it is often presumed that post-transcriptional noise and gene copy number variation affect transcriptional parameter estimation, the size of the error introduced remains unclear. To address this issue, here we measure both mature and nascent mRNA distributions of GAL10 in yeast cells using smFISH and classify each cell according to its cell cycle phase. We infer transcriptional parameters from mature and nascent mRNA distributions, with and without accounting for cell cycle phase and compare the results to live-cell transcription measurements of the same gene. We find that: (i) correcting for cell cycle dynamics decreases the promoter switching rates and the initiation rate, and increases the fraction of time spent in the active state, as well as the burst size; (ii) additional correction for post-transcriptional noise leads to further increases in the burst size and to a large reduction in the errors in parameter estimation. Furthermore, we outline how to correctly adjust for measurement noise in smFISH due to uncertainty in transcription site localisation when introns cannot be labelled. Simulations with parameters estimated from nascent smFISH data, which is corrected for cell cycle phases and measurement noise, leads to autocorrelation functions that agree with those obtained from live-cell imaging.

                Orb2 the Drosophila homolog of Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) forms prion-like oligomers. These oligomers consist of Orb2A and Orb2B isoforms and their formation are dependent on the oligomerization of the Orb2A isoform. Drosophila with a mutation diminishing Orb2A's prion-like oligomerization forms long-term memory but fails to maintain it over time. Since, this prion-like oligomerization of Orb2A plays a crucial role in the maintenance of memory, here we aim to find what regulates this oligomerization. In an immunoprecipitation-based screen, we identify interactors of Orb2A in the Hsp40 and Hsp70 families of proteins. Amongst these, we find an Hsp40 family protein Mrj as a regulator of the conversion of Orb2A to its prion-like form. Mrj interacts with Hsp70 proteins and acts as a chaperone by interfering with the aggregation of pathogenic Huntingtin. Unlike its mammalian homolog, we find Drosophila Mrj is neither an essential gene nor causes any gross neurodevelopmental defect. We observe a loss of Mrj results in a reduction in Orb2 oligomers. Further, the knockdown of Mrj in the mushroom body neurons results in a deficit in long-term memory. Our work implicates a chaperone Mrj in mechanisms of memory regulation through controlling the oligomerization of Orb2A and its association with the translating polysomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient simulation of neural development using shared memory parallelization</a></h4>

              
                The Neural Development Simulator, NeuroDevSim, is a Python module that simulates the most important aspects of development: growth, migration and pruning. It uses an agent-based modeling approach inherited from the NeuroMaC software. Each cycle, agents called fronts execute code. In the case of a growing dendritic or axonal front this will be a choice between extension, branching or growth termination. Somatic fronts can migrate to new positions and any front can be retracted to prune parts of neurons. NeuroDevSim is a multi-core program that uses an innovative shared memory approach to achieve parallel processing without messaging. We demonstrate close to linear strong scaling for medium size models for up to 32 cores and have run large models successfully on 128 cores. Most of the shared memory parallelism is achieved without memory locking. Instead cores have write privileges to private sections of arrays only, while being able to read the entire shared array. Memory conflicts are avoided by a coding rule that allows only active fronts to use methods that need writing access. The exception is collision detection, which is needed to avoid growth of physically overlapping structures. Here a locking mechanism was necessary to control access to grid points that register the location of nearby fronts. A custom approach using a serialized lock broker was able to manage both read and write locking. NeuroDevSim allows easy modeling of neural development for models ranging from a few complex to thousands of simple neurons or a mixture of both.

                Adaptive locomotion of animals depends on proprioception, which provides feedback on body postures to reshape motor output. How proprioception interacts with motor circuits and contributes to motor adaptation remains unclear. Here we characterize proprioception-mediated homeostatic control of undulatory movement in the roundworm C. elegans. The worm responds to optogenetically or mechanically induced decreases in mid-body bending amplitude by increasing its anterior amplitude. Conversely, it responds to increased mid-body amplitude by decreasing the anterior amplitude. This compensatory postural response requires dopaminergic PDE neurons to sense mid-body bending and signal to AVK interneurons via the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3. The FMRFamide-like neuropeptide FLP-1 from AVK regulates SMB head motor neurons to modulate anterior bending. We propose that this mechanism optimizes locomotion efficiency. Our findings demonstrate a functional motif for homeostatic behavioral control arising from the interplay between proprioception and neuromodulator signaling within a compact nervous system.

                Mammalian Muumlller glia (MG) possess limited regenerative capacities. However, the intrinsic capacity of mammalian MG to transdifferentiate to generate mature neurons without transgenic manipulations remains speculative. Here we show that MAP4K4, MAP4K6 and MAP4K7, which are conserved Misshapen subfamily of ste20 kinases homologs, repress YAP activity in mammalian MG and therefore restrict their ability to be reprogrammed. However, by treating with a small molecule inhibitor of MAP4K4/6/7, mouse MG regain their ability to proliferate and enter into a retinal progenitor cell (RPC)-like state after NMDA-induced retinal damage; such plasticity was lost in YAP knockout MG. Moreover, spontaneous trans-differentiation of MG into retinal neurons expressing both amacrine and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) markers occurs after inhibitor withdrawal. Taken together, these findings suggest that MAP4Ks block the reprogramming capacity of MG in a YAP-dependent manner in adult mammals, which provides a novel avenue for the pharmaceutical induction of retinal regeneration in vivo.

                Primary sensory regions are believed to instantiate stable neural representations, yet a number of recent rodent studies suggest instead that representations drift over time. We analyzed a massive fMRI dataset using an image-computable encoding model and found systematic changes in model fits that exhibited cumulative drift over many months. Convergent analyses pinpoint changes in neural responsivity as the source of the drift, while population-level representational dissimilarities between visual stimuli were unchanged, suggesting that downstream cortical areas may read-out a stable representation, even as representations within V1 drift.

                When concurrent visual and tactile stimuli are repeatedly presented with a spatial offset, even unisensory tactile stimuli are afterwards perceived with a spatial bias towards the previously presented visual stimuli. This so-called visuotactile ventriloquism aftereffect reflects visuotactile recalibration. It is unknown whether this recalibration occurs within a bodily map and interacts with perceived features like shape and size of body parts. Here, we applied tactile stimuli to participants' hidden left hand and simultaneously presented visual stimuli with spatial offsets that - if integrated with the tactile stimuli - implied an enlarged hand size. We either used a fixed spatial mapping between tactile and visual positions ('congruent'), or a scrambled ('incongruent') mapping. We assessed implicitly perceived hand size via two independent behavioral assessments: pointing movements to unisensory tactile stimuli and tactile distance judgments. Moreover, we assessed explicitly perceived change in hand size with perceptual self-reports. Especially after congruent recalibration, participants localized unimodal tactile stimuli as if they were aiming at an enlarged hand. They also reported tactile distance as shorter after congruent than incongruent recalibration. These modulations resemble those obtained after using tools that prolong the arm and extend reaching space; they suggest that recalibration affected a common, implicit hand representation that underlies both tasks. In contrast, explicit perceptual self-reports did not differ significantly between congruent and incongruent recalibration. Thus, simple visuotactile stimuli are sufficient to modify implicitly perceived body size, indicating a tight link of low-level multisensory processes such as the visuotactile ventriloquism aftereffect and body representation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological signatures of targeted memory reactivation during sleep are not accompanied by motor performance improvements in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during post-learning sleep enhances memory consolidation in young adults by modulating electrophysiological markers of plasticity (i.e., slow waves (SW) and slow/sigma oscillation coupling). Interestingly, older adults are known to exhibit deficits in motor memory consolidation, an impairment that has been linked to age-related degradations in the same sleep features sensitive to TMR interventions. We thus hypothesized that TMR would enhance motor memory consolidation in older adults via the modulation of these electrophysiological markers. Seventeen healthy older participants (age range: 50-74) were trained on a bimanual motor task involving two sequences that were cued by different sounds. Participants were retested after a 90-minute nap and the following morning. During non-rapid eye movement sleep of the post-learning nap, two different auditory cues were played: one sound associated to a learned - and thus reactivated - sequence and one control sound not associated to learning. Results indicated that changes in performance did not differ between reactivated and non-reactivated sequences. Yet, analyses of electrophysiological data revealed that TMR increased SW density. Moreover, phase-amplitude coupling between slow (0.5-2 Hz) and beta (around 20 Hz) oscillations before the SW trough was strengthened by the presentation of the unassociated sounds. Furthermore, the increase in slow/sigma (12-16 Hz) oscillation coupling around 1.75 sec post-SW trough for unassociated (as compared to associated) sounds was related to higher TMR-induced performance enhancement. Our results collectively demonstrate that, in older adults, TMR did not impact motor performance but modulated sleep-related markers of plasticity likely involved in protection against irrelevant information.

                The major protein-degradation machine, the proteasome, functions at brain synapses and regulates long-term information storage. Here we found that the two essential subcomplexes of the proteasome, the regulatory (19S) and catalytic (20S) particles that recognize and degrade substrates, are differentially distributed within individual rat cortical neurons. Using super-resolution microscopy, we discovered a surprising abundance of free particles (19S) near synapses. The free neuronal 19S particles bind and deubiquitylate Lys63-ubiquitin, a non-proteasome targeting ub-linkage. Pull-down assays revealed a significant over-representation of synaptic molecules as Lys63 interactors. Inhibition of 19S deubiquitylase activity significantly altered excitatory synaptic transmission and reduced the synaptic availability of AMPA receptors at multiple trafficking points in a proteasome-independent manner. Together, these results reveal a moonlighting function of the regulatory proteasomal subcomplex near synapses.

                Sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions are frequent comorbidities of Parkinson's disease (PD), a disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Although sleep/circadian disturbances can be observed years before diagnosing PD, it remains unclear whether circadian clocks have a causal role in the degenerative process. We demonstrated here that circadian clocks regulate the rhythmicity and magnitude of the vulnerability of DA neurons to oxidative stress in Drosophila. Circadian pacemaker neurons are presynaptic to a subset of DA neurons and rhythmically modulate their susceptibility to degeneration. The arrhythmic period (per) gene null mutation exacerbates the age-dependent loss of DA neurons and, in combination with brief oxidative stress, causes premature animal death. These findings suggest that circadian clock disruption promotes dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Modulation of Pulsatile Activities of Oxytocin Neurons in Lactating Wild-type Mice</a></h4>

              
                Breastfeeding, which is essential for the survival of mammalian infants, is critically mediated by pulsatile secretion of the pituitary hormone oxytocin from the central oxytocin neurons located in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei of mothers. Despite its importance, the molecular and neural circuit mechanisms of the milk ejection reflex remain poorly understood, in part because a mouse model to study lactation was only recently established. In our previous study, we successfully introduced fiber photometry-based chronic imaging of the pulsatile activities of oxytocin neurons during lactation. However, the necessity of Cre recombinase-based double knock-in mice substantially compromised the use of various Cre-dependent neuroscience toolkits. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a simple Cre-free method for monitoring oxytocin neurons by an adeno-associated virus vector driving GCaMP6s under a 2.6 kb mouse oxytocin mini-promoter. Using this method, we monitored calcium ion transients of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus in wild-type C57BL/6N and ICR mothers without genetic crossing. By combining this method with video recordings of mothers and pups, we found that the pulsatile activities of oxytocin neurons require physical mother-pup contact for the milk ejection reflex. Notably, the intensities and/or frequencies of photometric signals were dynamically modulated by mother-pup reunions after isolation and during natural weaning stages. Collectively, the present study illuminates the temporal dynamics of pulsatile activities of oxytocin neurons in wild-type mice and provides a tool to characterize maternal oxytocin functions.

                Multiphoton calcium imaging is one of the most powerful tools in modern neuroscience. However, multiphoton data require significant pre-processing of images and post-processing of extracted signals. As a result, many algorithms and pipelines have been developed for the analysis of multiphoton data, particularly two-photon imaging data. Most current studies use one of several algorithms and pipelines that are published and publicly available, and add customized upstream and downstream analysis elements to fit the needs of individual researchers. The vast differences in algorithm choices, parameter settings, pipeline composition, and data sources combine to make collaboration difficult, and raise questions about the reproducibility and robustness of experimental results. We present our solution, called NeuroWRAP, which is a tool that wraps multiple published algorithms together, and enables integration of custom algorithms. It enables development of collaborative, shareable custom workflows and reproducible data analysis for multiphoton calcium imaging data enabling easy collaboration between researchers. NeuroWRAP implements an approach to evaluate the sensitivity and robustness of the configured pipelines. When this sensitivity analysis is applied to a crucial step of image analysis, cell segmentation, we find a substantial difference between two popular workflows, CaImAn and Suite2p. NeuroWRAP harnesses this difference by introducing consensus analysis, utilizing two workflows in conjunction to significantly increase the trustworthiness and robustness of cell segmentation results.

                TPL2 (MAP3K8) is a central signaling node in the inflammatory response of peripheral immune cells. We find that TPL2 kinase activity modulates microglial cytokine release and is required for microglia-mediated neuron death in vitro. In acute in vivo neuroinflammation settings, TPL2 kinase activity regulates microglia activation states and brain cytokine levels. In a tauopathy model of chronic neurodegeneration, loss of TPL2 kinase activity reduces neuroinflammation and rescues synapse loss, brain volume loss, and behavioral deficits. Single-cell RNAseq analysis indicates protection in the tauopathy model was associated with reductions in activated microglia subpopulations as well as infiltrating peripheral immune cells. Overall, using various models, we find that TPL2 kinase activity can promote multiple harmful consequences of microglial activation in the brain including cytokine release, iNOS induction, astrocyte activation, and immune cell infiltration. Consequently, inhibiting TPL2 kinase activity could represent a potential therapeutic strategy in neurodegenerative conditions.

                Structural similarity networks are a central focus of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research into human brain connectomes in health and disease. We present Morphometric INverse Divergence (MIND), a robust method to estimate within-subject structural similarity between cortical areas based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the multivariate distributions of their structural features. Compared to the prior approach of morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) on N>10,000 data from the ABCD cohort, MIND networks were more consistent with known cortical symmetry, cytoarchitecture, and (in N=19 macaques) gold-standard tract-tracing connectivity, and were more invariant to cortical parcellation. Importantly, MIND networks were remarkably coupled with cortical gene co-expression, providing fresh evidence for the unified architecture of brain structure and transcription. Using kinship (N=1282) and genetic data (N=4085), we characterized the heritability of MIND phenotypes, identifying stronger genetic influence on the relationship between structurally divergent regions compared to structurally similar regions. Overall, MIND presents a biologically-validated lens for analyzing the structural organization of the cortex using readily-available MRI measurements.

                Discerning safety from threat and positive or negative outcomes of adversity are fundamental for mental health. Many brain structures have been implicated in both adaptive and maladaptive stress coping, however, how multiple regions function together as a network in the processing of this information is unclear. Here, we recorded local field potentials from seven regions of the mesolimbic-hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network (MLHFC) of male rats during the conditioning of a stimulus (CS) to the absence (safety) and then to the anticipation (fear) of footshocks, and during an approach-avoidance task. We developed a machine learning pipeline to investigate the relevance of specific features of oscillatory activity in the decoding of fear versus safety and approach versus avoidance. We found that decoding performance increased as a function of the number of brain regions included, reaching the best classification if all regions were considered. In addition, the best decoding was obtained from frequencies within the theta range (4-10 Hz). Remarkably, decoder models showed robust generalization within but not between individuals. Nevertheless, we were also able to identify patterns of MLHFC activity that decoded stress coping states from all rats. These patterns were characterized by increased brain-wide theta synchrony during fear and preceding approach. Our results indicate that stress coping information is encoded at the brain-wide level and highlight individual variability in this neural processing. Our findings also suggest that MLHFC network theta activity underlies active stress coping with both aversive and positive motivational valences.

                The National Institute of Mental Health launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to identify common biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders. A central challenge for this approach is to identify reliable biobehavioral paradigms that engage specific neural circuits implicated across psychiatric disorders. Delay discounting paradigms have been proposed as a promising candidate because both excessive and insufficient tendency to discount future rewards have been reported across a wide range of diagnoses. Because delay discounting involves multiple facets of neurocognitive functions, identifying specific neural systems engaged during the task can inform ongoing efforts in clinical neuroscience to link neural patterns to a core symptom dimension. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis of 72 fMRI studies of delay discounting by common analytic approaches (contrasts) to test the predictions of commonly proposed mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. Despite being widely used in previous studies, comparing impulsive and patient choices did not reveal any reliable clustering of effects. Our results instead revealed that the subjective value, magnitude, and delay contrasts reliably engage the valuation network, with the subjective value contrast eliciting more widespread activation. Furthermore, both the difficulty and task contrasts engage the frontoparietal network. Taken together, our findings suggest that both reward valuation and action selection are important but do not fully explain impulsive versus patient choices. Taken together, these results provide further support that delay discounting task is a promising measure of reward valuation that reliably activates the valuation network. In addition, we discuss implications for analytic strategies for future studies in clinical neuroscience.

                Rapid advances in tissue clearing protocols have begun to outpace the capabilities of existing microscope objectives: High-resolution imaging inside cm-sized cleared samples is often not possible as it requires multi-immersion objectives with high numerical aperture (NA > 0.7), long working distance (WD > 10 mm) and a large field-of-view (FOV > 1 mm). Here, we introduce a novel mirror-based optical design, the ''Schmidt objective'', which meets all these criteria despite containing only two optical elements. It consists of a spherical mirror in contact with the immersion medium and an aspherical correction plate. We showcase a multi-photon variant of a Schmidt objective that reaches NA 1.08 at an refractive index of 1.56 and demonstrate its versatility by imaging fixed samples in a wide range of immersion media ranging from air and water to BABB, DBE, and ECI. In addition, we demonstrate in vivo imaging by recording neuronal activity in larval zebrafish.

                To navigate, we must represent information about our place in the environment. Traditional research highlights the role of the hippocampal complex in this process. Spurred by recent research highlighting the widespread cortical encoding of cognitive and motor variables previously thought to have localized function, we hypothesized that navigational variables would be likewise encoded widely, especially in the prefrontal cortex, which is often associated with control of volitional behavior. We recorded neural activity from six prefrontal structures while macaques performed a foraging task in an open enclosure. In all six regions, we found strong encoding of allocentric position, head direction, egocentric boundary distance, and linear and angular velocity. These encodings were not accounted for by distance or time to reward. Strength of coding of all variables increase along a ventral-to-dorsal gradient. Together these results argue that encoding of navigational variables is not localized to the hippocampal complex and support the hypothesis that navigation is continuous with other forms of flexible cognition in the service of action.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model-Constrained Self-supervised Deep Learning Approach to the Quantification of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Data Based on Linear-combination Model Fitting</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: While the recommended analysis method for magnetic resonance spectroscopy data is linear combination model (LCM) fitting, the supervised deep learning (DL) approach for quantification of MR spectroscopy (MRS) data recently showed encouraging results; however, supervised learning requires ground truth fitted spectra, which is not practical. This work investigates the feasibility and efficiency of the LCM-based self-supervised DL method for the analysis of MRS data. Method: We present a novel DL-based method for the quantification of relative metabolite concentrations, using quantum-mechanics simulated metabolite responses and neural networks. We trained, validated, and evaluated the proposed networks with simulated and publicly accessible in-vivo human brain MRS data and compared the performance with traditional methods. A novel adaptive macromolecule fitting algorithm is included. We investigated the performance of the proposed methods in a Monte Carlo (MC) study. Result: The validation using low-SNR simulated data demonstrated that the proposed methods could perform quantification comparably to other methods. The applicability of the proposed method for the quantification of in-vivo MRS data was demonstrated. Our proposed networks have the potential to reduce computation time significantly. Conclusion: The proposed model-constrained deep neural networks trained in a self-supervised manner with complex data can offer fast and efficient quantification of MRS data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Smaller total and subregional cerebellar volumes in posttraumatic stress disorder: a mega-analysis by the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD workgroup</a></h4>

              
                Background: The cerebellum critically contributes to higher-order cognitive and emotional functions such fear learning and memory. Prior research on cerebellar volume in PTSD is scant and has neglected neuroanatomical subdivisions of the cerebellum that differentially map on to motor, cognitive, and affective functions. Methods: We quantified cerebellar lobule volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging in 4,215 adults (PTSD n= 1640; Control n=2575) across 40 sites from the from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD working group. Using a new state-of-the-art deep-learning based approach for automatic cerebellar parcellation, we obtained volumetric estimates for the total cerebellum and 28 subregions. Linear mixed effects models controlling for age, gender, intracranial volume, and site were used to compare cerebellum total and subregional volume in PTSD compared to healthy controls. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control the false discovery rate (p-FDR < 0.05). Results: PTSD was associated with significant grey and white matter reductions of the cerebellum. Compared to controls, people with PTSD demonstrated smaller total cerebellum volume. In addition, people with PTSD showed reduced volume in subregions primarily within the posterior lobe (lobule VIIB, crus II), but also the vermis (VI, VIII), flocculonodular lobe (lobule X), and cerebellar white matter (all p-FDR < 0.05). Effects of PTSD on volume were consistent, and generally more robust, when examining symptom severity rather than diagnostic status. Conclusions: These findings implicate regionally specific cerebellar volumetric differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The cerebellum appears to play an important role in high-order cognitive and emotional processes, far beyond its historical association with vestibulomotor function. Further examination of the cerebellum in trauma-related psychopathology will help to clarify how cerebellar structure and function may disrupt cognitive and affective processes at the center of translational models for PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurofeedback training can modulate task-relevant memory replay in rats</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal replay - the time-compressed, sequential reactivation of ensembles of neurons related to past experience - is a key neural mechanism of memory consolidation. Replay typically coincides with a characteristic pattern of local field potential activity, the sharp-wave ripple (SWR). Reduced SWR rates are associated with cognitive impairment in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that a clinically viable intervention to promote SWRs and replay would prove beneficial. We therefore developed a neurofeedback paradigm for rat subjects in which SWR detection triggered rapid positive feedback in the context of a memory-dependent task. This training protocol increased the prevalence of task-relevant replay during the targeted neurofeedback period by changing the temporal dynamics of SWR occurrence. This increase was also associated with neural and behavioral forms of compensation after the targeted period. These findings reveal short-timescale regulation of SWR generation and demonstrate that neurofeedback is an effective strategy for modulating hippocampal replay.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normative Sex Differences in Cognition and Morphometric Brain Connectivity: Evidence from 30,000+ UK Biobank Participants</a></h4>

              
                There is robust evidence for sex differences in domain-specific cognitive performance in the general population, where females typically show an advantage for verbal memory (VM), while males tend to perform better on tasks of spatial memory (SM). Sex differences in brain structure and connectivity are also well-documented and may provide insight into sex differences in cognition. In this study, we examined sex differences in cognition and morphometric brain connectivity of a large healthy sample (N = 31,180) from the UK Biobank dataset. Using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and regional cortical thickness values, we applied jackknife bias estimation and graph theory to obtain subject-specific measures of morphometric brain connectivity, hypothesizing that sex-related differences in brain network global efficiency, or overall connectivity, would underlie observed cognitive differences. As predicted, females demonstrated better VM performance and males showed an advantage in SM. Females also demonstrated faster processing speed, with no observed sex difference in executive functioning. Males tended to have higher global efficiency, as well as higher regional connectivity (nodal strengths) in both the left and right hemispheres relative to females. Furthermore, higher global efficiency in males was found to mediate observed sex differences in cognition, predicting poorer verbal memory performance, better spatial memory, and slower processing speed in males. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of the way biological sex and differences in cognitive performance are related to morphometric brain connectivity as derived from graph-theoretic methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial complex I controls blood brain barrier permeability</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes are key mediators of energy metabolism in astrocytes and neurons, with subsequent effects on memory, behaviour and neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability are known pathologies in Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases. However, knowledge of how ETC activities regulate metabolic flux and influence permeability in the BBB is lacking. Using metabolic flux control analysis we show that complex I is a critical control point for oxidative flux and permeability in brain microvascular endothelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Inhibition of complex I activity immediately reduced the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) by 60%, leading to an increase in protein transport across the BBB. These events were accompanied by a transient reduction in ATP that was recovered, along with TEER values, over an extended time period. Furthermore, while inhibition of downstream complexes III or IV decreased oxygen respiration rates, no effects on BBB permeability were identified, due to compensatory glycolytic flux and maintenance of ATP synthesis. These data show that mitochondrial complex I is critical for maintaining energy production in endothelial cells and transiently controls BBB permeability, which may contribute to brain disorders where complex I dysfunction is a hallmark.

                Previously, we found that age-dependent beta-amyloid accumulation is not enough to cause synaptic decline. Here, we characterized endolysosomes (late-endosomes and lysosomes) in aged neurons and the aged brain, which might drive synaptic decline since lysosomes are a cellular aging target and relevant for synapses. Neuronal aging induces enlarged endolysosome accumulation in the aged neurons and brain, especially distally, related to the increased anterograde movement. Aged lysosomes abound in neurites but are less degradative due to deacidification despite cathepsin D buildup, leading to late-endosome accumulation. Increasing the acidification of aged lysosomes by ML-SA1 treatment increased degradation and reverted synaptic decline, while lysosome alkalinization by chloroquine treatment mimicked age-dependent lysosome dysfunction and synaptic decline. We identify the deacidification of distal lysosomes as a neuronal mechanism of age-dependent synapse loss. Our findings suggest that future therapeutic strategies to address lysosomal defects might be able to delay age-related synaptic decline.

                Animals can learn to repeat behaviors to earn desired rewards, a process commonly known as reinforcement learning. While previous work has implicated the ascending dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning, little is known about the role of the hippocampus. Here we report that a specific population of hippocampal neurons and their dopaminergic innervation contribute to operant self-stimulation. These neurons are located in the dentate gyrus, receive dopaminergic projections from the locus coeruleus, and express D1 dopamine receptors. Activation of D1+ dentate neurons is sufficient for self-stimulation: mice will press a lever to earn optogenetic activation of these neurons. A similar effect is also observed with selective activation of the locus coeruleus projections to the dentate gyrus, and blocked by D1 receptor antagonism. Calcium imaging of D1+ dentate neurons revealed significant activity at the time of action selection, but not during passive reward delivery. These results reveal the role of dopaminergic innervation of the hippocampus in supporting operant reinforcement.

                Tau protein pathology is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer Disease or frontotemporal dementia. Synaptic dysfunction and abnormal visual evoked potentials have been reported in murine models of tauopathy, but little is known about the state of the network activity on a single neuronal level prior to brain atrophy. In the present study, oscillatory rhythms and single-cell calcium activity of primary visual cortex pyramidal neuron population were investigated in basal and light evoked states in the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model prior to neurodegeneration. We found a decrease in their responsivity and overall activity which was insensitive to GABAergic modulation. Despite an enhancement of basal state coactivation of cortical pyramidal neurons, a loss of input-output synchronicity was observed. Spectral power analysis revealed a reduction of basal theta oscillations in rTg4510 mice. Enhanced susceptibility to a sub-convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol was further indicated by an increase in theta power and higher number of absence-like seizures in rTg4510 compared to control mice. Our results unveil impairments in visual cortical pyramidal neuron processing and define aberrant oscillations as a biomarker candidate in early stages of neurodegenerative tauopathies.

                There is significant evidence suggesting aggregated misfolded alpha-synuclein, a major component of Lewy bodies, propagates in a prion-like manner contributing to disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Animal models are essential for understanding and developing treatments for these diseases. However, despite modelling human pathology, most endpoints studied in mice do not translate to humans. Furthermore, the progression by which alpha-synuclein misfolding affects human-relevant measures such as brain volume and underlying subtle, high-level cognitive deficits is poorly understood. Here we used a mouse model of synucleinopathy; hemizygous M83 human A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice inoculated with recombinant human alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) injected in the right striatum to initiate alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation. We examined alpha-synuclein-induced atrophy at 90 days post-injection using ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging as well as high-level cognition and motor function, as biomarkers of alpha-synuclein toxicity. We observed widespread atrophy in bilateral regions that project to or receive input from the injection site, highlighting a network of regions that are consistent with structural changes observed in humans with PD. Moreover, we detected early deficits in reversal learning with touchscreen testing in PFF-injected mice prior to motor dysfunction, consistent with the pathology observed in cortical-striatal and thalamic loops. We show, using translational approaches in mice, that progression of prion-like spreading of alpha-synuclein causes selective atrophy via connected brain regions leading to high-level cognitive deficits. We propose that precise imaging and cognitive biomarkers can provide a more direct and human-relevant measurement of alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity in pre-clinical testing.

                Neurodegenerative diseases represent an increasing health burden, with a worrying lack of models recapitulating the hallmarks of the pathology. Recently, lab-on-a-chip technology has opened new reliable alternatives to conventional in vitro models able to replicate key aspects of human physiology. For instance, microfluidics allows to mimic the extracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins in the finely controlled microenvironment, thanks to the intrinsic high surface-area-to-volume ratio. Automated microfluidic platforms offer advantages in implementing high-throughput, standardized and parallelized assays, suitable for drug screenings and developing new therapeutic approaches in a cost-effective way. However, the major challenges in the broad application of automated lab-on-a-chip in biological research are the lack of production robustness and ease of use of the devices. Here, we present an automated microfluidic platform able to host the rapid conversion of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into neurons via NGN2 viral programming in a user-friendly manner. The design of the platform, built with multilayer soft-lithography techniques, shows easiness in the fabrication and assembly thanks to the simple geometry and experimental reproducibility at the same time. The all operations are automatically managed from the cell seeding, medium change, doxycycline-mediated neuronal induction, and selection of the genetically engineered cells, to the analysis, including immunofluorescence assay. Our results show a high-throughput, efficient and homogenous conversion of hiPSCs in neurons in 10 days showing the expression of mature marker MAP2, and calcium signaling. The neurons-on-chip model here described represents a fully automated loop system able to address the challenges in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and improve current preclinical models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiological Condition Dependent Changes in Ciliary GPCR Localization in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Primary cilia are small immotile cellular appendages which mediate diverse types of singling and are found on most mammalian cell types including throughout the central nervous system. Cilia are known to localize certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are critical for mediating the signaling of these receptors. Several of these neuronal GPCRs have recognized roles in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Heterologous cell line and model systems like C. elegans and Chlamydomonas have implicated both dynamic GPCR cilia localization and cilia length and shape changes as key for signaling. However, it is unclear if mammalian ciliary GPCRs utilize similar mechanisms in vivo and under what physiological conditions these processes may occur. Here, we use the ciliary GPCRs, melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) and neuropeptide-Y receptor 2 (NPY2R) as model ciliary receptors to determine if dynamic localization to cilia occurs. We tested physiological conditions in which these GPCRs have been implicated such as feeding behavior, obesity, and circadian rhythm. Cilia were imaged using confocal microscopy and analyzed with a computer assisted approach allowing for unbiased and high throughput analysis of cilia. We analyzed GPCR positive cilia, cilia frequency as well as cilia length and receptor occupancy. Interestingly we observed changes in ciliary length, receptor occupancy, and cilia frequency under different conditions, but no consistent theme across GPCRs or brain nuclei was observed. A better understanding of the subcellular localization dynamics of ciliary GPCRs could reveal unrecognized molecular mechanisms regulating behaviors like feeding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Direct Brain Recordings Identify a Causal Subsequent-Memory Effect</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous variation in brain state and stimulus-specific evoked activity can both contribute to successful encoding. Previous studies, however, have not clearly distinguished among these components. We address this question by analyzing intracranial EEG recorded from epilepsy patients as they studied and subsequently recalled lists of words. We first trained classifiers to predict recall of either single items or entire lists and found that both classifiers exhibited similar performance. We found that list-level classifier output -- a biomarker of successful encoding -- tracked item presentation and recall events, despite having no information about the trial structure. Across widespread brain regions, decreased low- and increased high-frequency activity (HFA) marked successful encoding of both items and lists. We found regional differences in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, where in the hippocampus HFA correlated more strongly with item recall, whereas in the prefrontal cortex HFA correlated more strongly with list performance. Despite subtle differences in item- and list-level features, the similarity in overall classification performance, spectral signatures of successful recall, and fluctuations of spectral activity across the encoding period argue for a shared endogenous process that causally impacts the brain's ability to learn new information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bayesball: Bayesian Integration in Professional Baseball Batters</a></h4>

              
                Pitchers in baseball throw the ball with such high velocity and varying movement that batters only have a few hundred milliseconds to estimate whether to swing and how high to swing--contacting the ball too high or too low may produce hit balls that easily result in an out. Even before the pitcher releases the ball, the batter has some belief, or estimated distribution (a 'prior'), of where the ball may land in the zone. Batters will update this prior belief with information from observing the pitch (the 'likelihood') to calculate their final estimate (the 'posterior'). These models of behavior, called Bayesian models within movement science, predict that when players have better prior information, e.g. because they know the upcoming pitch due to 'tipping', that they will rely more on prior information; by contrast if their prior is less informative, e.g. because the pitch is very random as in the case of a knuckleball, they will instead rely more on the observation. Here we test these models using information from more than a million pitches from professional baseball. We find that batters integrate prior information with noisy observations to manage pitch uncertainty. Moreover, as predicted by a Bayesian model, a batter's estimate of where to swing is biased towards the prior when the pitch is tipped and biased towards the likelihood in the case of pitches with high uncertainty. These results demonstrate that Bayesian ideas are relevant well beyond laboratory experiments and matter in the world of sports.

	<p>Number&amp;amp;ndash;color synesthesia is a condition in which synesthetes perceive numbers with concurrent experience of specific, corresponding colors. It has been proposed that synesthetic association exists primarily between representations of Arabic digit graphemes and colors, and a secondary, semantic connection between numerosity and colors is built via repeated co-activation. However, this distinction between the graphemic and semantic pathways of synesthetic number&amp;amp;ndash;color connection has not been empirically tested. The current study aims to dissociate graphemic and semantic aspects of color activations in number&amp;amp;ndash;color synesthesia by comparing their time courses. We adopted a synesthetic priming paradigm with varied stimuli onset asynchronies (SOAs). A number (2&amp;amp;ndash;6, prime) was presented in one of three notations: digit, dice, or non-canonical dot pattern, and a color patch (target) appeared with an SOA of 0, 100, 300, 400, or 800 ms. Participants reported the color as quickly as possible. Using the congruency effect (i.e., shorter reaction time when target color matched the synesthetic color of number prime) as an index of synesthetic color activation level, we revealed that the effect from the graphemic pathway is quick and relatively persistent, while the effect from the semantic pathway unfolds at a later stage and is more transient. The dissociation between the graphemic and semantic pathways of synesthesia implies further functional distinction within &amp;amp;ldquo;conceptual synesthesia&amp;amp;rdquo;, which has been originally discussed as a unitary phenomenon. This distinction has been demonstrated by the differential time courses of synesthetic color activations, and suggested that a presumed, single type of synesthesia could involve multiple mechanisms.</p>

	<p>d Variability in the response of individuals to various non-invasive brain stimulation protocols is a major problem that limits their potential for clinical applications. Baseline motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude is the key predictor of an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s response to transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols. However, the factors that predict MEP amplitude and its variability remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the input&amp;amp;ndash;output curve (IOC) parameters that best predict MEP amplitude and its variability. We analysed IOC data from 75 subjects and built a general linear model (GLM) using the IOC parameters as regressors and MEP amplitude at 120% resting motor threshold (RMT) as the response variable. We bootstrapped the data to estimate variability of IOC parameters and included them in a GLM to identify the significant predictors of MEP amplitude variability. Peak slope, motor threshold, and maximum MEP amplitude of the IOC were significant predictors of MEP amplitude at 120% RMT and its variability was primarily driven by the variability of peak slope and maximum MEP amplitude. Recruitment gain and maximum corticospinal excitability are the key predictors of MEP amplitude and its variability. Inter-individual variability in motor output may be reduced by achieving a uniform IOC slope.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is one of the important comorbidities of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is critical to find appropriate methods for early diagnosis and objective assessment of mild cognitive impairment patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM-MCI). Our study aimed to investigate potential early alterations in phase lag index (PLI) and determine whether it can distinguish between T2DM-MCI and normal controls with T2DM (T2DM-NC). EEG was recorded in 30 T2DM-MCI patients and 30 T2DM-NC patients. The phase lag index was computed and used in a logistic regression model to discriminate between groups. The correlation between the phase lag index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was assessed. The &amp;amp;alpha;-band phase lag index was significantly decreased in the T2DM-MCI group compared with the T2DM-NC group and showed a moderate degree of classification accuracy. The MoCA score was positively correlated with the &amp;amp;alpha;-band phase lag index (r = 0.4812, moderate association, p = 0.015). This work shows that the functional connectivity analysis of EEG may offer an effective way to track the cortical dysfunction linked to the cognitive deterioration of T2DM patients, and the &amp;amp;alpha;-band phase lag index may have a role in guiding the diagnosis of T2DM-MCI.</p>

	<p>Emotion regulation in old age was found to be more efficient; seniors seem to focus less on the negative aspects of experiences. Here, we ask, do older individuals regulate their emotions more efficiently or are they numb to the physiological changes that modulate these emotions? Interoception, the perception of physical feelings, influences a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s mood, emotions, and sense of well-being, and was hardly tested among older adults. We examined the awareness of physiological changes (physiological arousal&amp;amp;mdash;blood pressure and heart rate) of 47 older adults, compared to 18 young adults, and their subjective reports of emotional experiences while viewing emotional stimuli. Interoception was decreased in old age. Blood pressure medications had a partial role in this reduction. Moreover, interoception mediated emotional experience, such that low interoception led to lower experiences of changes in physiological arousal. These findings may account for the emotional changes in old age, suggesting a decline in sensitivity with age, which leads to a positive interpretation of information.</p>

	<p>Plaque rupture of the basilar artery is one of the leading causes of posterior circulation stroke. The present study aimed to investigate the role of fluid dynamics in the ruptured fibrous cap of basilar artery plaques. Patients with basilar artery plaques (50&amp;amp;ndash;99% stenosis) were screened. Integrity of the fibrous cap was assessed by high-resolution MRI. Computational fluid dynamics models were built based on MR angiography to obtain the wall shear stress and velocity. A total of 176 patients were included. High-resolution MRI identified 35 ruptured fibrous caps of basilar artery plaques. Ruptured fibrous cap was significantly associated with acute infarction (27/35 vs. 96/141, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in the territory of the basilar artery. Proximal wall shear stress of stenosis was positively related with the ruptured fibrous cap (OR 1.564; 95% CI, 1.101&amp;amp;ndash;2.222; p = 0.013). The threshold of wall shear stress for the ruptured fibrous cap of basilar artery plaques was 4.84 Pa (Area under ROC 0.732, p = 0.008, 95%CI 0.565&amp;amp;ndash;0.899). The present study demonstrated that increased proximal wall shear stress of stenosis was associated with ruptured fibrous caps of basilar artery plaques.</p>

                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of non-fatal global disease burden, with females being two-fold more likely than males to be diagnosed with the disorder. Despite this distinct sex-linked disparity of diagnosis, it is unclear what underlies the sex bias of MDD prevalence. Recent findings suggest a role for the gut in mediating affective disorders through the gut-brain-axis (GBA). However, few studies have included sex as a biological variable. For this study, cross-sex transfer of cecal microbiota was performed between male and female C57Bl/6 mice to elucidate the effects of sex and the gut microbiome on a standard battery of tests measuring depressive-like behaviours. Specifically, regardless of sex, recipients of male cecal content had a greater sucrose preference than controls and recipients of female cecum. Conversely, in the splash test, recipients of female cecum displayed a decrease in grooming behaviour compared to both controls and recipients of male cecum, suggestive of an increase in depressive-like behaviour. These results support a role for female-specific gut microbes in contributing to female vulnerability to depression, while male-specific gut microbes may protect in part against an anhedonia-like phenotype.

                Although some advancements concerning the arousal involved in mediating the delayed emergency from general anesthesia, which will lead to the serious complications, had been made, the role by arousal in modulating in delayed emergency still remains to be unclear. In our models, based on our previous working that activation of the 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by optogenetics can significantly reduce the emergency time by activating arousal pathway, we further test whether the serotonergic neural circuit between the DRN and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in modulating the arousal from the sevoflurane anesthesia and the emergency time of sevoflurane anesthesia by the pharmacological, optogenetics and fiber photometry. Our findings showed that whether the serotonergic neural circuit between the DRN and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a key role in modulating the arousal from the sevoflurane anesthesia and the emergency time of sevoflurane anesthesia. Based on the serotonergic neural circuit, the 5-HT 1 A receptor is of great significance to mediate the arousal and the emergency time of the sevoflurane anesthesia.

                Dopaminergic cell loss due to the accumulation of -syn is a core feature of PD pathogenesis. Neuroinflammation specifically induced by -syn has been shown to exacerbate neurodegeneration, yet the role of CNS resident macrophages in this process remains unclear. We found that a specific subset of CNS resident macrophages, border-associated macrophages (BAMs), play an essential role in mediating -syn related neuroinflammation due to their unique role as the antigen presenting cells necessary to initiate a CD4 T cell response. Surprisingly, the loss of MHCII antigen presentation on microglia had no effect on neuroinflammation. Furthermore, -syn expression led to an expansion in BAM numbers and a unique damage-associated activation state. Through a combinatorial approach of single-cell RNA sequencing and depletion experiments, we found that BAMs played an essential role in immune cell recruitment, infiltration, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, BAMs were identified in post-mortem PD brain in close proximity to T cells. These results point to a critical role for BAMs in mediating PD pathogenesis through their essential role in the orchestration of the -syn-mediated neuroinflammatory response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network Segregation in Aging Females and Evaluation of the Impact of Sex Steroid Hormones</a></h4>

              
                Males and females show differential patterns in connectivity in resting-state networks (RSNs) during normal aging, from early adulthood to late middle age. Age-related differences in network integration (effectiveness of specialized communication at the global network level) and segregation (functional specialization at the local level of specific brain regions) may also differ by sex. These differences may be due at least in part to endogenous hormonal fluctuation, such as that which occurs in females during midlife with the transition to menopause when levels of estrogens and progesterone drop markedly. A limited number of studies that have investigated sex differences in the action of steroid hormones in brain networks. Here we investigated how sex steroid hormones relate to age-network relationships in both males and females, with a focus on network segregation. Females displayed a significant quadratic relationship between age and network segregation for the cerebellar-basal ganglia and salience networks. In both cases, segregation was still increasing through adulthood, highest in midlife, and with a downturn thereafter. However, there were no significant relationships between sex steroid hormone levels and network segregation levels in females, and they did not exhibit significant associations between progesterone or 17{beta}-estradiol and network segregation. Patterns of connectivity between the cerebellum and basal ganglia have been associated with cognitive performance and self-reported balance confidence in older adults. Together, these findings suggest that network segregation patterns with age in females vary by network, and that sex steroid hormones are not associated with this measure of connectivity in this cross-sectional analysis. Though this is a null effect, it remains critical for understanding the extent to which hormones relate to brain network architecture.
