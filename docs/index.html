<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thousands of individuals die each year from opioid‐related overdoses. While naloxone (Narcan®) is currently the most widely employed treatment to reverse opioid toxicity, high or repeated doses of this antidote often lead to precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). We hypothesized that a slow linear release of naloxone from a nanoparticle would induce fewer POW symptoms compared to high‐dose free naloxone. First, we measured the acute impact of covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal‐<i>c </i>NPs) on morphine‐induced antinociception in the hotplate test. We found that Nal‐<i>c </i>NP treatment blocked the antinociceptive effect of morphine within 15 min of administration. Next, we tested the impact of Nal‐<i>c </i>NPs on POW symptoms in male morphine‐dependent mice. To induce morphine dependence, mice were treated with 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) twice‐daily for six consecutive days. On day 7 mice received 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) injections 2 hr prior to receiving treatment of either unmodified free naloxone, a high or low dose of Nal‐<i>c </i>NP, empty nanoparticle (<i>c </i>NP‐empty), or saline. Behavior was analyzed for 0–6 hr followed by 24 and 48 hr time points after treatment. As expected, free naloxone induced a significant increase in POW behavior in morphine‐dependent mice compared to saline‐treated mice upon free naloxone administration. In comparison, reduced POW behavior was observed with both doses of Nal‐<i>c </i>NP. Side effects of Nal‐<i>c </i>NP on locomotion and fecal boli production were measured and no significant side‐effects were observed. Overall, our data show that sustained release of naloxone from a covalent nanoparticle does not induce severe POW symptoms in morphine‐dependent mice.</p>

<p>by Laura Bella Naumann, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Hebbian plasticity, a mechanism believed to be the substrate of learning and memory, detects and further enhances correlated neural activity. Because this constitutes an unstable positive feedback loop, it requires additional homeostatic control. Computational work suggests that in recurrent networks, the homeostatic mechanisms observed in experiments are too slow to compensate instabilities arising from Hebbian plasticity and need to be complemented by rapid compensatory processes. We suggest presynaptic inhibition as a candidate that rapidly provides stability by compensating recurrent excitation induced by Hebbian changes. Presynaptic inhibition is mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors that effectively and reversibly attenuate transmitter release. Activation of these receptors can be triggered by excess network activity, hence providing a stabilising negative feedback loop that weakens recurrent interactions on sub-second timescales. We study the stabilising effect of presynaptic inhibition in a recurrent networks, in which presynaptic inhibition is implemented as a multiplicative reduction of recurrent synaptic weights in response to increasing inhibitory activity. We show that networks with presynaptic inhibition display a gradual increase of firing rates with growing excitatory weights, in contrast to traditional excitatory-inhibitory networks. This alleviates the positive feedback loop between Hebbian plasticity and network activity and thereby allows homeostasis to act on timescales similar to those observed in experiments. Our results generalise to spiking networks with a biophysically more detailed implementation of the presynaptic inhibition mechanism. In conclusion, presynaptic inhibition provides a powerful compensatory mechanism that rapidly reduces effective recurrent interactions and thereby stabilises Hebbian learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8M0a75I0Uo" width="1" />

Drug repurposing, identifying novel indications for drugs, bypasses common drug development pitfalls to ultimately deliver therapies to patients faster. However, most repurposing discoveries have been led by anecdotal observations (e.g. Viagra) or experimental-based repurposing screens, which are costly, time-consuming, and imprecise. Recently, more systematic computational approaches have been proposed, however these rely on utilizing the information from the diseases a drug is already approved to treat. This inherently limits the algorithms, making them unusable for investigational molecules. Here, we present a computational approach to drug repurposing, CATNIP, that requires only biological and chemical information of a molecule. CATNIP is trained with 2,576 diverse small molecules and uses 16 different drug similarity features, such as structural, target, or pathway based similarity. This model obtains significant predictive power (AUC = 0.841). Using our model, we created a repurposing network to identify broad scale repurposing opportunities between drug types. By exploiting this network, we identified literature-supported repurposing candidates, such as the use of systemic hormonal preparations for the treatment of respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that we can use our approach to identify novel uses for defined drug classes. We found that adrenergic uptake inhibitors, specifically amitriptyline and trimipramine, could be potential therapies for Parkinson’s disease. Additionally, using CATNIP, we predicted the kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, as a possible treatment for Type 2 Diabetes. Overall, this systematic approach to drug repurposing lays the groundwork to streamline future drug development efforts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GaN2Ncpsy4I" width="1" />

<p>by Leo Kozachkov, Mikael Lundqvist, Jean-Jacques Slotine, Earl K. Miller</p>

The brain consists of many interconnected networks with time-varying, partially autonomous activity. There are multiple sources of noise and variation yet activity has to eventually converge to a stable, reproducible state (or sequence of states) for its computations to make sense. We approached this problem from a control-theory perspective by applying contraction analysis to recurrent neural networks. This allowed us to find mechanisms for achieving stability in multiple connected networks with biologically realistic dynamics, including synaptic plasticity and time-varying inputs. These mechanisms included inhibitory Hebbian plasticity, excitatory anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic sparsity and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Our findings shed light on how stable computations might be achieved despite biological complexity. Crucially, our analysis is not limited to analyzing the stability of fixed geometric objects in state space (e.g points, lines, planes), but rather the stability of state trajectories which may be complex and time-varying.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/660jkWwn5gk" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear about weight gain and finalized to food‐related control behaviors. Growing interest has been demonstrated about neurobiological processes subtend to AN physiopathology. The present review aimed to collect neurostructural and neurofunctional available data from 2010 to 2019. Results have been organized according to the neuroimaging technique employed, also including a specific section on electroencephalographic results, mostly neglected in previous reviews. Diffuse cerebral vulnerability has been demonstrated and the contribution of several structures has been identified. Insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal areas are primarily involved both by structural and functional perspectives. Moreover, consistent alterations in white matter integrity and brain electrical activity have been reported. Neuroimaging findings give a substantial contribution to AN pathophysiological description, also in order to understand altered but reversible processes in the passage from acute illness phase to disorder's remission, useful also for defining therapy.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Latest studies have revealed that pain negatively impacts on reward processing and motivation leading to negative affective states and stress. These states not only reduce quality of life of patients by increasing the appearance of psychiatric comorbidities, but also have an important impact on vulnerability to drug abuse, including alcohol. In fact, clinical, epidemiological but also preclinical studies have revealed that the presence of pain is closely related to alcohol use disorders (AUDs). All this evidence suggests that pain is a factor that increases the risk of suffering AUD, predicting heavy drinking behavior and relapse drinking in those patients with a previous history of AUD. The negative consequences of chronic pain and its impact on stress and AUD are likely mediated by alterations in the central nervous system, especially in the stress and reward systems. Therefore, pain and stress impact on dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway can lead to an increase in drug abuse liability. In this mini review we analyze the interaction between pain, stress, and alcohol addiction, and how dynamic changes in the kappa opioid system might play a crucial role in the development of compulsive alcohol drinking in chronic pain patients.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Given the ubiquitous nature of opioids in the treatment of pain, it is an interesting paradox that this class of medications also represents one of the least understood components of clinical pain medicine. For many years, there has been intense interest in the mechanisms of opioid activity, but this has not resulted in a corresponding increase in convincing clinical data. This review focuses primarily on the evidence surrounding the long‐term use of opioids in chronic pain, but discussions of this research are often conflated with the very different data governing acute and cancer‐related pain, where evidence of efficacy is clearer. It is therefore important to clarify the evidence‐based indications for opioid therapy. There remains very little evidence that opioids improve function or quality of life beyond 3 months in people with chronic pain conditions. In all three patient populations, the development of tolerance, dependence, hyperalgesia and withdrawal are key phenomena that affect the patient experience, and in particular the decision to remain on opioids in the long term. This is a common thread that connects the opioid literature in all of these spheres, and justifies the burgeoning interest in these phenomena in the basic science literature. There is an urgent need to address these negative consequences of opioid use, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit that opioids can offer.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence deep learning system with that of expert neuro‐ophthalmologists in classifying optic disc appearance.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly presented images without clinical information. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The system correctly classified 678 of 800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675 of 800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641 of 800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96–0.98), 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94–0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.87–0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema, and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar to or better than the 2 experts. Intergrader agreement at the eye level was 0.71 (95% CI = 0.67–0.76) between Expert 1 and Expert 2, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.68–0.76) between the system and Expert 1, and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.61–0.70) between the system and Expert 2.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The performance of this deep learning system at classifying optic disc abnormalities was at least as good as 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists. Future prospective studies are needed to validate this system as a diagnostic aid in relevant clinical settings. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) pathway inhibitors are emerging treatments for migraine. CGRP‐mediated vasodilation is, however, a critical rescue mechanism in ischemia. We, therefore, investigated whether gepants, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, worsen cerebral ischemia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Middle cerebral artery was occluded for 12 to 60 minutes in mice. We compared infarct risk and volumes, collateral flow, and neurological deficits after pretreatment with olcegepant (single or 10 daily doses of 0.1–1mg/kg) or rimegepant (single doses of 10–100mg/kg) versus vehicle. We also determined their potency on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse and human vessels, in vitro.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Olcegepant (1mg/kg, single dose) increased infarct risk after 12‐ to 20‐minute occlusions mimicking transient ischemic attacks (14/19 vs 6/18 with vehicle, relative risk = 2.21, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.022), and doubled infarct volumes (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001) and worsened neurological deficits (median score = 9 vs 5 with vehicle, <i>p </i> = 0.008) after 60‐minute occlusion. Ten daily doses of 0.1 to 1mg/kg olcegepant yielded similar results. Rimegepant 10mg/kg increased infarct volumes by 60% after 20‐minute ischemia (<i>p </i> = 0.03); 100mg/kg caused 75% mortality after 60‐minute occlusion. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mice, olcegepant 1mg/kg increased infarct size after 30‐minute occlusion (1.6‐fold, <i>p </i> = 0.017). Both gepants consistently diminished collateral flow and reduced reperfusion success. Olcegepant was 10‐fold more potent than rimegepant on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse aorta.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Gepants worsened ischemic stroke in mice via collateral dysfunction. CGRP pathway blockers might thus aggravate coincidental cerebral ischemic events. The cerebrovascular safety of these agents must therefore be better delineated, especially in patients at increased risk of ischemic events or on prophylactic CGRP inhibition. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>The scope of human consciousness includes states departing from what most of
us experience as ordinary wakefulness. These altered states of consciousness
constitute a prime opportunity to study how global changes in brain activity
relate to different varieties of subjective experience. We consider the problem
of explaining how global signatures of altered consciousness arise from the
interplay between large-scale connectivity and local dynamical rules that can
be traced to known properties of neural tissue. For this purpose, we advocate a
research program aimed at bridging the gap between bottom-up generative models
of whole-brain activity and the top-down signatures proposed by theories of
consciousness. Throughout this paper, we define altered states of
consciousness, discuss relevant signatures of consciousness observed in brain
activity, and introduce whole-brain models to explore the mechanisms of altered
consciousness from the bottom-up. We discuss the potential of our proposal in
view of the current state of the art, give specific examples of how this
research agenda might play out, and emphasise how a systematic investigation of
altered states of consciousness via bottom-up modelling may help us better
understand the biophysical, informational, and dynamical underpinnings of
consciousness.

<p>A core problem in cognitive science and machine learning is to understand how
humans derive semantic representations from perceptual objects, such as color
from an apple, pleasantness from a musical chord, or trustworthiness from a
face. Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) is a prominent method for
studying such representations, in which participants are presented with binary
choice trials constructed such that the decisions follow a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo acceptance rule. However, MCMCP's binary choice paradigm generates
relatively little information per trial, and its local proposal function makes
it slow to explore the parameter space and find the modes of the distribution.
Here we therefore generalize MCMCP to a continuous-sampling paradigm, where in
each iteration the participant uses a slider to continuously manipulate a
single stimulus dimension to optimize a given criterion such as 'pleasantness'.
We formulate both methods from a utility-theory perspective, and show that the
new method can be interpreted as 'Gibbs Sampling with People' (GSP). Further,
we introduce an aggregation parameter to the transition step, and show that
this parameter can be manipulated to flexibly shift between Gibbs sampling and
deterministic optimization. In an initial study, we show GSP clearly
outperforming MCMCP; we then show that GSP provides novel and interpretable
results in three other domains, namely musical chords, vocal emotions, and
faces. We validate these results through large-scale perceptual rating
experiments. The final experiments combine GSP with a state-of-the-art image
synthesis network (StyleGAN) and a recent network interpretability technique
(GANSpace), enabling GSP to efficiently explore high-dimensional perceptual
spaces, and demonstrating how GSP can be a powerful tool for jointly
characterizing semantic representations in humans and machines.

<p>This paper introduces a new method for inter-frame coding based on two
complementary autoencoders: MOFNet and CodecNet. MOFNet aims at computing and
conveying the Optical Flow and a pixel-wise coding Mode selection. The optical
flow is used to perform a prediction of the frame to code. The coding mode
selection enables competition between direct copy of the prediction or
transmission through CodecNet. The proposed coding scheme is assessed under the
Challenge on Learned Image Compression 2020 (CLIC20) P-frame coding conditions,
where it is shown to perform on par with the state-of-the-art video codec
ITU/MPEG HEVC. Moreover, the possibility of copying the prediction enables to
learn the optical flow in an end-to-end fashion i.e. without relying on
pre-training and/or a dedicated loss term.

<p>In this work, we tackle model efficiency by exploiting redundancy in the
\textit{implicit structure} of the building blocks of convolutional neural
networks. We start our analysis by introducing a general definition of
Composite Kernel structures that enable the execution of convolution operations
in the form of efficient, scaled, sum-pooling components. As its special case,
we propose \textit{Structured Convolutions} and show that these allow
decomposition of the convolution operation into a sum-pooling operation
followed by a convolution with significantly lower complexity and fewer
weights. We show how this decomposition can be applied to 2D and 3D kernels as
well as the fully-connected layers. Furthermore, we present a Structural
Regularization loss that promotes neural network layers to leverage on this
desired structure in a way that, after training, they can be decomposed with
negligible performance loss. By applying our method to a wide range of CNN
architectures, we demonstrate "structured" versions of the ResNets that are up
to 2$\times$ smaller and a new Structured-MobileNetV2 that is more efficient
while staying within an accuracy loss of 1% on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets.
We also show similar structured versions of EfficientNet on ImageNet and HRNet
architecture for semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. Our method
performs equally well or superior in terms of the complexity reduction in
comparison to the existing tensor decomposition and channel pruning methods.

<p>Distribution-based search algorithms are an effective approach for
evolutionary reinforcement learning of neural network controllers. In these
algorithms, gradients of the total reward with respect to the policy parameters
are estimated using a population of solutions drawn from a search distribution,
and then used for policy optimization with stochastic gradient ascent. A common
choice in the community is to use the Adam optimization algorithm for obtaining
an adaptive behavior during gradient ascent, due to its success in a variety of
supervised learning settings. As an alternative to Adam, we propose to enhance
classical momentum-based gradient ascent with two simple techniques: gradient
normalization and update clipping. We argue that the resulting optimizer called
ClipUp (short for "clipped updates") is a better choice for distribution-based
policy evolution because its working principles are simple and easy to
understand and its hyperparameters can be tuned more intuitively in practice.
Moreover, it removes the need to re-tune hyperparameters if the reward scale
changes. Experiments show that ClipUp is competitive with Adam despite its
simplicity and is effective on challenging continuous control benchmarks,
including the Humanoid control task based on the Bullet physics simulator.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07259">Identifying Critical Neurons in ANN Architectures using Mixed Integer Programming. (arXiv:2002.07259v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>We introduce a mixed integer program (MIP) for assigning importance scores to
each neuron in deep neural network architectures which is guided by the impact
of their simultaneous pruning on the main learning task of the network. By
carefully devising the objective function of the MIP, we drive the solver to
minimize the number of critical neurons (i.e., with high importance score) that
need to be kept for maintaining the overall accuracy of the trained neural
network. Further, the proposed formulation generalizes the recently considered
lottery ticket optimization by identifying multiple "lucky" sub-networks
resulting in optimized architecture that not only performs well on a single
dataset, but also generalizes across multiple ones upon retraining of network
weights. Finally, we present a scalable implementation of our method by
decoupling the importance scores across layers using auxiliary networks. We
demonstrate the ability of our formulation to prune neural networks with
marginal loss in accuracy and generalizability on popular datasets and
architectures.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10579">Autoencoding with a Classifier System. (arXiv:1910.10579v4 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Autoencoders enable data dimensionality reduction and are a key component of
many learning systems. This article explores the use of a learning classifier
system to perform autoencoding. Initial results using a neural network
representation and combining artificial evolution with stochastic gradient
descent, suggest it is an effective approach to data reduction. The approach
adaptively subdivides the input domain into local approximations that are
simpler than a global neural network solution. By allowing the number of
neurons in the autoencoders to evolve, this further enables the emergence of an
ensemble of structurally heterogeneous solutions to cover the problem space. In
this case, networks of differing complexity are typically seen to cover
different areas of the problem space. Furthermore, the rate of gradient descent
applied to each layer is tuned via self-adaptive mutation, thereby reducing the
parameter optimisation task.

<p>Repetitive visual stimulation is successfully used in a study on the visual evoked potential (VEP) plasticity in the visual system in mammals. Practicing visual tasks or repeated exposure to sensory stimuli can induce neuronal network changes in the cortical circuits and improve the perception of these stimuli. However, little is known about the effect of visual training at the subcortical level. In the present study, we extend the knowledge showing positive results of this training in the rat’s Superior colliculus (SC). In electrophysiological experiments, we showed that a single training session lasting several hours induces a response enhancement both in the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the SC. Further, we tested if collicular responses will be enhanced without V1 input. For this reason, we inactivated the V1 by applying xylocaine solution onto the cortical surface during visual training. Our results revealed that SC’s response enhancement was present even without V1 inputs and showed no difference in amplitude comparing to VEPs enhancement while the V1 was active. These data suggest that the visual system plasticity and facilitation can develop independently but simultaneously in different parts of the visual system.</p>

<p>Meditation practices, originated from ancient traditions, have increasingly received attention due to their potential benefits to mental and physical health. The scientific community invests efforts into scrutinizing and quantifying the effects of these practices, especially on the brain. There are methodological challenges in describing the neural correlates of the subjective experience of meditation. We noticed, however, that technical considerations on signal processing also don't follow standardized approaches, which may hinder generalizations. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the usage of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a tool to study meditation experiences in healthy individuals. We describe the main EEG signal processing techniques and how they have been translated to the meditation field until April 2020. Moreover, we examine in detail the limitations/assumptions of these techniques and highlight some good practices, further discussing how technical specifications may impact the interpretation of the outcomes. By shedding light on technical features, this article contributes to more rigorous approaches to evaluate the construct of meditation.</p>

<p>Over the last 15 years, network analysis approaches based on MR data have allowed a renewed understanding of the relationship between brain function architecture and consciousness. Application of this approach to Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) highlights the relationship between specific aspects of network topology and levels of consciousness. Nonetheless, such applications do not acknowledge that DOC patients present with a dramatic level of heterogeneity in structural connectivity (SC) across groups (e.g., etiology, diagnostic categories) and within individual patients (e.g., over time), which possibly affects the level and quality of functional connectivity (FC) patterns that can be expressed. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that the most frequently employed outcome metrics in the study of brain connectivity (e.g., degree distribution, inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity, and clustering coefficient) are interrelated and cannot be assumed to be independent of each other. We present empirical data showing that, when the two points above are not taken into consideration with an appropriate analytic model, it can lead to a misinterpretation of the role of each outcome metric in the graph's structure and thus misinterpretation of FC results. We show that failing to account for either SC or the inter-relation between outcome measures can lead to inflated false positives (FP) and/or false negatives (FN) in inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity results (defined, respectively, as a positive or negative result in network connectivity that is present when not accounting for SC and/or outcome measure inter-relation, but becomes not significant when accounting for all variables). Overall, we find that unconscious patients have lower rates of FP and FN for within cortical connectivity, lower rates of FN for cortico-subcortical connectivity, and lower rates of FP for within subcortical connectivity. These lower rates in unconscious patients may reflect differences in their triadic closure and SC metrics, which bias the interpretations of the inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity if the SC metrics and triadic closure are not modeled. We suggest that future studies of functional connectivity in DOC patients (i) incorporate where possible SC metrics and (ii) properly account for the intercorrelated nature of outcome variables.</p>

<p>The formation of the nervous system involves establishing complex networks of synaptic connections between proper partners. This developmental undertaking requires the rapid expansion of the plasma membrane surface area as neurons grow and polarize, extending axons through the extracellular environment. Critical to the expansion of the plasma membrane and addition of plasma membrane material is exocytic vesicle fusion, a regulated mechanism driven by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins receptors (SNAREs). Since their discovery, SNAREs have been implicated in several critical neuronal functions involving exocytic fusion in addition to synaptic transmission, including neurite initiation and outgrowth, axon specification, axon extension, and synaptogenesis. Decades of research have uncovered a rich variety of SNARE expression and function. The basis of SNARE-mediated fusion, the opening of a fusion pore, remains an enigmatic event, despite an incredible amount of research, as fusion is not only heterogeneous but also spatially small and temporally fast. Multiple modes of exocytosis have been proposed, with full-vesicle fusion (FFV) and kiss-and-run (KNR) being the best described. Whereas most in vitro work has reconstituted fusion using VAMP-2, SNAP-25, and syntaxin-1; there is much to learn regarding the behaviors of distinct SNARE complexes. In the past few years, robust heterogeneity in the kinetics and fate of the fusion pore that varies by cell type have been uncovered, suggesting a paradigm shift in how the modes of exocytosis are viewed is warranted. Here, we explore both classic and recent work uncovering the variety of SNAREs and their importance in the development of neurons, as well as historical and newly proposed modes of exocytosis, their regulation, and proteins involved in the regulation of fusion kinetics.</p>

<p>Dopamine replacement therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the only temporary therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD), but it triggers dyskinesia over time. Since dyskinesia is associated with increased neuronal firing that bolsters purinergic signaling, we now tested whether the selective and blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue-G (BBG, 22.5–45 mg/kg ip) attenuated behavioral, neurochemical and biochemical alterations in rats turned hemiparkinsonian upon unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and treated daily with L-DOPA (30 mg/kg by gavage) for 22 days. The blockade of P2X7 receptors decreased L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and motor incoordination in hemiparkinsonian rats. In parallel, BBG treatment rebalanced the altered dopamine D1 and D2 receptor density and signaling as well as some neuroinflammation-associated parameters in the striatum and substantia nigra. These findings herald a hitherto unrecognized role for purinergic signaling in the etiopathology of dyskinesia and prompt P2X7 receptor antagonists as novel candidate anti-dyskinesia drugs.</p>

<p>Volume conduction of electrical potentials in the brain is highly influenced by the material properties and geometry of the tissue and recording devices implanted into the tissue. These effects are very large in EEG due to the volume conduction through the skull and scalp but are often neglected in intracranial electrophysiology. When considering penetrating electrodes deep in the brain, the assumption of an infinite and homogenous medium can be used when the sources are far enough from the brain surface and the electrodes to minimize the boundary effect. When the electrodes are recording from the brain's surface the effect of the boundary cannot be neglected, and the large surface area and commonly used insulating materials in surface electrode arrays may further increase the effect by altering the nature of the boundary in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. This gives the experimenter some control over the spatial profiles of the potentials by appropriate design of the electrode arrays. We construct a simple three-layer model to describe the effect of material properties and geometry above the brain surface on the electric potentials and conduct empirical experiments to validate this model. A laminar electrode array is used to measure the effect of insulating and relatively conducting layers above the cortical surface by recording evoked potentials alternating between a dried surface and saline covering layer, respectively. Empirically, we find that an insulating boundary amplifies the potentials relative to conductive saline by about a factor of 4, and that the effect is not constrained to potentials that originate near the surface. The model is applied to predict the influence of array design and implantation procedure on the recording amplitude and spatial selectivity of the surface electrode arrays.</p>

<p>With the release of the multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, many researchers have applied machine learning methods to distinguish between healthy subjects and autistic individuals by using features extracted from resting state functional MRI data. An important part of applying machine learning to this problem is extracting these features. Specifically, whether to include negative correlations between brain region activities as relevant features and how best to define these features. For the second question, the graph theoretical properties of the brain network may provide a reasonable answer. In this study, we investigated the first issue by comparing three different approaches. These included using the positive correlation matrix (comprising only the positive values of the original correlation matrix), the absolute value of the correlation matrix, or the anticorrelation matrix (comprising only the negative correlation values) as the starting point for extracting relevant features using graph theory. We then trained a multi-layer perceptron in a leave-one-site out manner in which the data from a single site was left out as testing data and the model was trained on the data from the other sites. Our results show that on average, using graph features extracted from the anti-correlation matrix led to the highest accuracy and AUC scores. This suggests that anti-correlations should not simply be discarded as they may include useful information that would aid the classification task. We also show that adding the PCA transformation of the original correlation matrix to the feature space leads to an increase in accuracy.</p>

<p>The growing importance of astrocytes in the field of neuroscience has led to a greater number of computational models devoted to the study of astrocytic functions and their metabolic interactions with neurons. The modeling of these interactions demands a combined understanding of brain physiology and the development of computational frameworks based on genomic-scale reconstructions, system biology, and dynamic models. These computational approaches have helped to highlight the neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by astrocytes and other glial cells, both under normal conditions and during neurodegenerative processes. In the present review, we evaluate some of the most relevant models of astrocyte metabolism, including genome-scale reconstructions and astrocyte-neuron interactions developed in the last few years. Additionally, we discuss novel strategies from the multi-omics perspective and computational models of other glial cell types that will increase our knowledge in brain metabolism and its association with neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The Tomographic Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEGt) toolbox is integrated with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Neuroinformatics Ecosystem as a docker into the Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN). qEEGt produces age-corrected normative Statistical Parametric Maps of EEG log source spectra testing compliance to a normative database. This toolbox was developed at the Cuban Neuroscience Center as part of the first wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) and has been validated and used in different health systems for several decades. Incorporation into the MNI ecosystem now provides CBRAIN registered users access to its full functionality and is accompanied by a public release of the source code on GitHub and Zenodo repositories. Among other features are the calculation of EEG scalp spectra, and the estimation of their source spectra using the Variable Resolution Electrical Tomography (VARETA) source imaging. Crucially, this is completed by the evaluation of z spectra by means of the built-in age regression equations obtained from the CHBMP database (ages 5–87) to provide normative Statistical Parametric Mapping of EEG log source spectra. Different scalp and source visualization tools are also provided for evaluation of individual subjects prior to further post-processing. Openly releasing this software in the CBRAIN platform will facilitate the use of standardized qEEGt methods in different research and clinical settings. An updated precis of the methods is provided in Appendix I as a reference for the toolbox. qEEGt/CBRAIN is the first installment of instruments developed by the neuroinformatic platform of the Cuba-Canada-China (CCC) project.</p>

<p>Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a current focus in brain-computer interface research. However, the classification of EEG is difficult owing to large amounts of data and high levels of noise. Therefore, it is important to determine how to effectively extract features that include important information. Regularization, one of the effective methods for EEG signal processing, can effectively extract important features from the signal and has potential applications in EEG emotion recognition. Currently, the most popular regularization technique is Lasso (L<sub>1</sub>) and Ridge Regression (L<sub>2</sub>). In recent years, researchers have proposed many other regularization terms. In theory, L<sub>q</sub>-type regularization has a lower q value, which means that it can be used to find solutions with better sparsity. L<sub>1/2</sub> regularization is of L<sub>q</sub> type (0 &lt; q &lt; 1) and has been shown to have many attractive properties. In this work, we studied the L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty in sparse logistic regression for three-classification EEG emotion recognition, and used a coordinate descent algorithm and a univariate semi-threshold operator to implement L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty logistic regression. The experimental results on simulation and real data demonstrate that our proposed method is better than other existing regularization methods. Sparse logistic regression with L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty achieves higher classification accuracy than the conventional L<sub>1</sub>, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net regularization methods, using fewer but more informative EEG signals. This is very important for high-dimensional small-sample EEG data and can help researchers to reduce computational complexity and improve computational accuracy. Therefore, we propose that sparse logistic regression with the L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty is an effective technique for emotion recognition in practical classification problems.</p>

<p>For a long time, the relevance of the information provided by direct electrostimulation (DES) for mapping brain functions was debated. Recently, major advances in intraoperative DES for guiding resection of cerebral tumors in awake patients enabled the validation of this method and its increased utilization in basic neurosciences. Indeed, in addition to the cortical stimulation used for many decades in epilepsy surgery, axonal mapping was developed thanks to DES of the white matter tracts, giving original insights into the neural connectivity. Moreover, functional results collected during intrasurgical mapping have been correlated with neuropsychological performances before and after DES-guided resection, and with perioperative neuroimaging data. Thus, it was evidenced that DES offers the unique opportunity to identify both cortical and subcortical structures critical for cerebral functions. Here, the first aim is to propose a three-level model of DES-generated functional disruption, able to explain the behavioral consequences elicited during awake surgery, i.e., (i) DES of an input/output unimodal (e.g., somatosensory or motor) network inducing “positive” responses (as involuntary movement); (ii) DES of a distributed specialized network inducing a within-system disruption leading to specific “negative” disorders (e.g., exclusive language deficit with no other disorders); (iii) DES generating an inter-system disruption leading to more complex behavioral disturbances (e.g., the inability to perform dual-task while each function can be performed separately). Second, in light of this model, original findings gained from DES concerning the human connectome, complementary to those provided by functional neuroimaging (FNI), are reviewed. Further longitudinal multimodal investigations are needed to explore neuroplasticity mechanisms.</p>

<p>A generalized neural field model of large-scale activity in the corticothalamic system is used to predict standard evoked potentials. This model embodies local feedbacks that modulate the gains of neural activity as part of the response to incoming stimuli and thus enables both activity changes and effective connectivity changes to be calculated as parts of a generalized evoked response, and their relative contributions to be determined. The results show that incorporation of gain modulations enables a compact and physically justifiable description of the differences in gain between background-EEG and standard-ERP conditions, with the latter able to be initiated from the background state, rather than requiring distinct parameters as in earlier work. In particular, top-down gains are found to be reduced during an ERP, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions that the role of internal models is diminished in favor of external inputs when the latter change suddenly. The static-gain and modulated-gain system transfer functions are analyzed via control theory in terms of system resonances that were recently shown to implement data filtering whose gain adjustments can be interpreted as attention. These filters are shown to govern early and late features in standard evoked responses and their gain parameters are shown to be dynamically adjusted in a way that implements a form of attention. The results show that dynamically modulated resonant filters responsible for the low-frequency oscillations in an evoked potential response have different parameters than those responsible for low-frequency resting EEG responses, while both responses share similar mid- and high-frequency resonant filters. These results provide a biophysical mechanism by which oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges of an evoked response are modulated as reflections of attention; notably theta is enhanced and alpha suppressed during the latter parts of the ERP. Furthermore, the model enables the part of the ERP response induced by gain modulations to be estimated and interpreted in terms of attention.</p>

<p>Electrical and chemical synapses shape the dynamics of neural networks, and their functional roles in information processing have been a longstanding question in neurobiology. In this paper, we investigate the role of synapses on the optimization of the phenomenon of self-induced stochastic resonance in a delayed multiplex neural network by using analytical and numerical methods. We consider a two-layer multiplex network in which, at the intra-layer level, neurons are coupled either by electrical synapses or by inhibitory chemical synapses. For each isolated layer, computations indicate that weaker electrical and chemical synaptic couplings are better optimizers of self-induced stochastic resonance. In addition, regardless of the synaptic strengths, shorter electrical synaptic delays are found to be better optimizers of the phenomenon than shorter chemical synaptic delays, while longer chemical synaptic delays are better optimizers than longer electrical synaptic delays; in both cases, the poorer optimizers are, in fact, worst. It is found that electrical, inhibitory, or excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only electrical synapses at the intra-layer levels can each optimize the phenomenon. Additionally, only excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only inhibitory chemical synapses at the intra-layer levels can optimize the phenomenon. These results may guide experiments aimed at establishing or confirming to the mechanism of self-induced stochastic resonance in networks of artificial neural circuits as well as in real biological neural networks.</p>

Background<p>The immune system of human and mouse neonates is relatively immature. However, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), commonly divided into the subsets ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3, are already present in the placenta and other fetal compartments and exhibit higher activity than what is seen in adulthood. Recent reports have suggested the potential role of ILCs, especially ILC2s, in spontaneous preterm labor, which is associated with brain damage and subsequent long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. Therefore, we hypothesized that ILCs, and especially ILC2s, play a role in preterm brain injury.</p>Methods<p>C57Bl/6J mice at postnatal day 6 were subjected to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) insult induced by left carotid artery ligation and subsequent exposure to 10% oxygen in nitrogen. The presence of ILCs and ILC2s in the brain was examined at different time points after HI. The contribution of ILC2s to HI-induced preterm brain damage was explored using a conditionally targeted ILC2-deficient mouse strain (Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup>), and gray and white-matter injury were evaluated at 7 days post-HI. The inflammatory response in the injured brain was assessed using immunoassays and immunochemistry staining.</p>Results<p>Significant increases in ILCs and ILC2s were observed at 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days post-HI in the injured brain hemisphere compared with the uninjured hemisphere in wild-type mice. ILC2s in the brain were predominantly located in the meninges of the injured ipsilateral hemispheres after HI but not in the brain parenchyma. Overall, we did not observe changes in cytokine/chemokine levels in the brains of Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup> mice compared with wild type animals apart from IL-13. Gray and white-matter tissue loss in the brain was not affected after HI in Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup> mice. Correspondingly, we did not find any differences in reactive microglia and astrocyte numbers in the brain in Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice following HI insult.</p>Conclusion<p>After HI, ILCs and ILC2s accumulate in the injured brain hemisphere. However, ILC2s do not contribute to the development of brain damage in this mouse model of preterm brain injury.</p>

Increased levels of molecular determinants that mediate the membrane contact between mitochondria and other organelles, and their functions, have been revealed in recent years.

<p>Aging is associated with an increased prevalence of vascular health conditions that are linked to a disruption in the cerebral vasculature and white matter microstructural organization. In people with cardiovascular risk factors, increased cerebral arterial pulsatility is associated with poorer white matter microstructural organization and cognitive functioning. This study examines the relationship among arterial pulsatility, white matter microstructural organization, and cognitive ability in a healthy adult lifespan sample. One hundred and eighty-nine adults were divided into a younger adult (&lt;50 years, n = 97) and older adult (&gt;50 years, n = 92). The latter were further subdivided into two subgroups with (CV+, n = 25) and without (CV−, n = 67) cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial pulsatility was measured using cardiac-gated phase-contrast flow quantification sequence and three indexes of whole-brain white matter microstructural organization [i.e., fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RaD), mean diffusivity (MD)] were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Cognitive ability was assessed using global cognitive functioning (MoCA) and a measure of working memory [sensitivity (d′) from a 2-back task]. Neither the whole group analysis nor the younger adult group showed an association between measures of arterial pulsatility, global white matter microstructural organization, and cognition. In older adults, higher MD and RaD were associated with increased arterial pulsatility and poorer working memory performance. The indirect pathway from arterial pulsatility to working memory performance via both MD and RaD measures was significant in this group. Interestingly, a comparison of CV+ and CV− subgroups showed that this mediating relationship was only evident in older adults with at least one CV risk factor. These findings are consistent with cardiovascular risk factors as underlying arterial, white matter, and cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults.</p>

<p>Mutations in transmembrane protein 230 (TMEM230) gene are suggested to be associated with the autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease (PD) with typical movement disorders and Lewy body pathology. However, the normal functions and the pathological roles of TMEM230 are not clear. In this study, we used TMEM230 isoform II constructs including wild-type (WT) and four reported PD-linked mutation constructs (Y92C, R141L, 184Wext*5, and 184PGext*5). Ectopic expression of WT and PD-linked mutant TMEM230 variants in cultured cells dramatically induced apoptotic cell death compared with that of vector control cells. Mutant TMEM230 caused cell toxicity at an increased severity than WT TMEM230. Moreover, expression of TMEM230 increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreased cellular ATP, activated caspase 3/7, and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) cleavage. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; an ROS scavenger) or Z-VAD-FMK (a caspase inhibitor) significantly attenuated TMEM230-induced apoptosis in both cultured cells and primary neurons. Our results indicated that TMEM230 mediated a PARP1-linked apoptotic cell death pathway. These findings not only provide the novel insight into the biological roles of TMEM230 in the PARP1-linked pathway but also provide a TMEM230-induced cell death mechanism underlying PD pathogenesis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60513">Structural insights into the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating of the human mitochondrial calcium uniporter</a></h4>

Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is mediated by an inner mitochondrial membrane protein called the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. In humans, the uniporter functions as a holocomplex consisting of MCU, EMRE, MICU1 and MICU2, among which MCU and EMRE form a subcomplex and function as the conductive channel while MICU1 and MICU2 are EF-hand proteins that regulate the channel activity in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner. Here we present the EM structures of the human mitochondrial calcium uniporter holocomplex (uniplex) in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, revealing distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent assembly of the uniplex. Our structural observations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes the dimerization interaction between MICU1 and MICU2, which in turn determines how the MICU1-MICU2 subcomplex interacts with the MCU-EMRE channel and, consequently, changes the distribution of the uniplex assemblies between the blocked and unblocked states.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59806">Actionable recommendations from trainees to improve science training</a></h4>

Over the past 20 years, a series of reports written by groups of senior researchers and administrators have recommended changes to improve the training environments for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the United States. However, academic institutions and departments have largely failed to implement these recommendations, which has exacerbated the problems faced by these trainees. Here, based on input from trainees at different career stages, we outline seven practical changes that academic institutions and departments can make to improve their training environments.

Local activation and long-range inhibition are mechanisms conserved in self-organizing systems leading to biological patterns. A number of them involve the production by the developing cell of an inhibitory morphogen, but how this cell becomes immune to self-inhibition is rather unknown. Under combined nitrogen starvation, the multicellular cyanobacterium <i>Nostoc</i> PCC 7120 develops nitrogen-fixing heterocysts with a pattern of one heterocyst every 10-12 vegetative cells. Cell differentiation is regulated by HetR which activates the synthesis of its own inhibitory morphogens, diffusion of which establishes the differentiation pattern. Here we show that HetR interacts with HetL at the same interface as PatS, and that this interaction is necessary to suppress inhibition and to differentiate heterocysts. <i>hetL</i> expression is induced under nitrogen-starvation and is activated by HetR, suggesting that HetL provides immunity to the heterocyst. This protective mechanism might be conserved in other differentiating cyanobacteria as HetL homologues are spread across the phylum.

Frizzleds (Fzd) are the primary receptors for Wnt morphogens, which are essential regulators of stem cell biology, yet the structural basis of Wnt signaling through Fzd remains poorly understood. Here we report the structure of an unliganded human Fzd5 determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.7 Å resolution, with the aid of an antibody chaperone acting as a fiducial marker. We also analyzed the topology of low-resolution XWnt8/Fzd5 complex particles, which revealed extreme flexibility between the Wnt/Fzd-CRD and the Fzd-TM regions. Analysis of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to Wnt3a versus a 'surrogate agonist' that cross-links Fzd to LRP6, revealed identical structure-activity relationships. Thus, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling appears to be principally reliant on ligand-induced Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization, versus the allosteric mechanisms seen in structurally analogous class A G protein-coupled receptors, and Smoothened. These findings deepen our mechanistic understanding of Wnt signal transduction, and have implications for harnessing Wnt agonism in regenerative medicine.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58223">Mechanisms underlying genome instability mediated by formation of foldback inversions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

Foldback inversions, also called inverted duplications, have been observed in human genetic diseases and cancers. Here we used a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> genetic system that generates gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) mediated by foldback inversions combined with whole-genome sequencing to study their formation. Foldback inversions were mediated by formation of single-stranded DNA hairpins. Two types of hairpins were identified: small-loop hairpins that were suppressed by <i>MRE11</i>, <i>SAE2</i>, <i>SLX1</i>, and <i>YKU80</i> and large-loop hairpins that were suppressed by <i>YEN1</i>, <i>TEL1</i>, <i>SWR1</i>, and <i>MRC1</i>. Analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand breaks (DSBs) revealed that long-stem hairpin-forming sequences could form foldback inversions when proximal or distal to the DSB, whereas short-stem hairpin-forming sequences formed foldback inversions when proximal to the DSB. Finally, we found that foldback inversion GCRs were stabilized by secondary rearrangements, mostly mediated by different homologous recombination mechanisms including single-strand annealing; however, <i>POL32</i>-dependent break-induced replication did not appear to be involved forming secondary rearrangements.

Different subtypes of interneurons, destined for the olfactory bulb, are continuously generated by neural stem cells located in the ventricular and subventricular zones along the lateral forebrain ventricles of mice. Neuronal identity in the olfactory bulb depends on the existence of defined microdomains of pre-determined neural stem cells along the ventricle walls. The molecular mechanisms underlying positional identity of these neural stem cells are poorly understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Vax1 controls the production of two specific neuronal sub-types. First, it is directly necessary to generate Calbindin expressing interneurons from ventro-lateral progenitors. Second, it represses the generation of dopaminergic neurons by dorsolateral progenitors through inhibition of Pax6 expression. We present data indicating that this repression occurs, at least in part, via activation of microRNA miR-7.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57814">Mitochondrial volume fraction and translation duration impact mitochondrial mRNA localization and protein synthesis</a></h4>

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that must precisely control their protein composition according to cellular energy demand. Although nuclear-encoded mRNAs can be localized to the mitochondrial surface, the importance of this localization is unclear. As yeast switch to respiratory metabolism, there is an increase in the fraction of the cytoplasm that is mitochondrial. Our data point to this change in mitochondrial volume fraction increasing the localization of certain nuclear-encoded mRNAs to the surface of the mitochondria. We show that mitochondrial mRNA localization is necessary and sufficient to increase protein production to levels required during respiratory growth. Furthermore, we find that ribosome stalling impacts mRNA sensitivity to mitochondrial volume fraction and counterintuitively leads to enhanced protein synthesis by increasing mRNA localization to mitochondria. This points to a mechanism by which cells are able to use translation elongation and the geometric constraints of the cell to fine-tune organelle-specific gene expression through mRNA localization.

Mutations in the <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> aquaporin AQP2 are associated with resistance to pentamidine and melarsoprol. We show that TbAQP2 but not TbAQP3 was positively selected for increased pore size from a common ancestor aquaporin. We demonstrate that TbAQP2's unique architecture permits pentamidine permeation through its central pore and show how specific mutations in highly conserved motifs affect drug permeation. Introduction of key TbAQP2 amino acids into TbAQP3 renders the latter permeable to pentamidine. Molecular dynamics demonstrates that permeation by dicationic pentamidine is energetically favourable in TbAQP2, driven by the membrane potential, although aquaporins are normally strictly impermeable for ionic species. We also identify the structural determinants that make pentamidine a permeant although most other diamidine drugs are excluded. Our results have wide-ranging implications for optimising antitrypanosomal drugs and averting cross-resistance. Moreover, these new insights in aquaporin permeation may allow the pharmacological exploitation of other members of this ubiquitous gene family.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54880">Transient intracellular acidification regulates the core transcriptional heat shock response</a></h4>

Heat shock induces a conserved transcriptional program regulated by heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in eukaryotic cells. Activation of this heat shock response is triggered by heat-induced misfolding of newly synthesized polypeptides, and so has been thought to depend on ongoing protein synthesis. Here, using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we report the discovery that Hsf1 can be robustly activated when protein synthesis is inhibited, so long as cells undergo cytosolic acidification. Heat shock has long been known to cause transient intracellular acidification which, for reasons which have remained unclear, is associated with increased stress resistance in eukaryotes. We demonstrate that acidification is required for heat shock response induction in translationally inhibited cells, and specifically affects Hsf1 activation. Physiological heat-triggered acidification also increases population fitness and promotes cell cycle reentry following heat shock. Our results uncover a previously unknown adaptive dimension of the well-studied eukaryotic heat shock response.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53539">Altered functional connectivity during speech perception in congenital amusia</a></h4>

Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing. Accordingly, they downweight pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration. We investigated the neural basis for this strategy. During fMRI, individuals with amusia (N=15) and controls (N=15) read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary. They then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues, and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amusia group, between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners. Connectivity differences between these regions were not present during a control task. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, and suggest a compensatory mechanism.

Introduction: Sex differences in brain cortical function affect cognition, behavior, and susceptibility to neural diseases, but the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism in cortical function is still largely unknown. Estrogen and estrogen receptors (ERs), specifically ER{beta}, the most abundant ER in the cortex, may play a role in determining sex differences in gene expression, which could underlie functional sex differences. However, further investigation is needed to address brain region specificity of the effects of sex and ER{beta} on gene expression. The goal of this study was to investigate sex differences in gene expression in the mouse posterior cortex, where sex differences in transcription have never been examined, and to determine how genetic ablation of ER{beta} affects transcription. Methods: In this study, we performed unbiased transcriptomics on RNA from the posterior cortex of adult wild-type and ER{beta} knockout mice (n=4/sex/genotype). We used unbiased clustering to analyze whole-transcriptome changes between the groups. We also performed differential expression analysis on the data using DESeq2 to identify specific changes in gene expression. Results: We found only 27 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in wild-type (WT) males vs females, of which 17 were autosomal genes. Interestingly, in ER{beta}KO males vs females all the autosomal DEGs were lost. Gene Ontology analysis of the subset of DEGs with sex differences only in the WT cortex revealed a significant enrichment of genes annotated with the function cation channel activity. Moreover, within each sex we found only a few DEGs in ER{beta}KO vs WT mice (8 and 5 in males and females, respectively). Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that in the adult mouse posterior cortex there are surprisingly few sex differences in gene expression, and those that exist are mainly related to cation channel activity. Additionally, they indicate that brain region-specific functional effects of ER{beta} may be largely post-transcriptional.

Choosing a mate is one of the most consequential decisions a female will make during her lifetime. This is particularly true for species in which females either mate repeatedly with the same partner or mate infrequently but use the sperm from a single copulation to fertilize eggs over an extended period of time. Drosophila melanogaster uses the latter strategy. Here, we characterize the neural circuitry that implements mating decisions in the female brain. A female fly signals her mating choice by opening her vaginal plates to allow a courting male to copulate. Vaginal plate opening (VPO) occurs in response to the male courtship song and is dependent upon the female's mating status. We sought to understand how these exteroceptive (song) and interoceptive (mating status) inputs are integrated to control VPO. We show that VPO is triggered by a pair of female-specific descending neurons, the vpoDNs. The vpoDNs receive excitatory input from vpoEN auditory neurons, which are tuned to specific features of the melanogaster song. The song responses of vpoDNs, but not vpoENs, are attenuated upon mating, accounting for the reduced receptivity of mated females. This modulation is mediated by pC1 neurons, which encode the female's mating status and also provide excitatory input to vpoDNs. The vpoDNs thus directly integrate the external and internal signals to control the mating decisions of Drosophila females.

Variations in body mass index (BMI) have been suggested to relate to atypical brain organization, yet connectome-level substrates of BMI and their neurobiological underpinnings remain unclear. Studying 325 healthy young adults, we examined association between functional connectome organization and BMI variations. We capitalized on connectome manifold learning techniques, which represent macroscale functional connectivity patterns along continuous hierarchical axes that dissociate low level and higher order brain systems. We observed an increased differentiation between unimodal and heteromodal association networks in individuals with higher BMI, indicative of an increasingly segregated modular architecture and a disruption in the hierarchical integration of different brain system. Transcriptomic decoding and subsequent gene enrichment analyses identified genes previously implicated in genome-wide associations to BMI and specific cortical, striatal, and cerebellar cell types. These findings provide novel insights for functional connectome substrates of BMI variations in healthy young adults and point to potential molecular associations.

Nobody wants to experience anxiety. However, anxiety may be induced by our own implicit choices that are mis-reinforced by some imbalance in reinforcement learning. Here we focused on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as a candidate for implicitly learned anxiety. Simulations in the reinforcement learning framework showed that agents implicitly learn to become anxious when the memory trace signal for past actions decays differently for positive and negative prediction errors. In empirical data, we confirmed that OCD patients showed extremely imbalanced traces, which were normalized by serotonin enhancers. We also used fMRI to identify the neural signature of OCD and healthy participants with imbalanced traces. Beyond the spectrum of clinical phenotypes, these behavioral and neural characteristics can be generalized to variations in the healthy population.

The complexity of social interactions is a defining property of the human species. Many social neuroscience experiments have sought to map "perspective taking", "empathy", and other canonical psychological constructs to distinguishable brain circuits. This predominant research paradigm was seldom complemented by bottom-up studies of the unknown sources of variation that add up to measures of social brain structure; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. We aimed at a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks in the UK Biobank cohort (n=~10,000). Coherent patterns of structural co-variation were explored within a recent atlas of social brain locations, enabled through translating autoencoder algorithms from deep learning. The artificial neural networks learned rich subnetwork representations that became apparent from social brain variation at population scale. The learned subnetworks carried essential information about the co-dependence configurations between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as feelings of loneliness. Our population-level evidence indicates that hidden subsystems of the social brain underpin interindividual variation in dissociable aspects of social lifestyle.

Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a neurological disorder with no cure. NPC proteins deliver cholesterol from endosomes to other compartments including trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) is a resident ER enzyme that converts cholesterol to cholesteryl esters for storage. Here, we report the surprising finding that in a mutant Npc1 mice, Acat1-deficiency delayed the onset of weight loss and declining motor skill, prolonged lifespan, delayed Purkinje neuron death, and improved hepatosplenic pathology. Furthermore, syntaxin 6, a cholesterol-binding t-SNARE normally localized to TGN, is mislocalized in mutant NPC cells. However, upon ACAT1 inhibition this mislocalization is corrected, and increase the level of a few proteins further downstream. Our results imply that ACAT1 inhibition diverts a cholesterol storage pool in a way that replenished the low cholesterol level in NPC-deficient TGN. Taking together, we identify ACAT1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for NPC treatment.

Oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) support sex-specific and context-appropriate social behaviors. Although alterations of these systems underlie the appearance of neuropsychiatric disorders, their formation and developmental dynamics remain largely unknown. Using novel brain clearing techniques and 3D imaging, we have reconstructed the specification of oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic circuits in the developing mouse brain with unprecedented cellular resolution. A systematic quantification indicates that OXT and AVP neurons in the hypothalamus display distinctive dynamics, but also share common features as a high cellular plasticity from embryonic to early postnatal stages. Our findings reveal new insights into the appearance and consolidation of neuropeptidergic systems in the developing CNS which is a critical step to unveil brain formation and function.

Voluntary movements are usually preceded by a slow, negative-going brain signal over motor areas, the so-called readiness potential (RP). To date, the exact nature and causal role of the RP in movement preparation have remained heavily debated. One important open question is whether people can exert conscious control over their RP, for example by learning to suppress it. If people were able to initiate spontaneous movements without eliciting an RP, this would challenge the idea that the RP is a necessary stage of the causal chain leading up to a voluntary movement. We tested the ability of participants to control the magnitude of their RP in a neurofeedback experiment. Participants performed self-initiated movements and after every movement they were provided with immediate feedback about the magnitude of their RP. They were asked to find a mental strategy to perform voluntary movements such that the RPs were as small as possible. We found no evidence that participants were able to to willfully modulate or suppress their RPs while still eliciting voluntary movements. This suggests that the RP might be an involuntary component of voluntary action over which people cannot exert conscious control.

Autophagy is a finely tuned process of programmed degradation and recycling of proteins and cellular components, which is crucial in neuronal function and synaptic integrity. Mounting evidence implicates chromatin remodelling in fine-tuning autophagy pathways. However, this epigenetic regulation is poorly understood in neurons. Here, we investigate the role in autophagy of KANSL1, a member of the nonspecific lethal complex, which acetylates histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16ac) to facilitate transcriptional activation. Loss-of-function of KANSL1 is strongly associated with the neurodevelopmental disorder Koolen-de Vries Syndrome (KdVS). Starting from KANSL1-deficient human induced-pluripotent stem cells, both from KdVS patients and genome-edited lines, we identified superoxide dismutase 1, an antioxidant enzyme, to be significantly decreased, leading to a subsequent increase in oxidative stress and autophagosome accumulation. In KANSL1-deficient neurons, autophagosome accumulation at excitatory synapses resulted in reduced synaptic density, reduced AMPA receptor-mediated transmission and impaired neuronal network activity. Furthermore, we found that increased oxidative stress-mediated autophagosome accumulation leads to increased mTOR activation and decreased lysosome function, further preventing the clearing of autophagosomes. Finally, by pharmacologically reducing oxidative stress, we could rescue the aberrant autophagosome formation as well as synaptic and neuronal network activity in KANSL1-deficient neurons. Our findings thus point towards an important relation between oxidative stress-induced autophagy and synapse function, and demonstrate the importance of H4K16ac-mediated changes in chromatin structure to balance reactive oxygen species- and mTOR-dependent autophagy.

Endogenous clocks enable organisms to adapt their physiology and behavior to daily variation in environmental conditions. Metabolic processes in cyanobacteria to humans are effected by the circadian clock, and its dysregulation causes metabolic disorders. In mouse and Drosophila were shown that the circadian clock directs translation of factors involved in ribosome biogenesis and synchronizes protein synthesis. However, the role of clocks in Drosophila neurogenesis and the potential impact of clock impairment on neural circuit formation and function is less understood. Here we demonstrate that light stimuli or circadian clock causes a defect in neural stem cell growth and proliferation accompanied by reduced nucleolar size. Further, we define that light and clock independently affect the InR/TOR growth regulatory pathway due to the effect on regulators of protein biosynthesis. Altogether, these data suggest that alterations in growth regulatory pathways induced by light and clock are associated with impaired neural development.

Rapid screening for stroke in pre-hospital settings may improve patient outcomes by allowing early deployment of thrombolytic therapies. Near-infrared hybrid diffuse optical screening devices may fill this need. This study seeks to determine whether hybrid diffuse optical measurements can measure hemodynamic changes associated with cerebral ischemia within the first few hours of the onset of acute ischemia in a large animal model. A hybrid diffuse optical device combining of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) was fabricated to measure total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) and blood flow index (BFI). Cerebral ischemia was induced by ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) in five miniature pigs. Additionally, a fatal stroke was induced in two pigs by injecting 5ml air emboli into both CCA. Cerebral hemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously throughout the study with the hybrid optical device. Relative changes BFI showed the good repeatability both of the ligation and fatal stroke experiments. During bilateral CCA ligation, the BFI decreased by up to about 66% of baseline values; during the fatal stroke experiment, the BFI decreased by up to about 95%, with a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. To the best of our knowledge, there are not existing methods which can measure the cerebral ischemia within the first few hours of the onset noninvasively. The MRI scanning was conducted at 24 h post injury. However, the images showed no abnormality. The results show the hybrid diffuse optical method can immediately measure the hemodynamic changes of miniature pigs in the first few hours of each single cerebral ischemia onset, and the BFI may be the promising biomarker to distinguish the cerebral ischemia and cerebral death.

Eye related movements such as blinks and microsaccades are modulated during bistable perceptual tasks, however, the role of such movements in these purely internal perceptual switches is not known. We conducted two experiments involving an ambiguous plaid stimulus, wherein participants had to continuously report their motion percept. To dissociate the effect of blinks and microsaccades from the visual consequences of such eye movements, we added external blanks and microshifts. Our results showed that while blanks facilitated a switch to the coherent motion percept, this was not the case for a switch to component percept. A similar difference was found with respect to blinks. While both types of perceptual switches were preceded by a decrease in blinks, only the switch to coherent percept was followed by an increase in blinks. These blink related findings, which we largely replicated and refined in a second study, indicate distinct internal processes underlying the two perceptual switches. Microsaccade rates, on the other hand, only showed a weak relation with perceptual switches but their direction was modulated by the perceived motion direction. Additionally, our data showed that microsaccades are differently modulated around internal (blinks) and external events (blanks, microshifts), indicating an interaction between different eye related movements. This study shows that eye movements such as blinks and microsaccades are modulated by purely internal perceptual events independent of task related motor or attentional demands. Eye movements therefore can uncover distinct internal perceptual processes that might otherwise be hard to dissociate.

Histone-3-lysine-4-methylation (H3K4me) is mediated by six different lysine methyltransferases (KMTs). Amongst these enzymes SET domain containing 1b (SETD1B) has been linked to intellectual disability but its role in the adult brain has not been studied yet. Here we show that mice lacking Setd1b from excitatory neurons of the adult forebrain exhibit severe memory impairment. By combining neuron-specific ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq approaches we show that Setd1b controls the expression of neuronal-identity genes with a broad H3K4me3 peak linked to learning and memory processes. Our data furthermore suggest that basal neuronal gene-expression is ensured by other H3K4 KMTs such as Kmt2a and Kmt2b while the additional presence of Setd1b at the single cell level provides transcriptional consistency to the expression of genes important for learning &amp; memory.

The functional organization of diverse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types, which shape the visual signals transmitted to the brain, has been examined in many species. The unique spatial, temporal, and chromatic properties of the numerically dominant RGC types in macaque monkey retina are presumed to most accurately model human vision. However, the functional similarity between RGCs in macaques and humans has only begun to be tested, and recent work suggests possible differences. Here, the properties of the numerically dominant human RGC types were examined using large-scale multi-electrode recordings with fine-grained visual stimulation in isolated retina, and compared to results from dozens of recordings from macaque retina using the same experimental methods and conditions. The properties of four major human RGC types -- ON-parasol, OFF-parasol, ON-midget, and OFF-midget -- closely paralleled those of the same macaque RGC types, including the spatial and temporal light sensitivity, precisely coordinated mosaic organization of receptive fields, ON-OFF asymmetries, spatial response nonlinearity, and sampling of photoreceptor inputs over space. Putative smooth monostratified cells and polyaxonal amacrine cells were also identified based on similarities to cell types previously identified in macaque retina. The results suggest that recently proposed differences between human and macaque RGCs probably reflect experimental differences, and that the macaque model provides an accurate picture of human RGC function.

Neural circuit synaptic connectivities (the connectome) provide the anatomical foundation for our understanding of nematode nervous system function. However, other non-synaptic routes of communication are known in invertebrates including extrasynaptic volume transmission (EVT), which enables short- and/or long-range communication in the absence of synaptic connections. Although EVT has been highlighted as a facet of Caenorhabditis elegans neurosignaling, no experimental evidence identifies body cavity fluid (pseudocoelomic fluid; PCF) as a vehicle for either neuropeptide or biogenic amine transmission. In the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum FMRFamide-like peptides encoded on flp-18 potently stimulate female reproductive organs but are only expressed in cells that are anatomically distant from the reproductive organ, with no known synaptic connections to this tissue. Here we report a new non-synaptic mode of signaling in nematodes mediated by neuropeptides within the PCF. Our data show that: (i) A. suum PCF (As-PCF) contains a catalogue of neuropeptides including FMRFamide-like peptides and neuropeptide-like proteins; (ii) the A. suum FMRFamide-like peptide As-FLP-18A dominates the As-PCF peptidome; (iii) As-PCF potently modulates nematode reproductive muscle function ex vivo, mirroring the effects of synthetic FLP-18 peptides; (iv) As-PCF activates the C. elegans FLP-18 receptors NPR-4 and -5; (v) As-PCF alters C. elegans behavior and, (vi) FLP-18 and FLP-18 receptors display pan-phylum distribution in nematodes. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence that supports an extrasynaptic volume route for neuropeptide transmission in nematodes. These data demonstrate non-synaptic signaling within the nematode functional connectome and are pertinent to receptor deorphanisation approaches underpinning drug discovery programs for nematode pathogens.

Increased reactivity to addiction related cues (cue-reactivity) plays a critical role in the maintenance of addiction. Studies assessing cue-reactivity in gambling disorder often suffer from low ecological validity due to the usage of picture stimuli in a neutral lab environment. Here we describe a novel virtual reality (VR) set-up for the concurrent assessment of behavioral and psychophysiological cue-reactivity in gambling disorder. On two days, thirty-four healthy non-gambling participants explored two rich and navigable VR-environments (neutral: cafe vs. gambling-related: casino and sports-betting facility), while their electrodermal activity was measured using remote sensors. In addition, participants completed a temporal discounting task implemented in each VR environment. On a third day, participants performed the task in a standard lab testing context. We then used comprehensive computational modeling using both standard softmax and drift diffusion model (DDM) choice rules to assess the reliability of discounting model parameters assessed in VR. Test-retest reliability estimates were good to excellent for the discount rate log(k), whereas they were poor to moderate for additional DDM parameters. Differences in model parameters between standard lab testing and VR, reflecting reactivity to the different environments, were mostly numerically small and of inconclusive directionality. Finally, while exposure to VR generally increased tonic skin conductance, this effect was not modulated by the neutral vs. gambling-related VR-environment. Taken together this proof-of-concept study in non-gambling participants demonstrates the feasibility assessing both physiological and behavioral cue-reactivity in VR. We show that temporal discounting measures obtained in VR are reliable, suggesting that VR is a promising tool for an ecologically valid assessment of cue-reactivity in gambling disorder.

How the unique capacities of human cognition arose in evolution is a question of enduring interest. It is still unclear which developmental programs are responsible for the emergence of the human brain. The inability to determine corresponding ages between humans and apes has hampered progress in detecting developmental programs leading to the emergence of the human brain. I harness temporal variation in anatomical, behavioral, and transcriptional variation to determine corresponding ages from fetal to postnatal development and aging, between humans and chimpanzees. This multi-dimensional approach results in 137 corresponding time points across the lifespan, from embryonic day 44 to ~55 years of age, in humans and their equivalent ages in chimpanzees. I used these data to test whether developmental programs, such as the timeline of prefrontal cortex maturation, previously claimed to differ between humans and chimpanzees, do so once variation in developmental schedules is controlled for. I compared the maturation of frontal cortex projections from structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans and from temporal variation in the expression of genes used to track long-range projecting neurons (i.e., supragranular-enirhced genes) in chimpanzees and humans. Contrary to what has been suggested, the timetable of prefrontal cortex maturation is not unusually extended in humans. This dataset, which is the largest with which to determine corresponding ages across humans and chimpanzees, provides a rigorous approach to control for variation in developmental schedules and to identify developmental programs responsible for unique features of the human brain.

The perception of opportunities and threats in complex scenes represents one of the main functions of the human visual system. In the laboratory, its neurophysiological basis is often studied by having observers view pictures varying in affective content. This body of work has consistently shown that viewing emotionally engaging, compared to neutral, pictures (1) heightens blood flow in limbic structures and frontoparietal cortex, as well as in anterior ventral and dorsal visual cortex, and (2) prompts an increase in the late positive event-related potential (LPP), a scalp-recorded and time-sensitive index of engagement within the network of aforementioned neural structures. The role of retinotopic visual cortex in this process has, however, been contentious, with competing theoretical notions predicting the presence versus absence of emotion-specific signals in retinotopic visual areas. The present study used multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning to address this question by examining the large-scale neural representations of affective pictures. Recording EEG and fMRI simultaneously while observers viewed pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral affective pictures, and applying multivariate pattern analysis to single-trial BOLD activities in retinotopic visual cortex, we identified three robust findings: First, unpleasant-versus-neutral decoding accuracy, as well as pleasant-versus-neutral decoding accuracy, were well above chance level in all retinotopic visual areas, including primary visual cortex. Second, the decoding accuracy in ventral visual cortex, but not in early visual cortex or dorsal visual cortex, was significantly correlated with LPP amplitude. Third, effective connectivity from amygdala to ventral visual cortex predicted unpleasant-versus-neutral decoding accuracy, and effective connectivity from ventral frontal cortex to ventral visual cortex predicted pleasant-versus-neutral decoding accuracy. These results suggest that affective pictures evoked valence-specific multivoxel neural representations in retinotopic visual cortex and that these multivoxel representations were influenced by reentry signals from limbic and frontal brain regions.

Representing multiple agents and their mutual relations is a prerequisite to understand social events. Using functional MRI on human adults, we show that visual areas dedicated to body-form and body-motion perception contribute to processing social events, by holding the representation of multiple moving bodies and encoding the spatial relations between them. In particular, seeing animations of human bodies facing and moving toward (vs. away from) each other, increased neural activity in the body-selective cortex (extrastriate body area -EBA) and posterior superior temporal sulcus for biological-motion perception (bm-pSTS). In those areas, representation of body postures and movements, as well as of the overall scene, was more accurate for facing-body (vs. non-facing body) stimuli. Effective connectivity analysis with Dynamic Causal Modeling revealed increased coupling between EBA and bm-pSTS during perception of facing-body stimuli. The attunement of human vision to multiple-body scenes involving perceptual cues of interaction such as face-to-face positioning and approaching behaviour, was further supported by the participants' better performance in a match-to-sample task with facing-body vs. non-facing body stimuli. Thus, visuo-spatial cues of interaction in multiple-person scenarios affect the perceptual representation of body and body motion and, by promoting functional integration, streamline the process from body perception to action representation.

In experiments on perceptual decision-making, individuals learn a categorization task through trial-and-error protocols. We explore the capacity of a decision-making attractor network to learn a categorization task through reward-based, Hebbian type, modifications of the weights incoming from the stimulus encoding layer. For the latter, we assume a standard layer of a large number of stimulus specific neurons. Within the general framework of Hebbian learning, authors have hypothesized that the learning rate is modulated by the reward at each trial. Surprisingly, we find that, when the coding layer has been optimized in view of the categorization task, such reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL) fails to extract efficiently the category membership. In a previous work we showed that the attractor neural networks nonlinear dynamics accounts for behavioral confidence in sequences of decision trials. Taking advantage of these findings, we propose that learning is controlled by confidence, as computed from the neural activity of the decision-making attractor network. Here we show that this confidence-controlled, reward-based, Hebbian learning efficiently extracts categorical information from the optimized coding layer. The proposed learning rule is local, and, in contrast to RMHL, does not require to store the average rewards obtained on previous trials. In addition, we find that the confidence-controlled learning rule achieves near optimal performance.

Alpha rhythms (~10Hz) in the human brain are classically associated with idling activities, being predominantly observed during quiet restfulness with closed eyes. However, recent studies demonstrated that alpha (~10Hz) rhythms can directly relate to visual stimulation, resulting in oscillations which can last for as long as one second. This alpha reverberation, dubbed Perceptual Echoes (PE), suggests that the visual system actively samples and processes visual information within the alpha-band frequency. Although PE have been linked to various visual functions, their underlying mechanisms and functional role are not completely understood. In the current study, we investigated whether conscious perception modulates the generation and the amplitude of PE. Specifically, we displayed two colored Gabor patches with different orientations on opposite sides of the screen, and using a set of dichoptic mirrors we induced a binocular rivalry between the two stimuli. We asked participants to continuously report which one of two Gabor patches they consciously perceived, while recording their EEG signals. Importantly, the luminance of each patch fluctuated randomly over time, generating random sequences from which we estimated two impulse-response functions (IRFs) reflecting the perceptual echoes generated by the perceived (dominant) and non-perceived (suppressed) stimulus respectively. We found that the alpha power of the PE generated by the consciously perceived stimulus was comparable with that of the PE generated during monocular vision (control condition), and significantly higher than the PE induced by the suppressed stimulus. Moreover, confirming previous findings, we found that all PEs propagated as a travelling wave from posterior to frontal brain regions, irrespective of conscious perception. All in all our results demonstrate that conscious perception modulates PE, suggesting that the synchronization of neural activity plays an important role in visual sampling and conscious perception.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.06.239152v1?rss=1">A novel method for tri-clustering dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) identifies significant schizophrenia effects across multiple states in distinct subgroups of individuals</a></h4>

Background: Brain imaging data collected from individuals are highly complex with unique variation; however, such variation is typically ignored in approaches that focus on group averages or even supervised prediction. State-of-the-art methods for analyzing dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) subdivide the entire time course into several (possibly overlapping) connectivity states (i.e., sliding window clusters). Though, such an approach does not factor in the homogeneity of underlying data and may end up with a less meaningful subgrouping of the dataset. Methods: Dynamic-N-way tri-clustering (dNTiC) incorporates a homogeneity benchmark to approximate clusters that provide a more apples-to-apples comparison between groups within analogous subsets of time-space and subjects. dNTiC sorts the dFNC states by maximizing similarity across individuals and minimizing variance among the pairs of components within a state. Results: Resulting tri-clusters show significant differences between schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy control (HC) in distinct brain regions. Compared to HC, SZ in most tri-clusters show hypoconnectivity (low positive) among subcortical, default mode, cognitive control but hyper-connectivity (high positive) between sensory networks. In tri-cluster 3, HC subjects show significantly stronger connectivity among sensory networks and anticorrelation between subcortical and sensory networks compared to SZ. Results also provide statistically significant difference in reoccurrence time between SZ and HC subjects for two distinct dFNC states. Conclusions: Outcomes emphasize the utility of the proposed method for characterizing and leveraging variance within high-dimensional data to enhance the interpretability and sensitivity of measurements in the study of a heterogeneous disorder like schizophrenia and in unconstrained experimental conditions such as resting fMRI.

Optogenetics has been harnessed to shed new mechanistic light on current therapies and to develop future treatment strategies. This has been to date achieved by the correction of electrical signals in neuronal cells and neural circuits that are affected by disease. In contrast, the optogenetic delivery of trophic biochemical signals, which support cell survival and thereby may modify progression of degenerative disorders, has never been demonstrated in an animal disease model. Here, we reengineered the human and Drosophila melanogaster REarranged during Transfection (hRET and dRET) receptors to be activated by light, creating one-component optogenetic tools termed Opto-hRET and Opto-dRET. Upon blue light stimulation, these receptors robustly induced the MAPK/ERK proliferative signaling pathway in cultured cells. In PINK1B9 flies that exhibit loss of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), a kinase associated with familial Parkinson's disease (PD), light activation of Opto-dRET suppressed mitochondrial defects, tissue degeneration and behavioral deficits. In human cells with PINK1 loss-of-function, mitochondrial fragmentation was rescued using Opto-dRET via the PI3K/NF{kappa}B pathway. Our results demonstrate that a light-activated receptor can ameliorate disease hallmarks in a genetic model of PD. The optogenetic delivery of trophic signals is cell type-specific and reversible and thus has the potential to overcome limitations of current strategies towards a spatio-temporal regulation of tissue repair.

Myelin plays a crucial role in how well information travels between brain regions. Many neurological diseases affect the myelin in the white matter, making myelin-sensitive metrics derived from quantitative MRI of potential interest for early detection and prognosis of those conditions. Complementing the structural connectome, obtained with diffusion MRI tractography, with a myelin sensitive measure could result in a more complete model of structural brain connectivity and give better insight into how the myeloarchitecture relates to brain function. In this work we weight the connectome by the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) as a measure sensitive to myelin, and then we assess its added value by comparing it with connectomes weighted by the number of streamlines (NOS). Our analysis reveals differences between the two connectomes both in the distribution of their weights and the modular organization. Additionally, the rank-based analysis shows that R1 is able to separate different classes (unimodal and transmodal), following a functional gradient. Overall, the R1-weighted connectome provides a different perspective on structural connectivity taking into account white matter myeloarchitecture.

Annually, approximately 3 million children around the world experience traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), of which up to 20% are characterized as moderate to severe (msTBI) and/or have abnormal imaging findings. Affected children are vulnerable to long-term cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, as injury can disrupt or alter ongoing brain maturation. Post-injury outcomes are highly variable, and there is only limited understanding of how inter-individual differences in outcomes arise. Small sample sizes have also complicated efforts to better understand factors influencing the impact of TBI on the developing brain. White matter (WM) disruption is a critical aspect of TBI neuropathology and diffusion MRI (dMRI) is particularly sensitive to microstructural abnormalities. Here we present the results of a coordinated analysis of dMRI data across ten cohorts from three countries. We had three primary aims: (1) to characterize the nature and extent of WM disruption across key post-injury intervals (acute/subacute - within 2 months, post-acute - 2-6 months, chronic - 6+ months); (2) evaluate the impact of age and sex on WM in the context of injury; and (3) to examine associations between WM and neurobehavioral outcomes. Based on data from 507 children and adolescents (244 with complicated mild to severe TBI and 263 control children), we report widespread WM disruption across all post-injury intervals. As expected, injury severity was a significant contributor to the pattern and extent of WM degradation, but explained less variance in dMRI measures with increasing time since injury, supporting other research indicating that other factors contribute increasingly to outcomes over time. The corpus callosum appears to be particularly vulnerable to injury, an effect that persists years post-TBI. We also report sex differences in the effect of TBI on the uncinate fasciculus (UNC), a structure with a key role in emotion regulation. Females with a TBI had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the UNC than those with no TBI, and this phenomenon was further associated with more frequent parent-reported behavioral problems as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). These effects were not detected in males. With future harmonization of imaging and neurocognitive data, more complex modeling of factors influencing outcomes will be possible and help to identify clinically-meaningful patient subtypes.

Background: The use of functional neuroimaging has been an extremely fruitful avenue for investigating the neural basis of human reward function. This approach has included identification of potential neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric disease and examination of environmental, experiential, and biological factors that may contribute to disease risk via effects on the reward system. However, a central and largely unexamined assumption of much of this research is that neural reward function is an individual difference characteristic that is relatively stable over time. Methods: In two independent samples of adolescents and young adults studied longitudinally (Ns = 145 &amp; 153, 100% female &amp; 100% male, ages 15-21 &amp; 20-22, 2-4 scans &amp; 2 scans respectively), we tested within-person stability of reward-task BOLD activation, with a median of 1 and 2 years between scans. We examined multiple commonly used contrasts of active states and baseline in both the anticipation and feedback phases of a card-guessing reward task. We examined the effects of cortical parcellation resolution, contrast, network (reward regions and resting-state networks), region-size, and activation strength and variability on the stability of reward-related activation. Results: Overall, stability (ICC; intra-class correlation) across 1-2 years was modest. In both samples, contrasts of an active state relative to a baseline were more stable (e.g., Win&gt;Baseline; mean ICC = 0.13 - 0.33) than contrasts of two active states (e.g., Win&gt;Loss; mean ICC = 0.048 - 0.05). Additionally, activation in reward regions was less stable than in many non-task networks (e.g., dorsal attention), and activation in regions with greater between-subject variability showed higher stability in both samples. Conclusions: These results show that functional neuroimaging activation to reward has modest stability over 1-2 years. Notably, results suggest that contrasts intended to map cognitive function and show robust group-level effects (i.e. Win &gt; Loss) may be less effective in studies of individual differences and disease risk. The robustness of group-level activation should be weighed against other factors when selecting regions of interest in individual difference fMRI studies.

Netrins are secreted proteins that direct cell migration and axon extension in the developing CNS and are essential for normal neural development. In the mature CNS, netrin-1 is expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes and implicated in the stability of axo-oligodendroglial paranodal junctions. Here we report that the netrin receptor UNC5B is highly expressed by mature oligodendrocytes and enriched at paranodes. We demonstrate that paranodes become disorganized following conditional deletion of UNC5B in oligodendrocytes, with disruption of the interface between glial loops and detachment of glial loops from the axon. Examining axoglial domain segregation, Caspr1 and Kv1.1 disperse along the axon, internodes shorten, and the periodicity of compact myelin is reduced, indicating significant breakdown of myelin organization in UNC5B cKOs. Paranodal disruption and axoglial domain disorganization progressively worsen with age and a delay in motor learning develops specifically in aged animals that lack oligodendroglial UNC5B. We detect reduced amounts of oligodendroglial Claudin-11 and JAM-C proteins in UNC5B knockouts, suggesting that disruption of the specialized autotypic junctions between glial loops may underlie paranodal disorganization. Our findings reveal an essential contribution of oligodendroglial UNC5B at axoglial junctions that is required for the stability of mature myelin.

<p>by Leonila Lagunes, Lee Bardwell, German A. Enciso</p>

Protein activity is often regulated by ligand binding or by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Moreover, proteins that are regulated in this way often contain multiple ligand binding sites or modification sites, which can operate to create an ultrasensitive dose response. Here, we consider the contribution of the individual modification/binding sites to the activation process, and how their individual values affect the ultrasensitive behavior of the overall system. We use a generalized Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model that allows for variable conformational free energy contributions from distinct sites, and associate a so-called activation parameter to each site. Our analysis shows that the ultrasensitivity generally increases as the conformational free energy contribution from one or more sites is strengthen. Furthermore, ultrasensitivity depends on the mean of the activation parameters and not on their variability. In some cases, we find that the best way to maximize ultrasensitivity is to make the contribution from all sites as strong as possible. These results provide insights into the performance objectives of multiple modification/binding sites and thus help gain a greater understanding of signaling and its role in diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJBqMdkzcCs" width="1" />

Radiotherapy is a commonly used conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Cytotoxicity limits the use of this life-saving therapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we use the syngeneic mouse BMT model to test the hypothesis that lethal radiation damages tissues, thereby unleashing signals that indiscriminately activate the inflammasome pathways in host and transplanted cells. We find that a clinically relevant high dose of radiation causes severe damage to bones and the spleen through mechanisms involving the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes but not the NLRC4 inflammasome. Downstream, we demonstrate that gasdermin D (GSDMD), the common effector of the inflammasomes, is also activated by radiation. Remarkably, protection against the injury induced by deadly ionizing radiation occurs only when NLRP3, AIM2, or GSDMD is lost simultaneously in both the donor and host cell compartments. Thus, this study reveals a continuum of the actions of lethal radiation relayed by the inflammasome-GSDMD axis, initially affecting recipient cells and ultimately harming transplanted cells as they grow in the severely injured and toxic environment. This study also suggests that therapeutic targeting of inflammasome-GSDMD signaling has the potential to prevent the collateral effects of intense radiation regimens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2JzKjJWvFho" width="1" />

<p>by Emmanuel Gallaud, Anjana Ramdas Nair, Nicole Horsley, Arnaud Monnard, Priyanka Singh, Tri Thanh Pham, David Salvador Garcia, Alexia Ferrand, Clemens Cabernard</p>

Centrosomes, the main microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) of metazoan cells, contain an older “mother” and a younger “daughter” centriole. Stem cells either inherit the mother or daughter-centriole-containing centrosome, providing a possible mechanism for biased delivery of cell fate determinants. However, the mechanisms regulating centrosome asymmetry and biased centrosome segregation are unclear. Using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and live-cell imaging, we show in fly neural stem cells (neuroblasts) that the mitotic kinase Polo and its centriolar protein substrate Centrobin (Cnb) accumulate on the daughter centriole during mitosis, thereby generating molecularly distinct mother and daughter centrioles before interphase. Cnb’s asymmetric localization, potentially involving a direct relocalization mechanism, is regulated by Polo-mediated phosphorylation, whereas Polo’s daughter centriole enrichment requires both Wdr62 and Cnb. Based on optogenetic protein mislocalization experiments, we propose that the establishment of centriole asymmetry in mitosis primes biased interphase MTOC activity, necessary for correct spindle orientation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nIq8ciYcrXg" width="1" />

<p>Many patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remain unresponsive after surviving critical illness. Although several structural brain abnormalities have been described, their impact on brain function and implications for prognosis are unknown. Functional neuroimaging, which has prognostic significance, has yet to be explored in this population. Here we describe a patient with severe COVID‐19 who, despite prolonged unresponsiveness and structural brain abnormalities, demonstrated intact functional network connectivity, and weeks later recovered the ability to follow commands. When prognosticating for survivors of severe COVID‐19, clinicians should consider that brain networks may remain functionally intact despite structural injury and prolonged unresponsiveness.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement, and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all <i>D. melanogaster </i> CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. <i>In vivo </i> assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90‐min dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole PET‐CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses with a plasma‐input function were performed using the single‐tissue and two‐tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma‐input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI‐based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma‐input‐ and reference tissue‐based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole time–activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BP<sub>ND</sub> at the voxel level. As PET tracer, [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue‐based approach.</p>

<p>Genetic studies have identified variants in the LRRK2 gene as important components of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathobiology. Biochemical and emergent biomarker studies have coalesced around LRRK2 hyperactivation in disease. Therapeutics that diminish LRRK2 activity, either with small molecule kinase inhibitors or anti-sense oligonucleotides, have recently advanced to the clinic. Historically, there have been few successes in the development of therapies that might slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Over the past few decades of biomedical research, retrospective analyses suggest the broad integration of informative biomarkers early in development tends to distinguish successful pipelines from those that fail early. Herein, we discuss the biomarker regulatory process, emerging LRRK2 biomarker candidates, assays, underlying biomarker biology, and clinical integration.</p>

<p>Recently, ferroptosis has been revealed as a new form of regulated cell death. Distinct from apoptosis and necrosis, ferroptosis is evoked by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the metabolism of iron, lipids, and amino acids plays a significant regulatory role in ferroptosis, which can be reversed by glutathione peroxidase 4 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. Ferroptosis is implicated in the onset and development of numerous neurological diseases. Emerging studies have reported that ferroptosis induces and aggravates brain tissue damage following cerebral ischemia, whereas inhibition of ferroptosis dramatically attenuates induced damage. In this review, we have summarized the mechanistic relationship between ferroptosis and cerebral ischemia, including through iron overload, downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4, and upregulation of lipid peroxidation. Although considerable attention has been paid to the effect of ferroptosis on cerebral ischemic injury, specific mechanisms need to be experimentally confirmed, including how cerebral ischemia induces ferroptosis and how ferroptosis deteriorates cerebral ischemia.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic but solid shield in the cerebral microvascular system. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by regulating the exchange of materials between the circulation and the brain and protects the neural tissue from neurotoxic components as well as pathogens. Here, we discuss the development of the BBB in physiological conditions and then focus on the role of the BBB in cerebrovascular disease, including acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Finally, we summarize recent advancements in the development of therapies targeting the BBB and outline future directions and outstanding questions in the field. We propose that BBB dysfunction not only results from, but is causal in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders; the BBB is more a contributor to the disruption of CNS homeostasis than a victim in neurological disorders.</p>

Despite the fact that sleep disturbances are a major issue in PD patients, only limited data are available regarding interactions of sleep disturbances and cognitive performance.</p>Objective<p>This post hoc analysis of the RaSPar trial was therefore designed to further elucidate sleep disturbances and their impact on cognition in PD.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-six PD patients with sleep disturbances were evaluated thoroughly including assessments of patients’ subjective and objective sleep quality by interview, questionnaires, and polysomnography (PSG). Cognitive performance was assessed by Parkinson Neuropsychometric Dementia Assessment (PANDA) and Test of Attentional Performance (TAP), and associations of sleep and cognitive function were evaluated.</p>Results<p>We did not detect differences in cognitive performance between patients with and without rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Instead, cognitive impairment, particularly affecting cognitive domains attention, executive function/working memory, and semantic memory, was associated with impaired PSG-measured sleep quality (e.g., sleep efficiency) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) (Apnea-Hypopnea Index &gt; 5/h). Global cognitive performance was decreased in patients with SDB (PANDA score 23.2 ± 3.5 vs. 26.9 ± 2.2, P = 0.020, unpaired two-sided t-test).</p>Conclusion<p>Sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances impair cognitive performance in PD and should be evaluated in routine care, and treatment options such as continuous airway pressure therapy should be considered.</p>

<p>The development of cognitive interventions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often requires the assessment of multiple cognitive functions. However, experimental settings consisting of various tasks are particularly strenuous for patients and can thus result in poor data quality. For the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition, this study aims to validate a combined n-back/nogo paradigm by comparing it to single task versions and to demonstrate its applicability for ADHD research. Twenty-five healthy individuals and 34 ADHD patients between 9 and 16 years participated in this event-related potential (ERP) study. Healthy controls underwent single task versions of a 2-back working memory task and a go/nogo response inhibition task as well as the introduced combined 2-back/nogo task. This combined task demonstrated a comparable ERP structure for working memory and response inhibition aspects as single task versions. Behaviorally, higher working memory performance during the combined paradigm indicated lower task difficulty, while high correlations between combined and single task versions still indicated valid working memory measures. For response inhibition performance, different task versions resulted in similar outcomes. The application of the combined n-back/nogo paradigm in ADHD patients revealed the expected working memory and response inhibition deficits, increased omission errors, reaction times, and standard deviation of reaction time, as well as diminished n-back P3 and nogo P3 amplitudes. We conclude that the combined n-back/nogo task is an effective paradigm for the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition deficits in ADHD on a behavioral and neurophysiological level.</p>

<p>Motor imagery-based brain–computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) send commands to a computer using the brain activity registered when a subject imagines—but does not perform—a given movement. However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as “BCI-inefficiency,” in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1: r = 0.54; Session 2: r = 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (r-squared = 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time.</p>

<p>The connectivity structure of neuronal networks in cortex is highly dynamic. This ongoing cortical rewiring is assumed to serve important functions for learning and memory. We analyze in this article a model for the self-organization of synaptic inputs onto dendritic branches of pyramidal cells. The model combines a generic stochastic rewiring principle with a simple synaptic plasticity rule that depends on local dendritic activity. In computer simulations, we find that this synaptic rewiring model leads to synaptic clustering, that is, temporally correlated inputs become locally clustered on dendritic branches. This empirical finding is backed up by a theoretical analysis which shows that rewiring in our model favors network configurations with synaptic clustering. We propose that synaptic clustering plays an important role in the organization of computation and memory in cortical circuits: we find that synaptic clustering through the proposed rewiring mechanism can serve as a mechanism to protect memories from subsequent modifications on a medium time scale. Rewiring of synaptic connections onto specific dendritic branches may thus counteract the general problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.</p>

<p>During development, neurons navigate a tangled thicket of thousands of axons and dendrites to synapse with just a few specific targets. This phenomenon termed wiring specificity, is critical to the assembly of neural circuits and the way neurons manage this feat is only now becoming clear. Recent studies in the mouse retina are shedding new insight into this process. They show that specific wiring arises through a series of stages that include: directed axonal and dendritic growth, the formation of neuropil layers, positioning of such layers, and matching of co-laminar synaptic partners. Each stage appears to be directed by a distinct family of recognition molecules, suggesting that the combinatorial expression of such family members might act as a blueprint for retinal connectivity. By reviewing the evidence in support of each stage, and by considering their underlying molecular mechanisms, we attempt to synthesize these results into a wiring model which generates testable predictions for future studies. Finally, we conclude by highlighting new optical methods that could be used to address such predictions and gain further insight into this fundamental process.</p>

<p>The inferior colliculus (IC) is an auditory midbrain structure involved in processing biologically important temporal features of sounds. The responses of IC neurons to these temporal features reflect an interaction of synaptic inputs and neuronal biophysical properties. One striking biophysical property of IC neurons is the rebound depolarization produced following membrane hyperpolarization. To understand how the rebound depolarization is involved in spike timing, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from IC neurons in brain slices of P9–21 rats. We found that the percentage of rebound neurons was developmentally regulated. The precision of the timing of the first spike on the rebound increased when the neuron was repetitively injected with a depolarizing current following membrane hyperpolarization. The average jitter of the first spikes was only 0.5 ms. The selective T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonist, mibefradil, significantly increased the jitter of the first spike of neurons in response to repetitive depolarization following membrane hyperpolarization. Furthermore, the rebound was potentiated by one to two preceding rebounds within a few hundred milliseconds. The first spike generated on the potentiated rebound was more precise than that on the non-potentiated rebound. With the addition of a calcium chelator, BAPTA, into the cell, the rebound potentiation no longer occurred, and the precision of the first spike on the rebound was not improved. These results suggest that the postinhibitory rebound mediated by T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel promotes spike timing precision in IC neurons. The rebound potentiation and precise spikes may be induced by increases in intracellular calcium levels.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by the accumulation of intracellular lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferroptosis is significantly different from other types of cell death including apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, both in morphology and biochemical characteristics. The mechanisms that are associated with ferroptosis include iron metabolism, lipid oxidation, and other pathophysiological changes. Ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors can influence its occurrence through different pathways. Ferroptosis was initially discovered in tumors, though recent studies have confirmed that it is also closely related to a variety of neurological diseases including neurodegenerative disease [Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), etc.] and stroke. This article reviews the definition and characteristics of ferroptosis, the potential mechanisms associated with its development, inducers/inhibitors, and its role in non-neoplastic neurological diseases. We hope to provide a theoretical basis and novel treatment strategies for the treatment of central nervous system diseases by targeting ferroptosis.</p>

<p>A class of Group III muscle afferent neurons has branching sensory terminals in the connective tissue between layers of mouse abdominal muscles (“CT3 muscle afferents”). These sensory endings are both mechanosensitive and metabosensitive. In the present study, responses of CT3 afferents to lactate ions and changes in temperature were recorded. Raising muscle temperature from 32.7°C to 37°C had no consistent effects on CT3 afferent basal firing rate or responses to either von Frey hair stimulation or to an applied load. Superfusion with lactate ions (15 mM, pH 7.4) was associated with an increase in firing from 6 ± 0.7 Hz to 11.7 ± 6.7 Hz (14 units, n = 13, P &lt; 0.05, P = 0.0484) but with considerable variability in the nature and latency of response. Reducing the concentration of extracellular divalent cations, which mimicked the chelating effects of lactate, did not increase firing. Raised concentrations of divalent cations (to compensate for chelation) did not block excitatory effects of lactate on CT3 afferents, suggesting that effects via ASIC3 were not involved. Messenger RNA for the G-protein coupled receptor, hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) was detected in dorsal root ganglia and HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was present in spinal afferent nerve cell bodies retrogradely labeled from mouse abdominal muscles. HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was also present in axons in mouse abdominal muscles. This raises the possibility that some effects of lactate on group III muscle afferents may be mediated by HCAR1.</p>

<p>Inflammatory processes and microglia activation accompany most of the pathophysiological diseases in the central nervous system. It is proven that glial pathology precedes and even drives the development of multiple neurodegenerative conditions. A growing number of studies point out the importance of microglia in brain development as well as in physiological functioning. These resident brain immune cells are divergent from the peripherally infiltrated macrophages, but their precise in situ discrimination is surprisingly difficult. Microglial heterogeneity in the brain is especially visible in their morphology and cell density in particular brain structures but also in the expression of cellular markers. This often determines their role in physiology or pathology of brain functioning. The species differences between rodent and human markers add complexity to the whole picture. Furthermore, due to activation, microglia show a broad spectrum of phenotypes ranging from the pro-inflammatory, potentially cytotoxic M1 to the anti-inflammatory, scavenging, and regenerative M2. A precise distinction of specific phenotypes is nowadays essential to study microglial functions and tissue state in such a quickly changing environment. Due to the overwhelming amount of data on multiple sets of markers that is available for such studies, the choice of appropriate markers is a scientific challenge. This review gathers, classifies, and describes known and recently discovered protein markers expressed by microglial cells in their different phenotypes. The presented microglia markers include qualitative and semi-quantitative, general and specific, surface and intracellular proteins, as well as secreted molecules. The information provided here creates a comprehensive and practical guide through the current knowledge and will facilitate the choosing of proper, more specific markers for detailed studies on microglia and neuroinflammatory mechanisms in various physiological as well as pathological conditions. Both basic research and clinical medicine need clearly described and validated molecular markers of microglia phenotype, which are essential in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of diseases engaging glia activation.</p>

<p>The adult central nervous system (CNS) contains resident stem cells within specific niches that maintain a self-renewal and proliferative capacity to generate new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes throughout adulthood. Physiological aging is associated with a progressive loss of function and a decline in the self-renewal and regenerative capacities of CNS stem cells. Also, the biggest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is age, and current in vivo and in vitro models of neurodegenerative diseases rarely consider this. Therefore, combining both aging research and appropriate interrogation of animal disease models towards the understanding of the disease and age-related stem cell failure is imperative to the discovery of new therapies. This review article will highlight the main intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of neural stem cell (NSC) aging and discuss how these factors impact normal homeostatic functions within the adult brain. We will consider established in vivo animal and in vitro human disease model systems, and then discuss the current and future trajectories of novel senotherapeutics that target aging NSCs to ameliorate brain disease.</p>

<p>Objective: To assess the value of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during acute phase in predicting post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) at 3–6 months.</p><p>Methods: We prospectively recruited 229 patients who had suffered their first-ever ischemic stroke. PSCI was determined in 104 of these patients by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery performed at 3–6 months. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was then performed to compare the discriminatory ability of the MMSE and MoCA. Also, we applied a decision tree generated by the classification and regression tree methodology.</p><p>Results: In total, 66 patients had PSCI when evaluated 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke. Logistic regression analysis revealed that education, body mass index (BMI), and baseline MoCA scores were independently associated with PSCI. ROC curve analysis showed that the ability to predict PSCI was similar when compared between baseline MoCA scores [area under curve (AUC), 0.821; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.743–0.898] and baseline MMSE scores (AUC, 0.809; 95% CI, 0.725–0.892, P = 0.75). Both MMSE and MoCA exhibited similar predictive values at their optimal cut-off points (MMSE ≤27; sensitivity, 0.682; specificity, 0.816; MoCA ≤21; sensitivity, 0.636; specificity, 0.895). Classification and regression tree-derived analysis yielded an AUC of 0.823 (sensitivity, 0.803; specificity, 0.842).</p><p>Conclusion: When applied within 2 weeks of stroke, the MMSE and MoCA are both useful and have similar predictive value for PSCI 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57595">Rapid stimulus-driven modulation of slow ocular position drifts</a></h4>

The eyes are never still during maintained gaze fixation. When microsaccades are not occurring, ocular position exhibits continuous slow changes, often referred to as drifts. Unlike microsaccades, drifts remain to be viewed as largely random eye movements. Here we found that ocular position drifts can, instead, be very systematically stimulus-driven, and with very short latencies. We used highly precise eye tracking in three well trained macaque monkeys and found that even fleeting (~8 ms duration) stimulus presentations can robustly trigger transient and stimulus-specific modulations of ocular position drifts, and with only approximately 60 ms latency. Such drift responses are binocular, and they are most effectively elicited with large stimuli of low spatial frequency. Intriguingly, the drift responses exhibit some image pattern selectivity, and they are not explained by convergence responses, pupil constrictions, head movements, or starting eye positions. Ocular position drifts have very rapid access to exogenous visual information.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57381">The novel ciliogenesis regulator DYRK2 governs Hedgehog signaling during mouse embryogenesis</a></h4>

Mammalian Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays key roles in embryogenesis and uniquely requires primary cilia. Functional analyses of several ciliogenesis-related genes led to the discovery of the developmental diseases known as ciliopathies. Hence, identification of mammalian factors that regulate ciliogenesis can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of embryogenesis and ciliopathy. Here, we demonstrate that DYRK2 acts as a novel mammalian ciliogenesis-related protein kinase. Loss of <i>Dyrk2</i> in mice causes suppression of Hh signaling and results in skeletal abnormalities during in vivo embryogenesis. Deletion of <i>Dyrk2</i> induces abnormal ciliary morphology and trafficking of Hh pathway components. Mechanistically, transcriptome analyses demonstrate down-regulation of <i>Aurka</i> and other disassembly genes following <i>Dyrk2</i> deletion. Taken together, the present study demonstrates for the first time that DYRK2 controls ciliogenesis and is necessary for Hh signaling during mammalian development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57264">How to measure and evaluate binding affinities</a></h4>

Quantitative measurements of biomolecule associations are central to biological understanding and are needed to build and test predictive and mechanistic models. Given the advances in high-throughput technologies and the projected increase in the availability of binding data, we found it especially timely to evaluate the current standards for performing and reporting binding measurements. A review of 100 studies revealed that in most cases essential controls for establishing the appropriate incubation time and concentration regime were not documented, making it impossible to determine measurement reliability. Moreover, several reported affinities could be concluded to be incorrect, thereby impacting biological interpretations. Given these challenges, we provide a framework for a broad range of researchers to evaluate, teach about, perform, and clearly document high-quality equilibrium binding measurements. We apply this framework and explain underlying fundamental concepts through experimental examples with the RNA-binding protein Puf4.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57258">A machine-vision approach for automated pain measurement at millisecond timescales</a></h4>

Objective and automatic measurement of pain in mice remains a barrier for discovery in neuroscience. Here we capture paw kinematics during pain behavior in mice with high-speed videography and automated paw tracking with machine and deep learning approaches. Our statistical software platform, PAWS (Pain Assessment at Withdrawal Speeds), uses a univariate projection of paw position over time to automatically quantify seven behavioral features that are combined into a single, univariate pain score. Automated paw tracking combined with PAWS reveals a behaviorally-divergent mouse strain that displays hyper-sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. To demonstrate the efficacy of PAWS for detecting spinally- versus centrally-mediated behavioral responses, we chemogenetically activated nociceptive neurons in the amygdala, which further separated the pain-related behavioral features and the resulting pain score. Taken together, this automated pain quantification approach will increase objectivity in collecting rigorous behavioral data, and it is compatible with other neural circuit dissection tools for determining the mouse pain state.

The quantitative modeling of semantic representations in the brain plays a key role in understanding the neural basis of semantic processing. Previous studies have demonstrated that word vectors, which were originally developed for use in the field of natural language processing, provide a powerful tool for such quantitative modeling. However, whether semantic representations revealed by the word vector-based models actually capture our perception of semantic information remains unclear, as there has been no study explicitly examining the behavioral correlates of the modeled semantic representations. To address this issue, we compared the semantic structure of nouns and adjectives estimated from word vector-based brain models with that evaluated from human behavior. The brain models were constructed using voxelwise modeling to predict the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to natural movies from semantic contents in each movie scene through a word vector space. The semantic dissimilarity of word representations was then evaluated using the brain models. Meanwhile, data on human behavior reflecting the perception of semantic dissimilarity between words were collected in psychological experiments. We found a significant correlation between brain model- and behavior-derived semantic dissimilarities of words. This finding suggests that semantic representations in the brain modeled via word vectors appropriately capture our perception of word meanings.

Neurofeedback can be used to alter brain activity and is therefore an attractive tool for neuromodulation in clinical contexts. Different contexts might call for different patterns of activity modulation. For example, following stroke, alternative therapeutic strategies could involve up or down-regulation of activity in the ipsilateral motor cortex. However, effects of such strategies on activity and brain structure are unknown. In a proof of concept study in healthy individuals, we showed that fMRI neurofeedback can be used to drive activity up or down in ipsilateral motor cortex during hand movement. Given evidence for activity-dependent white matter plasticity, we also tested effects of activity modulation on white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We show rapid opposing changes in corpus callosum microstructure that depend on the direction of activity modulation. Bidirectional modulation of ipsilateral motor cortex activity is therefore possible, and results not only in online changes in activity patterns, but also in changes in microstructure detectable 24 hours later.

Glutamate receptor ion channels such as the -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor mediate the majority of fast excitatory neurotransmission in the vertebrate CNS. AMPA receptors canonically provide the fast, millisecond component of the synaptic current. However, we found that about two-thirds of principal cells in the mouse hippocampus express AMPA receptors that do not desensitize and stay active for up to half a second. These receptors are expressed at synapses with a sparse but flat spatial distribution. The resulting increase in charge transfer allows single connections to reliably trigger action potentials. Biophysical and pharmacological observations imply that slow AMPA receptors incorporate {gamma}-8 and other auxiliary proteins, and their activation lengthens individual miniature synaptic currents. Synaptic connections harboring slow AMPARs should have unique roles in hippocampal function.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to investigate whether neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 62 consecutive patients who presented with magnetic resonance imaging changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40–50ml of CSF. Additionally, S100 protein, neuron‐specific enolase, β‐amyloid protein, tau protein and phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without a CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, positive CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease predicted these improvements.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer's disease and NPH changes, supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH, with the latter appearing to be rare. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson´s Disease (PD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 PD patients with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society‐Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25mg once daily‐1mg twice daily, Phase 1). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for four weeks (Phase 2). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week four. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose=0.75mg) or placebo. At week four, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95%CI 1.53‐3.74, p=0.002, effect size=1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95%CI ‐0.16‐2.16, p=0.280, effect size=0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference:1.63, 95%CI 0.09‐3.18, p=0.030, effect size=0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% placebo‐group, 32% nabilone‐group). There were no serious AEs.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for PD patients with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R">Anticoagulation Timing in Cardioembolic Stroke and Recurrent Event Risk</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Guidelines recommend initiating anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation, such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high‐risk features on echocardiography.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0–3 days, 4–14 days, or &gt;14 days), and outcomes were recurrent stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 2,084 patients, 1,289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the 3 groups (0–3 days: 10.3%, 64/617; 4–14 days: 9.7%, 52/535; &gt;14 days: 10.2%, 14/137; <i>p </i> = 0.933). In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4 and 14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs 0–3 days; odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–4.43), nor did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs &gt;14 days; OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.36–1.62, <i>p </i> = 0.482).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this multicenter real‐world cohort, the recommended (4–14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Corticosteroids exert a dual role in eukaryotic cells through their action via (1) intracellular receptors (slow genomic responses), or (2) membrane-bound receptors (fast non-genomic responses). Highly vulnerable regions of the brain, like the hippocampus, express high amounts of corticosteroid receptors, yet their actions on ionic currents and neurotransmitters release are still undefined. Here, we investigated the effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on GABA and glutamate (Glu) release from isolated nerve terminals of the rat hippocampus. MP favored both spontaneous and depolarization-evoked [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals, without affecting [<sup>3</sup>H]GABA outflow. Facilitation of [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu release by MP is mediated by a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent non-genomic mechanism relying on the activation of membrane-bound glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors sensitive to their antagonists mifepristone and spironolactone, respectively. The involvement of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent high-affinity EAAT transport reversal was inferred by blockage of MP-induced [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu release by DL-TBOA. Depolarization-evoked [<sup>3</sup>H]GABA release in the presence of MP was partially attenuated by the selective P2X7 receptor antagonist A-438079, but this compound did not affect the release of [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu. Data indicate that MP differentially affects GABA and glutamate release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals via fast non-genomic mechanisms putatively involving the activation of membrane-bound corticosteroid receptors. Facilitation of Glu release strengthen previous assumptions that MP may act as a cognitive enhancer in rats, while crosstalk with ATP-sensitive P2X7 receptors may promote a therapeutically desirable GABAergic inhibitory control during paroxysmal epileptic crisis that might be particularly relevant when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels decrease below the threshold required for transmitter release.</p>

<p>Mutations in the LAMA2 gene affect the production of the α2 subunit of laminin-211 (= merosin) and result in either partial or complete laminin-211 deficiency. Complete merosin deficiency is typically associated with a more severe congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), clinically manifested by hypotonia and weakness at birth, the development of contractures of large joints, and progressive respiratory involvement. Muscle atrophy and severe weakness typically prevent independent ambulation. Partial merosin deficiency is mostly manifested by later onset limb-girdle weakness and joint contractures so that independent ambulation is typically achieved. Collectively, complete and partial merosin deficiency is referred to as LAMA2-related dystrophies (LAMA2-RDs) and represents one of the most common forms of congenital muscular dystrophies worldwide. LAMA2-RDs are classically characterized by both central and peripheral nervous system involvement with abnormal appearing white matter (WM) on brain MRI and dystrophic appearing muscle on muscle biopsy as well as creatine kinase (CK) levels commonly elevated to &gt;1,000 IU/L. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved diagnostic abilities for LAMA2-RD, and the majority of patients with merosin deficiency carry recessive pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene. The existence of multiple animal models for LAMA2-RDs has helped to advance our understanding of laminin-211 and has been instrumental in preclinical research progress and translation to clinical trials. The first clinical trial for the LAMA2-RDs was a phase 1 pharmacokinetic and safety study of the anti-apoptotic compound omigapil, based on preclinical studies performed in the dy<sup>W</sup>/dy<sup>W</sup> and dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mouse models. This phase 1 study enabled the collection of pulmonary and motor outcome measures and also provided the opportunity for investigating exploratory outcome measures including muscle ultrasound, muscle MRI and serum, and urine biomarker collection. Natural history studies, including a five-year prospective natural history and comparative outcome measures study in patients with LAMA2-RD, have helped to better delineate the natural history and identify viable outcome measures. Plans for further clinical trials for LAMA2-RDs are presently in progress, highlighting the necessity of identifying adequate, disease-relevant biomarkers, capable of reflecting potential therapeutic changes, in addition to refining the clinical outcome measures and time-to-event trajectory analysis of affected patients.</p>

<p>Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in the development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during the early postnatal period can influence brain development and vice-versa. It is increasingly recognized that communication between the GI tract and brain is mainly driven by neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic mediators, collectively called the gut-brain axis (GBA). Changes in the GBA mediators occur in response to the developmental changes in the body during this period. This review provides an overview of major developmental events in the GI tract and brain in the early postnatal period and their parallel developmental trajectories under physiological conditions. Current knowledge of GBA mediators in context to brain function and behavioral outcomes and their synthesis and metabolism (site, timing, etc.) is discussed. This review also presents hypotheses on the role of the GBA mediators in response to the parallel development of the GI tract and brain in infants.</p>

<p>Reward and punishment have demonstrated dissociable effects on motor learning and memory, which suggests that these reinforcers are differently processed by the brain. To test this possibility, we use electroencephalography to record cortical neural activity after the presentation of reward and punishment feedback during a visuomotor rotation task. Participants were randomly placed into Reward, Punishment, or Control groups and performed the task under different conditions to assess the adaptation (learning) and retention (memory) of the motor task. These conditions featured an incongruent position between the cursor and the target, with the cursor trajectory, rotated 30° counterclockwise, requiring the participant to adapt their movement to hit the target. Feedback based on error magnitude was provided during the Adaptation condition in the form of a positive number (Reward) or negative number (Punishment), each representing a monetary gain or loss, respectively. No reinforcement or visual feedback was provided during the No Vision condition (retention). Performance error and event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to feedback presentation were calculated for each participant during both conditions. Punishment feedback reduced performance error and promoted faster learning during the Adaptation condition. In contrast, punishment feedback increased performance error during the No Vision condition compared to Control and Reward groups, which suggests a diminished motor memory. Moreover, the Punishment group showed a significant decrease in the amplitude of ERPs during the No Vision condition compared to the Adaptation condition. The amplitude of ERPs did not change in the other two groups. These results suggest that punishment feedback impairs motor retention by altering the neural processing involved in memory encoding. This study provides a neurophysiological underpinning for the dissociative effects of punishment feedback on motor learning.</p>

<p>Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19), caused by recently identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by inconsistent clinical presentations. While many infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild respiratory symptoms, others develop severe pneumonia or even respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to infect the lungs, the intestines, blood vessels, the bile ducts, the conjunctiva, macrophages, T lymphocytes, the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. More than a third of cases displayed neurological involvement, and many severely ill patients developed multiple organ infection and injury. However, less than 1% of patients had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, raising a question of how the virus spreads throughout the body. We propose that nerve terminals in the orofacial mucosa, eyes, and olfactory neuroepithelium act as entry points for the brain invasion, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brainstem. By exploiting the subcellular membrane compartments of infected cells, a feature common to all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable to disseminate from the brain to periphery via vesicular axonal transport and passive diffusion through axonal endoplasmic reticula, causing multiple organ injury independently of an underlying respiratory infection. The proposed model clarifies a wide range of clinically observed phenomena in CoVID-19 patients, such as neurological symptoms unassociated with lung pathology, protracted presence of the virus in samples obtained from recovered patients, exaggerated immune response, and multiple organ failure in severe cases with variable course and dynamics of the disease. We believe that this model can provide novel insights into CoVID-19 and its long-term sequelae, and establish a framework for further research.</p>

<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury produces long-term neurological damage, and presents a significant public health problem with nearly 18,000 new cases per year in the U.S. The injury results in both acute and chronic changes in the spinal cord, ultimately resulting in the production of a glial scar, consisting of multiple cells including fibroblasts, macrophages, microglia, and reactive astrocytes. Within the scar, there is an accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules—primarily tenascins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs)—which are considered to be inhibitory to axonal regeneration. In this review article, we discuss the role of CSPGs in the injury response, especially how sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains act to inhibit plasticity and regeneration. This includes how sulfation of GAG chains influences their biological activity and interactions with potential receptors. Comprehending the role of CSPGs in the inhibitory properties of the glial scar provides critical knowledge in the much-needed production of new therapies.</p>

<p>Fear of falling influences postural strategies used for balance, and is key in the maintenance of independent living and quality of life as adults age. However, there is a distinct need for methodology that aims to specifically address and prime fear under dynamic conditions, and to better determine the role of fear in movement preparation. This preliminary study investigated how fear priming influences fear of falling in young and older individuals, and assessed how changes in fear of falling map to movement behavior. Young (21.5 ± 1.7 years, n = 10) and older (58.1 ± 2.2 years) participants matched for height, weight, and sex were repeatedly exposed to four different and incrementally challenging laboratory-based slipping perturbations during a self-initiated, goal-directed step and reach task. Both younger and older cohorts showed similar heightened perceptions in fear of falling after fear priming, and changes in peak joint excursions including reduced ankle flexion, and increased lumbar flexion after fear priming. Age-related changes were only evident in total mediolateral center of mass displacement, with younger participants showing greater displacement after fear priming. Despite clear differences in preparatory muscle onsets relative to reach onset seen in older participants, muscle timings or co-contraction indices were not significantly different. Methods utilizing repeated exposure to varying increases of a slip-based postural challenge can successfully prime fear of falling in individuals, regardless of age.</p>

The human superior temporal plane, the site of the auditory cortex, displays high inter-individual macro-anatomical variation. This questions the validity of curvature-based alignment (CBA) methods for in vivo imaging data. Here, we have addressed this issue by developing CBA+, which is a cortical surface registration method that uses prior macro-anatomical knowledge. We validate this method by using cytoarchitectonic areas on 10 individual brains (which we make publicly available). Compared to volumetric and standard surface registration, CBA+ results in a more accurate cytoarchitectonic auditory atlas. The improved correspondence of micro-anatomy following the improved alignment of macro-anatomy validates the superiority of CBA+ compared to CBA. In addition, we use CBA+ to align in vivo and postmortem data. This allows projection of functional and anatomical information collected in vivo onto the cytoarchitectonic areas, which has the potential to contribute to the ongoing debate on the parcellation of the human auditory cortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55649">Temperature stress induces mites to help their carrion beetle hosts by eliminating rival blowflies</a></h4>

Ecological conditions are known to change the expression of mutualisms though the causal agents driving such changes remain poorly understood. Here we show that temperature stress modulates the harm threatened by a common enemy, and thereby induces a phoretic mite to become a protective mutualist. Our experiments focus on the interactions between the burying beetle <i>Nicrophorus vespilloides</i>, an associated mite species <i>Poecilochirus carabi</i> and their common enemy, blowflies<i>, </i>when all three species reproduce on the same small vertebrate carrion. We show that mites compete with beetle larvae for food in the absence of blowflies, and reduce beetle reproductive success. However, when blowflies breed on the carrion too, mites enhance beetle reproductive success by eating blowfly eggs. High densities of mites are especially effective at promoting beetle reproductive success at higher and lower natural ranges in temperature, when blowfly larvae are more potent rivals for the limited resources on the carcass.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous population of mesenchymal cells supporting tumor progression, whose origin remains to be fully elucidated. Osterix (Osx) is a marker of osteogenic differentiation, expressed in skeletal progenitor stem cells and bone-forming osteoblasts. We report <i>Osx</i> expression in CAFs and by using Osx-cre;TdTomato reporter mice we confirm the presence and pro-tumorigenic function of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells in extra-skeletal tumors. Surprisingly, only a minority of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells expresses fibroblast and osteogenic markers. The majority of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells express the hematopoietic marker CD45, have a genetic and phenotypic profile resembling that of tumor infiltrating myeloid and lymphoid populations, but with higher expression of lymphocytic immune suppressive genes. We find <i>Osx </i>transcript and Osx protein expression early during hematopoiesis, in subsets of hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor populations. Our results indicate that <i>Osx</i> marks distinct tumor promoting CD45- and CD45+ populations and challenge the dogma that Osx is expressed exclusively in cells of mesenchymal origin.

Telomeres define the natural ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and are crucial for chromosomal stability. The budding yeast Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 proteins form a heterotrimeric complex, and the inactivation of any of its subunits leads to a uniformly lethal phenotype due to telomere deprotection. Although Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 seem to belong to an epistasis group, it remains unclear whether they function differently in telomere protection. Here, we employed the single-linear-chromosome yeast SY14, and surprisingly found that the deletion of <i>CDC13</i> leads to telomere erosion and intrachromosome end-to-end fusion, which depends on Rad52 but not Yku. Interestingly, the emergence frequency of survivors in the SY14 <i>cdc13</i>Δ mutant was ~29 fold higher than that in either the <i>stn1</i>Δ or <i>ten1</i>Δ mutant, demonstrating a predominant role of Cdc13 in inhibiting telomere fusion. Chromosomal fusion readily occurred in the telomerase-null SY14 strain, further verifying the default role of intact telomeres in inhibiting chromosome fusion.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47318">A minimal self-organisation model of the Golgi apparatus</a></h4>

The design principles dictating the spatio-temporal organisation of eukaryotic cells, and in particular the mechanisms controlling the self-organisation and dynamics of membrane-bound organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, remain elusive. Although this organelle was discovered 120 years ago, such basic questions as whether vesicular transport through the Golgi occurs in an anterograde (from entry to exit) or retrograde fashion are still strongly debated. Here, we address these issues by studying a quantitative model of organelle dynamics that includes: de-novo compartment generation, inter-compartment vesicular exchange, and biochemical conversion of membrane components. We show that anterograde or retrograde vesicular transports are asymptotic behaviors of a much richer dynamical system. Indeed, the structure and composition of cellular compartments and the directionality of vesicular exchange are intimately linked. They are emergent properties that can be tuned by varying the relative rates of vesicle budding, fusion and biochemical conversion.

Nearly all brain functions involve routing neural activity among a distributed network of areas. Understanding this routing requires more than a description of interareal anatomical connectivity: it requires understanding what controls the flow of signals through interareal circuitry and how this communication might be modulated to allow flexible behavior. Here we review proposals of how communication, particularly between visual cortical areas, is instantiated and modulated, highlighting recent work that offers new perspectives.

Memory formation is a dynamic process and sleep is part of it. Consolidation of memories relies on finely orchestrated brain activities occurring during the post-learning sleep period. In this issue of Neuron, Kumar and colleagues provide evidence that the activity of adult-born hippocampal neurons during REM sleep is critical for the consolidation of episodic memory.

To establish a genuine scientific discourse, we must accept a long due departure from the habit of neatly arranging things in a hierarchy where “macroscopic” psychological mystery awaits explanation in terms of “microscopic” neural objects. Instead, a relational scientific methodology is wanted, accompanied by a dialogic mode of conversation between the disciplines.

Vancraeyenest et al. reversibly inactivated the pathway from the VTA to the NAc using a double-infection viral vector approach in macaques.

Surprisingly, reinforcement-based learning remained unaffected, contrary to motivational behavior requiring high effort.

<p>by Lina K. Klein, Guido Maiello, Vivian C. Paulun, Roland W. Fleming</p>

We rarely experience difficulty picking up objects, yet of all potential contact points on the surface, only a small proportion yield effective grasps. Here, we present extensive behavioral data alongside a normative model that correctly predicts human precision grasping of unfamiliar 3D objects. We tracked participants’ forefinger and thumb as they picked up objects of 10 wood and brass cubes configured to tease apart effects of shape, weight, orientation, and mass distribution. Grasps were highly systematic and consistent across repetitions and participants. We employed these data to construct a model which combines five cost functions related to force closure, torque, natural grasp axis, grasp aperture, and visibility. Even without free parameters, the model predicts individual grasps almost as well as different individuals predict one another’s, but fitting weights reveals the relative importance of the different constraints. The model also accurately predicts human grasps on novel 3D-printed objects with more naturalistic geometries and is robust to perturbations in its key parameters. Together, the findings provide a unified account of how we successfully grasp objects of different 3D shape, orientation, mass, and mass distribution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YoLZSjliezU" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the gray short‐tailed opossum (<i>Monodelphis domestica </i>). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal Day 7, P7SCI) and nonregenerating (SCI at Day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d, and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC ≥ 1, <i>Padj </i> ≤ 0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. One hundred and forty‐seven genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI data set). The majority of changes were gene upregulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as “cell proliferation,” “cell adhesion,” and “apoptosis.” Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly downregulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI + 7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a posttranslational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labeling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labeling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, rostral ventral medulla, A1, and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn [DH]). Ultrastructural examination showed labeling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes.

<p>Exogenous melatonin significantly alters hippocampal neuronal micromorphometry, increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) expression, and improves memory retention in mice. These findings expand our knowledge about the beneficial effects of melatonin on hippocampal neurons, and implicates alterations of structural neuroplasticity and crp‐1 upregulation as possible key players in this process of cognitive function improvement. </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuronal plasticity describes changes in structure, function, and connections of neurons. The hippocampus, in particular, has been shown to exhibit considerable plasticity regarding both physiological and morphological functions. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, promotes cell survival and dendrite maturation of neurons in the newborn brain and protects against neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous melatonin on neuronal architecture and its possible mechanism in the hippocampus of adult male C57BL/6 mice. Melatonin treatment significantly increased the total length and complexity of dendrites in the apical and basal <i>cornu ammonis </i> (CA) 1 and in the dentate gyrus in mouse hippocampi. Spine density in CA1 apical dendrites was increased, but no significant differences in other subregions were observed. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, the length and arborization of neurites were significantly augmented by melatonin treatment. Additionally, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in both <i>in vivo </i> and <i>in vitro </i> systems revealed significant increases in the level of cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) protein, which is known to be involved in dendritic branching in mouse hippocampal neurons after melatonin treatment. Our results suggest that exogenous melatonin leads to significant alterations of neuronal micromorphometry in the adult hippocampus, possibly via crp‐1 signaling.</p>

<p>Extracellular ascorbic acid induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, stimulating sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) anterograde trafficking in wild‐type cells. No ascorbic acid‐induced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase was observed in Huntington's disease (HD) cells. Thus, SVCT2 would fail to reach the cellular surface, affecting ascorbic acid uptake in HD cells.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine expansion at the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and it is localized in several organelles, including endosomes. HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant highly concentrated in the brain where it acts as a messenger, modulating neuronal metabolism. It is transported into neurons via the sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). During synaptic activity, ascorbic acid is released from glial reservoirs to the extracellular space, inducing an increase in SVCT2 localization at the plasma membrane. Here, we studied SVCT2 trafficking and localization in HD. SVCT2 is decreased at synaptic terminals in YAC128 male mice. Using cellular models for HD (STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 cells), we determined that SVCT2 trafficking through secretory and endosomal pathways is altered in resting conditions. We observed Golgi fragmentation and SVCT2/Htt‐associated protein‐1 mis‐colocalization. Additionally, we observed altered ascorbic acid‐induced calcium signaling that explains the reduced SVCT2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular ascorbic acid (active conditions) described in our previous results. Therefore, SVCT2 trafficking to the plasma membrane is altered in resting and active conditions in HD, explaining the redox imbalance observed during early stages of the disease.</p>

<p>Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in Layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of Layers III and II. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in Layer III with sparser termination in Layers I, II, and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in Layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: (a) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in nonprimate species; (b) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00052">Effects of Cortical Cooling on Activity Across Layers of the Rat Barrel Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Moderate cortical cooling is known to suppress slow oscillations and to evoke persistent cortical activity. However, the cooling-induced changes in electrical activity across cortical layers remain largely unknown. Here, we performed multi-channel local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recordings with linear silicone probes through the layers of single cortical barrel columns in urethane-anesthetized rats under normothermia (38°C) and during local cortical surface cooling (30°C). During cortically generated slow oscillations, moderate cortical cooling decreased delta wave amplitude, delta-wave occurrence, the duration of silent states, and delta wave-locked MUA synchronization. Moderate cortical cooling increased total time spent in the active state and decreased total time spent in the silent state. Cooling-evoked changes in the MUA firing rate in cortical layer 5 (L5) varied from increase to decrease across animals, and the polarity of changes in L5 MUA correlated with changes in total time spent in the active state. The decrease in temperature reduced MUA firing rates in all other cortical layers. Sensory-evoked MUA responses also decreased during cooling through all cortical layers. The cooling-dependent slowdown was detected at the fast time-scale with a decreased frequency of sensory-evoked high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Thus, moderate cortical cooling suppresses slow oscillations and desynchronizes neuronal activity through all cortical layers, and is associated with reduced firing across all cortical layers except L5, where cooling induces variable and non-consistent changes in neuronal firing, which are common features of the transition from slow-wave synchronization to desynchronized activity in the barrel cortex.</p>

<p>Aim: To examine the effects of fentanyl, a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, on-air puff-evoked responses in Purkinje cells (PCs), and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) using in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice.</p><p>Methods: Male mice 6–8 weeks-old were anesthetized and fixed on a custom-made stereotaxic frame. The cerebellar surface was exposed and perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Patch-clamp recordings in the cell-attached mode were obtained from PCs and MLIs. Facial stimulation by air-puff of the ipsilateral whisker pad was performed through a pressurized injection system. Fentanyl citrate, CTOP, and H-89 dissolved in ACSF were perfused onto the cerebellar surface.</p><p>Results: Fentanyl significantly inhibited the amplitude and area under the curve (AUC) of sensory stimulation-evoked inhibitory responses in PCs. Although fentanyl did not influence the frequency of simple spikes (SSs), it decreased the pause of SS. The IC<sub>50</sub> of the fentanyl-induced suppression of the P1 response amplitude was 5.53 μM. The selective MOR antagonist CTOP abolished fentanyl-induced inhibitory responses in PCs. However, the application of CTOP alone increased the amplitude, AUC of P1, and the pause of SS. Notably, fentanyl significantly inhibited the tactile-evoked response of MLIs but did not affect their spontaneous firing. The fentanyl-induced decrease of inhibitory responses in PCs was partially prevented by a PKA inhibitor, H-89.</p><p>Conclusions: These results suggest that fentanyl binds to MORs in MLIs to reduce GABAergic neurotransmission in MLI-PC projections and one potential mechanism is via modulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia, characterized by neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid plaque in brain pathology. Major efforts in AD drug were devoted to the interference with the production and accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), by consecutive cleavage by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Therefore, β-secretase and γ-secretase inhibition have been the focus for AD drug discovery efforts for amyloid reduction. Here, we review β-secretase inhibitors and γ-secretase inhibitors/modulators, and their efficacies in clinical trials. In addition, we discussed the novel concept of specifically targeting the γ-secretase substrate APP. Targeting amyloidogenic processing of APP is still a fundamentally sound strategy to develop disease-modifying AD therapies and recent advance in γ-secretase/APP complex structure provides new opportunities in designing selective inhibitors/modulators for AD.</p>

<p>The dynamic trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which enables the endocytosis, recycling, and exocytosis of AMPARs, is crucial for synaptic plasticity. Endophilin2, which directly interacts with the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, plays an important role in AMPAR endocytosis. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) promotes the maturation of the dendritic spine and can transfer AMPARs to the membrane. Although the mechanisms of AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis are well known, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying AMPAR recycling remain unclear. Here, we report a unique interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2. Our results showed that overexpression of CRMP2 and endophilin2 increased the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and modestly enhanced AMPAR levels in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the CRMP2 and endophilin2 overexpression phenotype failed to occur when the interaction between these two proteins was inhibited. Further analysis revealed that this interaction was regulated by CRMP2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited its interaction with endophilin2; this was mainly affected by the phosphorylation of Thr514 and Ser518 by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β. CRMP2 phosphorylation increased degradation and inhibited the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, the dephosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited degradation and promoted the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2 was conductive to the recycling of AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits in hippocampal neurons.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00035">Assessing the Effects of Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation Over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Human Cognition: A Systematic Review</a></h4>

<p>Theta burst stimulation is increasingly growing in popularity as a non-invasive method of moderating corticospinal networks. Theta burst stimulation uses gamma frequency trains applied at the rhythm of theta, thus, mimicking theta–gamma coupling involved in cognitive processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been found to play a crucial role in numerous cognitive processes. Here, we include 25 studies for review to determine the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 20 of these studies are healthy participant and five are patient (pharmacotherapy-resistant depression) studies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, only a descriptive approach is used and meta-analytics ruled out. The cognitive effect is measured on various cognitive domains: attention, working memory, planning, language, decision making, executive function, and inhibitory and cognitive control. We conclude that continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mainly inhibits cognitive performance. However, in some instances, it can lead to improved performance by inhibiting the effect of distractors or other competing irrelevant cognitive processes. To be precise, continuous theta burst stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired attention, inhibitory control, planning, and goal-directed behavior in decision making but also improved decision making by reducing impulsivity. Conversely, continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired executive function, working, auditory feedback regulation, and cognitive control but accelerated the planning, decision-making process. These findings constitute a useful contribution to the literature on the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>

Background<p>Apathy is one of the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, its pathophysiology remains unclear.</p>Methods<p>We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired at a 3.0T MRI scanner using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) metric in 20 de novo, drug-naïve, non-demented PD patients with apathy (PD-A), 26 PD patients without apathy (PD-NA) without comorbidity of depressive or anxious symptoms, and 23 matched healthy control (HC) subjects.</p>Results<p>We found that the ALFF decreased significantly in the bilateral nucleus accumbens, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with PD-A compared to patients with PD-NA and HC subjects. Furthermore, apathy severity was negatively correlated with the ALFF in the bilateral nucleus accumbens and dorsal ACC in the pooled patients with PD.</p>Conclusion<p>The present study characterized the functional pattern of changes in spontaneous neural activity in patients with PD-A. With the aim to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for these changes, this study controlled for the potentially confounding effects of dopaminergic medication, depression, anxiety, and global cognitive impairment. The findings of the current study add to the literature by highlighting potential abnormalities in mesocorticolimbic pathways involved in the development of apathy in PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00782">TRP Channels Role in Pain Associated With Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) are cation channels expressed in both non-excitable and excitable cells from diverse tissues, including heart, lung, and brain. The TRP channel family includes 28 isoforms activated by physical and chemical stimuli, such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, and noxious stimuli. Recently, it has been shown that TRP channels are also directly or indirectly activated by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and TRP channels are involved in the progression of those diseases by mechanisms involving changes in the crosstalk between Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, oxidative stress, and production of inflammatory mediators. TRP channels involved in nociception include members of the TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPC subfamilies that transduce physical and chemical noxious stimuli. It has also been reported that pain is a complex issue in patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and adequate management of pain in those conditions is still in discussion. TRPV1 has a role in neuroinflammation, a critical mechanism involved in neurodegeneration. Therefore, some studies have considered TRPV1 as a target for both pain treatment and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, this review aimed to describe the TRP-dependent mechanism that can mediate pain sensation in neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic approach available to palliate pain and neurodegenerative symptoms throughout the regulation of these channels.</p>

<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a progressive autosomal dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia characterized by the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded protein within neuronal nuclei in the brain, which can lead to brain damage that precedes the onset of clinical manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as morphometric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have gained increasing attention as non-invasive and quantitative methods for the assessment of structural and functional alterations in clinical SCA3/MJD patients as well as preclinical carriers. Morphometric MRI has demonstrated typical patterns of atrophy or volume loss in the cerebellum and brainstem with extensive lesions in some supratentorial areas. DTI has detected widespread microstructural alterations in brain white matter, which indicate disrupted brain anatomical connectivity. Task-related fMRI has presented unusual brain activation patterns within the cerebellum and some extracerebellar tissue, reflecting the decreased functional connectivity of these brain regions in SCA3/MJD subjects. MRS has revealed abnormal neurochemical profiles, such as the levels or ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine, in both clinical cases and preclinical cases before the alterations in brain anatomical structure. Moreover, a number of studies have reported correlations of MR imaging alterations with clinical and genetic features. The utility of these MR imaging techniques can help to identify preclinical SCA3/MJD carriers, monitor disease progression, evaluate response to therapeutic interventions, and illustrate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and prognosis of SCA3/MJD.</p>

<p>Introduction: In this study, we examined whether the self-selection of occupations of interest affects reaction times (RTs) and cognitive processing by using the Aid for Decision-making in Occupation Choice (ADOC) and event-related potentials (ERP). We also assessed the relationship of these with psychological indicators.</p><p>Method: We extracted 78 occupations from the ADOC in consideration of the subjects’ age, and three conditions were set: (1) self-selection of an interesting occupation; (2) self-selection of a disliked occupation; and (3) forced selection. The RT task was executed under their conditions during which ERP was measured. We compared the P300 component of ERP in these conditions. Moreover, we examined the association of cognitive processing and degree of satisfaction and performance concerning occupation, with psychological indicators.</p><p>Results: P300 amplitude at Fz significantly increased in the self-selection of an interesting occupation. P300 amplitude at Pz was significantly positively correlated with the occupational satisfaction score.</p><p>Conclusion: Self-selection of interesting occupations in the ADOC resulted in increased attention resource allocation by increasing motivation. Further, there was a positive correlation between satisfaction concerning the occupation and attention of resource allocation. Therefore, occupational therapists should know which occupations the patients consider interesting and help them to select by themselves, thus enhancing their satisfaction after consultation. These interventions may contribute to promoting motivation and cognitive processing.</p>

<p>Adolescence is an important ontogenetic period that is characterized by behaviors such as enhanced novelty-seeking, impulsivity, and reward preference, which can give rise to an increased risk for substance use. While substance use rates in adolescence are generally on a decline, the current rates combined with emerging trends, such as increases in e-cigarette use, remain a significant public health concern. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological divergences associated with adolescent substance use, derived from a cross-sectional, retrospective, and longitudinal studies, and highlight how the use of these substances during adolescence may relate to behavioral and neuroimaging-based outcomes. Identifying and understanding the associations between adolescent substance use and changes in cognition, mental health, and future substance use risk may assist our understanding of the consequences of drug exposure during this critical window.</p>

<p>The process of aging commonly features a gradual deterioration in cognitive performance and, in particular, the decline of memory. Despite the increased longevity of the world’s population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, continues to be a major burden on public health, and consequently, the latest research has been focused on memory and aging. Currently, the failure of episodic and Prospective memory (PM) is one of the main complaints in the elderly, considered among the early symptoms of dementia. It is therefore increasingly important to define more clearly the boundaries between normal and pathological aging. Recently, researchers have begun to build and apply Virtual Environments (VE) to the explicit purpose of better understanding the performance of episodic and PM in complex and realistic contexts, with the perspective of further developing effective training procedures that depend on reliable cognitive assessment methods. Virtual technology offers higher levels of realism than “pen and paper” testing and at the same time more experimental control than naturalistic settings. In this mini-review article, we examine the outcomes of recently available studies on virtual reality technology applications developed for the assessment and improvement of episodic and/or PM. To consider the latest technology, we selected 29 articles that have been published in the last 10 years. These documents show that VR-based technologies can provide a valid basis for screening and treatment and, through increased sensory stimulation and enriched environments reproducing the scenarios of everyday life, could represent effective stimulating experiences even in pathological aging.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00072">Admittance Method for Estimating Local Field Potentials Generated in a Multi-Scale Neuron Model of the Hippocampus</a></h4>

<p>Significant progress has been made toward model-based prediction of neral tissue activation in response to extracellular electrical stimulation, but challenges remain in the accurate and efficient estimation of distributed local field potentials (LFP). Analytical methods of estimating electric fields are a first-order approximation that may be suitable for model validation, but they are computationally expensive and cannot accurately capture boundary conditions in heterogeneous tissue. While there are many appropriate numerical methods of solving electric fields in neural tissue models, there isn't an established standard for mesh geometry nor a well-known rule for handling any mismatch in spatial resolution. Moreover, the challenge of misalignment between current sources and mesh nodes in a finite-element or resistor-network method volume conduction model needs to be further investigated. Therefore, using a previously published and validated multi-scale model of the hippocampus, the authors have formulated an algorithm for LFP estimation, and by extension, bidirectional communication between discretized and numerically solved volume conduction models and biologically detailed neural circuit models constructed in NEURON. Development of this algorithm required that we assess meshes of (i) unstructured tetrahedral and grid-based hexahedral geometries as well as (ii) differing approaches for managing the spatial misalignment of current sources and mesh nodes. The resulting algorithm is validated through the comparison of Admittance Method predicted evoked potentials with analytically estimated LFPs. Establishing this method is a critical step toward closed-loop integration of volume conductor and NEURON models that could lead to substantial improvement of the predictive power of multi-scale stimulation models of cortical tissue. These models may be used to deepen our understanding of hippocampal pathologies and the identification of efficacious electroceutical treatments.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma is a WHO grade IV brain tumor, which leads to poor overall survival (OS) of patients. For precise surgical and treatment planning, OS prediction of glioblastoma (GBM) patients is highly desired by clinicians and oncologists. Radiomic research attempts at predicting disease prognosis, thus providing beneficial information for personalized treatment from a variety of imaging features extracted from multiple MR images. In this study, first-order, intensity-based volume and shape-based and textural radiomic features are extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1ce MRI data. The region of interest is further decomposed with stationary wavelet transform with low-pass and high-pass filtering. Further, radiomic features are extracted on these decomposed images, which helped in acquiring the directional information. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach achieved 0.695, 0.571, and 0.558 on BraTS training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach secured the third position in BraTS 2018 challenge for the OS prediction task.</p>

<p>One of the risk factors for schizophrenia is maternal infection. We have previously shown that Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) induced maternal immune activation in mice caused histological changes in the hippocampal CA1 area of offspring during the developmental period and impaired sensorimotor gating in offspring during adulthood, resulting in behavioral changes. However, it remains unclear how maternal immune activation functionally impacts the hippocampal neuronal activity of offspring. We studied the effect of prenatal poly I:C treatment on synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in postnatal and adult offspring. Treatment with poly I:C diminished excitatory and enhanced inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic transmission on pyramidal cells in adult offspring. During the early developmental period, we still observed that treatment with poly I:C decreased excitatory synaptic transmission and potentially increased GABAergic synaptic transmission, which was uncovered under a condition of high extracellular potassium-activated neurons. In conclusion, we demonstrate that maternal immune activation decreased excitatory and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission on hippocampal pyramidal cells from an early developmental period to adulthood, which could result in net inhibition in conjunction with poor functional organization and integration of hippocampal circuits.</p>

<p>For a long time, post-mortem analysis of human brain pathologies has been purely descriptive, limiting insight into the pathological mechanisms. However, starting in the early 2000s, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the routine application of bulk RNA-sequencing and microarray technologies have revolutionized the usefulness of post-mortem human brain tissue. This has allowed many studies to provide novel mechanistic insights into certain brain pathologies, albeit at a still unsatisfying resolution, with masking of lowly expressed genes and regulatory elements in different cell types. The recent rapid evolution of single-cell technologies has now allowed researchers to shed light on human pathologies at a previously unreached resolution revealing further insights into pathological mechanisms that will open the way for the development of new strategies for therapies. In this review article, we will give an overview of the incremental information that single-cell technologies have given us for human white matter (WM) pathologies, summarize which single-cell technologies are available, and speculate where these novel approaches may lead us for pathological assessment in the future.</p>

<p>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family polypeptides play key roles in promoting tissue regeneration and repair. FGF5 is strongly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system following injury; however, a role for FGF5 in peripheral nerve regeneration has not been shown up to now. In this report, we examined the expression of FGF5 and its receptors FGFR1-4 in Schwann cells of the mouse sciatic nerve following injury, and then measured the effects of FGF5 treatment upon cultured primary rat Schwann cells. By microarray and mRNA sequencing data analysis, RT-PCR, qPCR, western blotting and immunostaining, we show that FGF5 is highly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the mouse distal sciatic nerve following injury, and FGFR1 and FGFR2 are highly expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve both before and following injury. Using cultured primary rat Schwann cells, we show that FGF5 inhibits ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity but promotes rapid Schwann cell migration and adhesion via the upregulation of N-cadherin. Thus, FGF5 is an autocrine regulator of Schwann cells to regulate Schwann cell migration and adhesion.</p>

<p>Aberrant brain insulin signaling plays a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the progression of AD, with excessive mitochondrial fission in the hippocampus being one of the pathological mechanisms of AD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of AD and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by aberrant brain insulin signaling in the hippocampal neurons are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanistic signaling associated with mitochondrial dynamics using streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic compound, in the hippocampus cell line, HT-22 cells. In this metabolic dysfunctional cellular model, hallmarks of AD such as neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and tau hyper-phosphorylation are induced by STZ. We found that in the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, phosphorylation is increased in STZ-treated HT-22 cells. We also determined that inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation suppresses STZ-induced AD-like pathology. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of Drp1 was induced by CDK5, and inhibition of CDK5 suppresses STZ-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and AD-like pathology. Therefore, these findings indicate that mitochondrial morphology and functional regulation may be a strategy of potential therapeutic for treating abnormal metabolic functions associated with the pathogenesis of AD.</p>

<p>Myelin is a dynamic membrane that is important for coordinating the fast propagation of action potentials along small or large caliber axons (0.1–10 μm) some of which extend the entire length of the spinal cord. Due to the heterogeneity of electrical and energy demands of the variable neuronal populations, the axo-myelinic and axo-glial interactions that regulate the biophysical properties of myelinated axons also vary in terms of molecular interactions at the membrane interfaces. An important topic of debate in neuroscience is how myelin is maintained and modified under neuronal control and how disruption of this control (due to disease or injury) can initiate and/or propagate neurodegeneration. One of the key molecular signaling cascades that have been investigated in the context of neural injury over the past two decades involves the myelin-associated inhibitory factors (MAIFs) that interact with Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1). Chief among the MAIF superfamily of molecules is a reticulon family protein, Nogo-A, that is established as a potent inhibitor of neurite sprouting and axon regeneration. However, an understated role for NgR1 is its ability to control axo-myelin interactions and Nogo-A specific ligand binding. These interactions may occur at axo-dendritic and axo-glial synapses regulating their functional and dynamic membrane domains. The current review provides a comprehensive analysis of how neuronal NgR1 can regulate myelin thickness and plasticity under normal and disease conditions. Specifically, we discuss how NgR1 plays an important role in regulating paranodal and juxtaparanodal domains through specific signal transduction cascades that are important for microdomain molecular architecture and action potential propagation. Potential therapeutics designed to target NgR1-dependent signaling during disease are being developed in animal models since interference with the involvement of the receptor may facilitate neurological recovery. Hence, the regulatory role played by NgR1 in the axo-myelinic interface is an important research field of clinical significance that requires comprehensive investigation.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and there is still no effective way to stop its progress. Therefore, early detection is crucial for the prevention and the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The current diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, however, mainly depends on the symptoms, so it is necessary to establish a reliable imaging modality for PD diagnosis and its progression monitoring. Other studies and our previous ones demonstrated that substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SNH) was detected by transcranial sonography (TCS) in the ventral midbrain of PD patients, and SNH is regarded as a characteristic marker of PD. The present study aimed to explore whether SNH could serve as a reliable imaging modality to monitor the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD. The results revealed that the size of SNH was positively related with the degree of dopaminergic neuron death in PD animal models. Furthermore, we revealed that microglia activation contributed to the SNH formation in substantia nigra (SN) in PD models. Taken together, this study suggests that SNH through TCS is a promising imaging modality to monitor the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that there is a critical window for estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in postmenopausal women with Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, supporting evidence is lacking. To address this issue, we investigated the effective period for estradiol (E2) treatment using a mouse model of AD. Four-month-old female APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice were ovariectomized (OVX) and treated with E2 for 2 months starting at the age of 4 months (early period), 6 months (mid-period), or 8 months (late period). We then evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis, β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, telomerase activity, and hippocampal-dependent behavior. Compared to age-matched wild type mice, APP/PS1 mice with intact ovaries showed increased proliferation of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) at 8 months of age and decreased proliferation of NSCs at 10 months of age; meanwhile, Aβ accumulation progressively increased with age, paralleling the reduced survival of immature neurons. OVX-induced depletion of E2 in APP/PS1 mice resulted in elevated Aβ levels accompanied by elevated p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) expression and increased NSC proliferation at 6 months of age, which subsequently declined; accelerated reduction of immature neurons starting from 6 months of age, and reduced telomerase activity and worsened memory performance at 10 months of age. Treatment with E2 in the early period post-OVX, rather than in the mid or late period, abrogated these effects, and p75<sup>NTR</sup> inhibition reduced the overproliferation of NSCs in 6-month-old OVX-APP/PS1 mice. Thus, E2 deficiency in young APP/PS1 mice exacerbates cognitive deficits and depletes the hippocampal NSC pool in later life; this can be alleviated by E2 treatment in the early period following OVX, which prevents Aβ/p75<sup>NTR</sup>-induced NSC overproliferation and preserves telomerase activity.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by senile plaques (SPs), which are caused by amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds to advanced glycation end products deposited during vascular dysfunction. Alzheimer’s disease may occur when RAGE binds to Aβ and releases reactive oxygen species, further exacerbating Aβ deposition and eventually leading to SPs and NFTs. As it is involved in early AD, RAGE may be considered as a more potent biomarker than Aβ. Positron emission tomography provides valuable information regarding the underlying pathological processes of AD many years before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Thus, to further reveal the role of RAGE in AD pathology and for early diagnosis of AD, a tracer that targets RAGE is needed. In this review, we first describe the early diagnosis of AD and then summarize the interaction between RAGE and Aβ and Tau that is required to induce AD pathology, and finally focus on RAGE-targeting probes, highlighting the potential of RAGE to be used as an effective target. The development of RAGE probes is expected to aid in AD diagnosis and treatment.</p>

The chloride-proton exchanger CLC-7 plays critical roles in lysosomal homeostasis and bone regeneration and its mutation can lead to osteopetrosis, lysosomal storage disease and neurological disorders. In lysosomes and the ruffled border of osteoclasts, CLC-7 requires a b-subunit, OSTM1, for stability and activity. Here we present electron cryomicroscopy structures of CLC-7 in occluded states by itself and in complex with OSTM1, determined at resolutions up to 2.8 Å. In the complex, the luminal surface of CLC-7 is entirely covered by a dimer of the heavily glycosylated and disulfide-bonded OSTM1, which serves to protect CLC-7 from the degradative environment of the lysosomal lumen. OSTM1 binding does not induce large-scale rearrangements of CLC-7, but does have minor effects the conformation of the ion-conduction pathway, potentially contributing to its regulatory role. These studies provide insights into the role of OSTM1 and serve as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of CLC-7 regulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59328">Heterogeneous somatostatin-expressing neuron population in mouse ventral tegmental area</a></h4>

The cellular architecture of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the main hub of the brain reward system, remains only partially characterized. To extend the characterization to inhibitory neurons, we have identified three distinct subtypes of somatostatin (Sst)-expressing neurons in the mouse VTA. These neurons differ in their electrophysiological and morphological properties, anatomical localization, as well as mRNA expression profiles. Importantly, similar to cortical Sst-containing interneurons, most VTA Sst neurons express GABAergic inhibitory markers, but some of them also express glutamatergic excitatory markers and a subpopulation even express dopaminergic markers. Furthermore, only some of the proposed marker genes for cortical Sst neurons were expressed in the VTA Sst neurons. Physiologically, one of the VTA Sst neuron subtypes locally inhibited neighboring dopamine neurons. Overall, our results demonstrate the remarkable complexity and heterogeneity of VTA Sst neurons and suggest that these cells are multifunctional players in the midbrain reward circuitry.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56938">A flexible framework for simulating and fitting generalized drift-diffusion models</a></h4>

The drift-diffusion model (DDM) is an important decision-making model in cognitive neuroscience. However, innovations in model form have been limited by methodological challenges. Here, we introduce the generalized drift-diffusion model (GDDM) framework for building and fitting DDM extensions, and provide a software package which implements the framework. The GDDM framework augments traditional DDM parameters through arbitrary user-defined functions. Models are solved numerically by directly solving the Fokker-Planck equation using efficient numerical methods, yielding a 100-fold or greater speedup over standard methodology. This speed allows GDDMs to be fit to data using maximum likelihood on the full response time (RT) distribution. We demonstrate fitting of GDDMs within our framework to both animal and human datasets from perceptual decision-making tasks, with better accuracy and fewer parameters than several DDMs implemented using the latest methodology, to test hypothesized decision-making mechanisms. Overall, our framework will allow for decision-making model innovation and novel experimental designs.

DNA:RNA hybrids constitute a well-known source of recombinogenic DNA damage. The current literature is in agreement with DNA:RNA hybrids being produced co-transcriptionally by the invasion of the nascent RNA molecule produced <i>in cis</i> with its DNA template. However, it has also been suggested that recombinogenic DNA:RNA hybrids could be facilitated by the invasion of RNA molecules produced <i>in trans</i> in a Rad51-mediated reaction. Here, we tested the possibility that such DNA:RNA hybrids constitute a source of recombinogenic DNA damage taking advantage of Rad51-independent single-strand annealing (SSA) assays in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. For this, we used new constructs designed to induce expression of mRNA transcripts <i>in trans</i> with respect to the SSA system. We show that unscheduled and recombinogenic DNA:RNA hybrids that trigger the SSA event are formed in<i> cis</i> during transcription and in a Rad51-independent manner. We found no evidence that such hybrids form <i>in trans </i>and in a Rad51-dependent manner.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55684">Intrinsic excitation-inhibition imbalance affects medial prefrontal cortex differently in autistic men versus women</a></h4>

Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54754">Metabolic response of blood vessels to TNFα</a></h4>

TNFa signaling in the vascular endothelium elicits multiple inflammatory responses that drive vascular destabilization and leakage. Bioactive lipids are main drivers of these processes. <i>In vitro</i> mechanistic studies of bioactive lipids have been largely based on two-dimensional endothelial cell cultures that, due to lack of laminar flow and the growth of the cells on non-compliant stiff substrates, often display a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This complicates the assessment of inflammatory processes. Three-dimensional microvessels-on-a-chip models provide a unique opportunity to generate endothelial microvessels in a more physiological environment. Using an optimized targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory bioactive lipids, we measure the profile changes upon administration of TNFa. We demonstrate that bioactive lipid profiles can be readily detected from three-dimensional microvessels-on-a-chip and display a more dynamic, less inflammatory response to TNFa, that resembles more the human situation, compared to classical two-dimensional endothelial cell cultures.

Tsabar et al. show that a subset of cells switches from oscillatory to sustained p53 dynamics more than 24 h after irradiation-induced DNA damage. Switching is maximal at intermediate radiation doses, requires escape from irradiation-induced cell cycle arrest, and is facilitated by caspase-2-PIDDosome-mediated degradation of p53’s inhibitor MDM2.

Cell-surface glycans play a critical role in cell functions and fate. Nevertheless, the relevance of host glycosylation to HIV persistence is unknown. Colomb et al. characterized the cell-surface glycomes of HIV-infected cells during therapy and identified glycomic signatures of these cells that may affect cell trafficking and therefore HIV persistence.

Tian et al. present a cell-tracking pipeline called EllipTrack that is optimized for modern, multi-day, high-throughput 2D fluorescent time-lapse movies. EllipTrack produces nearly error-free cell lineages for the cell lines tested and represents an improvement over existing tools for hard-to-track cells such as cancer cells.

Segura-Bayona et al. find the Tousled-like kinases (TLKs) maintain chromatin at repetitive genome elements and telomeres. TLK depletion results in heterochromatin desilencing and induction of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), robustly activating cGAS-STING-TBK1-mediated innate immune responses. This suggests TLKs represent a druggable vulnerability in ALT+ and chromosomally unstable tumor cells.

GPR35 is associated with IBD, but how GPR35 may influence macrophage-mediated intestinal homeostasis remains unclear.

RBP2, for instance, primes synaptic vesicles via Munc13-1 at the expense of presynaptic Ca2+-channel function and, consequently, affects short term plasticity.

<p>by Gabriel Koch Ocker, Michael A. Buice</p>

Neural computation is determined by neurons’ dynamics and circuit connectivity. Uncertain and dynamic environments may require neural hardware to adapt to different computational tasks, each requiring different connectivity configurations. At the same time, connectivity is subject to a variety of constraints, placing limits on the possible computations a given neural circuit can perform. Here we examine the hypothesis that the organization of neural circuitry favors computational flexibility: that it makes many computational solutions available, given physiological constraints. From this hypothesis, we develop models of connectivity degree distributions based on constraints on a neuron’s total synaptic weight. To test these models, we examine reconstructions of the mushroom bodies from the first instar larva and adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We perform a Bayesian model comparison for two constraint models and a random wiring null model. Overall, we find that flexibility under a homeostatically fixed total synaptic weight describes Kenyon cell connectivity better than other models, suggesting a principle shaping the apparently random structure of Kenyon cell wiring. Furthermore, we find evidence that larval Kenyon cells are more flexible earlier in development, suggesting a mechanism whereby neural circuits begin as flexible systems that develop into specialized computational circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OhEIj0eIIGQ" width="1" />

<p>by Giorgos Minas, Dan J. Woodcock, Louise Ashall, Claire V. Harper, Michael R. H. White, David A. Rand</p>

We consider how a signalling system can act as an information hub by multiplexing information arising from multiple signals. We formally define multiplexing, mathematically characterise which systems can multiplex and how well they can do it. While the results of this paper are theoretical, to motivate the idea of multiplexing, we provide experimental evidence that tentatively suggests that the NF-<i>κ</i>B transcription factor can multiplex information about changes in multiple signals. We believe that our theoretical results may resolve the apparent paradox of how a system like NF-<i>κ</i>B that regulates cell fate and inflammatory signalling in response to diverse stimuli can appear to have the low information carrying capacity suggested by recent studies on scalar signals. In carrying out our study, we introduce new methods for the analysis of large, nonlinear stochastic dynamic models, and develop computational algorithms that facilitate the calculation of fundamental constructs of information theory such as Kullback–Leibler divergences and sensitivity matrices, and link these methods to new theory about multiplexing information. We show that many current models such as those of the NF-<i>κ</i>B system cannot multiplex effectively and provide models that overcome this limitation using post-transcriptional modifications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9MxzVqLUduA" width="1" />

Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) present a conceptually elegant approach to not only overcome, but better yet, exploit intra-tumoural hypoxia. Despite being successful <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, HAPs are yet to achieve successful results in clinical settings. It has been hypothesised that this lack of clinical success can, in part, be explained by the insufficiently stringent clinical screening selection of determining which tumours are suitable for HAP treatments. Taking a mathematical modelling approach, we investigate how tumour properties and HAP-radiation scheduling influence treatment outcomes in simulated tumours. The following key results are demonstrated <i>in silico</i>: <i>(i)</i> HAP and ionising radiation (IR) monotherapies may attack tumours in dissimilar, and complementary, ways. <i>(ii)</i> HAP-IR scheduling may impact treatment efficacy. <i>(iii)</i> HAPs may function as IR treatment intensifiers. <i>(iv)</i> The spatio-temporal intra-tumoural oxygen landscape may impact HAP efficacy. Our <i>in silico</i> framework is based on an on-lattice, hybrid, multiscale cellular automaton spanning three spatial dimensions. The mathematical model for tumour spheroid growth is parameterised by multicellular tumour spheroid (MCTS) data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oXpNL_S1XMU" width="1" />

<p>by Andy Hoyle, David Cairns, Iona Paterson, Stuart McMillan, Gabriela Ochoa, Andrew P. Desbois</p>

Mass production and use of antibiotics has led to the rise of resistant bacteria, a problem possibly exacerbated by inappropriate and non-optimal application. Antibiotic treatment often follows <i>fixed-dose</i> regimens, with a standard dose of antibiotic administered equally spaced in time. But are such fixed-dose regimens optimal or can alternative regimens be designed to increase efficacy? Yet, few mathematical models have aimed to identify optimal treatments based on biological data of infections inside a living host. In addition, assumptions to make the mathematical models analytically tractable limit the search space of possible treatment regimens (e.g. to fixed-dose treatments). Here, we aimed to address these limitations by using experiments in a <i>Galleria mellonella</i> (insect) model of bacterial infection, to create a fully parametrised mathematical model of a systemic <i>Vibrio</i> infection. We successfully validated this model with biological experiments, including treatments unseen by the mathematical model. Then, by applying artificial intelligence, this model was used to determine optimal antibiotic dosage regimens to treat the host to maximise survival while minimising total antibiotic used. As expected, host survival increased as total quantity of antibiotic applied during the course of treatment increased. However, many of the optimal regimens tended to follow a large initial ‘loading’ dose followed by doses of incremental reductions in antibiotic quantity (dose ‘tapering’). Moreover, application of the entire antibiotic in a single dose at the start of treatment was never optimal, except when the total quantity of antibiotic was very low. Importantly, the range of optimal regimens identified was broad enough to allow the antibiotic prescriber to choose a regimen based on additional criteria or preferences. Our findings demonstrate the utility of an insect host to model antibiotic therapies <i>in vivo</i> and the approach lays a foundation for future regimen optimisation for patient and societal benefits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6KNpSUkA4E" width="1" />

Many large-scale functional connectivity studies have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations during task states. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states primarily reduce correlations among pairs of neurons, likely enhancing their information coding by suppressing shared spontaneous activity. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether co-active brain regions during task states tend to increase or decrease their correlations. We found that variability and correlations primarily decrease across a variety of cortical regions in two highly distinct data sets: non-human primate spiking data and human functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Moreover, this observed variability and correlation reduction was accompanied by an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, suggesting that decreased correlations increased information coding capacity. We further found in both spiking and neural mass computational models that task-evoked activity increased the stability around a stable attractor, globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-P3CCpUKEk" width="1" />

<p>by K. L. Nikhil, Sandra Korge, Achim Kramer</p>

A ubiquitous feature of the circadian clock across life forms is its organization as a network of cellular oscillators, with individual cellular oscillators within the network often exhibiting considerable heterogeneity in their intrinsic periods. The interaction of coupling and heterogeneity in circadian clock networks is hypothesized to influence clock’s entrainability, but our knowledge of mechanisms governing period heterogeneity within circadian clock networks remains largely elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the principles that underlie intercellular period variation in circadian clock networks (clonal period heterogeneity). To this end, we employed a laboratory selection approach and derived a panel of 25 clonal cell populations exhibiting circadian periods ranging from 22 to 28 h. We report that a single parent clone can produce progeny clones with a wide distribution of circadian periods, and this heterogeneity, in addition to being stochastically driven, has a heritable component. By quantifying the expression of 20 circadian clock and clock-associated genes across our clone panel, we found that inheritance of expression patterns in at least three clock genes might govern clonal period heterogeneity in circadian clock networks. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that heritable epigenetic variation in gene expression regulation might underlie period heterogeneity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nO7_HYsM5lM" width="1" />

The Scar/WAVE complex is the principal catalyst of pseudopod and lamellipod formation. Here we show that Scar/WAVE’s proline-rich domain is polyphosphorylated after the complex is activated. Blocking Scar/WAVE activation stops phosphorylation in both <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mammalian cells, implying that phosphorylation modulates pseudopods after they have been formed, rather than controlling whether they are initiated. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation is not promoted by chemotactic signaling but is greatly stimulated by cell:substrate adhesion and diminished when cells deadhere. Phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic Scar/WAVE mutants are both normally functional and rescue the phenotype of knockout cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation and actin regulation. However, pseudopods and patches of phosphorylation-deficient Scar/WAVE last substantially longer in mutants, altering the dynamics and size of pseudopods and lamellipods and thus changing migration speed. Scar/WAVE phosphorylation does not require ERK2 in <i>Dictyostelium</i> or mammalian cells. However, the MAPKKK homologue SepA contributes substantially—<i>sep</i>A mutants have less steady-state phosphorylation, which does not increase in response to adhesion. The mutants also behave similarly to cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient Scar, with longer-lived pseudopods and patches of Scar recruitment. We conclude that pseudopod engagement with substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar/WAVE’s activity and that phosphorylation acts as a pseudopod timer by promoting Scar/WAVE turnover.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z8MkWjL8crs" width="1" />

<p>by I-Ting Lin, Meng-Chao Yao</p>

Recognition of self and nonself is important for outcrossing organisms, and different mating types establish the barrier against self-mating. In the unicellular ciliate <i>T</i>. <i>thermophila</i>, mating type determination requires complex DNA rearrangements at a single <i>mat</i> locus during conjugation to produce a type-specific gene pair (<i>MTA</i> and <i>MTB</i>) for 1 of 7 possible mating types. Surprisingly, we found that decreased expression of the DNA breakage-repair protein Ku80 at late stages of conjugation generated persistent selfing phenotype in the progeny. DNA analysis revealed multiple mating-type gene pairs as well as a variety of mis-paired, unusually arranged mating-type genes in these selfers that resemble some proposed rearrangement intermediates. They are found also in normal cells during conjugation and are lost after 10 fissions but are retained in Ku mutants. Silencing of <i>TKU80</i> or <i>TKU70-2</i> immediately after conjugation also generated selfing phenotype, revealing a hidden DNA rearrangement process beyond conjugation. Mating reactions between the mutant and normal cells suggest a 2-component system for self–nonself-recognition through <i>MTA</i> and <i>MTB</i> genes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/O3TPN2fSdms" width="1" />

Sleep is vital for survival. Yet under environmentally challenging conditions, such as starvation, animals suppress their need for sleep. Interestingly, starvation-induced sleep loss does not evoke a subsequent sleep rebound. Little is known about how starvation-induced sleep deprivation differs from other types of sleep loss, or why some sleep functions become dispensable during starvation. Here, we demonstrate that down-regulation of the secreted cytokine unpaired 2 (<i>upd2</i>) in <i>Drosophila</i> flies may mimic a starved-like state. We used a genetic knockdown strategy to investigate the consequences of <i>upd2</i> on visual attention and sleep in otherwise well-fed flies, thereby sidestepping the negative side effects of undernourishment. We find that knockdown of <i>upd2</i> in the fat body (FB) is sufficient to suppress sleep and promote feeding-related behaviors while also improving selective visual attention. Furthermore, we show that this peripheral signal is integrated in the fly brain via insulin-expressing cells. Together, these findings identify a role for peripheral tissue-to-brain interactions in the simultaneous regulation of sleep quality and attention, to potentially promote adaptive behaviors necessary for survival in hungry animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vW68mrDTUfg" width="1" />

<p><i>PPP2R5D‐ </i>related neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental and behavioral manifestations. We report the association of early‐onset parkinsonism with the <i>PPP2R5D </i> p.E200K mutation.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Insula epilepsy is rare and can be evaluated effectively by Stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG). Many previous studies of insulo‐opercular seizures have been unable to separate insular and opercular onset. With adequate sampling of the insula, this study shows this is possible.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed intrainsular dynamics and extrainsular propagation in 12 patients with “pure” insula epilepsy (n = 9) or insular and only deepest opercular involvement (n = 3) at seizure onset. Review of semiology defined clinical groups, agglomerative cluster, and principal component analysis of semiological features were performed. Quantitative epileptogenicity, and intrainsular and extrainsular propagation were computed via time frequency analysis and epileptogenicity mapping.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizure onset patterns were heterogeneous; the seizure onset zone was focal. Seizure onset and first ictal change within insula functional subdivision correlated with aura and reflex component. No paninsular spread occurred; contralateral insular spread was very early. While the discharge was intrainsular, clinical signs related to aura or vegetative signs. Extrainsular propagation was early and related to the emergence of the majority of clinical signs. Cluster analysis found an anterior, intermediate, and posterior insula seizure onset group. The largest principal component separated anterior insula manifestations, including early hypermotor signs, early recovery, and no aura from posterior insula features of early dystonia, early tonic motor features, and sensorimotor aura.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Aura is vital to identifying seizure onset and relates to insula functional subdivision. Seizures are heterogenous; extrainsular propagation occurs early, accounting for most of the semiology. With adequate sampling, "pure" insula epilepsy can be identified and focal curative resection is possible. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Early discrimination of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics (SM) poses a diagnostic challenge. The circulating metabolome might reflect pathophysiological events related to acute IS. Here, we investigated the utility of early metabolic changes for differentiating IS from SM.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed untargeted metabolomics on serum samples obtained from patients with IS (N=508) and SM (N=349; defined by absence of a DWI positive lesion on MRI) who presented to hospital within 24 hours after symptom onset (median time from symptom onset to blood sampling= 3.3h; IQR: 1.6‐6.7h) and from neurologically normal controls (NC, N=112). We compared diagnostic groups in a discovery‐validation approach by applying multivariable linear regression models, machine learning techniques, and propensity score matching. We further performed a targeted look‐up of published metabolite sets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of forty‐one metabolites were significantly associated with IS compared to NC. The top metabolites showing the highest value in separating IS from SM were asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine, pregnenolone sulfate, and adenosine. Together, these four metabolites differentiated patients with IS from SM with an AUC of 0.90 in the replication sample, which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography (AUC=0.80) obtained for routine diagnostics. They were further superior to previously published metabolite sets detected in our samples. All four metabolites returned to control levels by day 90.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A set of four metabolites with known biological effects relevant to stroke pathophysiology shows unprecedented utility to identify patients with IS upon hospital arrival thus encouraging further investigation including multicenter studies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sex steroid hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) regulate neuronal function by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and GPER1, and through differential production via the enzyme aromatase. ERs and aromatase are expressed across the nervous system, including in the striatal brain regions. These regions, comprising the nucleus accumbens core, shell, and caudate–putamen, are instrumental for a wide‐range of functions and disorders that show sex differences in phenotype and/or incidence. Sex‐specific estrogen action is an integral component for generating these sex differences. A distinctive feature of the striatal regions is that in adulthood neurons exclusively express membrane but not nuclear ERs. This long‐standing finding dominates models of estrogen action in striatal regions. However, the developmental etiology of ER and aromatase cellular expression in female and male striatum is unknown. This omission in knowledge is important to address, as developmental stage influences cellular estrogenic mechanisms. Thus, ERα, GPER1, and aromatase cellular immunoreactivity was assessed in perinatal, prepubertal, and adult female and male rats. We tested the hypothesis that ERα, GPER1, and aromatase exhibits sex, region, and age‐specific differences, including nuclear expression. ERα exhibits nuclear expression in all three striatal regions before adulthood and disappears in a region‐ and sex‐specific time‐course. Cellular GPER1 expression decreases during development in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course, resulting in extranuclear expression by adulthood. Somatic aromatase expression presents at prepuberty and increases by adulthood in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course. These data indicate that developmental period exerts critical sex‐specific influences on striatal cellular estrogenic mechanisms.</p>

<p>Neurons of the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdm) project onto hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST. Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.</p>

<p>Light sheet microcopy is used to map frequency along the basilar membrane within intact cochleae, retaining spatial orientation and relationships with internal and external structural landmarks. Three‐dimensional measures of how frequency domains relate to one another gives insight into how the geometric organization of the cochlea may influence its physiology.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides a rapid and complete three‐dimensional image of the cochlea. The method retains anatomical relationships—on a micrometer scale—between internal structures such as hair cells, basilar membrane (BM), and modiolus with external surface structures such as the round and oval windows. Immunolabeled hair cells were used to visualize the spiraling BM in the intact cochlea without time intensive dissections or additional histological processing; yet material prepared for LSFM could be rehydrated, the BM dissected out and reimaged at higher resolution with the confocal microscope. In immersion‐fixed material, details of the cochlear vasculature were seen throughout the cochlea. Hair cell counts (both inner and outer) as well as frequency maps of the BM were comparable to those obtained by other methods, but with the added dimension of depth. The material provided measures of angular, linear, and vector distance between characteristic frequency regions along the BM. Thus, LSFM provides a unique ability to rapidly image the entire cochlea in a manner applicable to model and interpret physiological results. Furthermore, the three‐dimensional organization of the cochlea can be studied at the organ and cellular level with LSFM, and this same material can be taken to the confocal microscope for detailed analysis at the subcellular level.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00055">Adaptation Modulates Spike-Phase Coupling Tuning Curve in the Rat Primary Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Adaptation is an important mechanism that causes a decrease in the neural response both in terms of local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity. We previously showed this reduction effect in the tuning curve of the primary auditory cortex. Moreover, we revealed that a repeated stimulus reduces the neural response in terms of spike-phase coupling (SPC). In the current study, we examined the effect of adaptation on the SPC tuning curve. To this end, employing the phase-locking value (PLV) method, we estimated the spike-LFP coupling. The data was obtained by a simultaneous recording from four single-electrodes in the primary auditory cortex of 15 rats. We first investigated whether the neural system may use spike-LFP phase coupling in the primary auditory cortex to encode sensory information. Secondly, we investigated the effect of adaptation on this potential SPC tuning. Our data showed that the coupling between spikes’ times and the LFP phase in beta oscillations represents sensory information (different stimulus frequencies), with an inverted bell-shaped tuning curve. Furthermore, we showed that adaptation to a specific frequency modulates SPC tuning curve of the adapter and its neighboring frequencies. These findings could be useful for interpretation of feature representation in terms of SPC and the underlying neural mechanism of adaptation.</p>

<p>Novel therapeutic approaches for treating inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) prompt a need to understand which patients with impaired vision have the anatomical potential to gain from participation in a clinical trial. We used supervised machine learning to predict foveal function from foveal structure in blue cone monochromacy (BCM), an X-linked congenital cone photoreceptor dysfunction secondary to mutations in the OPN1LW/OPN1MW gene cluster. BCM patients with either disease-associated large deletion or missense mutations were studied and results compared with those from subjects with other forms of IRD and various degrees of preserved central structure and function. A machine learning technique was used to associate foveal sensitivities and best-corrected visual acuities to foveal structure in IRD patients. Two random forest (RF) models trained on IRD data were applied to predict foveal function in BCM. A curve fitting method was also used and results compared with those of the RF models. The BCM and IRD patients had a comparable range of foveal structure. IRD patients had peak sensitivity at the fovea. Machine learning could successfully predict foveal sensitivity (FS) results from segmented or un-segmented optical coherence tomography (OCT) input. Application of machine learning predictions to BCM at the fovea showed differences between predicted and measured sensitivities, thereby defining treatment potential. The curve fitting method provided similar results. Given a measure of visual acuity (VA) and foveal outer nuclear layer thickness, the question of how many lines of acuity would represent the best efficacious result for each BCM patient could be answered. We propose that foveal vision improvement potential in BCM is predictable from retinal structure using machine learning and curve fitting approaches. This should allow estimates of maximal efficacy in patients being considered for clinical trials and also guide decisions about dosing.</p>

<p>Background: Neuronal apoptosis involved in secondary injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly contributes to the poor outcomes of patients with TBI. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can selectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Hypoxia factor (HIF) 1α is a controversial factor that mediates the neuronal apoptotic pathway. Herein, we hypothesize that HIF-1α may mediate the TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis after TBI.</p><p>Methods: We used Western blots and immunofluorescence to study the expression and cell localization of TRAIL and death receptor 5 (DR5) after TBI in rats. Soluble DR5 (sDR5) administration was used to block the TRAIL-induced neuronal death and neural deficits. HIF-1α inhibitor 2ME and agonist DMOG were used to study the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death. Meanwhile, HIF-1α siRNA was used to investigate the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death in vitro.</p><p>Results: The expressions of microglia-located TRAIL and neuron-located DR5 were significantly upregulated after TBI. sDR5 significantly attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis and neurological deficits. 2ME decreased neuronal apoptosis, lesion area, and brain edema and improved neurological function via increased expression of TRAIL decoy receptor 1 (DcR1), which inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis after TBI. The administration of DMOG produced the opposite effect than did 2ME. Similarly, HIF-1α siRNA attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal death via increased DcR1 expression in vitro.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the TRAIL/DR5 signaling pathway plays an important role after neuronal apoptosis after TBI. HIF-1α mediates TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating DcR1 expression following TBI.</p>

Biological agents adapt behavior to support the survival needs of the individual and the species. In this review we outline the anatomical, physiological, and computational processes that support reinforcement learning (RL). We describe two circuits in the primate brain that are linked to specific aspects of learning and goal-directed behavior. The ventral circuit, that includes the amygdala, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum, has substantial connectivity with the hypothalamus.

<p>Ultrasonic neuromodulation of peripheral nerve cells.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Satisfactory treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) faces difficulties owing to the intrinsic biological barriers in larger injuries and invasive surgical interventions. Injury gaps &gt;3 cm have low chances of full motor and sensory recovery, and the unmet need for PNI repair techniques which increase the likelihood of functional recovery while limiting invasiveness motivate this work. Building upon prior work in ultrasound stimulation (US) of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the effects of US on DRG neuron and Schwann cell (SC) cocultures were investigated to uncover the role of SCs in mediating the neuronal response to US <i>in vitro </i>. Acoustic intensity‐dependent alteration in selected neuromorphometrics of DRG neurons in coculture with SCs was observed in total outgrowth, primary neurites, and length compared to previously reported DRG monoculture in a calcium‐independent manner. SC viability and proliferation were not impacted by US. Conditioned medium studies suggest secreted factors from SCs subjected to US impact DRG neuron morphology. These findings advance the current understanding of mechanisms by which these cell types respond to US, which may lead to new noninvasive US therapies for treating PNI.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We conducted a multi‐site, randomized, double‐blinded controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect that demonstrated significant spatially biased attention following acquired brain injury were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for twelve weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left – right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life and sleep. Assessments were conducted prior to and immediately following participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a three‐month no contact period.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome—a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (p=0.010, Cohen’s d=0.96)—as well as significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (p=0.027, Cohen’s d=0.24).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect may serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care.</p>

<p>Anti‐IgLON5 disease is a neurological disorder characterized by autoantibodies against IgLON5 and pathological evidence of neuronal‐specific tau accumulation. Here we report that patients' IgLON5 IgG, but not other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt the cytoskeletal organization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons resulting in dystrophic neurites and axonal swelling. Adsorption of IgLON5 IgG with HEK293 cells expressing IgLON5 abrogated the indicated cytoskeletal changes. These findings along an increase of levels of neurofilaments in patients' CSF suggest that IgLON5 IgG, unlike other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt neuronal cytoskeleton maintenance providing a link between autoimmunity and neurodegeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Millions suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year wherein the outcomes associated with injury can vary greatly between individuals. This study postulates that variations in each biomechanical parameter of a head trauma lead to differences in histological and behavioral outcome measures that should be considered collectively in assessing injury. While trauma severity typically scales with the magnitude of injury, much less is known about the effects of rate and duration of the mechanical insult. In this study, a newly developed voice‐coil fluid percussion injury system was used to investigate the effects of injury rate and fluid percussion impulse on a collection of post‐injury outcomes in male rats. Collectively the data suggest a potential shift in the specificity and progression of neuronal injury and function rather than a general scaling of injury severity. While a faster, shorter fluid percussion first presents as a mild TBI, neuronal loss and some behavioral tasks were similar among the slower and faster fluid percussion injuries. This study concludes that the sequelae of neuronal degeneration and behavioral outcomes are related to the complete temporal profile of the fluid percussion and do not scale only with peak pressure.</p>

<p>Insulin deficiency, rather than insulin resistance, induces AD‐like features in wild type and transgenic mice carrying amyloid β and tau genes. Treatment with Exendin‐4 ameliorates these features in an intervention paradigm when deficits were already present, reflecting the more likely scenario when patients will consult.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epidemiological studies have pointed at diabetes as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this has been supported by several studies in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, side‐by‐side comparison of the two types of diabetes is limited. We investigated the role of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in the development of memory impairments and the effect of Exendin‐4 (Ex4) treatment in a mouse model of AD. Three–4‐month‐old female wild type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing human tau and amyloid precursor protein (TAPP) were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) or fed a high‐fat diet (HFD). A second study was performed in TAPP‐STZ mice treated with Ex4, a long‐lasting analog of GLP‐1. Plasma and brain were collected at study termination for ELISA, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Learning and memory deficits were impaired in TAPP transgenic mice compared with WT mice at the end of the study. Deficits were exaggerated by insulin deficiency in TAPP mice but 12 weeks of insulin resistance did not affect memory performances in either WT or TAPP mice. Levels of phosphorylated tau were increased in the brain of WT‐STZ and TAPP‐STZ mice but not in the brain of WT or TAPP mice on HFD. In the TAPP‐STZ mice, treatment with Ex4 initiated after established cognitive deficits ameliorated learning, but not memory, impairments. This was accompanied by the reduction of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau expression. Theses studies support the role of Ex4 in AD, independently from its actions on diabetes.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to contrast findings with Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a discovery cohort of well‐characterized early MSA patients (n = 24) and matched healthy controls (CON, n = 14), we utilized enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay to measure NFL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF. We confirmed findings in a separate prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with early MSA (n = 38), Parkinson disease (PD, n = 16), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), and CON subjects (n = 15).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the discovery cohort, NFL was markedly elevated in MSA patients, with perfect separation from CON. αSyn‐PMCA was nonreactive in all CON, whereas all MSA samples were positive. In the confirmatory cohort, NFL again perfectly separated MSA from CON, and was significantly lower in PD and DLB compared to MSA. PMCA was again nonreactive in all CON, and positive in all but 2 MSA cases. All PD and all but 2 DLB samples were also positive for αSyn aggregates but with markedly different reaction kinetics from MSA; aggregation occurred later, but maximum fluorescence was higher, allowing for perfect separation of reactive samples between MSA and Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NFL and αSyn oligomers in CSF faithfully differentiate early MSA not only from CON but also from Lewy body synucleinopathies. The findings support the role of these markers as diagnostic biomarkers, and have important implications for understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synucleinopathies.

<p>Design‐based stereological methods allow the estimation of basic morphological parameters in representative samples of the sectioned central nervous system. Point probes can be used to estimate volume (illustrated for the Area Fraction Fractionator), line probes can be used to estimate surface area (illustrated for a vertical sections design), area probes can be used to estimate length (illustrated for the Spaceball probe), and volume probes must be used to estimate number (illustrated for the Disector). This review provides an introduction to how these methods solve problems associated with other quantitative approaches, how they are applied to histological material, how a sampling scheme can be designed and evaluated, and which practical problems need to be solved to generate the numbers that we will need to come to an understanding of central nervous system function.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated with studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity, and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough.” Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.</p>

<p>Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of seven species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and six species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.</p>

<p>Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity.</p>
<p>Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory.</p>
<p>In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: 1) Are we testing ODP <i>per s </i>e? 2) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? 3) The critical importance of binocular competition, 4) What is the adult plasticity? 5) Excitation‐Inhibition balance in local circuits, and 6) Species differences in the animal models.</p>

High levels of heterozygosity present a unique genome assembly challenge and can adversely impact downstream analyses, yet is common in sequencing datasets obtained from non-model organisms. Here we show that by re-assembling a heterozygous dataset with variant parameters and different assembly algorithms, we are able to generate assemblies whose protein annotations are statistically enriched for specific gene ontology categories. While total assembly length was not significantly affected by assembly methodologies tested, the assemblies generated varied widely in fragmentation level and we show local assembly collapse or expansion underlying the enrichment or depletion of specific protein functional groups. We show that these statistically significant deviations in gene ontology groups can occur in seemingly high-quality assemblies, and result from difficult-to-detect local sequence expansion or contractions. Given the unpredictable interplay between assembly algorithm, parameter, and biological sequence data heterozygosity, we highlight the need for better measures of assembly quality than N50 value, including methods for assessing local expansion and collapse.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UOVWOmeRqLQ" width="1" />

<p>by Samy Castro, Wael El-Deredy, Demian Battaglia, Patricio Orio</p>

The capability of cortical regions to flexibly sustain an “ignited” state of activity has been discussed in relation to conscious perception or hierarchical information processing. Here, we investigate how the intrinsic propensity of different regions to get ignited is determined by the specific topological organisation of the structural connectome. More specifically, we simulated the resting-state dynamics of mean-field whole-brain models and assessed how dynamic multi-stability and ignition differ between a reference model embedding a realistic human connectome, and alternative models based on a variety of randomised connectome ensembles. We found that the strength of global excitation needed to first trigger ignition in a subset of regions is substantially smaller for the model embedding the empirical human connectome. Furthermore, when increasing the strength of excitation, the propagation of ignition outside of this initial core–which is able to self-sustain its high activity–is way more gradual than for any of the randomised connectomes, allowing for graded control of the number of ignited regions. We explain both these assets in terms of the exceptional weighted core-shell organisation of the empirical connectome, speculating that this topology of human structural connectivity may be attuned to support enhanced ignition dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uuJ9kZWwaLk" width="1" />

One of the earliest and most prevalent barriers to successful reproduction is polyspermy, or fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm. To prevent these supernumerary fertilizations, eggs have evolved multiple mechanisms. It has recently been proposed that zinc released by mammalian eggs at fertilization may block additional sperm from entering. Here, we demonstrate that eggs from amphibia and teleost fish also release zinc. Using <i>Xenopus laevis</i> as a model, we document that zinc reversibly blocks fertilization. Finally, we demonstrate that extracellular zinc similarly disrupts early embryonic development in eggs from diverse phyla, including Cnidaria, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Our study reveals that a fundamental strategy protecting human eggs from fertilization by multiple sperm may have evolved more than 650 million years ago.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sYhQr72cKJU" width="1" />

The temporal association cortex is considered a primate specialization and is involved in complex behaviors, with some, such as language, particularly characteristic of humans. The emergence of these behaviors has been linked to major differences in temporal lobe white matter in humans compared with monkeys. It is unknown, however, how the organization of the temporal lobe differs across several anthropoid primates. Therefore, we systematically compared the organization of the major temporal lobe white matter tracts in the human, gorilla, and chimpanzee great apes and in the macaque monkey. We show that humans and great apes, in particular the chimpanzee, exhibit an expanded and more complex occipital–temporal white matter system; additionally, in humans, the invasion of dorsal tracts into the temporal lobe provides a further specialization. We demonstrate the reorganization of different tracts along the primate evolutionary tree, including distinctive connectivity of human temporal gray matter.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cbbjsGCW4V0" width="1" />

<p>The inflammatory immune response (IIR) is a physiological or excessive systemic response, induced by inflammatory immune cells according to changes in the internal and external environments. An excessive IIR is the pathological basis for the generation and development of neurological diseases. Ginkgolides are one of the important medicinal ingredients in Ginkgo biloba. Many studies have verified that ginkgolides have anti-platelet-activating, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, neurotrophic, and neuroimmunomodulatory effects. Inflammatory immunomodulation is mediated by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. They also inhibit the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-mediated signal transduction to attenuate the inflammatory response. Herein, we reviewed the studies on the roles of ginkgolides in inflammatory immunomodulation and suggested its potential role in novel treatments for neurological diseases.</p>

Objective<p>To investigate the impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related risk gene (ATP-binding cassette A7-ABCA7 and Clusterin-CLU) on the functional connectivity pattern of default mode network (DMN) in healthy middle-age adults.</p>Methods<p>A total of 147 healthy middle-aged volunteers were enrolled in this study. All subjects completed MRI scans, neuropsychological assessments, and AD-related genotyped analysis. All subjects were divided into high, middle and low risk groups according to the score of risk genotypes, which included CLU (rs11136000, rs2279590, rs9331888, and rs9331949) and ABCA7 (rs3764650 and rs4147929). The genetic effects of CLU, ABCA7, and CLU × ABCA7 on DMN functional connectivity pattern were further explored. Moreover, the genetic effect of Apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) was also considered. Finally, correlation analysis was performed between the signals of brain regions with genetic effect and neuropsychological test scores.</p>Results<p>Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group of CLU showed decreased functional connectivity in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the left middle frontal cortex (P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). As for the interaction between the CLU and ABCA7, all the subjects were divided into high, middle, and low risk group; the middle-risk group was divided into CLU and ABCA7-dominated middle-risk group. The function connectivity pattern of DMN among the three or four groups were distributed in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). When APOEε4 carriers were excluded, the CLU-predominant middle-risk group displayed the decreased functional connectivity in MPFC when compared with the low-risk group, while ABCA7-prodominant middle-risk group displayed decreased functional connectivity in cuneus when compared with the high-risk group (all P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). The z values of left middle frontal cortex were positively correlated with the scores of Serial Dotting Test (SDT) in high-risk group of CLU, while z values of MPFC and cuneus were positively correlated to the scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in low-risk group of three or four groups.</p>Conclusion<p>The functional connectivity of MPFC-PCC might be modulated by the interaction of CLU and ABCA7. Moreover, APOEε4 might be interacted with ABCA7 and CLU modulation in the middle-aged carriers.</p>

<p>Alternative splicing occurs in over 95% of protein-coding genes and contributes to the diversity of the human proteome. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) is a critical modulator of neuronal development and synaptic plasticity in the brain and is enriched in cassette exon splicing events, in which functional exons are excluded from the final transcript. These alternative splicing events affect apoER2 function, as individual apoER2 exons tend to encode distinct protein functional domains. Although several apoER2 splice variants have been characterized, much work remains to understand how apoER2 splicing events modulate distinct apoER2 activities, including ligand binding specificity, synapse formation and plasticity. Additionally, little is known about how apoER2 splicing events are regulated. Often, alternative splicing events are regulated through the combinatorial action of RNA-binding proteins and other epigenetic mechanisms, however, the regulatory pathways corresponding to each specific exon are unknown in most cases. In this mini-review, we describe the structure of apoER2, highlight the unique functions of known isoforms, discuss what is currently known about the regulation of apoER2 splicing by RNA-binding proteins and pose new questions that will further our understanding of apoER2 splicing complexity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00124">The P2X7 Receptor: Central Hub of Brain Diseases</a></h4>

<p>The P2X7 receptor is a cation channel activated by high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Upon long-term activation, it complexes with membrane proteins forming a wide pore that leads to cell death and increased release of ATP into the extracellular milieu. The P2X7 receptor is widely expressed in the CNS, such as frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and striatum, regions involved in neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. Despite P2X7 receptor functions in glial cells have been extensively studied, the existence and roles of this receptor in neurons are still controversially discussed. Regardless, P2X7 receptors mediate several processes observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and brain tumors, such as activation of neuroinflammatory response, stimulation of glutamate release and neuroplasticity impairment. Moreover, P2X7 receptor gene polymorphisms have been associated to depression, and isoforms of P2X7 receptors are implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases. In view of that, the P2X7 receptor has been proposed to be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in brain diseases. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying P2X7 receptor-mediated signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and brain tumors. In addition, it highlights the recent advances in the development of P2X7 receptor antagonists that are able of penetrating the central nervous system.</p>

Background<p>Despite the recent advances in the acute stroke care, treatment options for long-term disability are limited. RPh201 is a botany-derived bioactive compound that has been shown to exert beneficial effects in various experimental models of neural injury. The present study evaluated the effect of delayed RPh201 treatment on long term functional recovery after stroke.</p>Methods<p>Adult male Wistar rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomized into the following experimental groups (n = 20/group): (1) RPh201 treatment, and (2) Vehicle (cottonseed oil). RPh201 (20 μl) or Vehicle were subcutaneously administered twice a week for 16 consecutive weeks starting at 21 days after MCAO. An array of behavioral tests was performed up to120 days after MCAO.</p>Results<p>Ischemic rats treated with RPh201 exhibited significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement of neurological function measured by adhesive removal test, foot-fault test, and modified neurological severity score at 90 and 120 days after MCAO. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that RPh201 treatment robustly increased neurofilament heavy chain positive axons and myelin basic protein densities in the peri-infarct area by 61% and 31%, respectively, when compared to the Vehicle treatment, which were further confirmed by Western blot analysis. The RPh201 treatment did not reduce infarct volume.</p>Conclusion<p>Our data demonstrated that RPh201 has a therapeutic effect on improvement of functional recovery in male ischemic rats even when the treatment was initiated 21 days post stroke. Enhanced axonal and myelination densities by RPh201 in ischemic brain may contribute to improved stroke recovery.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00791">Will Sirtuins Be Promising Therapeutic Targets for TBI and Associated Neurodegenerative Diseases?</a></h4>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a leading cause of morbidity worldwide, induces mechanical, persistent structural, and metabolic abnormalities in neurons and other brain-resident cells. The key pathological features of TBI include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These pathological processes persist for a period of time after TBIs. Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases and mono-ADP-ribosyl transferases. The mammalian sirtuin family has seven members, referred to as Sirtuin (SIRT) 1–7. Accumulating evidence suggests that SIRT1 and SIRT3 play a neuroprotective role in TBI. Although the evidence is scant, considering the involvement of SIRT2, 4–7 in other brain injury models, they may also intervene in similar pathophysiology in TBI. Neurodegenerative diseases are generally accepted sequelae of TBI. It was found that TBI and neurodegenerative diseases have many similarities and overlaps in pathological features. Besides, sirtuins play some unique roles in some neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose that sirtuins might be a promising therapeutic target for both TBI and associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we review the neuroprotective effects of sirtuins on TBI as well as related neurodegeneration and discuss the therapeutic potential of sirtuin modulators.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, accounting for 60–70% of all dementias. AD is often under-diagnosed and recognized only at a later, more advanced stage, and this delay in diagnosis has been suggested as a contributing factor in the numerous unsuccessful AD treatment trials. Although there is no known cure for AD, early diagnosis is important for disease management and care. A hallmark of AD is the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ)-containing senile neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosporylated tau in the brain. However, current in vivo methods to quantify Aβ in the brain are invasive, requiring radioactive tracers and positron emission tomography. Toward development of alternative methods to assess AD progression, we focus on the retinal manifestation of AD pathology. The retina is an extension of the central nervous system uniquely accessible to light-based, non-invasive ophthalmic imaging. However, earlier studies in human retina indicate that the literature is divided on the presence of Aβ in the AD retina. To help resolve this disparity, this study assessed retinal tissues from neuropathologically confirmed AD cases to determine the regional distribution of Aβ in retinal wholemounts and to inform on future retinal image studies targeting Aβ. Concurrent post-mortem brain tissues were also collected. Neuropathological cortical assessments including neuritic plaque (NP) scores and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were correlated with retinal Aβ using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and quantitative image analysis. Aβ load was compared between AD and control (non-AD) eyes. Our results indicate that levels of intracellular and extracellular Aβ retinal deposits were significantly higher in AD than controls. Mid-peripheral Aβ levels were greater than central retina in both AD and control eyes. In AD retina, higher intracellular Aβ was associated with lower NP score, while higher extracellular Aβ was associated with higher CAA score. Our data support the feasibility of using the retinal tissue to assess ocular Aβ as a surrogate measure of Aβ in the brain of individuals with AD. Specifically, mid-peripheral retina possesses more Aβ deposition than central retina, and thus may be the optimal location for future in vivo ocular imaging.</p>

Purpose<p>The occurrence of mental fatigue when users stare at stimuli is a critical problem in the implementation of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based visual acuity assessment, which may weaken the SSVEP amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and subsequently affect the results of visual acuity assessment. This study aimed to explore the anti-fatigue performance of six stimulus paradigms (reverse vertical sinusoidal gratings, reverse horizontal sinusoidal gratings, reverse vertical square-wave gratings, brief-onset vertical sinusoidal gratings, reversal checkerboards, and oscillating expansion–contraction concentric rings) in SSVEP acuity assessment.</p>Methods<p>Based on four indices of α + θ index, pupil diameter, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and amplitude and SNR of SSVEPs, this study quantitatively evaluated mental fatigue in six SSVEP visual attention runs corresponding to six paradigms with 12 subjects.</p>Results<p>These indices of mental fatigue showed a good agreement. The results showed that the paradigm of motion expansion–contraction concentric rings had a superior anti-fatigue efficacy than the other five paradigms of conventional onset mode or pattern reversal mode during prolonged SSVEP experiment. The paradigm of brief-onset mode showed the lowest anti-fatigue efficacy, and the other paradigms of pattern reversal SSVEP paradigms showed a similar anti-fatigue efficacy, which was between motion expansion–contraction mode and onset mode.</p>Conclusion<p>This study recommended the paradigm of oscillating expansion–contraction concentric rings as the stimulation paradigm in SSVEP visual acuity because of its superior anti-fatigue efficacy.</p>

<p>The brain–computer interface (BCI) is a system that is designed to provide communication channels to anyone through a computer. Initially, it was suggested to help the disabled, but actually had been proposed a wider range of applications. However, the cross-subject recognition in BCI systems is difficult to break apart from the individual specific characteristics, unsteady characteristics, and environmental specific characteristics, which also makes it difficult to develop highly reliable and highly stable BCI systems. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is one of the most recent spellers with a clean, unified background and a single stimulus, which may evoke event-related potential (ERP) patterns with less individual difference. In order to build a BCI system that allows new users to use it directly without calibration or with less calibration time, RSVP was employed as evoked paradigm, then correlation analysis rank (CAR) algorithm was proposed to improve the cross-individual classification and simultaneously use as less training data as possible. Fifty-eight subjects took part in the experiments. The flash stimulation time is 200 ms, and the off time is 100 ms. The P300 component was locked to the target representation by time. The results showed that RSVP could evoke more similar ERP patterns among subjects compared with matrix paradigm. Then, the included angle cosine was calculated and counted for averaged ERP waveform between each two subjects. The average matching number of all subjects was 6 for the matrix paradigm, while for the RSVP paradigm, the average matching number range was 20 when the threshold value was set to 0.5, more than three times as much larger, quantificationally indicating that ERP waveforms evoked by the RSVP paradigm produced smaller individual differences, and it is more favorable for cross-subject classification. Information transfer rates (ITR) were also calculated for RSVP and matrix paradigms, and the RSVP paradigm got the average ITR of 43.18 bits/min, which was 13% higher than the matrix paradigm. Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value was computed and compared using the proposed CAR algorithm and traditional random selection. The results showed that the proposed CAR got significantly better performance than the traditional random selection and got the best AUC value of 0.8, while the traditional random selection only achieved 0.65. These encouraging results suggest that with proper evoked paradigm and classification methods, it is feasible to get stable performance across subjects for ERP-based BCI. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to improve BCI performances.</p>

<p>Previous research investigating handle-response compatibility effects with graspable objects used different categories of objects as stimuli, regardless of their specific, intrinsic characteristics. The current study explores whether different types of objects’ characteristics may elicit different types of spatial compatibility, that is, handle-response and response-effect compatibility as well as their potential interaction. In Experiment 1, objects having a graspable handle opposite to either a visible functional component (i.e., handle-function objects: a teapot) or a latent functional component (handle-only objects: a pitcher lacking the spout) were presented separately in different blocks. Both the handle and the goal-directed functional components of these objects were located on the horizontal axis. In Experiment 2, handle-only objects had a handle located on the horizontal axis and a latent functional component located on the vertical axis (e.g., a cup). In both experiments, participants were required to judge the material (plastic and metal) the object was made of. Results showed that the handle-response compatibility effect was sensitive to whether the actions consequences of object manipulation took place on the horizontal rather than on the vertical axis.</p>

<p>The brain shows a complex multiscale organization that prevents a direct understanding of how structure, function and dynamics are correlated. To date, advances in neural modeling offer a unique opportunity for simulating global brain dynamics by embedding empirical data on different scales in a mathematical framework. The Virtual Brain (TVB) is an advanced data-driven model allowing to simulate brain dynamics starting from individual subjects’ structural and functional connectivity obtained, for example, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of TVB has been limited so far to cerebral connectivity but here, for the first time, we have introduced cerebellar nodes and interconnecting tracts to demonstrate the impact of cerebro-cerebellar loops on brain dynamics. Indeed, the matching between the empirical and simulated functional connectome was significantly improved when including the cerebro-cerebellar loops. This positive result should be considered as a first step, since issues remain open about the best strategy to reconstruct effective structural connectivity and the nature of the neural mass or mean-field models generating local activity in the nodes. For example, signal processing is known to differ remarkably between cortical and cerebellar microcircuits. Tackling these challenges is expected to further improve the predictive power of functional brain activity simulations, using TVB or other similar tools, in explaining not just global brain dynamics but also the role of cerebellum in determining brain states in physiological conditions and in the numerous pathologies affecting the cerebro-cerebellar loops.</p>

<p>Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and the central nervous system (CNS) also participates in the pathogenesis of asthma. We previously reported the amygdala might regulate asthmatic attacks via projecting to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN). The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a crucial region that modulates respiratory. This study aimed to observe the activity in both PVN and DVC and the connection between PVN and DVC in asthmatic rats. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to observe the changes in Fos and oxytocin (OT) expression. Retrograde tracing using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and double immunohistochemistry for OT and Fos was used to observe the HRP/OT/Fos positive neurons distribution in the PVN. The results showed that during an asthma attack, the Fos positive neurons increased in both PVN and DVC over time. The expression of OT positive neurons in PVN showed a similar trend in parallel to the c-Fos positive neurons in PVN. The HRP retrograde-labeled neurons were densely distributed in the medial and lateral subnucleus in the PVN. OT<sup>+</sup>/HRP<sup>+</sup> and Fos<sup>+</sup>/OT<sup>+</sup>/HRP<sup>+</sup> accounted for 18.14%, and 2.37% of HRP-labeled neurons, respectively. Our study showed PVN and DVC were activated and the expression of OT positive neurons in PVN were increased over time during an asthma attack. The existence of connection between PVN and DVC suggested the OT neurons in PVN might project to DVC which might be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that freezing of gait (FOG) is a unique gait disturbance in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and its pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the clinical and oculomotor associations with FOG in Chinese PD patients. From Jan 2017 to Dec 2019, a total of 210 PD patients were consecutively registered for FOG evaluation based on item-3 of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ). We explored the demographic, motor, and non-motor symptom differences in FOG positive (PD+FOG, n = 45) vs. negative (PD-FOG, n = 165) group. In addition, 40 PD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) also underwent oculomotor test via videonystagmography (VNG). Visually guided saccade (VGS) latency, saccade accuracy and gain in smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) at three frequencies of horizontal axis were compared among PD+FOG (n = 20), PD-FOG (n = 20), and HC (n = 37). Compared with PD-FOG, PD+FOG had longer disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, lower cognitive scores, more severe depressive and autonomic impairments, as well as higher daily levodopa equivalent dosage. FOG occurred more frequently in patients with wearing-off. VNG subgroup analysis demonstrated that PD+FOG had prolonged saccade latency and decreased saccade accuracy relative to PD-FOG or HC. SPEM gain at 0.1 and 0.2 Hz was also decreased in PD+FOG compared with HC. Furthermore, prolonged saccade latency was correlated with higher FOGQ scores in PD patients. Our results verify that PD with FOG patients suffer from more severe motor and non-motor symptoms, indicating more extensive neurodegeneration. Prolonged saccade latency could be a practical oculomotor parameter both for identification and progression of FOG in PD.</p>

<p>by Rafael D’Andrea, Theo Gibbs, James P. O’Dwyer</p>

Neutral theory assumes all species and individuals in a community are ecologically equivalent. This controversial hypothesis has been tested across many taxonomic groups and environmental contexts, and successfully predicts species abundance distributions across multiple high-diversity communities. However, it has been critiqued for its failure to predict a broader range of community properties, particularly regarding community dynamics from generational to geological timescales. Moreover, it is unclear whether neutrality can ever be a true description of a community given the ubiquity of interspecific differences, which presumably lead to ecological inequivalences. Here we derive analytical predictions for when and why non-neutral communities of consumers and resources may present neutral-like outcomes, which we verify using numerical simulations. Our results, which span both static and dynamical community properties, demonstrate the limitations of summarizing distributions to detect non-neutrality, and provide a potential explanation for the successes of neutral theory as a description of macroecological pattern.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_7VQxYo9Oqg" width="1" />

<p>by Ian F. Coccimiglio, David C. Clarke</p>

Exercise training elicits profound metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle cells. A key molecule in coordinating these adaptations is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whose activity increases in response to cellular energy demand. AMPK activity dynamics are primarily controlled by the adenine nucleotides ADP and AMP, but how each contributes to its control in skeletal muscle during exercise is unclear. We developed and validated a mathematical model of AMPK signaling dynamics, and then applied global parameter sensitivity analyses with data-informed constraints to predict that AMPK activity dynamics are determined principally by ADP and not AMP. We then used the model to predict the effects of two additional direct-binding activators of AMPK, ZMP and Compound 991, further validating the model and demonstrating its applicability to understanding AMPK pharmacology. The relative effects of direct-binding activators can be understood in terms of four properties, namely their concentrations, binding affinities for AMPK, abilities to enhance AMPK phosphorylation, and the magnitudes of their allosteric activation of AMPK. Despite AMP’s favorable values in three of these four properties, ADP is the dominant controller of AMPK activity dynamics in skeletal muscle during exercise by virtue of its higher concentration compared to that of AMP.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YsGRQ_l22zc" width="1" />

<p>by Huu Hoang, Eric J. Lang, Yoshito Hirata, Isao T. Tokuda, Kazuyuki Aihara, Keisuke Toyama, Mitsuo Kawato, Nicolas Schweighofer</p>

We previously proposed, on theoretical grounds, that the cerebellum must regulate the dimensionality of its neuronal activity during motor learning and control to cope with the low firing frequency of inferior olive neurons, which form one of two major inputs to the cerebellar cortex. Such dimensionality regulation is possible via modulation of electrical coupling through the gap junctions between inferior olive neurons by inhibitory GABAergic synapses. In addition, we previously showed in simulations that intermediate coupling strengths induce chaotic firing of inferior olive neurons and increase their information carrying capacity. However, there is no <i>in vivo</i> experimental data supporting these two theoretical predictions. Here, we computed the levels of synchrony, dimensionality, and chaos of the inferior olive code by analyzing <i>in vivo</i> recordings of Purkinje cell complex spike activity in three different coupling conditions: carbenoxolone (gap junctions blocker), control, and picrotoxin (GABA-A receptor antagonist). To examine the effect of electrical coupling on dimensionality and chaotic dynamics, we first determined the physiological range of effective coupling strengths between inferior olive neurons in the three conditions using a combination of a biophysical network model of the inferior olive and a novel Bayesian model averaging approach. We found that effective coupling co-varied with synchrony and was inversely related to the dimensionality of inferior olive firing dynamics, as measured via a principal component analysis of the spike trains in each condition. Furthermore, for both the model and the data, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between coupling strengths and complexity entropy, a measure of chaos for spiking neural data. These results are consistent with our hypothesis according to which electrical coupling regulates the dimensionality and the complexity in the inferior olive neurons in order to optimize both motor learning and control of high dimensional motor systems by the cerebellum.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ISLNhcmuOB8" width="1" />

<p>by Edward C. Schrom II, Simon A. Levin, Andrea L. Graham</p>

In the animal kingdom, various forms of swarming enable groups of autonomous individuals to transform uncertain information into unified decisions which are probabilistically beneficial. Crossing scales from individual to group decisions requires dynamically accumulating signals among individuals. In striking parallel, the mammalian immune system is also a group of decentralized autonomous units (i.e. cells) which collectively navigate uncertainty with the help of dynamically accumulating signals (i.e. cytokines). Therefore, we apply techniques of understanding swarm behavior to a decision-making problem in the mammalian immune system, namely effector choice among CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. We find that incorporating dynamic cytokine signaling into a simple model of Th differentiation comprehensively explains divergent observations of this process. The plasticity and heterogeneity of individual Th cells, the tunable mixtures of effector types that can be generated <i>in vitro</i>, and the polarized yet updateable group effector commitment often observed <i>in vivo</i> are all explained by the same set of underlying molecular rules. These rules reveal that Th cells harness dynamic cytokine signaling to implement a system of quorum sensing. Quorum sensing, in turn, may confer adaptive advantages on the mammalian immune system, especially during coinfection and during coevolution with manipulative parasites. This highlights a new way of understanding the mammalian immune system as a cellular swarm, and it underscores the power of collectives throughout nature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ceLFKZWz0xM" width="1" />

Epigenetic dynamics, such as DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, have been extensively explored in human preimplantation embryos. However, the active demethylation process during this crucial period remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use single-cell chemical-labeling-enabled C-to-T conversion sequencing (CLEVER-seq) to quantify the DNA 5-formylcytosine (5fC) levels of human preimplantation embryos. We find that 5-formylcytosine phosphate guanine (5fCpG) exhibits genomic element-specific distribution features and is enriched in L1 and endogenous retrovirus-K (ERVK), the subfamilies of repeat elements long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeats (LTRs), respectively. Unlike in mice, paired pronuclei in the same zygote present variable difference of 5fCpG levels, although the male pronuclei experience stronger global demethylation. The nucleosome-occupied regions show a higher 5fCpG level compared with nucleosome-depleted ones, suggesting the role of 5fC in organizing nucleosome position. Collectively, our work offers a valuable resource for ten-eleven translocation protein family (TET)-dependent active demethylation-related study during human early embryonic development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pPNXRIlZ2wM" width="1" />

<p>by Harrison Steel, Robert Habgood, Ciarán Kelly, Antonis Papachristodoulou</p>

The precision and repeatability of in vivo biological studies is predicated upon methods for isolating a targeted subsystem from external sources of noise and variability. However, in many experimental frameworks, this is made challenging by nonstatic environments during host cell growth, as well as variability introduced by manual sampling and measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we developed Chi.Bio, a parallelised open-source platform that represents a new experimental paradigm in which all measurement and control actions can be applied to a bulk culture in situ. In addition to continuous-culturing capabilities, it incorporates tunable light outputs, spectrometry, and advanced automation features. We demonstrate its application to studies of cell growth and biofilm formation, automated in silico control of optogenetic systems, and readout of multiple orthogonal fluorescent proteins in situ. By integrating precise measurement and actuation hardware into a single low-cost platform, Chi.Bio facilitates novel experimental methods for synthetic, systems, and evolutionary biology and broadens access to cutting-edge research capabilities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4MGotWIcqu0" width="1" />

Virus proliferation involves gene replication inside infected cells and transmission to new target cells. Once positive-strand RNA virus has infected a cell, the viral genome serves as a template for copying (“stay-strategy”) or is packaged into a progeny virion that will be released extracellularly (“leave-strategy”). The balance between genome replication and virion release determines virus production and transmission efficacy. The ensuing trade-off has not yet been well characterized. In this study, we use hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model system to study the balance of the two strategies. Combining viral infection cell culture assays with mathematical modeling, we characterize the dynamics of two different HCV strains (JFH-1, a clinical isolate, and Jc1-n, a laboratory strain), which have different viral release characteristics. We found that 0.63% and 1.70% of JFH-1 and Jc1-n intracellular viral RNAs, respectively, are used for producing and releasing progeny virions. Analysis of the Malthusian parameter of the HCV genome (i.e., initial proliferation rate) and the number of de novo infections (i.e., initial transmissibility) suggests that the leave-strategy provides a higher level of initial transmission for Jc1-n, whereas, in contrast, the stay-strategy provides a higher initial proliferation rate for JFH-1. Thus, theoretical-experimental analysis of viral dynamics enables us to better understand the proliferation strategies of viruses, which contributes to the efficient control of virus transmission. Ours is the first study to analyze the stay-leave trade-off during the viral life cycle and the significance of the replication-release switching mechanism for viral proliferation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/br8qW96G6AI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) modulates synaptic activity and is widely distributed in brain areas such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum, among others. CB1R is involved in processes such as memory, learning, motor coordination, and mood. Genetic deletion of CB1R causes behavioral alterations. In this work, we evaluated neuronal morphology and synaptic structure in the hippocampus of adult male CB1R knockout mice (CB1R<sup>−/−</sup>). Morphological changes in the CB1R<sup>−/−</sup> hippocampus evidenced a decrease in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins neurofilaments 160 KDa, neurofilaments 200 KDa, and microtubule‐associated protein 2. CA1 neurons showed decreased arborization and changes in synaptic structure such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels. Results obtained in the present work provide evidence of the participation of CB1R in the establishment of neuronal structure and networks that could have an important role in neuronal plasticity. In addition, these changes observed in CB1R<sup>−/−</sup> could be correlated with behavioral alterations reported.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare genetic disorder leading to degenerative processes. So far, no effective treatment has been found. Therefore, it is important to assist the development of medication with imaging biomarkers reflecting disease status and progress. Ten FRDA patients (mean age 37 ± 14 years; four female) and 10 age‐ and sex‐matched controls were included. Acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for quantitative susceptibility mapping, <i>R </i>
<sub>1</sub>, <i>R </i>
<sub>2</sub> relaxometry and diffusion imaging was performed at 7 Tesla. Results of volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses of the quantitative data were compared with a voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) evaluation. Differences between patients and controls were assessed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.01) with age and sex as covariates, effect size of group differences, and correlations with disease characteristics with Spearman correlation coefficient. For the VBM analysis, a statistical threshold of 0.001 for uncorrected and 0.05 for corrected <i>p</i>‐values was used. Statistically significant differences between FRDA patients and controls were found in five out of twelve investigated structures, and statistically significant correlations with disease characteristics were revealed. Moreover, VBM revealed significant white matter atrophy within regions of the brainstem, and the cerebellum. These regions overlapped partially with brain regions for which significant differences between healthy controls and patients were found in the VOI‐based quantitative MRI evaluation. It was shown that two independent analyses provided overlapping results. Moreover, positive results on correlations with disease characteristics were found, indicating that these quantitative MRI parameters could provide more detailed information and assist the search for effective treatments.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists produce robust analgesia with minimal abuse liability and are considered promising pharmacological agents to manage chronic pain and itch. The KOR system is also notable for robust differences between the sexes, with females exhibiting lower analgesic response than males. Sexually dimorphic traits can be due to either the influence of gonadal hormones during development or adulthood, or due to the complement of genes expressed on the X or Y chromosome. Previous studies examining sex differences in KOR antinociception have relied on surgical or pharmacological manipulation of the gonads to determine whether sex hormones influence KOR function. While there are conflicting reports whether gonadal hormones influence KOR function, no study has examined these effects in context with sex chromosomes. Here, we use two genetic mouse models, the four core genotypes and XY*, to isolate the chromosomal and hormonal contributions to sex differences in KOR analgesia. Mice were treated with systemic KOR agonist (U50,488H) and thermal analgesia measured in the tail withdrawal assay. We found that KOR antinociception was influenced predominantly by the number of the X chromosomes. These data suggest that the dose and/or parental imprint on X gene(s) contribute significantly to the sexually dimorphism in KOR analgesia.</p>

<p>In functional MRI (fMRI), population receptive field (pRF) models allow a quantitative description of the response as a function of the features of the stimuli that are relevant for each voxel. The most popular pRF model used in fMRI assumes a Gaussian shape in the features space (e.g., the visual field) reducing the description of the voxel’s pRF to the Gaussian mean (the pRF preferred feature) and standard deviation (the pRF size). The estimation of the pRF mean has been proven to be highly reliable. However, the estimate of the pRF size has been shown not to be consistent within and between subjects. While this issue has been noted experimentally, here we use an optimization theory perspective to describe how the inconsistency in estimating the pRF size is linked to an inherent property of the Gaussian pRF model. When fitting such models, the goodness of fit is less sensitive to variations in the pRF size than to variations in the pRF mean. We also show how the same issue can be considered from a bias-variance perspective. We compare different estimation procedures in terms of the reliability of their estimates using simulated and real fMRI data in the visual (using the Human Connectome Project database) and auditory domain. We show that, the reliability of the estimate of the pRF size can be improved considering a linear combination of those pRF models with similar goodness of fit or a permutation based approach. This increase in reliability of the pRF size estimate does not affect the reliability of the estimate of the pRF mean and the prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>In vivo positron emission tomography of neuroinflammation has mainly focused on the evaluation of glial cell activation using radiolabeled ligands. However, the non-invasive imaging of neuroinflammatory cell proliferation has been scarcely evaluated so far. In vivo and ex vivo assessment of gliogenesis after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats was carried out using PET imaging with the marker of cell proliferation 3′-Deoxy-3′-[18F] fluorothymidine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FLT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence immunohistochemistry. MRI-T<sub>2</sub>W studies showed the presence of the brain infarction at 24 h after MCAO affecting cerebral cortex and striatum. In vivo PET imaging showed a significant increase in [<sup>18</sup>F]FLT uptake in the ischemic territory at day 7 followed by a progressive decline from day 14 to day 28 after ischemia onset. In addition, immunohistochemistry studies using Ki67, CD11b, and GFAP to evaluate proliferation of microglia and astrocytes confirmed the PET findings showing the increase of glial proliferation at day 7 after ischemia followed by decrease later on. Hence, these results show that [<sup>18</sup>F]FLT provides accurate quantitative information on the time course of glial proliferation in experimental stroke. Finally, this novel brain imaging method might guide on the imaging evaluation of the role of gliogenesis after stroke.</p>

<p>Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in athletes can cause persistent symptoms, known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), and repeated injuries may increase the long-term risk for an athlete to develop neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Center for Disease Control estimates that up to 3.8 million sport-related mTBI are reported each year in the United States. Despite the magnitude of the phenomenon, there is a current lack of comprehensive prognostic indicators and research has shown that available monitoring tools are moderately sensitive to short-term concussion effects but less sensitive to long-term consequences. The overall aim of this review is to discuss novel, quantitative, and objective measurements that can predict long-term outcomes following repeated sports-related mTBIs. The specific objectives were (1) to provide an overview of the current clinical and biomechanical tools available to health practitioners to ensure recovery after mTBIs, (2) to synthesize potential biological mechanisms in animal models underlying the long-term adverse consequences of mTBIs, (3) to discuss the possible link between repeated mTBI and neurodegenerative diseases, and (4) to discuss the current knowledge about fluid biomarkers for mTBIs with a focus on novel exosomal biomarkers. The conclusions from this review are that current post-concussion clinical tests are not sufficiently sensitive to injury and do not accurately quantify post-concussion alterations associated with repeated mTBIs. In the current review, it is proposed that current practices should be amended to include a repeated symptom inventory, a cognitive assessment of executive function and impulse control, an instrumented assessment of balance, vestibulo-ocular assessments, and an improved panel of blood or exosome biomarkers.</p>

<p>Resting-state Arterial Spin Labeling (rs-ASL) is a rather confidential method compared to resting-state BOLD. As ASL allows to quantify the cerebral blood flow, unlike BOLD, rs-ASL can lead to significant clinical subject-scaled applications. Despite directly impacting clinical practicability and functional networks estimation, there is no standard for rs-ASL regarding the acquisition duration. Our work here focuses on assessing the feasibility of ASL as an rs-fMRI method and on studying the effect of the acquisition duration on the estimation of functional networks. To this end, we acquired a long 24 min 30 s rs-ASL sequence and investigated how estimations of six typical functional brain networks evolved with respect to the acquisition duration. Our results show that, after a certain acquisition duration, the estimations of all functional networks reach their best and are stabilized. Since, for clinical application, the acquisition duration should be the shortest possible, we suggest an acquisition duration of 14 min, i.e., 240 volumes with our sequence parameters, as it covers the functional networks estimation stabilization.</p>

<p>Cooperation and competition are two ways of social interaction keys to life in society. Recent EEG-based hyperscanning studies reveal that cooperative and competitive interactions induce an increase in interbrain coupling. However, whether this interbrain coupling effect is just a reflection of inter-subject motor coordination or can also signal the type of social interaction is unknown. Here, we show that behavioral coordination and social interaction type can be distinguished according to the frequency of oscillation in which the brains are coupled. We use EEG to simultaneously measure the brain activity of pairs of subjects, while they were performing a visual cue-target task in a cooperative and competitive manner. Behavioral responses were quasi-simultaneous between subject pairs for both competitive and cooperative conditions, with faster average response times for the competitive condition. Concerning brain activity, we found increased interbrain coupling in theta band (3–7 Hz) during cooperation and competition, with stronger coupling during competitive interactions. This increase of interbrain theta coupling correlated with a decrease in reaction times of the dyads. Interestingly, we also found an increase in brain-to-brain coupling in gamma band (38–42 Hz) only during cooperative interactions. Unlike the theta coupling effect, the gamma interbrain coupling did not correlate with dyads’ reaction times. Taken together, these results suggest that theta interbrain coupling could be linked to motor coordination processes common to cooperative and competitive interactions, while gamma brain-to-brain coupling emerges as an electrophysiological marker of shared intentionality during cooperative interactions.</p>

The current study used within-subject pseudorandom design for backgrounds to improve EMERT to PREMERT (pseudorandom EMERT) and used eyes-closed and eyes-open resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect relevant brain activity of PREMERT for the first time. The results showed (1) two new recapitulative indexes of PREMERT were adopted, such as microexpression M and microexpression SD. Using pseudorandom design, the participants could effectively identify almost all the microexpressions, and each microexpression type had significant background effect. The PREMERT had good split-half reliability, parallel-forms reliability, criterion validity, and ecological validity. Therefore, it could stably and efficiently detect the participants’ microexpression recognition abilities. Because of its pseudorandom design, all participants did the same test; their scores could be compared with each other. (2) amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF; 0.01–0.1 Hz) in both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting states and ALFF difference could predict microexpression M, and the ALFF difference was less predictive. The relevant resting-state brain areas of microexpression M were some frontal lobes, insula, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, parietal lobe, caudate nucleus, precuneus, thalamus, putamen, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. (3) ALFFs in both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting states and ALFF difference could predict microexpression SD, and the ALFF difference was more predictive. The relevant resting-state brain areas of microexpression SD were some frontal lobes, central anterior gyrus, supplementary motor area, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, cuneus, occipital lobe, fusiform gyrus, parietal lobe, caudate nucleus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. (4) There were many similar relevant resting-state brain areas, such as brain areas of expression recognition, microexpressions consciousness and attention, and the change from expression backgrounds to microexpression, and some different relevant resting-state brain areas, such as precuneus, insula, and pallidum, between microexpression M and SD. The ALFF difference was more sensitive to PREMERT fluctuations.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00175">Truncated Tau Induces Mitochondrial Transport Failure Through the Impairment of TRAK2 Protein and Bioenergetics Decline in Neuronal Cells</a></h4>

<p>Mitochondria are highly specialized organelles essential for the synapse, and their impairment contributes to the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previously, we studied the role of caspase-3–cleaved tau in mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. In neurons, the presence of this AD-relevant tau form induced mitochondrial fragmentation with a concomitant reduction in the expression of Opa1, a mitochondrial fission regulator. More importantly, we showed that caspase-cleaved tau affects mitochondrial transport, decreasing the number of moving mitochondria in the neuronal processes without affecting their velocity rate. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these events are unknown. We studied the possible role of motor proteins (kinesin 1 and dynein) and mitochondrial protein adaptors (RhoT1/T2, syntaphilin, and TRAK2) in the mitochondrial transport failure induced by caspase-cleaved tau. We expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP), GFP-full-length, and GPF-caspase-3–cleaved tau proteins in rat hippocampal neurons and immortalized cortical neurons (CN 1.4) and analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins involved in mitochondrial transport regulation. We observed that hippocampal neurons expressing caspase-cleaved tau showed a significant accumulation of a mitochondrial population in the soma. These changes were accompanied by evident mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits, including depolarization, oxidative stress, and a significant reduction in ATP production. More critically, caspase-cleaved tau significantly decreased the expression of TRAK2 in immortalized and primary hippocampal neurons without affecting RhoT1/T2 and syntaphilin levels. Also, when we analyzed the expression of motor proteins—Kinesin 1 (KIF5) and Dynein—we did not detect changes in their expression, localization, and binding to the mitochondria. Interestingly, the expression of truncated tau significantly increases the association of TRAK2 with mitochondria compared with neuronal cells expressing full-length tau. Altogether these results indicate that caspase-cleaved tau may affect mitochondrial transport through the increase of TRAK2–mitochondria binding and reduction of ATP production available for the process of movement of these organelles. These observations are novel and represent a set of exciting findings whereby tau pathology could affect mitochondrial distribution in neurons, an event that may contribute to synaptic failure observed in AD.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are commonly identified by their expression of the intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). GFAP-immunoreactive (GFAP-IR) astrocytes exhibit regional heterogeneity in density and morphology in the mouse brain as well as morphological diversity in the human cortex. However, regional variations in astrocyte distribution and morphology remain to be assessed comprehensively. This was the overarching objective of this postmortem study, which mainly exploited the immunolabeling of vimentin (VIM), an intermediate filament protein expressed by astrocytes and endothelial cells which presents the advantage of more extensively labeling cell structures. We compared the densities of vimentin-immunoreactive (VIM-IR) and GFAP-IR astrocytes in various brain regions (prefrontal and primary visual cortex, caudate nucleus, mediodorsal thalamus) from male individuals having died suddenly in the absence of neurological or psychiatric conditions. The morphometric properties of VIM-IR in these brain regions were also assessed. We found that VIM-IR astrocytes generally express the canonical astrocytic markers Aldh1L1 and GFAP but that VIM-IR astrocytes are less abundant than GFAP-IR astrocytes in all human brain regions, particularly in the thalamus, where VIM-IR cells were nearly absent. About 20% of all VIM-IR astrocytes presented a twin cell morphology, a phenomenon rarely observed for GFAP-IR astrocytes. Furthermore VIM-IR astrocytes in the striatum were often seen to extend numerous parallel processes which seemed to give rise to large VIM-IR fiber bundles projecting over long distances. Moreover, morphometric analyses revealed that VIM-IR astrocytes were more complex than their mouse counterparts in functionally homologous brain regions, as has been previously reported for GFAP-IR astrocytes. Lastly, the density of GFAP-IR astrocytes in gray and white matter were inversely correlated with vascular density, but for VIM-IR astrocytes this was only the case in gray matter, suggesting that gliovascular interactions may especially influence the regional heterogeneity of GFAP-IR astrocytes. Taken together, these findings reveal special features displayed uniquely by human VIM-IR astrocytes and illustrate that astrocytes display important region- and marker-specific differences in the healthy human brain.</p>

<p>Graphical, voxel, and region-based analysis has become a popular approach to studying neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its prodromal stage [mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]. These methods have been used previously for classification or discrimination of AD in subjects in a prodromal stage called stable MCI (MCIs), which does not convert to AD but remains stable over a period of time, and converting MCI (MCIc), which converts to AD, but the results reported across similar studies are often inconsistent. Furthermore, the classification accuracy for MCIs vs. MCIc is limited. In this study, we propose combining different neuroimaging modalities (sMRI, FDG-PET, AV45-PET, DTI, and rs-fMRI) with the apolipoprotein-E genotype to form a multimodal system for the discrimination of AD, and to increase the classification accuracy. Initially, we used two well-known analyses to extract features from each neuroimage for the discrimination of AD: whole-brain parcelation analysis (or region-based analysis), and voxel-wise analysis (or voxel-based morphometry). We also investigated graphical analysis (nodal and group) for all six binary classification groups (AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs). Data for a total of 129 subjects (33 AD, 30 MCIs, 31 MCIc, and 35 HCs) for each imaging modality were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage. These data also include two APOE genotype data points for the subjects. Moreover, we used the 2-mm AICHA atlas with the NiftyReg registration toolbox to extract 384 brain regions from each PET (FDG and AV45) and sMRI image. For the rs-fMRI images, we used the DPARSF toolbox in MATLAB for the automatic extraction of data and the results for REHO, ALFF, and fALFF. We also used the pyClusterROI script for the automatic parcelation of each rs-fMRI image into 200 brain regions. For the DTI images, we used the FSL (Version 6.0) toolbox for the extraction of fractional anisotropy (FA) images to calculate a tract-based spatial statistic. Moreover, we used the PANDA toolbox to obtain 50 white-matter-region-parcellated FA images on the basis of the 2-mm JHU-ICBM-labeled template atlas. To integrate the different modalities and different complementary information into one form, and to optimize the classifier, we used the multiple kernel learning (MKL) framework. The obtained results indicated that our multimodal approach yields a significant improvement in accuracy over any single modality alone. The areas under the curve obtained by the proposed method were 97.78, 96.94, 95.56, 96.25, 96.67, and 96.59% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs binary classification, respectively. Our proposed multimodal method improved the classification result for MCIs vs. MCIc groups compared with the unimodal classification results. Our study found that the (left/right) precentral region was present in all six binary classification groups (this region can be considered the most significant region). Furthermore, using nodal network topology, we found that FDG, AV45-PET, and rs-fMRI were the most important neuroimages, and showed many affected regions relative to other modalities. We also compared our results with recently published results.</p>

<p>The importance of early interventions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) emphasizes the need to accurately and efficiently identify at-risk individuals. Although many dementia prediction models have been developed, there are fewer studies focusing on detection of brain pathology. We developed a model for identification of amyloid-PET positivity using data on demographics, vascular factors, cognition, APOE genotype, and structural MRI, including regional brain volumes, cortical thickness and a visual medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) rating. We also analyzed the relative importance of different factors when added to the overall model. The model used baseline data from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) exploratory PET sub-study. Participants were at risk for dementia, but without dementia or cognitive impairment. Their mean age was 71 years. Participants underwent a brain 3T MRI and PiB-PET imaging. PiB images were visually determined as positive or negative. Cognition was measured using a modified version of the Neuropsychological Test Battery. Body mass index (BMI) and hypertension were used as cardiovascular risk factors in the model. Demographic factors included age, gender and years of education. The model was built using the Disease State Index (DSI) machine learning algorithm. Of the 48 participants, 20 (42%) were rated as Aβ positive. Compared with the Aβ negative group, the Aβ positive group had a higher proportion of APOE ε4 carriers (53 vs. 14%), lower executive functioning, lower brain volumes, and higher visual MTA rating. AUC [95% CI] for the complete model was 0.78 [0.65–0.91]. MRI was the most effective factor, especially brain volumes and visual MTA rating but not cortical thickness. APOE was nearly as effective as MRI in improving detection of amyloid positivity. The model with the best performance (AUC 0.82 [0.71–0.93]) was achieved by combining APOE and MRI. Our findings suggest that combining demographic data, vascular risk factors, cognitive performance, APOE genotype, and brain MRI measures can help identify Aβ positivity. Detecting amyloid positivity could reduce invasive and costly assessments during the screening process in clinical trials.</p>

Agarwal et al. show that the post-translational modification of SUMO-conjugation of proteins (SUMOylation) in pain-sensing neurons regulates sensory ion channels and metabolic enzymes governing energy production. Reduced SUMOylation in diabetes leads to metabolic arrest and accumulation of toxic metabolites, driving neuropathy and sensory loss. Enhancing SUMOylation may reverse diabetic neuropathy.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Poor sociability and aggressive behavior are key clinical features of opioid use disorders. The corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) system may mediate behavioral effects of substances of abuse <i>but </i> its implication in substance‐induced social behavior deficits and outward‐directed hostility remains largely unknown. CRF signaling is mediated by two receptor types, termed CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>. The present study aimed at understanding the role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social and aggressive behavior induced by withdrawal from repeated opiate administration. Thus, wild‐type (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+), CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−), and null mutant (CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−) female and male mice were treated with saline or escalating doses of morphine (20‐100 mg/kg, i.p.) during six consecutive days and tested in the three‐chamber task for sociability (i.e., preference for an unfamiliar same‐sex conspecific vs. an object) 7 days after the last administration. Moreover, aggressive biting behavior toward the unfamiliar conspecific was assessed during the three‐chamber test. Opiate withdrawal disrupted sociability in CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+ and CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−, <i>but not </i> in CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, female mice, without affecting aggressive biting behavior in any genotype. In contrast, opiate withdrawal did not affect sociability <i>but </i> increased aggressive biting behavior in male mice, independently of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor‐deficiency. Nevertheless, in opiate‐withdrawn CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+, <i>but not </i> CRF<sub>1</sub>+/− and CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, male mice, sociability directly correlated with aggressive biting behavior, suggesting a role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in hostility‐linked social approach. These findings demonstrate the implication of the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social behavior deficits associated with repeated opiate administration and withdrawal, revealing a new potential target for the treatment of opioid use disorders.</p>

<p>cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was evaluated for its role in physical activity motivation of wild‐type (WT) and low voluntary wheel‐running (LVR) rats. Elevated CREB activity has been associated with reward deficits and was found to be higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of LVR rats. Reducing NAc activity through Gi‐DREADDs, pharmacology (C646/SR11302), and environmental enrichment increased LVR wheel‐running behavior. These findings highlight a potential molecular pathway important for the motivation to be physically active.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Given the integral role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity in motivational processes, the goal of the current study was to determine whether blunting chronic NAc CREB activity could rescue the low physical activity motivation of female, low voluntary running (LVR) rats. NAc CREB phosphorylation is elevated in these rats, a state previously attributed to deficits in reward valuation. It was recently shown that overexpression of the upstream CREB inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor alpha (PKIα), increased LVR nightly running by ~threefold. Therefore, the current study addresses the extent to which NAc CREB attenuation influences female LVR and wild‐type (WT) wheel‐running behavior. Inducible reductions in NAc neuronal activity using Gi‐coupled hM4Di DREADDs increased running behavior in LVR, but not in WT, rats. Similarly, site‐directed pharmacological inhibition of NAc CREB activity significantly increased LVR nightly running distance and time by ~twofold, with no effect in WT rats. Finally, environmentally enriched LVR rats exhibit higher levels of running compared to socially isolated rats in what appeared to be a CREB‐related manner. Considering the positive outcomes of upstream CREB modulation and environmental enrichment on LVR behavior, we believe that blunting NAc CREB activity has the neuromolecular potential to partially reverse low physical activity motivation, as exemplified by the LVR model. The positive physical activity outcome of early life enrichment adds translatable value to human childhood enrichment and highlights its importance on motivational processes later in life.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) could reflect the status of endothelial cells (ECs) which are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). MiR‐155 could regulate EC functions. However, their roles in IS remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs carrying miRNA‐155 (EMVs‐miR‐155) in IS patients to explore their potential roles as biomarkers. Ninety‐three IS patients and 70 controls were recruited in this study. The levels of circulating EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were detected by fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative real‐time PCR, respectively. The correlations between level of EMVs/EMVs‐miR‐155 and the onset time, severity, infarct volume, and subtypes of IS were analyzed. The severity and infarct volume were assessed by NIHSS and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors of IS. The ROC curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) of EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were determined. The levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were increased significantly in acute and subacute stages of IS and remained unchanged in chronic stage, and were positively related to the infarct volume and NIHSS scores and were associated with large artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism subtypes defined by Trial of Org 10 172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were significant and independent risk factors of IS and their AUC were 0.778 and 0.851, respectively, and increased to 0.892 after combination. Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.</p>

<p>We engrafted RFP‐expressing astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs into the cortex of immunodeficient mice neonatally. Nine months post engraftment, the human astrocytes in the superficial cortex developed into interlaminar astrocytes that mimicked the interlaminar astrocytes architecture of the adult human cortex. This chimeric mouse model will enable the study of human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in vivo.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes, a highly heterogeneous population of glial cells, serve as essential regulators of brain development and homeostasis. The heterogeneity of astrocyte populations underlies the diversity in their functions. In addition to the typical mammalian astrocyte architecture, the cerebral cortex of humans exhibits a radial distribution of interlaminar astrocytes in the supragranular layers. These primate‐specific interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. However, due to the lack of accessible experimental models, their functional properties and their role in regulating neuronal circuits remain unclear. Here we modeled human interlaminar astrocytes in humanized glial chimeric mice by engrafting astrocytes differentiated from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells into the mouse cortex. This model provides a novel platform for understanding neuron‐glial interaction and its alterations in neurological diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lithium is widely used to treat bipolar disorder. However, the efficacy and vulnerability as to its side effects are known to differ. Although the specific biochemical mechanism of action is still elusive, lithium may influence mitochondrial function, and consequently, metabolism. Lithium exposure in this study was conducted on a unique set of mito‐nuclear introgression lines of <i>Drosophila subobscura </i> to disentangle the independent effects of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) against a common nuclear DNA background. The study addressed three issues: (a) whether lithium has a dose‐dependent effect on whole‐organism metabolic rate, (b) whether mtDNA haplotypes show divergent metabolic efficiency measured by metabolic rate to lithium exposure and (c) whether lithium influences the whole‐organism metabolic rate across sexes. The results confirm that lithium influenced the whole‐organism metabolic rate, showing a subtle balance between efficacy and adverse effects within a narrow dose range. In addition, lithium exposure was found to influence metabolism differently based on mtDNA haplotypes and sex. This preliminary research may have a range of biological implications for the role of mitochondrial variability in psychiatric disease and treatment by contributing to the understanding and predicting of the lithium treatment response and risk for toxic side effects.</p>

<p>“Stem cell tourism,” the practice of offering unproven cellular preparations to patients as approved therapy, is rising in neurology. Currently, the experiences of patients and reported complications from these procedures are unknown in the United States. We evaluate academic neurologists' experiences with stem cell tourism and assess perceived competency on discussing this topic with patients. We found a lack of neurologist preparedness to discuss stem cell therapies with patients and an alarming list of unreported complications from these unregulated procedures. We also identified an urgent need for neurologist education and the creation of a national registry for reporting patient complications resulting from experimental stem cell interventions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The variegated pelage and social complexity of the African wild dog (<i>Lycaon pictus </i>) hint at the possibility of specializations of the visual system. Here, using a range of architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level organization of the image‐forming, non‐image forming, oculomotor, and accessory optic, vision‐associated systems in the brain of one representative individual of the African wild dog. For all of these systems, the organization, in terms of location, parcellation and topology (internal and external), is very similar to that reported in other carnivores. The image‐forming visual system consists of the superior colliculus, visual dorsal thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar and lateral posterior nucleus) and visual cortex (occipital, parietal, suprasylvian, temporal and splenial visual regions). The non‐image forming visual system comprises the suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectal nuclear complex and the Edinger‐Westphal nucleus. The oculomotor system incorporates the oculomotor, trochlear and abducens cranial nerve nuclei as well as the parabigeminal nucleus, while the accessory optic system includes the dorsal, lateral and medial terminal nuclei. The extent of similarity to other carnivores in the systems‐level organization of these systems indicates that the manner in which these systems process visual information is likely to be consistent with that found, for example, in the well‐studied domestic cat. It would appear that the sociality of the African wild dog is dependent upon the processing of information extracted from the visual system in the higher‐order cognitive and affective neural systems.</p>

<p>Corollary discharge is an important brain function that allows animals to distinguish external from self-generated signals, which is critical to sensorimotor coordination. Since discovery of the concept of corollary discharge in 1950, neuroscientists have sought to elucidate underlying neural circuits and mechanisms. Here, we review a history of neurophysiological studies on corollary discharge and highlight significant contributions from studies using African mormyrid weakly electric fish. Mormyrid fish generate brief electric pulses to communicate with other fish and to sense their surroundings. In addition, mormyrids can passively locate weak, external electric signals. These three behaviors are mediated by different corollary discharge functions including inhibition, enhancement, and predictive “negative image” generation. Owing to several experimental advantages of mormyrids, investigations of these mechanisms have led to important general principles that have proven applicable to a wide diversity of animal species.</p>

Objectives<p>Tremor is common in patients with Lewy body disease (LBD) and not rare in normal individuals. Prevalence of tremor in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and its association with other comorbidities are seldom studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the patient characteristics of VCI associated with tremor and to evaluate the possibility of mixed pathology with LBD in these patients.</p>Methods<p>Retrospective analysis of a large population with VCI registered in the database of a regional healthcare system was performed. VCI patients were divided into tremor and non-tremor groups. The associated characteristics including demographics, clinical features in motor and non-motor domains, vascular risk factors, and neuroimaging features were compared between the tremor group and the non-tremor group.</p>Results<p>Among 1337 patients with VCI, 292 (21.8%) had tremor, while 1045 (78.2%) did not have tremor. The tremor group had significantly higher prevalence of all motor and non-motor LBD clinical features than the non-tremor group. The tremor group also demonstrated more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Among patients with tremor, patients having tremor onset earlier than stroke onset showed significantly higher prevalence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. All comparisons were adjusted for age and severity of dementia.</p>Conclusion<p>Tremor is a common comorbidity of VCI. VCI patients with tremor had a higher prevalence of motor and non-motor LBD features. These findings raised the possibility of VCI patients with tremor having high possibility of mixed pathology with LBD.</p>

<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin protein complex, mTORC1, has received attention in recent years for its role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Numerous excellent reviews have been written on the pathways and drug targeting of this keystone regulator of metabolism. However, none have specifically highlighted several important nuances of mTOR regulation as relates to neurodegeneration. Herein, we focus on six such nuances/open questions: (1) “Antagonistic pleiotropy” – Should we weigh the beneficial anabolic functions of mTORC1 against its harmful inhibition of autophagy? (2) “Early/late-stage specificity” – Does the relative importance of these neuroprotective/neurotoxic actions change as a disease progresses? (3) “Regional specificity” – Does mTOR signaling respond differently to the same interventions in different brain regions? (4) “Disease specificity” – Could the same intervention to inhibit mTORC1 help in one disease and cause harm in another disease? (5) “Personalized therapy” – Might genetically-informed personalized therapies that inhibit particular nodes in the mTORC1 regulatory network be more effective than generalized therapies? (6) “Lifestyle interventions” – Could specific diets, micronutrients, or exercise alter mTORC1 signaling to prevent or improve the progression neurodegenerative diseases? This manuscript is devoted to discussing recent research findings that offer insights into these gaps in the literature, with the aim of inspiring further inquiry.</p>

<p>Knowledge of lipid droplets (LDs) has evolved from simple depots of lipid storage to dynamic and functionally active organelles involved in a variety of cellular functions. Studies have now informed significant roles for LDs in cellular signaling, metabolic disease, and inflammation. While lipid droplet biology has been well explored in peripheral organs such as the liver and heart, LDs within the brain are relatively understudied. The presence and function of these dynamic organelles in the central nervous system has recently gained attention, especially in the context of neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of LDs within the brain, with an emphasis on their relevance in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Alternating current stimulation is a promising method for the study and treatment of various visual neurological dysfunctions as well as progressive understanding of the healthy brain. Unfortunately, due to the current stimulation artifact, problems remain in the context of analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal recorded during ongoing stimulation. To address this problem, we propose the use of a simple moving average subtraction as a method for artifact elimination. This method involves the creation of a template of the stimulation artifact from EEG signal recorded during non-invasive electrical stimulation with a sinusoidal alternating current. The present report describes results of the effects of a simple moving average filtration that varies based on averaging parameters; in particular, we varied the number of sinusoidal periods per segment of the recorded signal and the number of segments used to construct an artifact template. Given the ongoing lack of a mathematical model that allows for the prediction of the “hidden” EEG signal with the alternating current stimulation artifact, we propose performing an earlier simulation that is based on the addition of artificial stimulation artifact to the known EEG signal. This solution allows for the optimization of filtering parameters with detailed knowledge about the accuracy of artifact removal. The algorithm, designed in the MATLAB environment, has been tested on data recorded from two volunteers subjected to sinusoidal transorbital alternating current stimulation. Analysis of the percentage difference between the original and filtered signal in time and frequency domain highlights the advantage of 1-period filtration.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, a network of face-selective brain regions has been identified as the core system for face processing, including occipital face area (OFA), fusiform face area (FFA), and posterior region of superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the ventral route of face processing and memory should end at the anterior temporal lobes (i.e., vATLs), which may play an important role bridging face perception and face memory. It is not entirely clear, however, the extent to which neural activities in these face-selective regions can effectively predict behavioral performance on tasks that are frequently used to investigate face processing and face memory test that requires recognition beyond variation in pose and lighting, especially when non-Caucasian East Asian faces are involved. To address these questions, we first identified during a functional scan the core face network by asking participants to perform a one-back task, while viewing either static images or dynamic videos. Dynamic localizers were effective in identifying regions of interest (ROIs) in the core face-processing system. We then correlated the brain activities of core ROIs with performances on face-processing tasks (component, configural, and composite) and face memory test (Taiwanese Face Memory Test, TFMT) and found evidence for limited predictability. We next adopted an multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach to further explore the predictability of face-selective brain regions on TFMT performance and found evidence suggesting that a basic visual processing area such as calcarine and an area for structural face processing such as OFA may play an even greater role in memorizing faces. Implications regarding how differences in processing demands between behavioral and neuroimaging tasks and cultural specificity in face-processing and memory strategies among participants may have contributed to the findings reported here are discussed.</p>

<p>Reliable propagation of slow-modulations of the firing rate across multiple layers of a feedforward network (FFN) has proven difficult to capture in spiking neural models. In this paper, we explore necessary conditions for reliable and stable propagation of time-varying asynchronous spikes whose instantaneous rate of changes—in fairly short time windows [20–100] msec—represents information of slow fluctuations of the stimulus. Specifically, we study the effect of network size, level of background synaptic noise, and the variability of synaptic delays in an FFN with all-to-all connectivity. We show that network size and the level of background synaptic noise, together with the strength of synapses, are substantial factors enabling the propagation of asynchronous spikes in deep layers of an FFN. In contrast, the variability of synaptic delays has a minor effect on signal propagation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00228">Purkinje Cell-Specific Knockout of Tyrosine Hydroxylase Impairs Cognitive Behaviors</a></h4>

<p>Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) expression has previously been reported in Purkinje cells (PCs) of rodents and humans, but its role in the regulation of behavior is not understood. Catecholamines are well known for facilitating cognitive behaviors and are expressed in many regions of the brain. Here, we investigated a possible role in cognitive behaviors of PC catecholamines, by mapping and testing functional roles of Th positive PCs in mice. Comprehensive mapping analyses revealed a distinct population of Th expressing PCs primarily in the posterior and lateral regions of the cerebellum (comprising about 18% of all PCs). To identify the role of PC catecholamines, we selectively knocked out Th in PCs using a conditional knockout approach, by crossing a Purkinje cell-selective Cre recombinase line, Pcp2-Cre, with a floxed tyrosine hydroxylase mouse line (Th<sup>lox/lox</sup>) to produce Pcp2-Cre;Th<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice. This manipulation resulted in approximately 50% reduction of Th protein expression in the cerebellar cortex and lateral cerebellar nucleus, but no reduction of Th in the locus coeruleus, which is known to innervate the cerebellum in mice. Pcp2-Cre;Th<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice showed impairments in behavioral flexibility, response inhibition, social recognition memory, and associative fear learning relative to littermate controls, but no deficits in gross motor, sensory, instrumental learning, or sensorimotor gating functions. Catecholamines derived from specific populations of PCs appear to support cognitive functions, and their spatial distribution in the cerebellum suggests that they may underlie patterns of activation seen in human studies on the cerebellar role in cognitive function.</p>

<p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the peripheral synapse that controls the coordinated movement of many organisms. The NMJ is also an archetypical model to study synaptic morphology and function. As the NMJ is the primary target of neuromuscular diseases and traumatic injuries, the establishment of suitable models to study the contribution of specific postsynaptic muscle-derived proteins on NMJ maintenance and regeneration is a permanent need. Considering the unique experimental advantages of the levator auris longus (LAL) muscle, here we present a method allowing for efficient electroporation-mediated gene transfer and subsequent detailed studies of the morphology and function of the NMJ and muscle fibers. Also, we have standardized efficient facial nerve injury protocols to analyze LAL muscle NMJ degeneration and regeneration. Our results show that the expression of a control fluorescent protein does not alter either the muscle structural organization, the apposition of the pre- and post-synaptic domains, or the functional neurotransmission parameters of the LAL muscle NMJs; in turn, the overexpression of MuSK, a major regulator of postsynaptic assembly, induces the formation of ectopic acetylcholine receptor clusters. Our NMJ denervation experiments showed complete reinnervation of LAL muscle NMJs four weeks after facial nerve injury. Together, these experimental strategies in the LAL muscle constitute effective methods to combine protein expression with accurate analyses at the levels of structure, function, and regeneration of the NMJ.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammation constitutes a fundamental cellular process to signal the loss of brain homeostasis. Glial cells play a central role in orchestrating these neuroinflammation processes in both deleterious and beneficial ways. These cellular responses depend on their intercellular interactions with neurons, astrocytes, the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and infiltrated T cells in the central nervous system (CNS). However, this intercellular crosstalk seems to be activated by specific stimuli for each different neurological scenario. This review summarizes key studies linking neuroinflammation with certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and for the development of better therapeutic strategies based on immunomodulation.</p>

<p>Background: The pathogenesis of dementia often starts several years prior to clinical onset during which the individual is asymptomatic. Existing strategies for the accurate diagnosis of early dementia are limited by high cost and the invasive nature of the procedures. Eye movement parameters associated with cognitive functions may be helpful in the early identification of dementia and in the development and evaluation of preventive and therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Objective: We aimed to assess differences in eye movement parameters between healthy elderly individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, we examined the correlations between eye movement parameters with cognitive functions and specific hemispheric region and neural structures in individuals with MCI.</p><p>Method: Eighty individuals with MCI without dementia (based on DSM-IV criteria) identified by community screening and 170 healthy controls were administered Chinese versions of MoCA and NTB, and a long (20 min) or short (5 min) version of a visual paired comparison (VPC) task. Two weeks later, 44 MCI patients and 107 healthy controls completed a retest of the VPC task, 44 MCI patients and 43 healthy controls among them administered a MRI. At the end of 1-year follow-up, a subset of 26 individuals with MCI and 57 healthy controls were administered the long version of VPC task and MoCA test again. Eye movement parameters and the relationship of eye movement parameters with cognitive functions and with changes in neural structures were compared between groups.</p><p>Results: Patients with MCI were older, had less education, and had lower scores on cognitive tests than healthy controls. After adjustment for age and level of education, patients with MCI had lower novelty preference scores on the VPC than healthy controls. Using the logistic regression model, the amount of time that subjects focused on these novel images could predict MCI patients from normal elderly with an out of sample area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.62. Furthermore, the cognition score of subjects whose novelty preference score was low decreased more remarkably in 1 year. For both the patient and control groups, VPC novelty preference was significantly correlated with verbal fluency and delayed and short-term memory function. Novelty preference score was also significantly correlated with the cortical thickness of several structures in the right hemisphere.</p><p>Conclusion: Eye movement parameters are stable indicators to distinguish patients with MCI and cognitively normal subjects and are not affected by different testing versions and numbers. Additionally, the patients’ cognitive deficits and eye movement indices were correlated. Future longitudinal studies should further explore the clinical utility of eye movement parameters as early markers of MCI.</p>

<p>Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is described as an age-related neurodegenerative disorder. However, the vast majority of research is carried out using experimental models of young animals lacking the implications of the decline processes associated with aging. It has been suggested that several molecular pathways are involved in the perpetuation of the degeneration and the neuroinflammation in PD. Among others, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been highly implicated in the development of PD, and regulating components of their activity are indicated as promising therapeutic targets.</p><p>Methods: To further define how MAPKs expression is related to the glial response and neuronal cell death, Parkinsonism was induced under an acute regimen in old mice. Moreover, the sacrifice was carried out at different time points (4, 8, 24, and 48 h) after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP) injections to describe the early dynamic changes over time produced by the intoxication.</p><p>Results: The results revealed that neuronal death increases as glial response increases in the nigrostriatal pathway. It was observed that both processes increase from 4 h in the ventral mesencephalon (VM), and neuronal death becomes significant at 48 h. In the striatum, they were significantly increased from 48 h after the MPTP administration compared with that in the control mice. Moreover, the p-ERK levels decrease, while phospho-p38 expression increases specifically in the striatum at 48 h after MPTP intoxication.</p><p>Conclusions: The importance of these data lies in the possibility of elucidating the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes under aging conditions to provide knowledge for the search of solutions that slow down the progression of PD.</p>

<p>by Antica Culina, Ilona van den Berg, Simon Evans, Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar</p>

Access to analytical code is essential for transparent and reproducible research. We review the state of code availability in ecology using a random sample of 346 nonmolecular articles published between 2015 and 2019 under mandatory or encouraged code-sharing policies. Our results call for urgent action to increase code availability: only 27% of eligible articles were accompanied by code. In contrast, data were available for 79% of eligible articles, highlighting that code availability is an important limiting factor for computational reproducibility in ecology. Although the percentage of ecological journals with mandatory or encouraged code-sharing policies has increased considerably, from 15% in 2015 to 75% in 2020, our results show that code-sharing policies are not adhered to by most authors. We hope these results will encourage journals, institutions, funding agencies, and researchers to address this alarming situation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RJFUVgs1x3U" width="1" />

<p>The number of brain structures in which acute morphine induced or suppressed the level of c‐Fos, pERK1/2 and pGSK3β. While the c‐Fos level in the brain is either upregulated or unchanged, the levels of phosphorylated forms of both kinases can be upregulated as well as downregulated below the baseline level. The day/night variation in the spontaneous levels of all markers may affect the direction, rate, and magnitude of the response to morphine.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As with other drugs or pharmaceuticals, opioids differ in their rewarding or analgesic effects depending on when they are applied. In the previous study, we have demonstrated the day/night difference in the sensitivity of the major circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus to a low dose of morphine, and showed the bidirectional effect of morphine on pERK1/2 and pGSK3β levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus depending on the time of administration. The main aim of this study was to identify other brain structures that respond differently to morphine depending on the time of its administration. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified 44 structures that show time‐of‐day specific changes in c‐Fos level and activity of ERK1/2 and GSK3β kinases in response to a single dose of 1 mg/kg morphine. Furthermore, comparison among control groups revealed the differences in the spontaneous levels of all markers with a generally higher level during the night, that is, in the active phase of the day. We thus provide further evidence for diurnal variations in the activity of brain regions outside the suprachiasmatic nucleus indicated by the temporal changes in the molecular substrate. We suggest that these changes are responsible for generating diurnal variation in the reward behavior or analgesic effect of opioid administration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is an incretin hormone with a number of functions to maintain energy homeostasis and contribute to motivated behavior, both peripherally and within the central nervous system (CNS). These functions, which include insulin secretion, gastric emptying, satiety, and the hedonic aspects of food and drug intake, are primarily mediated through stimulation of the GLP‐1 receptor. While this receptor plays an important role in a variety of physiological outcomes, data regarding its CNS expression has been primarily limited to regional receptor binding and single‐label transcript expression studies. We thus developed a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse, in which expression of a red fluorescent protein (mApple) is driven by the GLP‐1R promoter. Using this reporter mouse, we characterized the regional and cellular expression patterns of GLP‐1R expressing cells in the CNS, using double‐label immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. GLP‐1R‐expressing cells were enriched in several key brain regions and circuits, including the lateral septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, ventral midbrain, periaqueductal gray, and cerebral cortex. In most regions, GLP‐1R primarily colocalized with GABAergic neurons, except within some regions such as the hippocampus, where it was co‐expressed in glutamatergic neurons. GLP‐1R‐mApple cells were highly co‐expressed with 5‐HT3 receptor‐containing neurons within the cortex and striatum, as well as with dopamine receptor‐ and calbindin‐expressing cells within the lateral septum, the brain region in which GLP‐1R is most highly expressed. In this manuscript, we provide detailed images of GLP‐1R‐mApple expression and distribution within the brain and characterization of these neurons.</p>

<p>Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is a member of a novel family of growth factors that is not only secreted but is highly retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and protective against ER stress. CDNF is expressed in the brain and bowel and is neuroprotective. We sought to determine the location of CDNF in the gut as well as its functions during development and maintenance of the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is formed by precursor cells that migrate to the primordial bowel from the neural crest (1). These cells colonize the gut and some of the crest‐derived émigrés express (CDNF) within the gut (2). CDNF selectively promotes the development of subsets of enteric neurons that are late born (3). These include, but are not limited to enteric dopaminergic neurons. Most mature dopaminergic neurons coexpress CDNF. Exposure to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4) causes neurons isolated from the fetal gut to become CDNF‐dependent. When the bowel contains CDNF, submucosal dopaminergic and other late‐born neurons develop normally and are maintained; however, when CDNF is genetically deleted, these same neurons become deficient as a function of age. Although CDNF is expressed in subsets of neurons in both plexuses, the submucosal plexus selectively becomes hypoplastic in animals lacking CDNF, and parameters of gastrointestinal motility become abnormally slow. We conclude that enteric expression of CDNF is restricted to neurons and their precursors and that CDNF is essential for the development and maintenance of dopaminergic and other late‐born submucosal neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is expressed in the brain and is neuroprotective. We have previously shown that CDNF is also expressed in the bowel and that its absence leads to degeneration and autophagy in the enteric nervous system (ENS), particularly in the submucosal plexus. We now demonstrate that enteric CDNF immunoreactivity is restricted to neurons (submucosal &gt; myenteric) and is not seen in glia, interstitial cells of Cajal, or smooth muscle. Expression of CDNF, moreover, is essential for the normal development and survival of enteric dopaminergic neurons; thus, expression of the dopaminergic neuronal markers, dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine transporter are deficient in the ileum of <i>Cdnf </i>
<sup>
   <i>−/− </i>
</sup> mice. The normal age‐related decline in proportions of submucosal dopaminergic neurons is exacerbated in <i>Cdnf </i>
<sup>
   <i>−/− </i>
</sup> animals. The defect in <i>Cdnf </i>
<sup>
   <i>−/− </i>
</sup> animals is not dopamine‐restricted; proportions of other submucosal neurons (NOS‐, GABA‐, and CGRP‐expressing), are also deficient. The deficits in submucosal neurons are reflected functionally in delayed gastric emptying, slowed colonic motility, and prolonged total gastrointestinal transit. CDNF is expressed selectively in isolated enteric neural crest‐derived cells (ENCDC), which also express the dopamine‐related transcription factor Foxa2. Addition of CDNF to ENCDC promotes development of dopaminergic neurons; moreover, survival of these neurons becomes CDNF‐dependent after exposure to bone morphogenetic protein 4. The effects of neither glial cell‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) nor serotonin are additive with CDNF. We suggest that CDNF plays a critical role in development and long‐term maintenance of dopaminergic and other sets of submucosal neurons.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>GABAergic interneurons play an essential role in modulating cortical networks. The progenitor domains of cortical interneurons are localized in developing ventral forebrain, including the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), preoptic area (POA), and preoptic hypothalamic border domain (POH). Here, we characterized the expression pattern of <i>Zswim5 </i>, an MGE‐enriched gene in the mouse forebrain. At E11.5–E13.5, prominent <i>Zswim5 </i> expression was detected in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of MGE, POA, and POH, but not CGE of ventral telencephalon where progenitors of cortical interneurons resided. At E15.5 and E17.5, <i>Zswim5 </i> expression remained in the MGE/pallidum primordium and ventral germinal zone. <i>Zswim5 </i> mRNA was markedly decreased after birth and was absent in the adult forebrain. Interestingly, the <i>Zswim5 </i> expression pattern resembled the tangential migration pathways of cortical interneurons. <i>Zswim5 </i>‐positive cells in the MGE appeared to migrate from the MGE through the SVZ of LGE to overlying neocortex. Indeed, <i>Zswim5 </i> was co‐localized with <i>Nkx2.1 </i> and Lhx6, markers of progenitors and migratory cortical interneurons. Double labeling showed that Ascl1/Mash1‐positive cells co‐expressed <i>Zswim5 </i>. <i>Zswim5 </i> expressing cells contained none or at most low levels of Ki67 but co‐expressed Tuj1 in the SVZ of MGE. These results suggest that <i>Zswim5 </i> is immediately upregulated as progenitors exiting cell cycle become postmitotic. Given that recent studies have elucidated that the cell fate of cortical interneurons is determined shortly after becoming postmitotic, the timing of <i>Zswim5 </i> expression in early postmitotic interneurons suggests a potential role of <i>Zswim5 </i> in regulation of neurogenesis and tangential migration of cortical interneurons.</p>

<p>The thalamus of the amphibian <i>Xenopus </i> shows during larval development a progressively distinct set of pronuclei or tiers, formed from the embryonic histogenetic domains, which are specifically characterized by chemo‐ and genoarchitecture and ultimately define the adult thalamic organization, not observable by classical staining methods used for cytoarchitecture.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The early patterning of the thalamus during embryonic development defines rostral and caudal progenitor domains, which are conserved from fishes to mammals. However, the subsequent developmental mechanisms that lead to the adult thalamic configuration have only been investigated for mammals and other amniotes. In this study, we have analyzed in the anuran amphibian <i>Xenopus laevis </i> (an anamniote vertebrate), through larval and postmetamorphic development, the progressive regional expression of specific markers for the rostral (GABA, GAD67, <i>Lhx1 </i>, and Nkx2.2) and caudal (<i>Gbx2 </i>, <i>VGlut2 </i>, Lhx2, <i>Lhx9 </i>, and Sox2) domains. In addition, the regional distributions at different developmental stages of other markers such as calcium binding proteins and neuropeptides, helped the identification of thalamic nuclei. It was observed that the two embryonic domains were progressively specified and compartmentalized during premetamorphosis, and cell subpopulations characterized by particular gene expression combinations were located in periventricular, intermediate and superficial strata. During prometamorphosis, three dorsoventral tiers formed from the caudal domain and most pronuclei were defined, which were modified into the definitive nuclear configuration through the metamorphic climax. Mixed cell populations originated from the rostral and caudal domains constitute most of the final nuclei and allowed us to propose additional subdivisions in the adult thalamus, whose main afferent and efferent connections were assessed by tracing techniques under in vitro conditions. This study corroborates shared features of early gene expression patterns in the thalamus between <i>Xenopus </i> and mouse, however, the dynamic changes in gene expression observed at later stages in the amphibian support mechanisms different from those of mammals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Five prosomatostatin genes (<i>PSST1 </i>, <i>PSST2 </i>, <i>PSST3 </i>, <i>PSST5 </i>, and <i>PSST6 </i>) have been recently identified in elasmobranchs (Tostivint et al., General and Comparative Endocrinology, 2019, 279, 139–147). In order to gain insight into the contribution of each somatostatin to specific nervous systems circuits and behaviors in this important jawed vertebrate group, we studied the distribution of neurons expressing <i>PSST </i> mRNAs in the central nervous system (CNS) of <i>Scyliorhinus canicula </i>  using in situ hybridization. Additionally, we combined in situ hybridization with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunochemistry for better characterization of <i>PSST1 </i> and <i>PSST6 </i> expressing populations. We observed differential expression of <i>PSST1 </i> and <i>PSST6 </i>, which are the most widely expressed <i>PSST </i> transcripts, in cell populations of many CNS regions, including the pallium, subpallium, hypothalamus, diencephalon, optic tectum, midbrain tegmentum, and rhombencephalon. Interestingly, numerous small pallial neurons express <i>PSST1 </i> and <i>PSST6 </i>, although in different populations judging from the colocalization of TH immunoreactivity and <i>PSST6 </i> expression but not with <i>PSST1 </i>. We observed expression of <i>PSST1 </i> in cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting (CSF‐c) neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular organ and the central canal of the spinal cord. Unlike <i>PSST1 </i> and <i>PSST6 </i>, <i>PSST2 </i>, and <i>PSST3 </i> are only expressed in cells of the hypothalamus and in some hindbrain lateral reticular neurons, and <i>PSST5 </i> in cells of the region of the entopeduncular nucleus. Comparative data of brain expression of <i>PSST </i> genes indicate that the somatostatinergic system of sharks is the most complex reported in any fish.</p>

<p>Different neurons, layers, and subdivisions of the monkey entorhinal cortex exhibit different postnatal developmental profiles suggesting the differential structural maturation of putative functional circuits in support of spatial and episodic memory.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The entorhinal cortex is the main gateway for interactions between the neocortex and the hippocampus. Distinct regions, layers, and cells of the hippocampal formation exhibit different profiles of structural and molecular maturation during postnatal development. Here, we provide estimates of neuron number, neuronal soma size, and volume of the different layers and subdivisions of the monkey entorhinal cortex (Eo, Er, Elr, Ei, Elc, Ec, Ecl) during postnatal development. We found different developmental changes in neuronal soma size and volume of distinct layers in different subdivisions, but no changes in neuron number. Layers I and II developed early in most subdivisions. Layer III exhibited early maturation in Ec and Ecl, a two‐step/early maturation in Ei and a late maturation in Er. Layers V and VI exhibited an early maturation in Ec and Ecl, a two‐step and early maturation in Ei, and a late maturation in Er. Neuronal soma size increased transiently at 6 months of age and decreased thereafter to reach adult size, except in Layer II of Ei, and Layers II and III of Ec and Ecl. These findings support the theory that different hippocampal circuits exhibit distinct developmental profiles, which may subserve the emergence of different hippocampus‐dependent memory processes. We discuss how the early maturation of the caudal entorhinal cortex may contribute to path integration and basic allocentric spatial processing, whereas the late maturation of the rostral entorhinal cortex may contribute to the increased precision of allocentric spatial representations and the temporal integration of individual items into episodic memories.</p>

<p>The retinas of many fishes are characterized by single and double cones that are organized into lattice‐like formations. The functional significance of such cone mosaic periodicity is unknown. Unlike other flatfishes, the common sole and the Senegalese sole lack lattice‐like organization of their cone mosaics.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retinas of nonmammalian vertebrates have cone photoreceptor mosaics that are often organized as highly patterned lattice‐like distributions. In fishes, the two main lattice‐like patterns are composed of double cones and single cones that are either assembled as interdigitized squares or as alternating rows. The functional significance of such orderly patterning is unknown. Here, the cone mosaics in two species of Soleidae flatfishes, the common sole and the Senegalese sole, were characterized and compared to those from other fishes to explore variability in cone patterning and how it may relate to visual function. The cone mosaics of the common sole and the Senegalese sole consisted of single, double, and triple cones in formations that differed from the traditional square mosaic pattern reported for other flatfishes in that no evidence of higher order periodicity was present. Furthermore, mean regularity indices for single and double cones were conspicuously lower than those of other fishes with “typical” square and row mosaics, but comparable to those of goldfish, a species with lattice‐like periodicity in its cone mosaic. Opsin transcripts detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (<i>sws1 </i>, <i>sws2 </i>, <i>rh2.3 </i>, <i>rh2.4 </i>, <i>lws </i>, and <i>rh1 </i>) were uniformly expressed across the retina of the common sole but, in the Senegalese sole, <i>sws2 </i>, <i>rh2.4 </i>, and <i>rh1 </i> were more prevalent in the dorsal retina. Microspectrophotometry revealed five visual pigments in the retina of the common sole [S(472), M(523), M(536), L(559), and rod(511)] corresponding to the repertoire of transcripts quantified except for <i>sws1 </i>. Overall, these results indicate a loss of cone mosaic patterning in species that are primarily nocturnal or dwell in low light environments as is the case for the common sole and the Senegalese sole. The corollary is that lattice‐like patterning of the cone mosaic may improve visual acuity. Ecological and physiological correlates derived from observations across multiple fish taxa that live in low light environments and do not possess lattice‐like cone mosaics are congruent with this claim.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey visual signals to 50 regions of the brain. For reasons of interest and convenience, they constitute an excellent system for the study of brain structure and function. There is general agreement that, absent a complete “parts list”, understanding how the nervous system processes information will remain an elusive goal. Recent studies indicate that there are 30‐50 types of ganglion cell in mouse retina, whereas only a few years ago it was still written that mice and the more visually oriented lagomorphs had less than 20 types of RGC. More than 30 years ago I estimated that rabbits have about 40 types of RGC. The present study indicates that this number is much too low. I have employed the old but powerful method of Golgi‐impregnation to rabbit retina, studying the range of component neurons in this already well‐studied retinal system. Close quantitative and qualitative analysis of 1142 RGCs in 26 retinas takes into account cell body and dendritic field size, level(s) of dendritic stratification in the retina’s inner plexiform layer, and details of dendritic branching. 91 morphologies are recognized. Of these, at least 32 can be correlated with physiologically studied RGCs, dye‐injected for morphological analysis. It is unlikely that rabbits have 91 types of RGC, but is argued here that this number lies between 60 and 70. The present study provides a “yardstick” for measuring the output of future molecular studies that may be more definitive in fixing the number of RGC types in rabbit retina.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The African wild dog is endemic to sub‐Saharan Africa and belongs to the family Canidae which includes domestic dogs and their closest relatives (i.e. wolves, coyotes, jackals, dingoes and foxes). The African wild dog is known for its highly social behaviour, co‐ordinated pack predation, and striking vocal repertoire, but little is known about its brain and whether it differs in any significant way from that of other canids. We employed gross anatomical observation, magnetic resonance imaging and classical neuroanatomical staining to provide a broad overview of the structure of the African wild dog brain. Our results reveal a mean brain mass of 154.08 g, with an encephalization quotient of 1.73, indicating that the African wild dog has a relatively large brain size. Analysis of the various structures that comprise their brains and their topological inter‐relationships, as well as the areas and volumes of the corpus callosum, ventricular system, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and the gyrification index, all reveal that the African wild dog brain is, in general, similar to that of other mammals, and very similar to that of other carnivorans. While at this level of analysis we do not find any striking specializations within the brain of the African wild dog, apart from a relatively large brain size, the observations made indicate that more detailed analyses of specific neural systems, particularly those involved in sensorimotor processing, sociality or cognition, may reveal features that are either unique to this species or shared amongst the Canidae to the exclusion of other Carnivora.</p>

<p>The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.

</p>
<br />
<p>A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are non‐vocal in most non‐human primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.</p>

<p>Spaceflight missions to the International Space Station (ISS) expose astronauts to microgravity, radiation, isolation, and elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), among other factors. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an Earth-based analog for spaceflight used to study body unloading, fluid shifts, and other factors unrelated to gravitational changes. While in space, astronauts need to use mental rotation strategies to facilitate their adaptation to the ISS environment. Therefore, spatial working memory is essential for crewmember performance. Although the effects of HDBR on spatial working memory have recently been studied, the results are still inconclusive. Here, we expand upon past work and examine the effects of HDBR with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>) on brain activation patterns during spatial working memory performance. In addition, we compare brain activation between 30 days of HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and 70 days of HDBR to test the isolated effect of CO<sub>2</sub>. Eleven subjects (6 males, 5 females; mean age = 34 ± 8 years) underwent six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. During the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> intervention, we observed decreasing activation in the right middle frontal gyrus and left regions of the cerebellum, followed by post-intervention recovery. We detected several correlations between brain and behavioral slopes of change with the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> intervention. For example, greater increases in activation in frontal, temporal and parietal regions were associated with larger spatial working memory improvements. Comparing the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group to data from our previous 70-day HDBR study, we found greater decreases in activation in the right hippocampus and left inferior temporal gyrus for the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group over the course of the intervention. Together, these findings increase our understanding of the neural mechanisms of HDBR, elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and spaceflight-related changes in spatial working memory performance.</p>

<p>Neural prostheses enable users to effect movement through a variety of actuators by translating brain signals into movement control signals. However, to achieve more natural limb movements from these devices, the restoration of somatosensory feedback is required. We used feature-learnability, a machine-learning approach, to assess signal features for their capacity to enhance decoding performance of neural signals evoked by natural tactile and proprioceptive somatosensory stimuli, recorded from the surface of the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) in urethane-anesthetized rats. The highest performing individual feature, spike amplitude, classified somatosensory DCN signals with 70% accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved was 87% using 13 features that were extracted from both high and low-frequency (LF) bands of DCN signals. In general, high-frequency (HF) features contained the most information about peripheral somatosensory events, but when features were acquired from short time-windows, classification accuracy was significantly improved by adding LF features to the feature set. We found that proprioception-dominated stimuli generalize across animals better than tactile-dominated stimuli, and we demonstrate how information that signal features contribute to neural decoding changes over the time-course of dynamic somatosensory events. These findings may inform the biomimetic design of artificial stimuli that can activate the DCN to substitute somatosensory feedback. Although, we investigated somatosensory structures, the feature set we investigated may also prove useful for decoding other (e.g., motor) neural signals.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00135">GABA, but Not Bestrophin-1, Is Localized in Astroglial Processes in the Mouse Hippocampus and the Cerebellum</a></h4>

<p>GABA is proposed to act as a gliotransmitter in the brain. Differences in GABA release from astroglia are thought to underlie differences in tonic inhibition between the cerebellum and the CA1 hippocampus. Here we used quantitative immunogold cytochemistry to localize and compare the levels of GABA in astroglia in these brain regions. We found that the density of GABA immunogold particles was similar in delicate processes of Bergman glia in the cerebellum and astrocytes in the CA1 hippocampus. The astrocytic GABA release is proposed to be mediated by, among others, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>–</sup> channel bestrophin-1. The bestrophin-1 antibodies did not show any significant bestrophin-1 signal in the brain of wt mice, nor in bestrophin-1 knockout mice. The bestrophin-1 signal was low both on Western blots and immunofluorescence laser scanning microscopic images. These results suggest that GABA is localized in astroglia, but in similar concentrations in the cerebellum and CA1 hippocampus, and thus cannot account for differences in tonic inhibition between these brain regions. Furthermore, our data seem to suggest that the GABA release from astroglia previously observed in the hippocampus and cerebellum occurs via mechanisms other than bestrophin-1.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00132">Lights on Endocannabinoid-Mediated Synaptic Potentiation</a></h4>

<p>The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a lipid-based neurotransmitter complex that plays crucial roles in the neural control of learning and memory. The current model of eCB-mediated retrograde signaling is that eCBs released from postsynaptic elements travel retrogradely to presynaptic axon terminals, where they activate cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs) and ultimately decrease neurotransmitter release on a short- or long-term scale. An increasing body of evidence has enlarged this view and shows that eCBs, besides depressing synaptic transmission, are also able to increase neurotransmitter release at multiple synapses of the brain. This indicates that eCBs act as bidirectional regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recently, studies unveiled links between the expression of eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-LTP) and learning, and between its dysregulation and several pathologies. In this review article, we first distinguish the various forms of eCB-LTP based on their mechanisms, resulting from homosynaptically or heterosynaptically-mediated processes. Next, we consider the neuromodulation of eCB-LTP, its behavioral impact on learning and memory, and finally, eCB-LTP disruptions in various pathologies and its potential as a therapeutic target in disorders such as stress coping, addiction, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and pain. Cannabis is gaining popularity as a recreational substance as well as a medicine, and multiple eCB-based drugs are under development. In this context, it is critical to understand eCB-mediated signaling in its multi-faceted complexity. Indeed, the bidirectional nature of eCB-based neuromodulation may offer an important key to interpret the functions of the eCB system and how it is impacted by cannabis and other drugs.</p>

<p>Imbalance in redox homeostasis is a major cause of age-related cognitive impairment. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key player in regulating synaptic transmission, plasticity and memory. Increasing evidence indicates an important interplay between the two systems. However, how excessive oxidative stress could alter ECS and that, in turn, impairs its modulatory role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function remains elusive. In the present study, we examined this causal link in D-galactose-induced oxidative rats. First, the reactive oxygen species generating enzymes, especially nitric oxide synthase (NOS), indeed show an elevated expression in D-galactose-treated rats, and this was correlated to an impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory loss in animal behavioral tests. Second, the cannabinoid receptor type I (CB1)-mediated signaling is known to regulate synaptic plasticity. We show that a decrease in CB1 and increase in degradation enzymes for CB1 ligand endocannabinoid anandamide all occurred to D-galactose-treated rats. Surprisingly, application of low-dose anandamide, known to reduce LTP under physiological condition, now acted to enhance LTP in D-galactose-treated rats, most likely resulted from the inhibition of GABAergic synapses. Furthermore, this reversal behavior of CB1-signaling could be fully simulated by a NOS inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium. These observations suggest that interaction between redox dysfunction and ECS should contribute significantly to the impaired synaptic plasticity and memory loss in D-galactose-treated rats. Therefore, therapies focusing on the balance of these two systems may shed lights on the treatment of age-related cognitive impairment in the future.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifactorial disease, characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons that eventually leads to paralysis and death. The current ALS-approved drugs modestly change the clinical course of the disease. The mechanism by which motor neurons progressively degenerate remains unclear but entails a non-cell autonomous process. Astrocytes impaired biological functionality were implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer disease (AD). In ALS disease patients, A1 reactive astrocytes were found to play a key role in the pathology of ALS disease and death of motor neurons, via loss or gain of function or acquired toxicity. The contribution of astrocytes to the maintenance of motor neurons by diverse mechanisms makes them a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ALS. Therapeutic approaches targeting at modulating the function of endogenous astrocytes or replacing lost functionality by transplantation of healthy astrocytes, may contribute to the development of therapies which might slow down or even halt the progression ALS diseases. The proposed mechanisms by which astrocytes can potentially ameliorate ALS progression and the status of ALS clinical studies involving astrocytes are discussed.</p>

Background<p>Encephalitis is a common central nervous system inflammatory disease that seriously endangers human health owing to the lack of effective diagnostic methods, which leads to a high rate of misdiagnosis and mortality. Glutamate is implicated closely in microglial activation, and activated microglia are key players in encephalitis. Hence, using glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) imaging for the early diagnosis of encephalitis holds promise.</p>Methods<p>The sensitivity of GluCEST imaging with different concentrations of glutamate and other major metabolites in the brain was validated in phantoms. Twenty-seven Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats with encephalitis induced by Staphylococcus aureus infection were used for preclinical research of GluCEST imaging in a 7.0-Tesla scanner. For the clinical study, six patients with encephalitis, six patients with lacunar infarction, and six healthy volunteers underwent GluCEST imaging in a 3.0-Tesla scanner.</p>Results<p>The number of amine protons on glutamate that had a chemical shift of 3.0 ppm away from bulk water and the signal intensity of GluCEST were concentration-dependent. Under physiological conditions, glutamate is the main contributor to the GluCEST signal. Compared with normal tissue, in both rats and patients with encephalitis, the encephalitis areas demonstrated a hyper-intense GluCEST signal, while the lacunar infarction had a decreased GluCEST signal intensity. After intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, patients with encephalitis lesions showed a decrease in GluCEST signal, and the results were significantly different from the pre-treatment signal (1.34 ± 0.31 vs 5.0 ± 0.27%, respectively; p = 0.000).</p>Conclusion<p>Glutamate plays a role in encephalitis, and the GluCEST imaging signal has potential as an in vivo imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of encephalitis. GluCEST will provide new insight into encephalitis and help improve the differential diagnosis of brain disorders.</p>

<p>As functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is developed as a neuroimaging technique and becomes an option to study a variety of populations and tasks, the reproducibility of the fNIRS signal is still subject of debate. By performing test–retest protocols over different functional tasks, several studies agree that the fNIRS signal is reproducible over group analysis, but the inter-subject and within-subject reproducibility is poor. The high variability at the first statistical level is often attributed to global systemic physiology. In the present work, we revisited the reproducibility of the fNIRS signal during a finger-tapping task across multiple sessions on the same and different days. We expanded on previous studies by hypothesizing that the lack of spatial information of the optodes contributes to the low reproducibility in fNIRS, and we incorporated a real-time neuronavigation protocol to provide accurate cortical localization of the optodes. Our proposed approach was validated in 10 healthy volunteers, and our results suggest that the addition of neuronavigation can increase the within-subject reproducibility of the fNIRS data, particularly in the region of interest. Unlike traditional approaches to positioning the optodes, in which low intra-subject reproducibility has been found, we were able to obtain consistent and robust activation of the contralateral primary motor cortex at the intra-subject level using a neuronavigation protocol. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that at least part of the variability in fNIRS cannot be only attributed to global systemic physiology. The use of neuronavigation to guide probe positioning, as proposed in this work, has impacts to longitudinal protocols performed with fNIRS.</p>

<p>This study examined stepping accuracy, gaze behavior, and state-anxiety in children with (N = 21, age M = 10.81, SD = 1.89) and without (N = 18, age M = 11.39, SD = 2.06) developmental coordination disorder (DCD) during an adaptive locomotion task. Participants walked at a self-selected pace along a pathway, placing their foot into a raised rectangular floor-based target box followed by either no obstacles, one obstacle, or two obstacles. Stepping kinematics and accuracy were determined using three-dimensional motion capture, whilst gaze was determined using mobile eye-tracking equipment. The children with DCD displayed greater foot placement error and variability when placing their foot within the target box and were more likely to make contact with its edges than their typically developing (TD) peers. The DCD group also displayed greater variability in the length and width of their steps in the approach to the target box. No differences were observed between groups in any of the gaze variables measured, in mediolateral velocity of the center of mass during the swing phase into the target box, or in the levels of self-reported state-anxiety experienced prior to facing each task. We therefore provide the first quantifiable evidence that deficits to foot placement accuracy and precision may be partially responsible for the increased incidence of trips and falls in DCD, and that these deficits are likely to occur independently from gaze behavior and state-anxiety.</p>

<p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience are impressive. In AI, this includes the development of computer programs that can beat a grandmaster at GO or outperform human radiologists at cancer detection. A great deal of these technological developments are directly related to progress in artificial neural networks—initially inspired by our knowledge about how the brain carries out computation. In parallel, neuroscience has also experienced significant advances in understanding the brain. For example, in the field of spatial navigation, knowledge about the mechanisms and brain regions involved in neural computations of cognitive maps—an internal representation of space—recently received the Nobel Prize in medicine. Much of the recent progress in neuroscience has partly been due to the development of technology used to record from very large populations of neurons in multiple regions of the brain with exquisite temporal and spatial resolution in behaving animals. With the advent of the vast quantities of data that these techniques allow us to collect there has been an increased interest in the intersection between AI and neuroscience, many of these intersections involve using AI as a novel tool to explore and analyze these large data sets. However, given the common initial motivation point—to understand the brain—these disciplines could be more strongly linked. Currently much of this potential synergy is not being realized. We propose that spatial navigation is an excellent area in which these two disciplines can converge to help advance what we know about the brain. In this review, we first summarize progress in the neuroscience of spatial navigation and reinforcement learning. We then turn our attention to discuss how spatial navigation has been modeled using descriptive, mechanistic, and normative approaches and the use of AI in such models. Next, we discuss how AI can advance neuroscience, how neuroscience can advance AI, and the limitations of these approaches. We finally conclude by highlighting promising lines of research in which spatial navigation can be the point of intersection between neuroscience and AI and how this can contribute to the advancement of the understanding of intelligent behavior.</p>

<p>Efficient methods for visualizing cell morphology in the intact animal are of great benefit to the study of structural development in the nervous system. Quantitative analysis of the complex arborization patterns of brain cells informs cell-type classification, dissection of neuronal circuit wiring, and the elucidation of growth and plasticity mechanisms. Time-lapse single-cell morphological analysis requires labeling and imaging of single cells in situ without contamination from the ramified processes of other nearby cells. Here, using the Xenopus laevis optic tectum as a model system, we describe CRE-Mediated Single-Cell Labeling by Electroporation (CREMSCLE), a technique we developed based on bulk co-electroporation of Cre-dependent inducible expression vectors, together with very low concentrations of plasmid encoding Cre recombinase. This method offers efficient, sparse labeling in any brain area where bulk electroporation is possible. Unlike juxtacellular single-cell electroporation methods, CREMSCLE relies exclusively on the bulk electroporation technique, circumventing the need to precisely position a micropipette next to the target cell. Compared with viral transduction methods, it is fast and safe, generating high levels of expression within 24 h of introducing non-infectious plasmid DNA. In addition to increased efficiency of single-cell labeling, we confirm that CREMSCLE also allows for efficient co-expression of multiple gene products in the same cell. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method is particularly well-suited for labeling immature neurons to follow their maturation over time. This approach therefore lends itself well to time-lapse morphological studies, particularly in the context of early neuronal development and under conditions that prevent more difficult visualized juxtacellular electroporation.</p>

<p>The neocortex performs a wide range of functions, including working memory, sensory perception, and motor planning. Despite this diversity in function, evidence suggests that the neocortex is made up of repeating subunits (“macrocolumns”), each of which is largely identical in circuitry. As such, the specific computations performed by these macrocolumns are of great interest to neuroscientists and AI researchers. Leading theories of this microcircuit include models of predictive coding, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM), and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). However, these models have not yet explained: (1) how microcircuits learn sequences input with delay (i.e., working memory); (2) how networks of columns coordinate processing on precise timescales; or (3) how top-down attention modulates sensory processing. I provide a theory of the neocortical microcircuit that extends prior models in all three ways. Additionally, this theory provides a novel working memory circuit that extends prior models to support simultaneous multi-item storage without disrupting ongoing sensory processing. I then use this theory to explain the functional origin of a diverse set of experimental findings, such as cortical oscillations.</p>

<p>Digital reconstruction or tracing of 3D tree-like neuronal structures from optical microscopy images is essential for understanding the functionality of neurons and reveal the connectivity of neuronal networks. Despite the existence of numerous tracing methods, reconstructing a neuron from highly noisy images remains challenging, particularly for neurites with low and inhomogeneous intensities. Conducting deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation prior to neuron tracing facilitates an approach to solving this problem via separation of weak neurites from a noisy background. However, large manual annotations are needed in deep learning-based methods, which is labor-intensive and limits the algorithm’s generalization for different datasets. In this study, we present a weakly supervised learning method of a deep CNN for neuron reconstruction without manual annotations. Specifically, we apply a 3D residual CNN as the architecture for discriminative neuronal feature extraction. We construct the initial pseudo-labels (without manual segmentation) of the neuronal images on the basis of an existing automatic tracing method. A weakly supervised learning framework is proposed via iterative training of the CNN model for improved prediction and refining of the pseudo-labels to update training samples. The pseudo-label was iteratively modified via mining and addition of weak neurites from the CNN predicted probability map on the basis of their tubularity and continuity. The proposed method was evaluated on several challenging images from the public BigNeuron and Diadem datasets, to fMOST datasets. Owing to the adaption of 3D deep CNNs and weakly supervised learning, the presented method demonstrates effective detection of weak neurites from noisy images and achieves results similar to those of the CNN model with manual annotations. The tracing performance was significantly improved by the proposed method on both small and large datasets (&gt;100 GB). Moreover, the proposed method proved to be superior to several novel tracing methods on original images. The results obtained on various large-scale datasets demonstrated the generalization and high precision achieved by the proposed method for neuron reconstruction.</p>

<p>Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD) caused by Presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations is characterized by early onset, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Impaired gamma secretase function favors production of longer beta-amyloid species in PS1 FAD. The PS1 E280A mutation is the largest FAD kindred under study. Here, we studied beta-amyloid deposits in PS1 E280A FAD brains in comparison to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD). We analyzed cortices and cerebellum from 10 FAD and 10 SAD brains using immunohistochemistry to determine total beta-amyloid, hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), and specific beta-amyloid peptides 1-38, 1-40, 1-42, and 1-43. Additionally, we studied beta-amyloid subspecies by ELISA, and vessel pathology was detected with beta-amyloid 1-42 and truncated pyroglutamylated beta-amyloid antibodies. There were no significant differences in total beta-amyloid signal between SAD and FAD. Beta-amyloid 1-38 and 1-43 loads were increased, and 1-42 loads were decreased in frontal cortices of SAD when compared to FAD. Beta-amyloid species assessment by ELISA resembled our findings by immunohistochemical analysis. Differences in beta-amyloid 1-38 and 1-42 levels between SAD and FAD were evidenced by using beta-amyloid length-specific antibodies, reflecting a gamma secretase-dependent shift in beta-amyloid processing in FAD cases. The use of beta-amyloid length-specific antibodies for postmortem assessment of beta-amyloid pathology can differentiate between SAD and PS1 FAD cases and it can be useful for identification of SAD cases potentially affected with gamma secretase dysfunction.</p>

<p>Background: Cognitive frailty (CF) is defined as the simultaneous presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment among older adults without dementia. Previous studies have revealed that neuropathological changes may contribute to the degeneration of subcortical nuclei in the process of cognitive impairment. However, it is unclear in CF. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in subcortical nuclei in older adults with CF and their relationship with cognitive decline and physical frailty.</p><p>Methods: A total of 26 older adults with CF and 26 matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Cognitive function and physical frailty were assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (Fuzhou version) and the Chinese version of the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS). Volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of subcortical nuclei were measured with structural and DTI brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compared between groups. Partial correlation analysis was conducted between subcortical nuclei volumes, MoCA scores, and physical frailty indexes.</p><p>Results: Significant volume reductions were found in five subcortical nuclei, including the bilateral thalami, left caudate, right pallidum, and accumbens area, in older adults with CF (P &lt; 0.05), and the bilateral thalami was most obvious. Decreased fractional anisotropy and relative anisotropy values were observed only in the left thalamus in the CF group (P &lt; 0.05). No group differences were found in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The MoCA scores were positively correlated with the volumes of the bilateral thalami, right pallidum, and accumbens area (P &lt; 0.05). Negative correlations were found between the physical frailty index and the volumes of the bilateral thalami, caudate, pallidum, and right accumbens area (P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Microstructural changes occur in the subcortical nuclei of older adults with CF, and these changes are correlated with cognitive decline and physical frailty. Therefore, microstructural atrophy of the subcortical nuclei may be involved in the pathological progression of CF.</p>

Animals and humans evolved sophisticated nervous systems that endowed them with the ability to form internal-models or beliefs and make predictions about the future to survive and flourish in a world in which future outcomes are often uncertain. Crucial to this capacity is the ability to adjust behavioral and learning policies in response to the level of uncertainty. Until recently, the neuronal mechanisms that could underlie such uncertainty-guided control have been largely unknown. In this review, I discuss newly discovered neuronal circuits in primates that represent uncertainty about future rewards and propose how they guide information-seeking, attention, decision-making, and learning to help us survive in an uncertain world.

<p>by Philipp Schneider, Axel von Kamp, Steffen Klamt</p>

The concept of minimal cut sets (MCS) provides a flexible framework for analyzing properties of metabolic networks and for computing metabolic intervention strategies. In particular, it has been used to support the targeted design of microbial strains for bio-based production processes. Herein we present a number of major extensions that generalize the existing MCS approach and broaden its scope for applications in metabolic engineering. We first introduce a modified approach to integrate gene-protein-reaction associations (GPR) in the metabolic network structure for the computation of gene-based intervention strategies. In particular, we present a set of novel compression rules for GPR associations, which effectively speedup the computation of gene-based MCS by a factor of up to one order of magnitude. These rules are not specific for MCS and as well applicable to other computational strain design methods. Second, we enhance the MCS framework by allowing the definition of multiple target (undesired) and multiple protected (desired) regions. This enables precise tailoring of the metabolic solution space of the designed strain with unlimited flexibility. Together with further generalizations such as individual cost factors for each intervention, direct combinations of reaction/gene deletions and additions as well as the possibility to search for substrate co-feeding strategies, the scope of the MCS framework could be broadly extended. We demonstrate the applicability and performance benefits of the described developments by computing (gene-based) <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain designs for the bio-based production of 2,3-butanediol, a chemical, that has recently received much attention in the field of metabolic engineering. With our extended framework, we could identify promising strain designs that were formerly unpredictable, including those based on substrate co-feeding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v3gT-h3RCy8" width="1" />

<p>by William Davis Haselden, Ravi Teja Kedarasetti, Patrick J. Drew</p>

Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that plays an important role in neurovascular coupling. NO produced by neurons diffuses into the smooth muscle surrounding cerebral arterioles, driving vasodilation. However, the rate of NO degradation in hemoglobin is orders of magnitude higher than in brain tissue, though how this might impact NO signaling dynamics is not completely understood. We used simulations to investigate how the spatial and temporal patterns of NO generation and degradation impacted dilation of a penetrating arteriole in cortex. We found that the spatial location of NO production and the size of the vessel both played an important role in determining its responsiveness to NO. The much higher rate of NO degradation and scavenging of NO in the blood relative to the tissue drove emergent vascular dynamics. Large vasodilation events could be followed by post-stimulus constrictions driven by the increased degradation of NO by the blood, and vasomotion-like 0.1–0.3 Hz oscillations could also be generated. We found that these dynamics could be enhanced by elevation of free hemoglobin in the plasma, which occurs in diseases such as malaria and sickle cell anemia, or following blood transfusions. Finally, we show that changes in blood flow during hypoxia or hyperoxia could be explained by altered NO degradation in the parenchyma. Our simulations suggest that many common vascular dynamics may be emergent phenomena generated by NO degradation by the blood or parenchyma.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gD5wzUCSmDA" width="1" />

<p>by Margaret L. DeMaegd, Wolfgang Stein</p>

Action potentials are a key component of neuronal communication and their precise timing is critical for processes like learning, memory, and complex behaviors. Action potentials propagate through long axons to their postsynaptic partners, which requires axons not only to faithfully transfer action potentials to distant synaptic regions but also to maintain their timing. This is particularly challenging when axons differ in their morphological and physiological properties, as timing is predicted to diverge between these axons when extrinsic conditions change. It is unknown if and how diverse axons maintain timing during temperature changes that animals and humans encounter. We studied whether ambient temperature changes cause different timing in the periphery of neurons that centrally produce temperature-robust activity. In an approach combining modeling, imaging, and electrophysiology, we explored mechanisms that support timing by exposing the axons of three different neuron types from the same crustacean (<i>Cancer borealis</i>) motor circuit and involved in the same functional task to a range of physiological temperatures. We show that despite substantial differences between axons, the effects of temperature on action potential propagation were moderate and supported temperature-robust timing over long-distances. Our modeling demonstrates that to maintain timing, the underlying channel properties of these axons do not need to be temperature-insensitive or highly restricted, but coordinating the temperature sensitivities of the Sodium activation gate time constant and the maximum Sodium conductance is required. Thus, even highly temperature-sensitive ion channel properties can support temperature-robust timing between distinct neuronal types and across long distances.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1J3KcNtroxI" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1VHzBX3PoEg/article">A circuit model of auditory cortex</a></h4>

<p>by Youngmin Park, Maria N. Geffen</p>

The mammalian sensory cortex is composed of multiple types of inhibitory and excitatory neurons, which form sophisticated microcircuits for processing and transmitting sensory information. Despite rapid progress in understanding the function of distinct neuronal populations, the parameters of connectivity that are required for the function of these microcircuits remain unknown. Recent studies found that two most common inhibitory interneurons, parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin-(SST) positive interneurons control sound-evoked responses, temporal adaptation and network dynamics in the auditory cortex (AC). These studies can inform our understanding of parameters for the connectivity of excitatory-inhibitory cortical circuits. Specifically, we asked whether a common microcircuit can account for the disparate effects found in studies by different groups. By starting with a cortical rate model, we find that a simple current-compensating mechanism accounts for the experimental findings from multiple groups. They key mechanisms are two-fold. First, PVs compensate for reduced SST activity when thalamic inputs are strong with less compensation when thalamic inputs are weak. Second, SSTs are generally disinhibited by reduced PV activity regardless of thalamic input strength. These roles are augmented by plastic synapses. These roles reproduce the differential effects of PVs and SSTs in stimulus-specific adaptation, forward suppression and tuning-curve adaptation, as well as the influence of PVs on feedforward functional connectivity in the circuit.

<p>by Xiao Zheng, Yuan Huang, Xiufen Zou</p>

Disease development and cell differentiation both involve dynamic changes; therefore, the reconstruction of dynamic gene regulatory networks (DGRNs) is an important but difficult problem in systems biology. With recent technical advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), large volumes of scRNA-seq data are being obtained for various processes. However, most current methods of inferring DGRNs from bulk samples may not be suitable for scRNA-seq data. In this work, we present scPADGRN, a novel DGRN inference method using “time-series” scRNA-seq data. scPADGRN combines the preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers with cell clustering for DGRN reconstruction. It exhibits advantages in accuracy, robustness and fast convergence. Moreover, a quantitative index called Differentiation Genes’ Interaction Enrichment (DGIE) is presented to quantify the interaction enrichment of genes related to differentiation. From the DGIE scores of relevant subnetworks, we infer that the functions of embryonic stem (ES) cells are most active initially and may gradually fade over time. The communication strength of known contributing genes that facilitate cell differentiation increases from ES cells to terminally differentiated cells. We also identify several genes responsible for the changes in the DGIE scores occurring during cell differentiation based on three real single-cell datasets. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analyses based on network inference coupled with quantitative computations can reveal key transcriptional regulators involved in cell differentiation and disease development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kywao3Rf5pI" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine associations of molecular markers of brain insulin signaling with Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognition among older persons with or without diabetes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This clinical–pathologic study was derived from a community‐based cohort study, the Religious Orders Study. We studied 150 individuals (mean age at death =87 years, 48% women): 75 with and 75 without diabetes (matched by sex on age at death and education). Using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo stimulation of brain tissue with insulin, we assessed insulin signaling in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus cortex. Postmortem data documented AD neuropathology. Clinical evaluations documented cognitive function proximate to death, based on 17 neuropsychological tests. In adjusted regression analyses, we examined associations of brain insulin signaling with diabetes, AD, and level of cognition.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain insulin receptor substrate‐1 (IRS1) phosphorylation (pS<sup>307</sup>IRS1/total IRS1) and serine/threonine‐protein kinase (AKT) phosphorylation (pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1/total AKT1) were similar in persons with or without diabetes. AKT phosphorylation was associated with the global AD pathology score (<i>p = </i> 0.001). In contrast, IRS1 phosphorylation was not associated with AD (<i>p </i> = 0.536). No other associations of insulin signaling were found with the global AD score, including when using the ex vivo brain insulin stimulation method. In secondary analyses, normalized pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1 was positively correlated with both the amyloid burden and tau tangle density, and no other associations of brain insulin signaling with neuropathology were observed. Moreover, normalized pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1 was associated with a lower level of global cognitive function (estimate = −0.212, standard error = 0.097; <i>p </i> = 0.031).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Brain AKT phosphorylation, a critical node in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors, is associated with AD neuropathology and lower cognitive function. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic variants of the cytoplasmic FMR1‐interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2 </i>) encoding an actin‐regulatory protein are associated with brain disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy. However, specific in vivo neuronal defects and potential treatments for <i>CYFIP2 </i>‐associated brain disorders remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized <i>Cyfip2 </i> heterozygous (<i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup>) mice to understand their neurobehavioral phenotypes and the underlying pathological mechanisms. Furthermore, we examined a potential treatment for such phenotypes of the <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>
   <i>+/− </i>
</sup> mice and specified a neuronal function mediating its efficacy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed behavioral analyses of <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice. We combined molecular, ultrastructural, and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological analyses of <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> prefrontal neurons. We also selectively reduced CYFIP2 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice with virus injections.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice exhibited lithium‐responsive abnormal behaviors. We found increased filamentous actin, enlarged dendritic spines, and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability in the adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> PFC that was restricted to layer 5 (L5) neurons. Consistently, adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice showed increased seizure susceptibility and auditory steady‐state responses from the cortical electroencephalographic recordings. Among the identified prefrontal defects, lithium selectively normalized the hyperexcitability of <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> L5 neurons. RNA sequencing revealed reduced expression of potassium channel genes in the adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> PFC. Virus‐mediated reduction of CYFIP2 in the PFC was sufficient to induce L5 hyperexcitability and lithium‐responsive abnormal behavior.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that L5‐specific prefrontal dysfunction, especially hyperexcitability, underlies both the pathophysiology and the lithium‐mediated amelioration of neurobehavioral phenotypes in adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice, which can be implicated in <i>CYFIP2 </i>‐associated brain disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Co‐incubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the HPC but increased binding in the PFC relative to control. Co‐incubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g. periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress (OS) contributes to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. OS can be a result of increased reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, reduced antioxidants, oxidatively damaged molecules, and/or a combination of these factors. Scientific literature is scarce for the markers of OS-specific for detecting AD at an early stage. The first aim of the current review is to provide an overview of the potential OS markers in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and/or urine that can be used for early diagnosis of human AD. The reason for exploring OS markers is that the proposed antioxidant therapies against AD appear to start too late to be effective. The second aim is to evaluate the evidence for natural antioxidants currently proposed to prevent or treat AD symptoms. To address these two aims, we critically evaluated the studies on humans in which various OS markers for detecting AD at an early stage were presented. Non-invasive OS markers that can detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD at an early stage in humans with greater specificity and sensitivity are primarily related to lipid peroxidation. However, a combination of OS markers, family history, and other biochemical tests are needed to detect the disease early on. We also report that the long-term use of vitamins (vitamin E as in almonds) and polyphenol-rich foods (curcumin/curcuminoids of turmeric, ginkgo biloba, epigallocatechin-3-gallate in green tea) seem justified for ameliorating AD symptoms. Future research on humans is warranted to justify the use of natural antioxidants.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify the genetic cause for progressive peripheral nerve disease in a Venezuelan family.</p>


<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Despite the growing list of genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, many patients with axonal forms lack a genetic diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pedigree was constructed, based on family clinical data. Next‐generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was performed for six affected family members. Muscle biopsies from four family members were used for analysis of muscle histology and ultrastructure, mtDNA sequencing, and RNA quantification. Ultrastructural studies were performed on sensory nerve biopsies from two affected family members.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Electrodiagnostic testing showed a motor and sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Pedigree analysis revealed inheritance only through the maternal line, consistent with mitochondrial transmission. Sequencing of mtDNA identified a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Val</sup> (mt‐tRNA<sup>Val</sup>) gene, m.1661A&gt;G, present at nearly 100% heteroplasmy, which disrupts a Watson‐Crick base pair in the T‐stem‐loop. Muscle biopsies showed chronic denervation/reinnervation changes, while biochemical analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme activities showed reduction in multiple ETC complexes. Northern blots from skeletal muscle total RNA showed severe reduction in abundance of mt‐tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, and mildly increased mt‐tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, in subjects compared to unrelated age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Nerve biopsies from two affected family members demonstrated ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities (hyperplasia, hypertrophy, crystalline arrays) consistent with a mitochondrial neuropathy.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We identify a previously unreported cause of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, a mutation in the mt‐tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, in a Venezuelan family. This work expands the list of CMT‐associated genes from protein‐coding genes to a mitochondrial tRNA gene.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Excitatory synapse formation begins in mid‐fetal gestation. However, due to our inability to image fetal synaptogenesis, the initial formation of synapses remains understudied. The recent development of human fetal brain spheroids provides access to this critical period of synapse formation. Using human neurons and brain spheroids, we address how altered actin regulation impacts the formation of excitatory synapses during fetal brain development. Prior to synapse formation, inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling promotes neurite elongation and branching. In addition to increasing neural complexity, ROCK inhibition increases the length of protrusions along the neurite, ultimately promoting excitatory synapse formation in human cortical brain spheroids. A corresponding increase in Rac1‐driven actin polymerization drives this increase in excitatory synaptogenesis. Using STORM super‐resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that actomyosin regulators, including the Rac1 regulator, α‐PIX, and the RhoA regulator, p115‐RhoGEF, localize to nascent excitatory synapses, where they preferentially localize to postsynaptic compartments. These results demonstrate that coordinated RhoGTPase activities underlie the initial formation of excitatory synapses and identify critical cytoskeletal regulators of early synaptogenic events.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal theta oscillations show prominent changes in frequency and amplitude depending on behavioral state or cognitive demands. How these dynamic changes in theta oscillations contribute to the spatial and temporal organization of hippocampal cells, and ultimately behavior, remain unclear. We used low‐theta frequency optogenetic stimulation to pace coordination of cellular and network activity between the medial septum (MS) and hippocampus during baseline and MS stimulation while rats were at rest or performing a spatial accuracy task with a visible or hidden goal zone. Hippocampal receptivity to pan‐neuronal septal stimulation at low‐theta frequency was primarily determined by speed and secondarily by task demands. Competition between artificial and endogenous field potentials at theta frequency attenuated hippocampal phase preference relative to local theta, but the spike‐timing activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells was effectively driven by artificial septal output, particularly during the hidden goal task. Notwithstanding temporal reorganization by artificial theta stimulation, place field properties were unchanged and alterations to spatial behavior were limited to goal zone approximation. Our results indicate that even a low‐theta frequency timing signal in the septohippocampal circuit is sufficient for spatial goal finding behavior. The results also advance a mechanistic understanding of how endogenous or artificial somatodendritic timing signals relate to displacement computations during navigation and spatial memory.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS) induces long‐term depression (LTD)‐like reduction of cortical excitability (DCS‐LTD), which has been tested in the treatment of epilepsy with modest effects. In part, this may be due to variable cortical neuron orientation relative to the electric field. We tested, in vivo and in vitro, whether DCS‐LTD occurs throughout the cortical thickness, and if not, then whether drug–DCS pairing can enhance the uniformity of the cortical response and the cDCS antiepileptic effect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cDCS‐mediated changes in cortical excitability were measured in vitro in mouse motor cortex (M1) and in human postoperative neocortex, in vivo in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), and in a mouse kainic acid (KA)‐seizure model. Contributions of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate–type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to cDCS‐mediated plasticity were tested with application of NMDAR blockers (memantine/D‐AP5).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>cDCS reliably induced DCS‐LTD in superficial cortical layers, and a long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like enhancement (DCS‐LTP) was recorded in deep cortical layers. Immunostaining confirmed layer‐specific increase of phospho‐S6 ribosomal protein in mouse M1. Similar nonuniform cDCS aftereffects on cortical excitability were also found in human neocortex in vitro and in S1 of alert mice in vivo. Application of memantine/D‐AP5 either produced a more uniform DCS‐LTD throughout the cortical thickness or at least abolished DCS‐LTP. Moreover, a combination of memantine and cDCS suppressed KA‐induced seizures.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>cDCS aftereffects are not uniform throughout cortical layers, which may explain the incomplete cDCS clinical efficacy. NMDAR antagonists may augment cDCS efficacy in epilepsy and other disorders where regional depression of cortical excitability is desirable. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has become a powerful tool for dissecting the molecular and pathological signatures of a variety of human diseases. However, the limited availability of biological samples from different disease stages is a major hurdle in studying disease progressions and identifying early pathological changes. Deep learning techniques have recently begun to be applied to analyze NGS data and thereby predict the progression of biological processes. In this study, we applied a deep learning technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict the molecular progress of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We successfully applied GANs to analyze RNA-seq data from a 5xFAD mouse model of AD, which recapitulates major AD features of massive amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. We examined how the generator is featured to have specific-sample generation and biological gene association. Based on the above observations, we suggested virtual disease progress by latent space interpolation to yield the transition curves of various genes with pathological changes from normal to AD state. By performing pathway analysis based on the transition curve patterns, we identified several pathological processes with progressive changes, such as inflammatory systems and synapse functions, which have previously been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Interestingly, our analysis indicates that alteration of cholesterol biosynthesis begins at a very early stage of AD, suggesting that it is the first effect to mediate the cholesterol metabolism of AD downstream of Aβ accumulation. Here, we suggest that GANs are a useful tool to study disease progression, leading to the identification of early pathological signatures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bhIz_qwVxII" width="1" />

<p>by Noor Seijdel, Nikos Tsakmakidis, Edward H. F. de Haan, Sander M. Bohte, H. Steven Scholte</p>

Feed-forward deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are, under specific conditions, matching and even surpassing human performance in object recognition in natural scenes. This performance suggests that the analysis of a loose collection of image features could support the recognition of natural object categories, without dedicated systems to solve specific visual subtasks. Research in humans however suggests that while feedforward activity may suffice for sparse scenes with isolated objects, additional visual operations ('routines') that aid the recognition process (e.g. segmentation or grouping) are needed for more complex scenes. Linking human visual processing to performance of DCNNs with increasing depth, we here explored if, how, and when object information is differentiated from the backgrounds they appear on. To this end, we controlled the information in both objects and backgrounds, as well as the relationship between them by adding noise, manipulating background congruence and systematically occluding parts of the image. Results indicate that with an increase in network depth, there is an increase in the distinction between object- and background information. For more shallow networks, results indicated a benefit of training on segmented objects. Overall, these results indicate that, de facto, scene segmentation can be performed by a network of sufficient depth. We conclude that the human brain could perform scene segmentation in the context of object identification without an explicit mechanism, by selecting or “binding” features that belong to the object and ignoring other features, in a manner similar to a very deep convolutional neural network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2f6aQtWdfSQ" width="1" />

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, <i>arginine vasotocin </i> (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni </i>, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, <i>in situ </i> hybridization for <i>avt </i>‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male <i>A. burtoni </i>, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain. Sensory information may be modulated by projections from the brain to the spinal cord, but the neural substrates for top‐down sensory control are incompletely understood. We identified a novel population of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brainstem, distinguished by their expression of prodynorphin, which we named LJA5. Here, we identify a similar group of <i>Pdyn+ </i> neurons in the human brainstem, and we define the efferent and afferent projection patterns of LJA5 neurons in mouse. Using specific genetic tools, we selectively traced the projections of the <i>Pdyn </i>‐expressing LJA5 neurons through the brain and spinal cord. Terminal fields were densest in the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG), lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), caudal pressor area, and lamina I of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and all levels of the spinal cord. We then labeled cell types in the PAG, LPB, medulla, and spinal cord to better define the specific targets of LJA5 boutons. LJA5 neurons send the only known inhibitory descending projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which transmits afferent pain, temperature, and itch information up to the brain. Using retrograde tracing, we found LJA5 neurons receive inputs from sensory and stress areas such as somatosensory/insular cortex, preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamus, PAG, and LPB. This pattern of inputs and outputs suggest LJA5 neurons are uniquely positioned to be activated by sensation and stress, and in turn, inhibit pain and itch.</p>

<p>Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithms (GEAs) rely on operators such as mutation
and recombination to introduce variation to the genotypes. Because of their
crucial role and effect on GEA performance, several studies have attempted to
model and quantify the variation induced by different operators on various
genotypic representations and GEAs. In this paper we focus on the popular
representations of integers from bit strings, and ask how sensitive these
particular representations are to variation operators, and in particular to
single-bit mutations.
</p>
<p>We approach this question from both theoretical and experimental
perspectives. First, we prove lower and upper bounds on the single-bit mutation
locality of any representation by reducing the problem to hypercube mappings.
We also compute an asymptotic limit for the distance distortion of any operator
and any representation. Then, our experiments replicate previous results on
mutation-based GEAs and examine the predictive power of the locality metrics we
compute. We primarily experiment with four representations in particular, two
of which have been extensively studied: Gray and standard binary encoding.
</p>
<p>Our main result is that the locality of standard binary encoding
representation is no worse---and sometimes better---than that of Gray encoding.
This result appears to contradict several past studies that found Gray to
outperform standard binary encoding for a large class of GEA problems. We
discuss various alternate explanations to Gray's better performance, but
conclude that single-bit mutation locality cannot be one of those. It may,
however, be useful for explaining the performance of GEAs during their
exploration phase.

<p>Many recurrent neural network machine learning paradigms can be formulated
using state-space representations. The classical notion of canonical
state-space realization is adapted in this paper to accommodate semi-infinite
inputs so that it can be used as a dimension reduction tool in the recurrent
networks setup. The so called input forgetting property is identified as the
key hypothesis that guarantees the existence and uniqueness (up to system
isomorphisms) of canonical realizations for causal and time-invariant
input/output systems with semi-infinite inputs. A second result uses the notion
of optimal reduction borrowed from the theory of symmetric Hamiltonian systems
to construct canonical realizations out of input forgetting but not necessarily
canonical ones. These two procedures are implemented and studied in detail in
the framework of linear fading memory input/output systems.

<p>Experimental characterization of neuronal dynamics involves recording both of
spontaneous activity patterns and of responses to transient and sustained
inputs. While much theoretical attention has been devoted to the spontaneous
activity of neurons, less is known about the dynamic mechanisms shaping their
responses to transient inputs, although these bear significant physiological
relevance. Here, we study responses to transient inputs in a widely used class
of neuron models (nonlinear adaptive hybrid models) well-known to reproduce a
number of biologically realistic behaviors. We focus on responses to transient
inputs that have been previously associated with Type III neurons, arguably the
least studied category in Hodgkin's classification, which are those neurons
that never exhibit continuous firing in response to sustained excitatory
currents. The two phenomena that we study are post-inhibitory facilitation, in
which an otherwise subthreshold excitatory input can induce a spike if it is
applied with proper timing after an inhibitory pulse, and slope detection, in
which a neuron spikes to a transient input only when the input's rate of change
is in a specific, bounded range. We analyze the origin of these phenomena in
nonlinear hybrid models and provide a geometric characterization of dynamical
structures associated with PIF in the system and an analytical study of slope
detection for tent inputs. While the necessary and sufficient conditions for
these behaviors are easily satisfied in neurons with Type III excitability, our
proofs are quite general and valid for neurons that do not exhibit Type III
excitability as well. This study therefore provides a framework for the
mathematical analysis of these responses to transient inputs associated with
Type III neurons in other systems and for advancing our understanding of these
systems' computational properties.

<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a novel computational paradigm that
captures some of efficiency of biological brains for inference and learning via
recursive processing and binary neural activations. Most existing training
algorithms for SNNs assume spiking neuron models in which a neuron outputs
individual spikes as a function of the dynamics of an internal state variable
known as membrane potential. This paper explores a more general model in which
each spiking neuron contains multiple compartments, each tracking the dynamics
of a distinct membrane potential, while sharing the same synaptic weights
across compartments. It is demonstrated that learning rules based on
probabilistic generalized linear neural models can leverage the presence of
multiple compartments through modern variational inference based on importance
weighting or generalized expectation-maximization. The key idea is to use the
neural compartments to sample multiple independent spiking signals from hidden
neurons so as to obtain better statistical estimates of the likelihood training
criterion. The derived online learning algorithms follow three-factor rules
with global learning signals. Experimental results on a structured output
memorization task and classification task with a standard neuromorphic data set
demonstrate significant improvements in terms of accuracy and calibration with
an increasing number of compartments.

<p>In recent years, algorithm research in the area of recommender systems has
shifted from matrix factorization techniques and their latent factor models to
neural approaches. However, given the proven power of latent factor models,
some newer neural approaches incorporate them within more complex network
architectures. One specific idea, recently put forward by several researchers,
is to consider potential correlations between the latent factors, i.e.,
embeddings, by applying convolutions over the user-item interaction map.
However, contrary to what is claimed in these articles, such interaction maps
do not share the properties of images where Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) are particularly useful. In this work, we show through analytical
considerations and empirical evaluations that the claimed gains reported in the
literature cannot be attributed to the ability of CNNs to model embedding
correlations, as argued in the original papers. Moreover, additional
performance evaluations show that all of the examined recent CNN-based models
are outperformed by existing non-neural machine learning techniques or
traditional nearest-neighbor approaches. On a more general level, our work
points to major methodological issues in recommender systems research.

<p>Animals exploit time to survive in the world. Temporal information is
required for higher-level cognitive abilities such as planning, decision
making, communication and effective cooperation. Since time is an inseparable
part of cognition, there is a growing interest in artificial intelligence to
time, which has a possibility of advancing the field. This study aims to
provide researchers with an interdisciplinary perspective on time. Firstly, we
briefly discussed the necessary information from psychology and neuroscience,
such as characteristics and models of time perception and related abilities.
Secondly, we investigated the emergent computational and robotic models of time
perception. As a result of the review, we observed that most timing models
showed a sign of dedicated time processing like the emergence of clock-like
mechanism from the neural network dynamics and revealed a relationship between
embodiment and time perception. We also noticed that most models of timing
developed for either sensory timing, the ability of assessment of an interval,
or motor timing, ability to reproduce an interval. Additionally, the number of
timing models capable of retrospective timing, which is the ability to track
time without paying attention, is insufficient. In this light, we discussed
possible research directions to promote interdisciplinary collaboration for
time perception.

<p>Body sway responses evoked by a horizontal acceleration of a level and firm
support surface are particular in that the vestibular information on body-space
angle BS resembles the proprioceptive information on body-foot angle BF. We
compared corresponding eyes-closed responses of vestibular-able (VA) and
vestibular-loss (VL) subjects, postulating a close correspondence. In
contradistinction to previous studies, we used an unpredictable (pseudorandom)
stimulus and found that the eyes-closed and eyes-open responses of the VA
closely resembled those of the VL subjects, as expected. We further conclude
that the vestibular signals coding head linear translation in VA subjects has
in this case too little functional relevance to cause a notable difference
between the subject groups.

<p>The analysis of brain connectivity aims to understand the emergence of
functional networks into the brain. This information can be used in the process
of electroencephalographic (EEG) signal analysis and classification for a
braincomputer interface (BCI). These systems provide an alternative channel of
communication and control to people with motor impairments. In this article,
four strategies for using the brain connectivity in a BCI environment as a tool
to obtain a deeper understanding of the cerebral mechanisms are proposed, with
the principal aim of developing a scheme oriented to neuro-rehabilitation of
gait in combination with different neurotechnologies and exoskeletons. This
scheme would allow improving current schemes and/or to design new control
strategies, as well as rehabilitation approaches.

<p>We study black-box adversarial attacks for image classifiers in a constrained
threat model, where adversaries can only modify a small fraction of pixels in
the form of scratches on an image. We show that it is possible for adversaries
to generate localized \textit{adversarial scratches} that cover less than $5\%$
of the pixels in an image and achieve targeted success rates of $98.77\%$ and
$97.20\%$ on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 trained ResNet-50 models, respectively. We
demonstrate that our scratches are effective under diverse shapes, such as
straight lines or parabolic B\a'ezier curves, with single or multiple colors.
In an extreme condition, in which our scratches are a single color, we obtain a
targeted attack success rate of $66\%$ on CIFAR-10 with an order of magnitude
fewer queries than comparable attacks. We successfully launch our attack
against Microsoft's Cognitive Services Image Captioning API and propose various
mitigation strategies.

<p>Morris-Lecar model is arguably the simplest dynamical model that retains both
the slow-fast geometry of excitable phase portraits and the physiological
interpretation of a conductance-based model. We augment this model with one
slow inward current to capture the additional property of bistability between a
resting state and a spiking limit cycle. The resulting dynamical system is a
core structure for many dynamical phenomena such as slow spiking and bursting.
We show how the proposed model combines physiological interpretation and
mathematical tractability and we discuss the benefits of the proposed approach
with respect to alternative models in the literature.

<p>Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) was established in the past decade as a potent approach to reveal non-trivial, time-varying properties of neural interactions – such as their multifractality or information content –, that otherwise remain hidden from conventional static methods. Several neuropsychiatric disorders were shown to be associated with altered DFC, with schizophrenia (SZ) being one of the most intensely studied among such conditions. Here we analyzed resting-state electroencephalography recordings of 14 SZ patients and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). We reconstructed dynamic functional networks from delta band (0.5–4 Hz) neural activity and captured their spatiotemporal dynamics in various global network topological measures. The acquired network measure time series were made subject to dynamic analyses including multifractal analysis and entropy estimation. Besides group-level comparisons, we built a classifier to explore the potential of DFC features in classifying individual cases. We found stronger delta-band connectivity, as well as increased variance of DFC in SZ patients. Surrogate data testing verified the true multifractal nature of DFC in SZ, with patients expressing stronger long-range autocorrelation and degree of multifractality when compared to controls. Entropy analysis indicated reduced temporal complexity of DFC in SZ. When using these indices as features, an overall cross-validation accuracy surpassing 89% could be achieved in classifying individual cases. Our results imply that dynamic features of DFC such as its multifractal properties and entropy are potent markers of altered neural dynamics in SZ and carry significant potential not only in better understanding its pathophysiology but also in improving its diagnosis. The proposed framework is readily applicable for neuropsychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia.</p>

<p>AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the CNS are normally impermeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but the aberrant expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) occurs in pathological conditions such as ischemia or epilepsy, or degenerative diseases such as ALS. Here, we show that select populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) similarly express high levels of CP-AMPARs in a mouse model of glaucoma. CP-AMPAR expression increased dramatically in both On sustained alpha and Off transient alpha RGCs, and this increase was prevented by genomic editing of the GluA2 subunit. On sustained alpha RGCs with elevated CP-AMPAR levels displayed profound synaptic depression, which was reduced by selectively blocking CP-AMPARs, buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup> with BAPTA, or with the CB1 antagonist AM251, suggesting that depression was mediated by a retrograde transmitter which might be triggered by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through CP-AMPARs. Thus, glaucoma may alter the composition of AMPARs and depress excitatory synaptic input in select populations of RGCs.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are neuronal disorders characterized by the loss of a large number of neurons in the human brain. Innate immunity-mediated neuroinflammation actively contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Inflammasomes are involved in the progression of the innate immune response and are responsible for the maturation of caspase-1 and inflammatory cytokines during neuroinflammation. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is one of the most intensively investigated inflammasomes, has been reported to play a key role in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we reviewed the mechanisms, role, and latest developments regarding the NLRP3 inflammasome with respect to three neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patient and animal model studies have found that abnormal protein aggregation of Aβ, synuclein, or copper–zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), which are the main proteins expressed in the three diseases, respectively, can activate microglial cells, induce increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release, and activate the NLRP3 pathway, leading to neurodegeneration. In contrast, a deficiency of the components of the NLRP3 pathway may inhibit Aβ, synuclein, or SOD1-induced microglial activation. These studies indicate a positive correlation between NLRP3 levels and abnormal protein aggregation. However, in the case of ALS, not only microglia but also astrocytes express increased NLRP3 levels and contribute to activation of the NLRP3 pathway. In addition, in this review article, we also focus on the therapeutic implications of targeting novel inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome or of novel drugs that mediate the NLRP3 pathway, which could play a role via NLRP3 in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>This special issue of Frontiers in Neuroscience-Neurodegeneration celebrates the 50th anniversary of John Olney’s seminal work introducing the concept of excitotoxicity as a mechanism for neuronal cell death. Since that time, fundamental research on the pathophysiological activation of glutamate receptors has played a central role in our understanding of excitotoxic cellular signaling pathways, leading to the discovery of many potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of acute or chronic/progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, excitotoxic signaling processes have been found repeatedly to be closely intertwined with oxidative cellular cascades. With this in mind, this review looks back at long-standing collaborative efforts by the authors linking cellular redox status and glutamate neurotoxicity, focusing first on the discovery of the redox modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, followed by the study of the oxidative conversion of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to the non-NMDA receptor agonist and neurotoxin 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (TOPA) quinone. Finally, we summarize our work linking oxidative injury to the liberation of zinc from intracellular metal binding proteins, leading to the uncovering of a signaling mechanism connecting excitotoxicity with zinc-activated cell death-signaling cascades.</p>

<p>The societal burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is staggering, with current estimates suggesting that 50 million people world-wide have AD. Identification of new therapeutic targets is a critical barrier to the development of disease-modifying therapies. A large body of data implicates vascular pathology and cardiovascular risk factors in the development of AD, indicating that there are likely shared pathological mediators. Inflammation plays a role in both cardiovascular disease and AD, and recent evidence has implicated elements of the coagulation system in the regulation of inflammation. In particular, the multifunctional serine protease thrombin has been found to act as a mediator of vascular dysfunction and inflammation in both the periphery and the central nervous system. In the periphery, thrombin contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis and diabetes, by inducing endothelial dysfunction and related inflammation. In the brain, thrombin has been found to act on endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in a manner that promotes vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Thrombin is elevated in the AD brain, and thrombin signaling has been linked to both tau and amyloid beta, pathological hallmarks of the disease. In AD mouse models, inhibiting thrombin preserves cognition and endothelial function and reduces neuroinflammation. Evidence linking atrial fibrillation with AD and dementia indicates that anticoagulant therapy may reduce the risk of dementia, with targeting thrombin shown to be particularly effective. It is time for “outside-the-box” thinking about how vascular risk factors, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, as well as the coagulation and inflammatory pathways interact to promote increased AD risk. In this review, we present evidence that thrombin is a convergence point for AD risk factors and as such that thrombin-based therapeutics could target multiple points of AD pathology, including neurodegeneration, vascular activation, and neuroinflammation. The urgent need for disease-modifying drugs in AD demands new thinking about disease pathogenesis and an exploration of novel drug targets, we propose that thrombin inhibition is an innovative tactic in the therapeutic battle against this devastating disease.</p>

<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a promising tool to enhance human motor skills. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms are not fully understood. On the other hand, neuroimaging modalities provide powerful tools to map some of the neurophysiological biomarkers associated with tES. Here, a comprehensive review was undertaken to summarize the neuroimaging evidence of how tES affects human motor skills. A literature search has been done on the PubMed database, and 46 relative articles were selected. After reviewing these articles, we conclude that neuroimaging techniques are feasible to be coupled with tES and offer valuable information of cortical excitability, connectivity, and oscillations regarding the effects of tES on human motor behavior. The biomarkers derived from neuroimaging could also indicate the motor performance under tES conditions. This approach could advance the understanding of tES effects on motor skill and shed light on a new generation of adaptive stimulation models.</p>

<p>As experimental neuroscience is moving toward more integrative approaches, with a variety of acquisition techniques covering multiple spatiotemporal scales, data management is becoming increasingly challenging for neuroscience laboratories. Often, datasets are too large to practically be stored on a laptop or a workstation. The ability to query metadata collections without retrieving complete datasets is therefore critical to efficiently perform new analyses and explore the data. At the same time, new experimental paradigms lead to constantly changing specifications for the metadata to be stored. Despite this, there is currently a serious lack of agile software tools for data management in neuroscience laboratories. To meet this need, we have developed Expipe, a lightweight data management framework that simplifies the steps from experiment to data analysis. Expipe provides the functionality to store and organize experimental data and metadata for easy retrieval in exploration and analysis throughout the experimental pipeline. It is flexible in terms of defining the metadata to store and aims to solve the storage and retrieval challenges of data/metadata due to ever changing experimental pipelines. Due to its simplicity and lightweight design, we envision Expipe as an easy-to-use data management solution for experimental laboratories, that can improve provenance, reproducibility, and sharing of scientific projects.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00304">Reinforcement and Punishment Shape the Learning Dynamics in fMRI Neurofeedback</a></h4>

Introduction<p>Neurofeedback (NF) using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven to be a valuable neuroscientific tool for probing cognition and promising therapeutic approach for several psychiatric disorders. Even though learning constitutes an elementary aspect of NF, the question whether certain training schemes might positively influence its dynamics has largely been neglected.</p>Methods<p>To address this issue, participants were trained to exert control on their subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal, receiving either exclusively positive reinforcement (PR, “positive feedback”) or also positive punishment (PP, “negative feedback”). The temporal dynamics of the learning process were investigated by individually modeling the feedback periods and trends, offering the possibility to assess activation changes within and across blocks, runs and sessions.</p>Results<p>The results show faster initial learning of the PR + PP group by significantly lower deactivations of the sgACC in the first session and stronger regulation trends during the first runs. Independent of the group, significant control over the sgACC could further be shown with but not without feedback.</p>Conclusion<p>The beneficial effect of PP is supported by previous findings of multiple research domains suggesting that error avoidance represents an important motivational factor of learning, which complements the reward spectrum. This hypothesis warrants further investigation with respect to NF, as it could offer a way to generally facilitate the process of gaining volitional control over brain activity.</p>
