	<p>Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) aims to hone motor skills and improve the quality of life. However, the non-repeatability of experimental results and the inconsistency of research conclusions have become a common phenomenon, which may be due to the imprecision of the experimental protocol, great variability of the participant characteristics within the group, and the irregularities of quantitative indicators. The aim of this study systematically summarised and analysed the effect of a-tDCS on lower extremity sensorimotor control under different experimental conditions. This narrative review was performed following the PRISMA guidelines until June 2022 in Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The findings of the present study demonstrated that a-tDCS can effectively improve the capabilities of lower extremity sensorimotor control, particularly in gait speed and time-on-task. Thus, a-tDCS can be used as an effective ergogenic technology to facilitate physical performance. In-depth and rigorous experimental protocol with larger sample sizes and combining brain imaging technology to explore the mechanism have a profound impact on the development of tDCS.</p>

	<p>Traditional cognitive linguistic theories acknowledge that human emotions are embodied, yet they fail to distinguish the dimensions that reflect the direction of neural signaling between the brain and body. Differences exist across languages and cultures in whether embodied emotions are conceptualized as afferent (feelings from the body) or efferent (enacted through the body). This important distinction has been neglected in academic discourse, arguably as a consequence of the &amp;amp;lsquo;lexical approach&amp;amp;rsquo;, and the dominance within the affective psychology of the cognitive and semantic models that overlook the role of interoception as an essential component of affective experience. Empirical and theoretical advances in human neuroscience are driving a reappraisal of the relationships between the mind, brain and body, with particular relevance to emotions. Allostatic (predictive) control of the internal bodily states is considered fundamental to the experience of emotions enacted through interoceptive sensory feelings and through the evoked physiological and physical actions mediated through efferent neural pathways. Embodied emotion concepts encompass these categorized outcomes of bidirectional brain&amp;amp;ndash;body interactions yet can be differentiated further into afferent or interoceptive and efferent or autonomic processes. Between languages, a comparison of emotion words indicates the dominance of afferent or interoceptive processes in how embodied emotions are conceptualized in Chinese, while efferent or autonomic processes feature more commonly in English. Correspondingly, in linguistic expressions of emotion, Chinese-speaking people are biased toward being more receptive, reflective, and adaptive, whereas native English speakers may tend to be more reactive, proactive, and interactive. Arguably, these distinct conceptual models of emotions may shape the perceived divergent values and &amp;amp;lsquo;national character&amp;amp;rsquo; of Chinese- and English-speaking cultures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Learning Spatiotemporal Properties of Hippocampal Place Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is well known that hippocampal place cells have spatiotemporal properties, namely, that they generally respond to a single spatial location of a small environment, and they also display the temporal response property of theta phase precession, namely, that the phase of spiking relative to the theta wave shifts from the late phase to early phase as the animal crosses the place field. Grid cells in Layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) also have spatiotemporal properties similar to hippocampal place cells, except that grid cells respond to multiple spatial locations that form a hexagonal pattern. Because the EC is the upstream area that projects strongly to the hippocampus, a number of EC-hippocampus learning models have been proposed to explain how the spatial receptive field properties of place cells emerge via synaptic plasticity. However, the question of how the phase precession properties of place cells and grid cells are related has remained unclear. This study shows how theta phase precession in hippocampal place cells can emerge from MEC input as a result of synaptic plasticity, demonstrating that a learning model based on non-negative sparse coding can account for both the spatial and temporal properties of hippocampal place cells. Although both MEC grid cells and other EC spatial cells contribute to the spatial properties of hippocampal place cells, it is the MEC grid cells that predominantly determine the temporal response properties of hippocampal place cells displayed here.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Viral load and gastrointestinal inflammation in COVID-19 patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: ACE-2 receptors are well-known as binding receptors to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 highly expressed in the gastrointestinal system. The Role of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and its effect on gut inflammation in COVID-19 patients are still not well-understood. This study aims to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on gastrointestinal inflammation. Methods: A total of 44 inpatient subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria were examined for cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from several nucleic levels based on fluorescence signal and calprotectin levels of stool samples using Calprotectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Results: Of 44 subjects, 52.3% were male, with a median age of 52.5 years. Hypertension or diabetes was found in 26 patients. The median cycle threshold value was 31.3 with a value range of 10.9-40.0, median cycle threshold was significantly lower in subjects with comorbidity with P = 0.01. The median fecal calprotectin level was 42 Î¼g/g with a value range of 5.1-1,393.7 Î¼g/g, with median fecal calprotectin significantly higher in subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms with P = 0.008 with a relative risk (RR) of 5.5. There was a significant correlation between cycle threshold and fecal calprotectin in subjects with comorbidity with P <0.05, a coefficient contingency of 0.414. Conclusion: Subjects with comorbidity are prone to have higher viral loads paralleled with gastrointestinal inflammation. Subjects with overt gastrointestinal manifestations had a five-fold higher degree of gut inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automated detection of over- and under-dispersion in baseline tables in randomised controlled trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Papers describing the results of a randomised trial should include a baseline table that compares the characteristics of randomised groups. Researchers who fraudulently generate trials often unwittingly create baseline tables that are implausibly similar (under-dispersed) or have large differences between groups (over-dispersed). I aimed to create an automated algorithm to screen for under- and over-dispersion in the baseline tables of randomised trials. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study I examined 2,245 randomised controlled trials published in health and medical journals on PubMed Central. I estimated the probability that a trial's baseline summary statistics were under- or over-dispersed using a Bayesian model that examined the distribution of t-statistics for the between-group differences, and compared this with an expected distribution without dispersion. I used a simulation study to test the ability of the model to find under- or over-dispersion and compared its performance with an existing test of dispersion based on a uniform test of p-values. My model combined categorical and continuous summary statistics, whereas the uniform uniform test used only continuous statistics. Results: The algorithm had a relatively good accuracy for extracting the data from baseline tables, matching well on the size of the tables and sample size. Using t-statistics in the Bayesian model out-performed the uniform test of p-values, which had many false positives for skewed, categorical and rounded data that were not under- or over-dispersed. For trials published on PubMed Central, some tables appeared under- or over-dispersed because they had an atypical presentation or had reporting errors. Some trials flagged as under-dispersed had groups with strikingly similar summary statistics. Conclusions: Automated screening for fraud of all submitted trials is challenging due to the widely varying presentation of baseline tables. The Bayesian model could be useful in targeted checks of suspected trials or authors.

                <p>by Hongli Ma, Han Wen, Zhiyuan Xue, Guojun Li, Zhaolei Zhang</p>

RNA molecules can adopt stable secondary and tertiary structures, which are essential in mediating physical interactions with other partners such as RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and in carrying out their cellular functions. In vivo and in vitro experiments such as RNAcompete and eCLIP have revealed in vitro binding preferences of RBPs to RNA oligomers and in vivo binding sites in cells. Analysis of these binding data showed that the structure properties of the RNAs in these binding sites are important determinants of the binding events; however, it has been a challenge to incorporate the structure information into an interpretable model. Here we describe a new approach, RNANetMotif, which takes predicted secondary structure of thousands of RNA sequences bound by an RBP as input and uses a graph theory approach to recognize enriched subgraphs. These enriched subgraphs are in essence shared sequence-structure elements that are important in RBP-RNA binding. To validate our approach, we performed RNA structure modeling via coarse-grained molecular dynamics folding simulations for selected 4 RBPs, and RNA-protein docking for LIN28B. The simulation results, e.g., solvent accessibility and energetics, further support the biological relevance of the discovered network subgraphs.

                Caecal volvulus (CV) is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, defined by an axial torsion of the caecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum around the mesenteric vascular pedicles, leading to ischemia and bowel necrosis. A 20-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, was admitted for generalized abdominal pain evolving for three days, along with constipation and abdominal distension, but with no vomiting. Physical examination showed a generalized abdominal tenderness with no rigidity or rebound tenderness, associated with abdominal distension and tympanic upon percussion. Laboratory findings were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed distension of a loop of the large bowel with its long axis extending from the right lower quadrant to the epigastrium or left upper quadrant. Colonic haustral pattern was absent. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a rounded focal collection of air-distended bowel with haustral creases in the upper left quadrant. In addition, spiraled loops of the collapsed cecum (giving a whirl sign) were noted, along with low-attenuating fatty mesentery from the twisted bowel. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy and caecectomy using GEA 80 charges. The patient had no complaints post-operation. CV is a rare cause of bowel obstruction, mainly caused by an exceedingly mobile caecum. Despite its rareness, CV represents the second most common cause of large bowel volvulus, behind sigmoid volvulus. For acute obstruction by CV, it is hard to differentiate it clinically from obstruction of the small bowel; therefore, radiological exams are needed. Surgery is the gold standard treatment for CV. We report a rare case of CV to highlight the rarity of this pathology, specify its diagnostic and therapeutic means, and its clinical and biological evolution.

                Background: This study aimed to determine the ameliorative effects of Physalis angulata leaf extract on L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced preeclampsia symptoms in rats. Methods: Phytochemical analysis of the extract was performed with liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=6). Preeclampsia rats were injected with L-NAME on gestation days 9 to 18 (G9â€“G18), while sham rats were injected with the same vehicle volume. Three groups of preeclampsia rats were orally supplemented with the extract at doses of 500, 1500, and 2500 mg/kg body weight/day on G12â€“G18. The tail-cuff method measured blood pressures. Spectrophotometry determined urine protein levels. Serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt)-1 levels were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum and placental malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured by colorimetry. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine tail artery endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), placental eNOS, and placental hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± expressions. Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) were counted using flow cytometry. Results: L-NAME injection increased blood pressures, 24-h total urine protein level, serum sFlt-1 level, serum and placental MDA levels, percentages of CACs and ECFCs, and placental HIF-1Î± expression. It also decreased serum and placental SOD activities, serum NO level, tail artery and placental eNOS expressions compared to the sham group. Physalis angulata leaf extract administration lowered blood pressures, urine protein level, sFlt-1 level, MDA levels, percentages of CACs and ECFCs, and placental HIF-1Î± expression. The extract increased SOD activities, NO level, tail artery and placental eNOS expressions compared to the preeclampsia group. Conclusions: Physalis angulata leaf extract reduces antiangiogenic factor and oxidative stress. It also enhances eNOS/NO signaling. Thus, it improves EPC and endothelial cell function and reverses L-NAME-induced hypertension and proteinuria in preeclampsia rats.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Optimal timing for lithium levels [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Reddy and Reddy (2014) discuss the optimal timing for lithium levels in patients taking once-daily extended-release lithium formulations. They argue for blood sampling 24 h after the previous dose rather than the standard 12 h. I interpret the data quite differently. The authors start with the assumption that the clinician wants a trough level. I disagree. What one wants is to be able to compare a patientâ€™s lithium level to the large body of published knowledge about lithium dosing. Almost all of that data comes from standard 12-h blood draws with plain (immediate-release) lithium carbonate or lithium citrate. So, the real question of interest is, with extended-release lithium formulations, at what time point does one draw the lithium level to compare most accurately with a standard 12-h blood draw with plain lithium carbonate? The answer is not obvious because extended-release formulations affect only the absorption and not the excretion of lithium. Their primary benefit is reducing the transient peak lithium serum concentration, not delaying the (already relatively slow) elimination of lithium. Emami and colleagues (2004) provide the needed data. First they show that 90% of the administered dose of a commercial extended-release formulation (Eskalith CRÂ®) is absorbed by 4 h after a dose, and ~100% is absorbed by 8 h (their Figure 2A). Second, they show that at 12 h after a dose, the blood levels for immediate and extended release formulations are essentially identical (their Figure 3).Â  Thus 12 h after the previous dose is the ideal time for drawing blood levels for extended-release lithium tablets.

                Hepatic Sodium Taurocholate cotransporter polypeptide (NTCP1) captures approximately 80% of the conjugated bile acids that come from the enterohepatic circulation. Transcriptionally, NTCP1 expression is activated by an RAR/RXR heterodimer, which is repressed by SHP when intracellular bile acids are high. In addition, NTCP1 activity is post-translational modulated by phosphorylation. However, whether NTCP1 could be regulated by acetylation is unknown. A bioinformatic analysis for the mouse NTCP1 protein sequence showed potential lysine acetylation sites. Thus, we evaluated taurocholate uptake in hepatocytes incubated with NAM, which induced a two-fold increase in the content of acetylated proteins. Interestingly, taurocholate uptake was reduced by 50% in hepatocytes incubated with NAM. These results demonstrate that acetylation mediates taurocholate uptake in hepatocytes possibly through modulation of NTCP1 activity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Long-term health after Severe Acute Malnutrition in children and adults- the role of the Pancreas (SAMPA): Protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal growth retardation may increase the risk of later chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes; however, long-term effects of wasting malnutrition in childhood or adulthood are less studied. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions, both critical for nutrition and NCD aetiology, may not fully recover following malnutrition. However, the evidence and mechanistic information is piecemeal. We hypothesise that wasting malnutrition at any age has long-term detrimental effects on endocrine and exocrine pancreatic structure and function. Methods: The SAMPA international research programme will assess pancreatic structure and function in 3700 participants from ongoing observational nutrition cohorts, two adolescent and four adult, in Zambia, Tanzania, Philippines, and India. Pancreas size, structure, and calcification will be assessed by ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan; exocrine function by faecal elastase and serum lipase; and endocrine function by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In-depth hormonal analyses of incretins, glucagon, proinsulin and trypsinogen during OGTT and intravenous glucose tolerance tests will be done in subsets of adult participants. Pancreatic size and function outcomes will be compared between people with and without prior wasting malnutrition. Analyses will investigate effect modification by sex, current age, time since malnutrition, current body mass index and dietary patterns. Mathematical modelling of OGTT data will be used to estimate the relative contribution to glucose dysregulation of decreased insulin production, changes in insulin clearance and increased insulin resistance. Proinsulin/insulin ratio will be analysed in archived samples from the Tanzanian cohort using a nested case-control design to investigate whether abnormal values precede diabetes. Conclusions: SAMPA, a large-scale multi-centre research programme using data from people with or without prior wasting malnutrition to assess several aspects of pancreatic phenotype, will provide coherent evidence for future policies and programmes for malnutrition and diabetes.

                Background: Physical activity and fitness level of fitness decline mostly between adolescence and early adulthood. This leads to risks of non-communicable diseases in the future. Medical students, assumed to have an extensive understanding of physical exercise and its benefits, are less active than they were before attending graduate school. This study aimed to assess changes in physical fitness and physical activity of students over-time. Methods: This was a prospective study undertaken at Basic Science Complex of Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital in Nepal. In total, 72 medical students were put through a modified Harvard step test during their first year and then three years later during their third year at medical school. Maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 max) was calculated subsequently by plotting the average pulse rate on the Astrand-Rhyming Nomogram. Results: The mean value of relative maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 max) decreased from first year to the third year. When the mean values of body mass index and relative maximum aerobic capacity were compared between first year and third year, the difference was found to be statistically significant (p-value=0.000). The physical fitness index and relative maximum aerobic capacity in both years were positively correlated r (70) = +.59, p<0.001(first year); r (70) = +.47, p<0.001(third year). Meanwhile, body mass index and relative maximum aerobic capacity in the third year were negatively correlated and statistically significant with r (70) = -0.23, p=.045. Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory fitness of the students steadily declined as they progressed through their academic years. Positive correlation between cardiorespiratory fitness and physical fitness index was established along with negative correlation between body mass index and cardiorespiratory fitness. The findings in this study expose the lack of fitness in youth as they focus more on academics, giving the impression that they forget to implement a fitness routine in their lifestyle.

                Liang etÂ al. discover that the DNA repair-related protein, HMCES, contributes to early development by maintaining a nodal/activin- or BMP-signaling-regulated transcriptional network. HMCES competitively binds chromatin to limit binding by R-SMAD proteins, resulting in repression of their regulatory effects. This reveals HMCES transcriptional regulatory function in TGF-Î² family signaling.

                Mechanisms underlying chronic colitis-associated tumorigenesis are unresolved. Melcher etÂ al. report distinct B cell-mediated protective mechanisms in chronic colitis versus colitis-associated colorectal cancer. B cell-derived IL-10 is essential to limit chronic inflammation, while specific IgA generated from IL-10+ B cells is implicated in the control of a tumor-protective microbiota.

                Backe etÂ al. demonstrate that responsiveness of the steroid hormone receptors upon ligand-binding-mediated activation depends on their association with specific Hsp90:co-chaperone (FNIP1, FNIP2, and Tsc1) subpopulations. This study reveals that formation of different Hsp90:co-chaperone:client complexes provide differentially primed pools of client proteins ready to act in different cellular environments.

                Mutations in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc) cause a stress hormone disorder called adrenal Cushingâ€™s syndrome. Omar etÂ al. uncover mislocalization as a required component of mutant-kinase pathology. Remarkably, two seemingly similar disease-causing PKAc variants diverge in subcellular localization, physiochemical properties, and downstream signaling pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Morphometric analysis of lungfish endocasts elucidates early dipnoan palaeoneurological evolution</a></h4>

              
                The lobe-finned fish, lungfish (Dipnoi, Sarcoptergii), have persisted for ~400 million years from the Devonian Period to present day. The evolution of their dermal skull and dentition is relatively well understood, but this is not the case for the central nervous system. While the brain has poor preservation potential and is not currently known in any fossil lungfish, substantial indirect information about it and associated structures (e.g. labyrinths) can be obtained from the cranial endocast. However, before the recent development of X-ray tomography as a palaeontological tool, these endocasts could not be studied non-destructively, and few detailed studies were undertaken. Here, we describe and illustrate the endocasts of six Palaeozoic lungfish from tomographic scans. We combine these with six previously described digital lungfish endocasts (4 fossil and 2 recent taxa) into a 12-taxon dataset for multivariate morphometric analysis using 17 variables. We find that the olfactory region is more highly plastic than the hindbrain, and undergoes significant elongation in several taxa. Further, while the semicircular canals covary as an integrated module, the utriculus and sacculus vary independently of each other. Functional interpretation suggests that olfaction has remained a dominant sense throughout lungfish evolution, and changes in the labyrinth may potentially reflect a change from nektonic to near-shore environmental niches. Phylogenetic implications show that endocranial form fails to support monophyly of the â€˜chirodipteridsâ€™. Those with elongated crania similarly fail to form a distinct clade, suggesting these two paraphyletic groups have converged towards either head elongation or truncation driven by non-phylogenetic constraints.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BK channel properties correlate with neurobehavioral severity in three KCNMA1-linked channelopathy mouse models</a></h4>

              
                KCNMA1 forms the pore of BK K<sup>+</sup> channels, which regulate neuronal and muscle excitability. Recently, genetic screening identified heterozygous <i>KCNMA1</i> variants in a subset of patients with debilitating paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, presenting with or without epilepsy (PNKD3). However, the relevance of <i>KCNMA1</i> mutations and the basis for clinical heterogeneity in PNKD3 has not been established. Here, we evaluate the relative severity of three <i>KCNMA1</i> patient variants in BK channels, neurons, and mice. In heterologous cells, BK<sup>N999S</sup> and BK<sup>D434G</sup> channels displayed gain-of-function (GOF) properties, whereas BK<sup>H444Q</sup> channels showed loss-of-function (LOF) properties. The relative degree of channel activity was BK<sup>N999S</sup> &gt; BK<sup>D434G</sup>&gt;WT &gt; BK<sup>H444Q</sup>. BK currents and action potential firing were increased, and seizure thresholds decreased, in <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>N999S/WT</sup> and <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>D434G/WT</sup> transgenic mice but not <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>H444Q/WT</sup> mice. In a novel behavioral test for paroxysmal dyskinesia, the more severely affected <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice became immobile after stress. This was abrogated by acute dextroamphetamine treatment, consistent with PNKD3-affected individuals. Homozygous <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice showed similar immobility, but in contrast, homozygous <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> mice displayed hyperkinetic behavior. These data establish the relative pathogenic potential of patient alleles as N999S&gt;D434G&gt;H444Q and validate <i>Kcnma1</i><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice as a model for PNKD3 with increased seizure propensity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">UP-DOWN states and ripples differentially modulate membrane potential dynamics across DG, CA3, and CA1 in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal ripples are transient population bursts that structure cortico-hippocampal communication and play a central role in memory processing. However, the mechanisms controlling ripple initiation in behaving animals remain poorly understood. Here we combine multisite extracellular and whole-cell recordings in awake mice to contrast the brain state and ripple modulation of subthreshold dynamics across hippocampal subfields. We find that entorhinal input to the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits UP and DOWN dynamics with ripples occurring exclusively in UP states. While elevated cortical input in UP states generates depolarization in DG and CA1, it produces persistent hyperpolarization in CA3 neurons. Furthermore, growing inhibition is evident in CA3 throughout the course of the ripple buildup, while DG and CA1 neurons exhibit depolarization transients 100 ms before and during ripples. These observations highlight the importance of CA3 inhibition for ripple generation, while pre-ripple responses indicate a long and orchestrated ripple initiation process in the awake state.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Exploring the expression patterns of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in the mouse brain using the curated RNA-seq database BrainPalmSeq</a></h4>

              
                Protein <i>S</i>-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational lipid modification that plays a critical role in neuronal development and plasticity, while dysregulated <i>S</i>-palmitoylation underlies a number of severe neurological disorders. Dynamic <i>S</i>-palmitoylation is regulated by a large family of ZDHHC palmitoylating enzymes, their accessory proteins, and a small number of known de-palmitoylating enzymes. Here, we curated and analyzed expression data for the proteins that regulate <i>S</i>-palmitoylation from publicly available RNAseq datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of their distribution in the mouse nervous system. We developed a web-tool that enables interactive visualization of the expression patterns for these proteins in the nervous system (http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/), and explored this resource to find region and cell-type specific expression patterns that give insight into the function of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in the brain and neurological disorders. We found coordinated expression of ZDHHC enzymes with their accessory proteins, de-palmitoylating enzymes and other brain-expressed genes that included an enrichment of <i>S</i>-palmitoylation substrates. Finally, we utilized ZDHHC expression patterns to predict and validate palmitoylating enzyme-substrate interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Increased signal-to-noise ratios within experimental field trials by regressing spatially distributed soil properties as principal components</a></h4>

              
                Environmental variability poses a major challenge to any field study. Researchers attempt to mitigate this challenge through replication. Thus, the ability to detect experimental signals is determined by the degree of replication and the amount of environmental variation, noise, within the experimental system. A major source of noise in field studies comes from the natural heterogeneity of soil properties which create microtreatments throughout the field. In addition, the variation within different soil properties is often nonrandomly distributed across a field. We explore this challenge through a sorghum field trial dataset with accompanying plant, microbiome, and soil property data. Diverse sorghum genotypes and two watering regimes were applied in a split-plot design. We describe a process of identifying, estimating, and controlling for the effects of spatially distributed soil properties on plant traits and microbial communities using minimal degrees of freedom. Importantly, this process provides a method with which sources of environmental variation in field data can be identified and adjusted, improving our ability to resolve effects of interest and to quantify subtle phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient Dlx2-mediated astrocyte-to-neuron conversion and inhibition of neuroinflammation by NeuroD1</a></h4>

              
                In vivo astrocyte-to-neuron (AtN) conversion induced by overexpression of neural transcriptional factors has great potential for neural regeneration and repair. Here, we demonstrate that a single neural transcriptional factor Dlx2 converts mouse striatal astrocytes into neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Lineage-tracing studies in Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice confirm that Dlx2 can convert striatal astrocytes into DARPP32+ and Ctip2+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Time-course studies reveal a gradual conversion from astrocytes to neurons in 1 month, with a distinct intermediate state in-between astrocytes and neurons. Interestingly, when Dlx2-infected astrocytes start to lose astrocytic markers, the other local astrocytes proliferate to maintain astrocytic level in the converted areas. Unexpectedly, while Dlx2 efficiently reprograms astrocytes into neurons in the grey matter striatum, it also induces partial reprogramming of astrocytes in the white matter corpus callosum. Such partial reprogramming of white matter astrocytes is associated with neuroinflammation, which can be essentially suppressed by the addition of NeuroD1. Our results highlight the importance of investigating AtN conversion both in the grey matter and white matter in order to thoroughly evaluate therapeutic potentials. This study also unveils a critical role of anti-inflammation by NeuroD1 during AtN conversion.

                We show that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains neural identity in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-driven cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) and SHH-driven medulloblastoma, a cancer of CGNPs. Proliferating CGNPs and medulloblastoma cells pass the neural fate commitment to their progeny through epigenetic mechanisms. The PRC2 mediates epigenetic regulation through histone methylation, and PRC2 inhibitors have been proposed for medulloblastoma therapy. We investigated PRC2 function in CGNPs and medulloblastoma by conditionally deleting PRC2 components Eed or Ezh2 in CGNPs and analyzing cerebellar growth, cellular gene expression (scRNA-seq), and tumorigenesis in medulloblastoma-prone Smo-mutant mice. Eed-deleted CGNPs showed reduced growth, with decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis and inappropriate myoid differentiation. Ezh2-deleted CGNPs also showed myoid differentiation without reduced growth. Eed-deleted and Ezh2-deleted medulloblastomas similarly demonstrated myoid differentiation, but progressed more rapidly than PRC2-intact controls. The PRC2 thus maintained neural fate in CGNPs and medulloblastoma, but PRC2 disruption did not block SHH medulloblastoma progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">System identification reveals multiple interacting states in visuomotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Many characteristics of sensorimotor adaptation are well predicted by the Kalman filter, a relatively simple learning algorithm for the optimal estimation of dynamic variables given noisy measurements. Yet not all Kalman filter predictions are confirmed empirically, suggesting that the model might be too simplistic to describe the observed behavior. In our study, we propose that sensorimotor adaptation can be modeled with multiple interacting states, each one described as a Kalman filter, to better reflect the architecture plant of the physical system implementing the behavior (i.e., the different motor and sensory components involved in adaptation). To test our hypothesis, we measured motor error in a series of rapid reaching tasks in which we introduced different conditions of feedback uncertainty and systematic perturbations. We then applied system identification procedures to the resulting adaptation response to test which system architecture would best fit the data. We considered three possible architectures: one with a single Kalman filter, with two filters in series, or two filters in parallel. We found that this latter structure consistently provided a significantly better fit than the others. When evaluating the identified system parameters, we found that the learning rates of both states decreased under higher uncertainty, the weight assigned to the slower state increased. Moreover, the dual-state parallel system accounted for the presence of a constant residual bias in the adaptation to a step offset, which has been repeatedly reported but is in disaccord with the predictions of the single Kalman filter. We propose that the identified system architecture reflects how the error is assigned to different components of the physical plant responsible for adaptation: namely, as uncertainty increases, the controller assigns a larger contribution in error reduction to the slower state, which is more likely to have been responsible for the measured error.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">miR-146a and miR-200b alter cognition by targeting NMDA receptor subunits</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in fine-tuning gene regulation. Understanding the mechanism of action of such miRNAs might help in manipulating the respective pathways thus providing therapeutic options. We have investigated the physiological roles of two miRNAs, miR-146a and miR-200b, that are differentially expressed in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers disease and schizophrenia. We specifically studied their involvement in learning and memory mechanisms. We show through bioinformatics prediction tools that these miRNAs can interact with transcripts of the N-methyl-D aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits Grin2A and Grin2B. This was further supported by showing interaction of the miRNAs to the 3-UTR sequences of Grin2A and Grin2B through luciferase assay. Overexpression of these miRNAs in primary hippocampal neurons caused downregulation of GluN2B and GluN2A protein levels. Stereotactic injections of these miRNAs into rat hippocampus caused cognitive deficits in multiple behavioural tests along with decreased protein levels of the NMDAR subunits, GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B, AMPAR subunit GluR1 and Neuregulin 1 (NRG1). During downregulation of NMDAR subunits by other physiological stimuli as in pharmacologically treated rat models [MK-801 treated and methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) treated], we found upregulated levels of miR-146a-5p and miR-200b-3p implying their involvement in downregulating NMDAR subunits. These results suggest the importance of miR-146a-5p and miR-200b-3p in mediating gene regulation in the hippocampus and their involvement in hippocampus dependent learning and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Use of vivo-morpholinos for gene knockdown in the postnatal shark retina</a></h4>

              
                Work in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula has shown that the evolutionary origin of postnatal neurogenesis in vertebrates is earlier than previously thought. Thus, the catshark can serve as a model of interest to understand postnatal neurogenic processes and their evolution in vertebrates. One of the best characterized neurogenic niches of the catshark CNS is found in the peripheral region of the retina. Unfortunately, the lack of genetic tools in sharks limits the possibilities to deepen in the study of genes involved in the neurogenic process. Here, we report a method for gene knockdown in the juvenile catshark retina based on the use of Vivo-Morpholinos. To establish the method, we designed Vivo-Morpholinos against the proliferation marker PCNA. We first evaluated the possible toxicity of 3 different intraocular administration regimes. After this optimization step, we show that a single intraocular injection of the PCNA Vivo-Morpholino decreases the expression of PCNA in the peripheral retina, which leads to reduced mitotic activity in this region. This method will help in deciphering the role of other genes potentially involved in postnatal neurogenesis in this model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial and temporal muscle synergies provide a dual characterization of low-dimensional and intermittent control of upper-limb movements</a></h4>

              
                Muscle synergy analysis is commonly used for investigating the neurophysiological mechanisms that the central nervous system employs to control muscle activations. In the last two decades, several models have been developed to decompose EMG signals into spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal synergies. However, the presence of different approaches complicates the comparison and interpretation of results. Spatial synergies represent invariant activation weights in muscle groups modulated with variant temporal coefficients, while temporal synergies are based on invariant temporal profiles that coordinate variant muscle weights. While non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) allows to extract both spatial and temporal synergies, temporal synergies and the comparison between the two approaches have been barely investigated and so far no study targeted a large set of multi-joint upper limb movements. Here we present several analyses that highlight the duality of spatial and temporal synergies as a characterization of low-dimensional and intermittent motor coordination in the upper limb, allowing high flexibility and dexterity. First, spatial and temporal synergies were extracted from two datasets representing a comprehensive mapping of proximal (REACH PLUS) and distal (NINAPRO) upper limb movements, focusing on their differences in reconstruction accuracy and inter-individual variability. For both models, we extracted synergies achieving a given level of the goodness of reconstruction (R2), and we compared the similarity of the invariant components across participants. The two models provide a compact characterization of motor coordination at spatial or temporal level, respectively. However, a lower number of temporal synergies are needed to achieve the same R2 with a higher inter-subject similarity. Spatial and temporal synergies may thus capture different levels of motor control. Second, we showed the existence of both spatial and temporal structure in the EMG data, extracting spatial and temporal synergies from a surrogate dataset in which the phases were shuffled preserving the same frequency content of the original data. Last, a detailed characterization of the structure of the temporal synergies suggested that they can be related to an intermittent control of the movement. These results may be useful to improve muscle synergy analysis in several fields such as rehabilitation, prosthesis control and motor control studies.

                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is an evolutionarily conserved brain region, well known for valence processing. Despite this central role, the relationship between activity of BLA neuronal ensembles in response to appetitive and aversive stimuli and the subsequent expression of valence-specific behavior has remained elusive. Here we leverage 2-photon calcium imaging combined with single cell holographic photostimulation through an endoscopic lens implanted in the deep brain to demonstrate a direct causal role for discrete ensembles of BLA neurons in the control of oppositely valenced behavior. We report that targeted photostimulation of individual groups of appetitive or aversive BLA neurons shifts behavioral responses toward those behaviors which recruited a specific consumption or avoidance ensemble. Here we identify that neuronal encoding of valence in the BLA is graded and relies on the relative proportion of individual BLA neurons recruited during a stable appetitive or aversive ensemble.

                Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common monogenic form of familial small vessel disease and no preventive or curative therapy is available. CADASIL is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, resulting in a mutated NOTCH3 receptor, with aggregation of the NOTCH3 extracellular domain (ECD) around vascular smooth muscle cells. In this study we have developed a novel active immunization therapy specifically targeting CADASIL-like aggregated NOTCH3 ECD. Immunizing CADASIL TgN3R182C150 mice with aggregates composed of CADASIL-R133C mutated and wild type EGF1-5 repeats for a total of four months resulted in a marked reduction (38-48%) in NOTCH3 deposition around brain capillaries, increased microglia activation and lowered serum levels of NOTCH3 ECD. Active immunization did not impact body weight, general behavior or the number and integrity of vascular smooth muscle cells in the retina, suggesting that the therapy is tolerable. This is the first therapeutic study reporting a successful reduction of CADASIL-like NOTCH3 accumulation in mice supporting further development towards clinical application for the benefit of CADASIL patients.

                Children with growth mindset tend to believe that personal abilities and traits are improvable through continuous efforts. This belief boosts intrinsic motivation and benefits cognitive abilities in children, in the long term resulting in improved academic performance. However, little is known regarding its neurocognitive mechanisms in the processing of cognitive tasks. Using functional brain imaging and an n-back task in school-aged children (ages 8-12), we demonstrated that growth mindset promotes working memory performance through enhanced response in the frontoparietal network, salience network, and caudate nucleus. While growth mindset predicted lower connectivity between caudate and insula irrespective of memory load, the connectivity between caudate and posterior cingulate cortex was selectively correlated with growth mindset in the high load condition. The cortico-striatal connectivity together with cortical response played a key mediatory role in the promotion effect of growth mindset towards working memory. Our findings suggest a neurocognitive mechanism accounts for how growth mindset promotes children's working memory in demanding tasks via modulation of motivational neural systems and information processing.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, with resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability being major symptoms. Neuropathologically, it is characterised by the presence of abundant filamentous inclusions of -synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in some brain cells, including dopaminergic nerve cells of the substantia nigra. PD is increasingly recognised as a multisystem disorder, with cognitive decline being one of its most common non-motor symptoms. Many patients with PD develop dementia more than 10 years after diagnosis. PD dementia (PDD) is clinically and neuropathologically similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is diagnosed when cognitive impairment precedes parkinsonian motor signs or begins within one year from their onset. In PDD, cognitive impairment develops in the setting of well-established PD. Besides PD and DLB, multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the third major synucleinopathy. It is characterised by the presence of abundant filamentous -synuclein inclusions in brain cells, especially oligodendrocytes (Papp-Lantos bodies). We previously reported the electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of two types of -synuclein filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with MSA. Each filament type is made of two different protofilaments. Here we report that the cryo-EM structures of -synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with PD, PDD and DLB are made of a single protofilament (Lewy fold) that is markedly different from the protofilaments of MSA. These findings establish the existence of distinct molecular conformers of assembled -synuclein in neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral Evidence for Enhanced Olfactory and Trigeminal Perception in Congenitally Deaf Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Sensory deprivation, particularly hearing loss, is an excellent model to study neuroplasticity in the human brain and the adaptive behaviors that support the daily lives of deprived individuals. In adaptation to their hearing loss, deaf individuals rely on their other intact senses. Visual and tactile abilities are enhanced in deafness, but few studies have evaluated the olfactory function. This study aimed to compare the impact of congenital deafness on olfactory capacities using psychophysical tasks. Methodological issues raised in previous studies, such as homogeneous onset of deafness and cognitive function assessment, were considered. Eleven individuals with bilateral severe-to-profound deafness since birth were compared to 11 hearing non-signers similar in age (age range = 20-51 years old) and sex (7 women). The deaf subjects were assessed using various standardized neuropsychological tests to ascertain typical cognition. Olfactory functions were evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks battery test, which measures olfactory detection threshold, odor discrimination, and odor identification. Further, accuracy and response time were examined for the identification and localization of two odors to disentangle olfactory sensitivity from sensitivity in the trigeminal system. The Sniffin' Sticks test demonstrated superior performances in the deaf participants to discriminate and identify odors. In line with this, they also showed higher sensitivity when both identifying and localizing odors. These findings suggest that congenital deafness is associated with superior performance in higher-level olfactory processing and increased sensitivity in the trigeminal system.

	<p>The semantic variant of a primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) is characterized by progressive disruption of semantic knowledge. This study aimed to compare the semantic features of words produced during a narrative speech in svPPA and the logopenic variant of PPA (lvPPA) and to explore their neuroanatomical correlates. Six patients with svPPA and sixteen with lvPPA underwent narrative speech tasks. For all the content words, a semantic depth index (SDI) was determined based on the taxonomic structure of a large lexical database. Study participants underwent an MRI examination. Cortical thickness measures were extracted according to the Desikan atlas. Correlations were computed between SDI and the thickness of cortical regions. Mean SDI was lower for svPPA than for lvPPA. Correlation analyses showed a positive association between the SDI and the cortical thickness of the bilateral temporal pole, parahippocampal and entorhinal cortices, and left middle and superior temporal cortices. Disruption of semantic knowledge observed in svPPA leads to the production of generic terms in narrative speech, and the SDI may be useful for quantifying the level of semantic impairment. The measure was associated with the cortical thickness of brain regions associated with semantic memory.</p>

	<p>Successful spinal surgery demands high levels of concentration and cooperation from participating health care workers. The intraoperative stress levels and concentration levels of surgeons have been studied previously; however, those of nurses are rarely studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the stresses affecting surgical nurses by their participating role during spinal surgery. A total of 160 surgical stress records were obtained during 40 surgeries, including electroencephalography (EEG) signals and heart rate variability (HRV) from three orthopedic spinal surgeons and six nurses; concentration, tension level and physical stress were analyzed. Levels of both concentration and tension were significantly higher in circulating nurses during all surgical stages (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Both beats per minute and low frequency/high frequency ratios, which reflect physical stress, were higher in scrub nurses (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). As the surgical experience of scrub nurses increased, the key parameters related to stress tended to decrease (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). These results will contribute to understanding the pattern of intraoperative stress of surgical nurses, and therefore help in enhancing the teamwork of the surgical team for optimal outcomes.</p>

	<p>In current research processes, mathematical learning has significantly impacted the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s plasticity and cognitive functions. While biochemical changes in brain have been investigated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, our study attempts to identify non-math students by using magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs). The proposed method crops the left middle front gyrus (MFG) region from the MRI, resulting in a multi-instance classification problem. Then, subspace enhanced contrastive learning is employed on all instances to learn robust deep features, followed by an ensemble classifier based on multiple-layer-perceptron models for student identification. The experiments were conducted on 123 MRIs taken from 72 math students and 51 non-math students. The proposed method arrived at an accuracy of 73.7% for image classification and 91.8% for student classification. Results show the proposed workflow successfully identifies the students who lack mathematical education by using MRI data. This study provides insights into the impact of mathematical education on brain development from structural imaging.</p>

	<p>Objective: To investigate the correlation between the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) segments and acute/subacute post-stroke aphasia (PSA). Methods: Twenty-six patients underwent language assessment and MRI scanning. The integrity of the AF based on a three-segment model was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging. All patients were classified into three groups according to the reconstruction of the left AF: completely reconstructed (group A, 8 cases), non-reconstructed (group B, 6 cases), and partially reconstructed (group C, 12 cases). The correlations and intergroup differences in language performance and diffusion indices were comprehensively estimated. Results: A correlation analyses showed that the lesion load of the language areas and diffusion indices on the left AF posterior and long segments was significantly related to some language subsets, respectively. When controlled lesion load was variable, significant correlations between diffusion indices on the posterior and long segments and comprehension, repetition, naming, and aphasia quotient were retained. Multiple comparison tests revealed intergroup differences in diffusion indices on the left AF posterior and long segments, as well as these language subsets. No significant correlation was found between the anterior segment and language performance. Conclusions: The integrity of the left AF segments, particularly the posterior segment, is crucial for the residual comprehension and repetition abilities in individuals with acute/subacute PSA, and lesion load in cortical language areas is an important factor that should be taken into account when illustrating the contributions of damage to special fiber tracts to language impairments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Behavioral Receptive Field for Ocular Following in Monkeys: Spatial Summation and Its Spatial Frequency Tuning</a></h4>

              
                <p>In human and nonhuman primates, reflexive tracking eye movements can be initiated at very short latency in response to a rapid shift of the image. Previous studies in humans have shown that only a part of the central visual field is optimal for driving ocular following responses. Herein, we have investigated spatial summation of motion information, across a wide range of spatial frequencies and speeds of drifting gratings by recording short-latency ocular following responses in macaque monkeys. We show that the optimal stimulus size for driving ocular responses cover a small (diameter, &lt;20&deg;), central part of the visual field that shrinks with higher spatial frequency. This signature of linear motion integration remains invariant with speed and temporal frequency. For low and medium spatial frequencies, we found a strong suppressive influence from surround motion, evidenced by a decrease of response amplitude for stimulus sizes larger than optimal. Such suppression disappears with gratings at high frequencies. The contribution of peripheral motion was investigated by presenting grating annuli of increasing eccentricity. We observed an exponential decay of response amplitude with grating eccentricity, the decrease being faster for higher spatial frequencies. Weaker surround suppression can thus be explained by sparser eccentric inputs at high frequencies. A difference-of-Gaussians model best renders the antagonistic contributions of peripheral and central motions. Its best-fit parameters coincide with several, well known spatial properties of area MT neuronal populations. These results describe the mechanism by which central motion information is automatically integrated in a context-dependent manner to drive ocular responses.</p>

                Motivation: Genotyping error can impact downstream single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analyses. Simulating various modes and levels of error can help investigators better understand potential biases caused by miscalled genotypes. Methods: We have developed and validated vcferr, a tool to probabilistically simulate genotyping error and missingness in variant call format (VCF) files. We demonstrate how vcferr could be used to address a research question by introducing varying levels of error of different type into a sample in a simulated pedigree, and assessed how kinship analysis degrades as a function of the kind and type of error. Software availability: vcferr is available for installation via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/vcferr/) or conda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/vcferr).

                Background: Recent developments in optical satellite remote sensing have led to a new era in the detection of surface water with its changing dynamics. This study presents the creation of surface water inventory for a part of Pune district (an administrative area), in India using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and a multi spectral water indices method. Methods: A total of 13 Landsat 8 OLI cloud free images were analyzed for surface water detection. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) spectral index method was employed to enhance the water pixels in the image. Water and non-water areas in the map were discriminated using the threshold slicing method with a trial and error approach. The accuracy analysis based on kappa coefficient and percentage of the correctly classified pixels was presented by comparing MNDWI maps with corresponding Joint Research Centre (JRC) Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) images. The changes in the surface area of eight freshwater reservoirs within the study area (Bhama Askhed, Bhatghar, Chaskaman, Khadakwasala, Mulashi, Panshet, Shivrata, and Varasgaon) for the year 2016 were analyzed and compared to GSWE time series water databases for accuracy assessment. The annual water occurrence map with percentage water occurrence on a yearly basis was also prepared. Results: The kappa coefficient agreement between MNDWI images and GSWE images is in the range of 0.56 to 0.96 with an average agreement of 0.82 indicating a strong level of agreement. Conclusions: MNDWI is easy to implement and is a sufficiently accurate method to separate water bodies from satellite images. The accuracy of the result depends on the clarity of image and selection of an optimum threshold method. The resulting accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithm will improve with implementation of automatic threshold selection methods and comparative studies for other spectral indices methods.

                Background: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a life-threatening ailment caused by diabetes. Several growth factors, as well as their various combinations, have shown promising effect in aiding diabetic foot ulcer healing. However, contradictory or paradoxical results are often available, and debates about this issue are ongoing. Therefore, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and placebo in healing diabetic foot ulcers. Methods: The database search included relevant English literature from Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier, and EMBASE that was published between 2009 and 2021. Inclusion criteria included type 1 and 2 diabetic patients with foot wounds focusing on complete healing rate. Exclusion criteria included combined therapy, non-human studies, reviews, and protocols. To assess the quality of each study, biases regarding random sequence generation, allocation concealment, participant and personnel blinding, outcome assessment blinding and incomplete outcome data were thoroughly identified. Results: Eight randomized control trials comprising 620 patients (337 in EGF group, 283 in placebo group), were included in this meta-analysis. EGF achieved a significantly higher complete healing rate than placebo after four weeks of treatment, with relative risk (RR): 3.04 (0.50, 18.44) and heterogeneity (Chi2 = 6.46, df = 2 (P = 0.04) I2 = 69 %). Notably, the healing frequency in the placebo group was 17%, whereas the healing frequency in the epidermal growth factor group was 34%. Likewise, after eight weeks of treatment, the relative risk and heterogeneity were RR: 2.59 (1.42, 4.72) and (Chi2 =7.92, df= 4 (p= 0.09): I2= 49%), respectively. Moreover, the risk ratio at 12 weeks was RR: 1.01 (0.42, 2.46), and heterogeneity was (Chi2 =8.55, df= 2 (p= 0.01): I2= 77%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that EGF significantly promotes wound healing, and could be recommended as an effective and safe treatment for DFUs.

                Background: Researchers need visualization methods (using statistical and interactive techniques) to efficiently perform quality assessments and glean insights from their data. Data on networks can particularly benefit from more advanced techniques since typical visualization methods, such as node-link diagrams, can be difficult to interpret. We use heatmaps and consensus clustering on network data and show they can be combined to easily and efficiently explore nonparametric relationships among the variables and networks that comprise an ego network data set. Methods: We used ego network data from the QuÃ©bec Adipose and Lifestyle Investigation in Youth (QUALITY) cohort used to evaluate this method. The data consists of 35 networks centered on individuals (egos), each containing a maximum of 10 nodes (alters). These networks are described through 41 variables: 11 describing the ego (e.g. fat mass percentage), 18 describing the alters (e.g. frequency of physical activity) and 12 describing the network structure (e.g. degree). Results: Four stable clusters were detected. Cluster one consisted of variables relating to the interconnectivity of the ego networks and the locations of interaction, cluster two consisted of the egoâ€™s age, cluster three contained lifestyle variables and obesity outcomes and cluster four was comprised of variables measuring alter importance and diet. Conclusions: This exploratory method using heatmaps and consensus clustering on network data identified several important associations among variables describing the altersâ€™ lifestyle habits and the egosâ€™ obesity outcomes. Their relevance has been identified by studies on the effect of social networks on childhood obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thalamic deep brain stimulation paradigm to reduce consciousness: Cortico-striatal dynamics implicated in mechanisms of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle J. Redinbaugh, Mohsen Afrasiabi, Jessica M. Phillips, Niranjan A. Kambi, Sounak Mohanta, Aeyal Raz, Yuri B. Saalmann</p>

Anesthetic manipulations provide much-needed causal evidence for neural correlates of consciousness, but non-specific drug effects complicate their interpretation. Evidence suggests that thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can either increase or decrease consciousness, depending on the stimulation target and parameters. The putative role of the central lateral thalamus (CL) in consciousness makes it an ideal DBS target to manipulate circuit-level mechanisms in cortico-striato-thalamic (CST) systems, thereby influencing consciousness and related processes. We used multi-microelectrode DBS targeted to CL in macaques while recording from frontal, parietal, and striatal regions. DBS induced episodes of abnormally long, vacant staring with low-frequency oscillations here termed vacant, perturbed consciousness (VPC). DBS modulated VPC likelihood in a frequency-specific manner. VPC events corresponded to decreases in measures of neural complexity (entropy) and integration (Î¦*), proposed indices of consciousness, and substantial changes to communication in CST circuits. During VPC, power spectral density and coherence at low frequencies increased across CST circuits, especially in thalamo-parietal and cortico-striatal pathways. Decreased consciousness and neural integration corresponded to shifts in cortico-striatal network configurations that dissociated parietal and subcortical structures. Overall, the features of VPC and implicated networks were similar to those of absence epilepsy. As this same multi-microelectrode DBS methodâ€“but at different stimulation frequenciesâ€“can also increase consciousness in anesthetized macaques, it can be used to flexibly address questions of consciousness with limited confounds, as well as inform clinical investigations of other consciousness disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The accuracy of absolute differential abundance analysis from relative count data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kimberly E. Roche, Sayan Mukherjee</p>

Concerns have been raised about the use of relative abundance data derived from next generation sequencing as a proxy for absolute abundances. For example, in the differential abundance setting, compositional effects in relative abundance data may give rise to spurious differences (false positives) when considered from the absolute perspective. In practice however, relative abundances are often transformed by renormalization strategies intended to compensate for these effects and the scope of the practical problem remains unclear. We used simulated data to explore the consistency of differential abundance calling on renormalized relative abundances versus absolute abundances and find that, while overall consistency is high, with a median sensitivity (true positive rates) of 0.91 and specificity (1â€”false positive rates) of 0.89, consistency can be much lower where there is widespread change in the abundance of features across conditions. We confirm these findings on a large number of real data sets drawn from 16S metabarcoding, expression array, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq experiments, where data sets with the greatest change between experimental conditions are also those with the highest false positive rates. Finally, we evaluate the predictive utility of summary features of relative abundance data themselves. Estimates of sparsity and the prevalence of feature-level change in relative abundance data give reasonable predictions of discrepancy in differential abundance calling in simulated data and can provide useful bounds for worst-case outcomes in real data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Local and collective transitions in sparsely-interacting ecological communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stav Marcus, Ari M. Turner, Guy Bunin</p>

Interactions in natural communities can be highly heterogeneous, with any given species interacting appreciably with only some of the others, a situation commonly represented by sparse interaction networks. We study the consequences of sparse competitive interactions, in a theoretical model of a community assembled from a species pool. We find that communities can be in a number of different regimes, depending on the interaction strength. When interactions are strong, the network of coexisting species breaks up into small subgraphs, while for weaker interactions these graphs are larger and more complex, eventually encompassing all species. This process is driven by the emergence of new allowed subgraphs as interaction strength decreases, leading to sharp changes in diversity and other community properties, and at weaker interactions to two distinct collective transitions: a percolation transition, and a transition between having a unique equilibrium and having multiple alternative equilibria. Understanding community structure is thus made up of two parts: first, finding which subgraphs are allowed at a given interaction strength, and secondly, a discrete problem of matching these structures over the entire community. In a shift from the focus of many previous theories, these different regimes can be traversed by modifying the interaction strength alone, without need for heterogeneity in either interaction strengths or the number of competitors per species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysis of the docking property of host variants of hACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 in a large cohort</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hyojung Paik, Jimin Kim, Sangjae Seo</p>

The recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is threatening global health. However, an understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells, including the physical docking property influenced by the hostâ€™s genetic diversity, is still lacking. Here, based on germline variants in the UK Biobank covering 502,543 individuals, we revealed the molecular interactions between human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is the representative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and COVID-19 infection. We identified six nonsense and missense variants of hACE2 from 2585 subjects in the UK Biobank covering 500000 individuals. Using our molecular dynamics simulations, three hACE2 variants from 2585 individuals we selected showed higher levels of binding free energy for docking in the range of 1.44â€“3.69 kcal/mol. Although there are diverse contributors to SARS-CoV-2 infections, including the mobility of individuals, we analyzed the diagnosis records of individuals with these three variants of hACE2. Our molecular dynamics simulations combined with population-based genomic data provided an atomistic understanding of the interaction between hACE2 and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

                Spatial and spatio-temporal data are used in a wide range of fields including environmental, health and social disciplines. Several packages in the statistical software R have been recently developed as clients for various databases to meet the growing demands for easily accessible and reliable spatial data. While documentation on how to use many of these packages exist, there is an increasing need for a one stop repository for tutorials on this information. In this paper, we presentÂ rspatialdataÂ a website that provides a collection of data sources and tutorials on downloading and visualising spatial data using R. The website includes a wide range of datasets including administrative boundaries of countries, Open Street Map data, population, temperature, vegetation, air pollution, and malaria data.Â The goal of the website is to equip researchers and communities with the tools to engage in spatial data analysis and visualisation so that they can address important local issues, such as estimating air pollution, quantifying disease burdens, and evaluating and monitoring the United Nationâ€™s sustainable development goals.

                Background: Rice cultivation is considered significant methane (CH4) emission source. Rice straw (RS) incorporation into the soil is a critical factor that produces higher CH4 emissions. The RS waterlogging approach on the soil surface potentially reduces CH4 emissions due to increasing RS decomposition in aerobic conditions. However, the hypothesis has not been entirely determined. The study aimed to examine CH4 emissions under RS waterlogging on surface water compared with RS incorporation into the soil. Methods: We carried out a microcosm experiment in a screen-house with two treatments, including (i) RS incorporation into the soil and (ii) RS waterlogging on the soil surface in triplicates. We compared the CH4 emissions and CH4 accumulation for the off-growing and rice-sowing periods. Yield-scaled CH 4 emission was assessed based on total methane emission and rice yield. Results: The results demonstrated that RS waterlogging reduced CH4 emissions by 16.9% compared to RS incorporation. During the rice-growing period, total CH4 emissions from RS waterlogging accounted for 36% of the incorporation treatment. Under RS waterlogging, high CH4 emissions during the off-sowing stage were disclosed. The difference between yield-scaled CH4 emissions was not significant. Conclusions: RS waterlogging is a feasible option to alternate conventional RS incorporation toward lower CH4 emissions from rice production. Ameliorating CH4 emission mitigation by RS waterlogging during off-sowing is recommended for future works.

                Background: Evaluation of the knowledge about stroke in the general population is extremely vital as it prevents stroke development, limits complications, and achieves better quality of life. Â We assume that the general Lebanese population lacks awareness about stroke and its associated complications. This study aims to evaluate stroke knowledge and determine the factors associated with stroke awareness among the general Lebanese population. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed respondentsâ€™ sociodemographic characteristics and the identification of risk factors, warning signs, stroke consequences, and early response to stroke symptoms. A total of 551 Lebanese adults without a history of stroke filled in an online self-reported questionnaire publicly shared on social applications. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with poor knowledge of stroke.Â  Results: Among the 551 participants enrolled, 403 (74.2%) were females and 312 (56.7%) were under 30 years of age. Females compared to males and employed compared to unemployed had significantly higher odds of identifying at least one risk factor (OR=4.3 [95%CI=1.1;16.8] and 6 [95%CI=1.2;29.6], respectively). Also, when compared to unemployed, employed participants had significantly higher odds of recognizing at least one of the early stroke symptoms (OR=3.3 [95%CI=1.2;8.9]) and identifying at least one of the stroke consequences (OR=5.3 [95%CI=1.1;25.9]). Reaching a university level of education compared to a school level was associated with significantly higher odds (OR=2.3 [95%CI=1.1;4.8]) of taking a patient to a hospital. Conclusion: Well-educated, employed, and female participants were more knowledgeable about stroke. Tailored interventions focusing on individuals with inadequate stroke literacy are needed. Further studies, more representative of the general Lebanese population with a larger sample size, are necessary to confirm our findings.

                Background: Islamic money market mutual funds have become an alternative to conventional investment instruments. This research has novelty in determining the variables of mutual fund performance by combining risk and return factors, asset allocation policy variables, and investment manager performance, which have a high impact on the return and risk level in reducing the risk of loss on investment. In addition, this research was conducted on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds that have not been studied before.Â  Methods: This research uses data on Islamic money market mutual funds registered with the Financial Services Authority in Indonesia. The performance of Islamic money market mutual funds was calculated using the Sharpe Method and tested using multiple regression analysis.Â  Results: The results showed that the asset allocation policy, investment manager performance, and the level of risk simultaneously have a significant effect on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia; however, partially, there is no significant effect between (1) the asset allocation policy on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia: (2) investment manager performance on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia, and (3) the level of risk on the performance of Islamic money market mutual funds in Indonesia.Â Â  Conclusions: The results indicated that optimization of returns and risks was needed by considering the composition of asset allocation, choosing the right investment manager, and conducting a good risk level analysis to obtain optimal Islamic money market mutual fund performance.

                Cholesterol granuloma is a rare non-infectious disease. Currently, there are no established guidelines, leaving the clinician to decide the best practice for each patient. A 43-year-old woman presented to the Surgery Clinic at Siloam General Hospital, Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, with the primary complaint of a painful mass located in her left breast over the previous week before being admitted to the hospital. The mass was found abruptly and was accompanied by severe pain and fever. On inspection, peau dâ€™orange, nipple retraction, tenderness, and warmth of the skin were observed. Ultrasonography suggested a malignant mass. The primary diagnosis was breast cancer, with a secondary differential diagnosis of breast abscess. An open biopsy was chosen because a breast abscess was the possible diagnosis. The biopsy results showed characteristics of cholesterol granuloma. Following the operation, the pain score was notably reduced as the operation showed a satisfactory result. The primary purpose of this case report was to illustrate a case of breast abscess caused by cholesterol granuloma, in which open excisional biopsy and drainage was superior for pain reduction and faster recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dental education during the pandemic â€“ cross-sectional lecturer-side evaluation for the use of digital teaching concepts [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant restrictions on dental teaching. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the attitudes of faculty members towards digital teaching formats and the effort creating digital lectures. We hypothesized that on the lecturer side there is no difference between the various digital teaching concepts in terms of workload and effort and that there is no increase in workload and effort when switching to digital teaching concepts. Methods: All German dental faculties were invited to the online survey by an anonymous voluntary questionnaire from January to April 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions that could be answered with a visual analog scale, free text answers, or with fixed answer options. Data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and an exploratory data analysis (Î±=0.05). Results: Before the pandemic, 24.8% of the participating lecturers were using digital teaching and 64.4% had no previous experience. After the outbreak of the pandemic 100% of the dental teaching was initially held online. More than 80% of the lecturers stated that they offer online lectures (86.1%), online seminars (81.2%), and/or online bedside teaching (33.7%). 88.1% see face-to-face teaching as the preferred teaching format. The lecturers also see the greatest opportunities for interaction in the area of analog teaching and significantly worse in synchronous and asynchronous digital teaching. In the course of the pandemic, respondents' attitudes towards online teaching improved in the median of 24.0 to a median of 50.0. Conclusions: Faculty members have positively changed their attitudes towards online teaching formats over the course of the pandemic. Although they see the greatest learning success in conventional face-to-face teaching formats and the creation of digital lectures is associated with a higher effort, they want more online lessons in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of ingestion of red dragon fruit extract on levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase after strenuous exercise in rats (Rattus norvegicus) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prolonged activation of skeletal muscles causes a decrease in the production of fatigue. Exercise with strenuous intensity causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). An increase in free radicals causes oxidative stress resulting in damage to cell function to mitochondrial dysfunction, and fatigue. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red dragon fruit (RDF) to delay fatigue due to oxidative stress, which improves cell function in mitochondria. Methods: 25 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) aged three months were divided into five groups: Group K1 was N.A. (No Activity) but drinking and eating; Group K2 performed strenuous exercise without RDF treatment; Groups 3, 4, and 5 (P1, P2 and P3, respectively) performed strenuous exercise and were treated with 75 mg kg-1.bw, 150 mg kg-1.bw, and 300 mg kg-1.bw of RDF extract, respectively. The exercise for the rats involved intense swimming for 20 minutes every day, four days a week for 31 days.Â  Malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured with the ELISA and histopathology for muscle soleus and lung tissue. Results: Strenuous exercise followed by RDF extract ingestion was compared for fatigue in terms of duration and time; before (24.55Â±1.38 minute) and after (95.31Â±7.82 minute) and led to a significant difference of 39% (p<0.01). The study also compared MDA before and after RDF extract ingestion in the K2 vs. the P1 group (p<0.05). At the same time, P2 differed more significantly (p<0.01). This indicated a spread of free radicals and featured histopathological damage of muscle cells. However, ingestion of RDF extract leads to improvement of soleus muscle cells; thus, repairs cell function, delaying fatigue. Conclusion: This study confirmed that strenuous exercise, which causes an increase in ROS, intensifies free radicals with RDF extract ingestion and declines oxidative stress, repairing cell function and delaying fatigue.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of natural products use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity and hospitalization: A self-reported cross-sectional survey study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using available resources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity of COVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of natural product use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity and hospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan. Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were â‰¥18 years old were the study population. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19 severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean Â± SD) of the study sample (n=2,148) was 40.25 Â± 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37â€“0.85]), onion (OR [0.69], CI [0.52â€“0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51â€“0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.66], CI [0.50â€“0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantial reduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR [0.55], CI [0.34â€“0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42â€“0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.61], CI [0.44â€“0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regular consumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection was associated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations are required to confirm these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has metastasis to the orbit, consequences in anaemia: A paediatric unusual case of Bangladesh. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a significant risk of spreading to other parts of the body early, orbital and ocular surrounding tissues metastases are uncommon. Case Report: This paper described a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with a locally advanced NPC and ocular metastasis and was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. One of the rare early presentations is orbital metastases with vision problems. Discussion: Orbital metastases in children are considerably more uncommon. Cachexia and malnutrition are prevalent problems in people with cancer, affecting life and longevity. Anaemia is a severe issue for nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Conclusion: Orbital metastases frequently arise in advanced stages of the disease and in the scenario of many metastases the persistence of therapy and the nasopharyngeal cancer patient's standard of living is linked to the occurrence of anaemia. In addition, to predict the prognosis of individuals with NPC, pretreatment laboratory profiles should be evaluated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The human amniotic epithelium confers a bias to differentiate toward the neuroectoderm lineage in human embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) derive from the epiblast and have pluripotent potential. To maintain the conventional conditions of the pluripotent potential in an undifferentiated state, inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (iMEF) is used as a feeder layer. However, it has been suggested that hESC under this conventional condition (hESC-iMEF) is an artifact that does not correspond to the <i>in vitro</i> counterpart of the human epiblast. Our previous studies demonstrated the use of an alternative feeder layer of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAEC) to derive and maintain hESC. We wondered if the hESC-hAEC culture could represent a different pluripotent stage than that of naÃ¯ve or primed conventional conditions, simulating the stage in which the amniotic epithelium derives from the epiblast during peri-implantation. Like the conventional primed hESC-iMEF, hESC-hAEC has the same levels of expression as the 'pluripotency core'; and does not express markers of naÃ¯ve pluripotency. However, it presents a downregulation of HOX genes and genes associated with the endoderm and mesoderm and it exhibits an increase in the expression of ectoderm lineage genes, specifically in the anterior neuroectoderm. Transcriptome analysis showed in hESC-hAEC an upregulated signature of genes coding for transcription factors involved in neural induction and forebrain development, and the ability to differentiate into a neural lineage was superior in comparison with conventional hESC-iMEF. We propose that the interaction of hESC with hAEC confers hESC a biased potential that resembles the anteriorized epiblast, which is predisposed to form the neural ectoderm.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single exposure to altered auditory feedback causes observable sensorimotor adaptation in speech</a></h4>

              
                Sensory errors induce two types of behavioral changes: rapid compensation within a movement and longer-term adaptation of subsequent movements. Although adaptation is hypothesized to occur whenever a sensory error is perceived (including after a single exposure to altered feedback), adaptation of articulatory movements in speech has only been observed after repeated exposure to auditory perturbations, questioning both current theories of speech sensorimotor adaptation as well as the universality of more general theories of adaptation. We measured single-exposure or 'one-shot' learning in a large dataset in which participants were exposed to intermittent, unpredictable perturbations of their speech acoustics. On unperturbed trials immediately following these perturbed trials, participants adjusted their speech to oppose the preceding shift, demonstrating that learning occurs even after a single exposure to auditory error. These results provide critical support for current theories of sensorimotor adaptation in speech and align speech more closely with learning in other motor domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-uniform distribution of dendritic nonlinearities differentially engages thalamostriatal and corticostriatal inputs onto cholinergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                The tonic activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) is modified differentially by their afferent inputs. Although their unitary synaptic currents are identical, in most CINs cortical inputs onto distal dendrites only weakly entrain them, whereas proximal thalamic inputs trigger abrupt pauses in discharge in response to salient external stimuli. To test whether the dendritic expression of the active conductances that drive autonomous discharge contribute to the CINs' capacity to dissociate cortical from thalamic inputs, we used an optogenetics-based method to quantify dendritic excitability in mouse CINs. We found that the persistent sodium (NaP) current gave rise to dendritic boosting, and that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current gave rise to a subhertz membrane resonance. This resonance may underlie our novel finding of an association between CIN pauses and internally-generated slow wave events in sleeping non-human primates. Moreover, our method indicated that dendritic NaP and HCN currents were preferentially expressed in proximal dendrites. We validated the non-uniform distribution of NaP currents: pharmacologically; with two-photon imaging of dendritic back-propagating action potentials; and by demonstrating boosting of thalamic, but not cortical, inputs by NaP currents. Thus, the localization of active dendritic conductances in CIN dendrites mirrors the spatial distribution of afferent terminals and may promote their differential responses to thalamic <i>vs.</i> cortical inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolic requirement for GOT2 in pancreatic cancer depends on environmental context</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial glutamate-oxaloacetate (GOT2) is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), a mechanism by which cells transfer reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria. GOT2 is a key component of mutant KRAS (KRAS*)-mediated rewiring of glutamine metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Here, we demonstrate that the loss of GOT2 disturbs redox homeostasis and halts proliferation of PDA cells in vitro. GOT2 knockdown (KD) in PDA cell lines in vitro induced NADH accumulation, decreased Asp and Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±KG) production, stalled glycolysis, disrupted the TCA cycle, and impaired proliferation. Oxidizing NADH through chemical or genetic means resolved the redox imbalance induced by GOT2 KD, permitting sustained proliferation. Despite a strong in vitro inhibitory phenotype, loss of GOT2 had no effect on tumor growth in xenograft PDA or autochthonous mouse models. We show that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment (TME), release the redox active metabolite pyruvate, and culturing GOT2 KD cells in CAF conditioned media (CM) rescued proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, blocking pyruvate import or pyruvate-to-lactate reduction prevented rescue of GOT2 KD in vitro by exogenous pyruvate or CAF CM. However, these interventions failed to sensitize xenografts to GOT2 KD in vivo, demonstrating the remarkable plasticity and differential metabolism deployed by PDA cells in vitro and in vivo. This emphasizes how the environmental context of distinct pre-clinical models impacts both cell-intrinsic metabolic rewiring and metabolic crosstalk with the tumor microenvironment (TME).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cancer type classification using plasma cell-free RNAs derived from human and microbes</a></h4>

              
                The utility of cell-free nucleic acids in monitoring cancer has been recognized by both scientists and clinicians. In addition to human transcripts, a fraction of cell-free nucleic acids in human plasma were proven to be derived from microbes and reported to have relevance to cancer. To obtain a better understanding of plasma cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs) in cancer patients, we profiled cfRNAs in ~300 plasma samples of 5 cancer types (colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer) and healthy donors (HDs) with RNA-seq. Microbe-derived cfRNAs were consistently detected by different computational methods when potential contaminations were carefully filtered. Clinically relevant signals were identified from human and microbial reads, and enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of downregulated human genes and higher prevalence torque teno viruses both suggest that a fraction of cancer patients were immunosuppressed. Our data support the diagnostic value of human and microbe-derived plasma cfRNAs for cancer detection, as an area under the ROC curve of approximately 0.9 for distinguishing cancer patients from HDs was achieved. Moreover, human and microbial cfRNAs both have cancer type specificity, and combining two types of features could distinguish tumors of five different primary locations with an average recall of 60.4%. Compared to using human features alone, adding microbial features improved the average recall by approximately 8%. In summary, this work provides evidence for the clinical relevance of human and microbe-derived plasma cfRNAs and their potential utilities in cancer detection as well as the determination of tumor sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolutionary history of human spindle genes includes back-and-forth gene flow with Neandertals</a></h4>

              
                Proteins associated with the spindle apparatus, a cytoskeletal structure that ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, experienced an unusual number of amino acid substitutions in modern humans after the split from the ancestors of Neandertals and Denisovans. Here, we analyze the history of these substitutions and show that some of the genes in which they occur may have been targets of positive selection. We also find that the two changes in the kinetochore scaffold 1 (KNL1) protein, previously believed to be specific to modern humans, were present in some Neandertals. We show that the <i>KNL1</i> gene of these Neandertals shared a common ancestor with present-day Africans about 200,000 years ago due to gene flow from the ancestors (or relatives) of modern humans into Neandertals. Subsequently, some non-Africans inherited this modern human-like gene variant from Neandertals, but none inherited the ancestral gene variants. These results add to the growing evidence of early contacts between modern humans and archaic groups in Eurasia and illustrate the intricate relationships among these groups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Engineered natural killer cells impede the immunometabolic CD73-adenosine axis in solid tumors</a></h4>

              
                Immunometabolic reprogramming due to adenosine produced by CD73 (encoded by the 5'-ectonucleotidase gene <i>NT5E</i>) is a recognized immunosuppressive mechanism contributing to immune evasion in solid tumors. Adenosine is not only known to contribute to tumor progression, but it has specific roles in driving dysfunction of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we engineered human NK cells to directly target the CD73-adenosine axis by blocking the enzymatic activity of CD73. In doing so, the engineered NK cells not only impaired adenosinergic metabolism driven by the hypoxic uptake of ATP by cancer cells in a model of non-small-cell lung cancer, but also mediated killing of tumor cells due to the specific recognition of overexpressed CD73. This resulted in a 'single agent' immunotherapy that combines antibody specificity, blockade of purinergic signaling, and killing of targets mediated by NK cells. We also showed that CD73-targeted NK cells are potent <i>in vivo</i> and result in tumor arrest, while promoting NK cell infiltration into CD73<sup>+</sup> tumors and enhancing intratumoral activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correspondence between the layered structure of deep language models and temporal structure of natural language processing in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Deep language models (DLMs) provide a novel computational paradigm for how the brain processes natural language. Unlike symbolic, rule-based models from psycholinguistics, DLMs encode words and their context as continuous numerical vectors. These "embeddings" are constructed by a sequence of layered computations to ultimately capture surprisingly sophisticated representations of linguistic structures. How does this layered hierarchy map onto the human brain during natural language comprehension? In this study, we used ECoG to record neural activity in language areas along the superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus while human participants listened to a 30-minute spoken narrative. We supplied this same narrative to a high-performing DLM (GPT2-XL) and extracted the contextual embeddings for each word in the story across all 48 layers of the model. We next trained a set of linear encoding models to predict the temporally-evolving neural activity from the embeddings at each layer. We found a striking correspondence between the layer-by-layer sequence of embeddings from GPT2-XL and the temporal sequence of neural activity in language areas. In addition, we found evidence for the gradual accumulation of recurrent information along the linguistic processing hierarchy. However, we also noticed additional neural processes that took place in the brain, but not in DLMs, during the processing of surprising (unpredictable) words. These findings point to a connection between language processing in humans and DLMs where the layer-by-layer accumulation of contextual information in DLM embeddings matches the temporal dynamics of neural activity in high-order language areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for absence of links between striatal dopamine synthesis capacity and working memory capacity, spontaneous eye-blink rate, and trait impulsivity</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in striatal dopamine synthesis capacity have been associated with working memory capacity, trait impulsivity and spontaneous eye-blink rate (sEBR), as measured with readily available and easily administered, off-the-shelf tests. Such findings have raised the suggestion that individual variation in dopamine synthesis capacity, estimated with expensive and invasive brain positron emission tomography (PET) scans, can be approximated with simple, more pragmatic tests. However, direct evidence for the relationship between these simple trait measures and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity has been limited and inconclusive. We measured striatal dopamine synthesis capacity using [18F]-FDOPA PET in a large sample of healthy volunteers (N=94) and assessed the correlation with simple, short tests of working memory capacity, trait impulsivity, and sEBR. We additionally explored the relationship with an index of subjective reward sensitivity. None of these trait measures correlated significantly with striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, nor did they have out-of-sample predictive power. Bayes Factor analyses indicated the evidence was in favor of absence of correlations for all but subjective reward sensitivity. These results warrant caution for using these off-the-shelf trait measures as proxies of striatal dopamine synthesis capacity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perturbations of a causal synaptic molecular network in autism and schizophrenia revealed with multiplexed imaging</a></h4>

              
                The complex functions of neuronal synapses in the central nervous system depend on their tightly interacting, compartmentalized molecular network of hundreds of proteins spanning the pre- and post-synaptic sites. This biochemical system is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, with identified common synaptopathologies and numerous risk genes associated with synaptic function. However, it remains unclear how the synaptic molecular network is altered in these disorders, and whether effects are common to distinct genetic perturbations. Here, we applied PRISM, a quantitative single-synapse multiplexed imaging technique, to systematically probe the effects of RNAi knockdown of 16 autism- and schizophrenia-associated genes on the simultaneous distribution of 10 synaptic proteins. This enabled the identification of novel phenotypes in synapse compositions and distributions. We applied Bayesian network inference to construct and validate a predictive model of causal hierarchical dependencies among eight proteins of the excitatory synapse. The resulting conditional dependence relationships could only be accessed via measurement which is both single-synapse and multiprotein, unique to PRISM. Finally, we show that central features of the network are similarly affected across distinct gene knockdowns. These results offer insight into the convergent molecular etiology of these debilitating, hereditary and highly polygenic disorders, as well as offering a novel, general framework for probing subcellular molecular networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel processing relies on a distributed, low-dimensional cortico-cerebellar architecture</a></h4>

              
                A characteristic feature of human cognition is our ability to 'multi-task' - performing two or more tasks in parallel - particularly when one task is well-learned. How the brain supports this capacity remains poorly understood. Most past studies have focussed on identifying the areas of the brain - typically the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - that are required to navigate information processing bottlenecks. In contrast, we take a systems neuroscience approach to test the hypothesis that the capacity to conduct effective parallel processing relies on a distributed architecture that interconnects the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum. The latter structure contains over half of the neurons in the adult human brain, and is well-suited to support the fast, effective, dynamic sequences required to perform tasks relatively automatically. By delegating stereotyped within-task computations to the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex can be freed up to focus on the more challenging aspects of performing the tasks in parallel. To test this hypothesis, we analysed task-based fMRI data from 50 participants who performed a task in which they either balanced an avatar on a screen ('Balance'), performed serial-7 subtractions ('Calculation') or performed both in parallel ('Dual-Task'). Using a set of approaches that include dimensionality reduction, structure-function coupling and time-varying functional connectivity, we provide robust evidence in support of our hypothesis. We conclude that distributed interactions between the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are crucially involved in parallel processing in the human brain.

                Emotionally expressive faces evoke enhanced neural responses in multiple brain regions, a phenomenon thought to depend critically on the amygdala. This emotion-related modulation is evident even in primary visual cortex (V1), providing a potential neural substrate by which emotionally salient stimuli can affect perception. How does emotional valence information, computed in the amygdala, reach V1? Here we use high-resolution functional MRI to investigate the layer profile and retinotopic distribution of neural activity specific to emotional facial expressions. Across three experiments, human participants viewed centrally presented face stimuli varying in emotional expression and performed a gender judgment task. We found that facial valence sensitivity was evident only in superficial cortical layers and was not restricted to the retinotopic location of the stimuli, consistent with diffuse feedback-like projections from the amygdala. Together, our results provide a feedback mechanism by which the amygdala directly modulates activity at the earliest stage of visual processing.

                Voxel-wise encoding models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art predictive models of brain activity evoked by natural movies. Despite the superior predictive performance of CNN-based models, the huge number of parameters in these models have made them difficult to interpret for domain experts. Here, we investigate the role of model compression in building more interpretable and more stable CNN-based voxel-wise models. We used (1) structural compression techniques to prune less important CNN filters and connections, (2) a receptive field compression method to choose the model receptive fields with optimal center and size, and (3) principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the model. We demonstrate that the compressed models offer a more stable interpretation of voxel-wise pattern selectivity compared to uncompressed models. Furthermore, our receptive field compressed models reveal that the optimal model receptive fields become larger along the ventral visual pathway, as the receptive fields become more centralized. Overall, our findings unveil the role of model compression in building more interpretable voxel-wise models.

                Cerebral cortex supports representations of the world in patterns of neural activity, used by the brain to make decisions and guide behavior. Past work has found diverse or limited changes in the primary sensory cortex in response to learning, suggesting the key computations might occur in downstream regions. Alternatively, sensory cortical changes may be central to learning. To study changes in sensory cortical representations, we trained mice to recognize entirely novel, non-sensory patterns of cortical activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) created by direct optogenetic stimulation. As animals learned to use these novel patterns, we found their detection abilities improved by an order of magnitude or more. The behavioral change was accompanied by large increases in V1 neural responses to fixed optogenetic input. Neural response amplification to novel optogenetic inputs had little effect on existing visual sensory responses. Amplification would seem to be desirable to improve decision-making in a detection task, and thus these data suggest adult cortical plasticity plays a significant role in improving the detection of novel sensory inputs during learning.

Event-based modelling of disease progression (EBM) is a data-driven technique for inferring a sequence of biomarker abnormalities, or events, from cross-sectional or short-term longitudinal datasets and has been applied to a variety of different diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional EBM (C-EBM) assumes the sequence of biomarker abnormalities occurs in series, with one biomarker event per disease progression stage. However, events may occur simultaneously, for example due to the presence of shared causal factors, a property which cannot be inferred from C-EBM. Here we introduce simultaneous EBM (S-EBM), a generalisation of C-EBM to enable estimation of simultaneous events. S-EBM can estimate a wider range of sequence types than C-EBM while being fully backward compatible with the original model. Using simulated data, we firstly demonstrate the inability of C-EBM to infer simultaneous events. We next assess the accuracy of S-EBM against ground truth data and subsequently demonstrate a real-world example application to sequence disease progression in AD. Simulations show that C-EBM can not discern serial events with high biomarker variance from simultaneous events, preventing its use for inferring simultaneous events. S-EBM has high estimation accuracy against ground truth for a range of sequence types (fully simultaneous, partially simultaneous, serial), number of biomarkers and biomarker variances. When applied to Alzheimer's disease biomarker data from ADNI, S-EBM estimated a sequence where events within sets of biomarker domains occur simultaneously. Accumulation of total and phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid; performance on RAVLT, ADAS-Cog and MMSE cognitive test scores; and volumetric decline in temporal regional brain volumes, were better described as groups of simultaneous events rather than a single set of serial events (likelihood ratio >> 1,000). Furthermore, C-EBM may be confidently incorrect regarding the serial ordering. S-EBM may be applied to prospective and retrospective biomarker data to refine understanding of disease progression and generate new hypotheses regarding disease aetiology and spread.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of age and sex on dendritic D2 autoreceptor inhibition in substantia nigra dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons are required for voluntary movement and reward learning, and advanced age is associated with motor and cognitive decline. In the midbrain, D2-type autoreceptors located on dendrodendritic synapses between dopamine neurons control cell firing through G protein-activated potassium (GIRK) channels. We previously showed that aging disrupts dopamine neuron pacemaker firing in mice, but only in males. Here we show that D2-receptor inhibitory postsynaptic currents (D2-IPSCs) in aged male mice are moderately smaller compared to young males as well as females, regardless of age. Local application of dopamine revealed a reduction in the amplitude of the D2-receptor currents in old males compared to young, pointing to a postsynaptic mechanism that could not be explained by impairment of the GIRK channels or degeneration of the dendritic arbor. Kinetic analysis showed no differences in D2-IPSCs in old versus young mice or between sexes. Potentiation of D2-IPSCs by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is also conserved in aging, indicating preservation of plasticity mechanisms. These findings have implications for understanding dopamine transmission in aging in both sexes and could explain in part the increased susceptibility of males to SNc degeneration of dopamine neurons in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic cell type structures in vivo neuronal activity across multiple time scales.</a></h4>

              
                Cell type is hypothesized to be a key determinant of the role of a neuron within a circuit. However, it is unknown whether a neuron's transcriptomic type influences the timing of its activity in the intact brain. In other words, can transcriptomic cell type be extracted from the time series of a neuron's activity? To address this question, we developed a new deep learning architecture that learns features of interevent intervals across multiple timescales (milliseconds to >30 min). We show that transcriptomic cell class information is robustly embedded in the timing of single neuron activity recorded in the intact brain of behaving animals (calcium imaging and extracellular electrophysiology), as well as in a bio-realistic model of visual cortex. In contrast, we were unable to reliably extract cell identity from summary measures of rate, variance, and interevent interval statistics. We applied our analyses to the question of whether transcriptomic subtypes of excitatory neurons represent functionally distinct classes. In the calcium imaging dataset, which contains a diverse set of excitatory Cre lines, we found that a subset of excitatory cell types are computationally distinguishable based upon their Cre lines, and that excitatory types can be classified with higher accuracy when considering their cortical layer and projection class. Here we address the fundamental question of whether a neuron, within a complex cortical network, embeds a fingerprint of its transcriptomic identity into its activity. Our results reveal robust computational fingerprints for transcriptomic types and classes across diverse contexts, defined over multiple timescales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter connectivity in uncinate fasciculus accounts for visual attention span in developmental dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                The present study aimed to investigate the role of connectivity disruptions in two fiber pathways, the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and the frontal aslant tract (FAT), in developmental dyslexia and determine the relationship between the connectivity of these pathways and behavioral performance in children with dyslexia. A total of 26 French children with dyslexia and 31 age-matched control children were included. Spherical deconvolution tractography was used to reconstruct the two fiber pathways. Hindrance-modulated oriented anisotropy (HMOA) was used to measure the connectivity of each fiber pathway in both hemispheres. The boys with dyslexia showed reduced HMOA in the UF compared to control boys, but this difference was not observed in girls. Furthermore, HMOA of the UF correlated with individual differences in the visual attention span in participants with dyslexia. All significant results found in HMOA of the UF were verified in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the UF using standard diffusion imaging model. This study suggests a differential sex effect on the connectivity disruption in the UF in developmental dyslexia. It also indicates that the UF may play an essential role in the visual attention span deficit in developmental dyslexia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The specificity of different-distance connections in human structural connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Brain structural connectomes underpin complex cognitive processes. To date, abundant organizational features have been distilled by network-based tools, including hubs, modules, and small-worldness. However, these features are often devoid of spatial characteristics which directly shape connection formation. By considering the spatial embedding of brain networks, we reveal the connection specificity, that is, the similarity of similar-distance connections and the dissimilarity of different-distance connections. It is induced by the whole-brain connection length distribution, allowing areas to send and receive diverse signals through different-distance connections. Based on it, areas' functional repertoires are associated with their connection length profiles, and meanwhile, length dispersion and clustering coefficients can be integrated into a hierarchy whose age-related degeneration may be related to cognitive decline. These results construct a putative bridge between brain spatial, topological, and functional features, expanding our understanding of how different architectures complement and reinforce each other to achieve complicated brain functions.

	<p>Neurological disorders are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular factors and uremic toxins are involved with cognitive impairment in CKD. In addition, vascular dementia-induced alterations in the structure and function of the hippocampus can lead to deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. However, regardless of this clinical evidence, the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in patients with CKD is not fully understood. We used male Sprague Dawley rats and performed 5/6 nephrectomy to observe the changes in behavior, field excitatory postsynaptic potential, and immunostaining of the hippocampus following CKD progression. We measured the hippocampus volume on magnetic resonance imaging scans in the controls (n = 34) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) hemodialysis patients (n = 42). In four cognition-related behavior assays, including novel object recognition, Y-maze, Barnes maze, and classical contextual fear conditioning, we identified deficits in spatial working memory, learning and memory, and contextual memory, as well as the ability to distinguish familiar and new objects, in the rats with CKD. Immunohistochemical staining of Na+/H+ exchanger1 was increased in the hippocampus of the CKD rat models. We performed double immunofluorescent staining for aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein and then verified the high coexpression in the hippocampus of the CKD rat model. Furthermore, results from recoding of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the hippocampus showed the reduced amplitude and slope of fEPSP in the CKD rats. ESRD patients with cognitive impairment showed a significant decrease in the hippocampus volume compared with ESRD patients without cognitive impairment or the controls. Our findings suggest that uremia resulting from decreased kidney function may cause the destruction of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and hippocampus-related cognitive impairment in CKD.</p>

	<p>Background: Frameless robot-assisted deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an innovative technique for leads implantation. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of this technique using the Sinovation SR1 robot. Methods: 35 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease who accepted conventional frame-based DBS surgery (n = 18) and frameless robot-assisted DBS surgery (n = 17) by the same group of neurosurgeons were analyzed. The coordinate of the tip of the intended trajectory was recorded as xi, yi, and zi. The actual position of lead implantation was recorded as xa, ya, and za. The vector error was calculated by the formula of &amp;amp;radic;(xi &amp;amp;minus; xa)2 + (yi &amp;amp;minus; ya)2 + (zi &amp;amp;minus; za)2 to evaluate the accuracy. Results: The vector error was 1.52 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.53 mm (range: 0.20&amp;amp;ndash;2.39 mm) in the robot-assisted group and was 1.77 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.67 mm (0.59&amp;amp;ndash;2.98 mm) in the frame-based group with no significant difference between two groups (p = 0.1301). In 10.7% (n = 3) frameless robot-assisted implanted leads, the vector error was greater than 2.00 mm with a maximum offset of 2.39 mm, and in 35.5% (n = 11) frame-based implanted leads, the vector error was larger than 2.00 mm with a maximum offset of 2.98 mm. Leads were more posterior than planned trajectories in the robot-assisted group and more medial and posterior in the conventional frame-based group. Conclusions: Awake frameless robot-assisted DBS surgery was comparable to the conventional frame-based technique in the accuracy and precision for leads implantation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification and targeting of a unique NaV1.7 domain driving chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Despite identification of several small molecules directly targeting the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, none has been clinically successful. We reported that preventing addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) on the NaV1.7-interacting cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) blocked NaV1.7 functions and was antinociceptive in rodents. Here, we discovered a 15 amino acid CRMP2 regulatory sequence (CRS) unique to NaV1.7 that is essential for this regulatory coupling. CRMP2 preferentially bound to the NaV1.7 CRS over other isoforms. Substitution of the NaV1.7 CRS with the homologous domains from the other eight voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms decreased tetrodotoxin-sensitive NaV1.7 currents in rodent sensory neurons. A cell-penetrant version of NaV1.7-CRS reduced NaV1.7 currents and trafficking, decreased presynaptic NaV1.7 localization, reduced spinal neurotransmitter release, and reversed mechanical allodynia in a rat spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. Interfering with NaV1.7-CRMP2 coupling did not produce motor impairment and spared thermal, inflammatory, and post-surgical nociception. As proof-of-concept for NaV1.7-targeted gene therapy, we found that NaV1.7-CRS packaged into an adeno-associated virus recapitulated the effects on NaV1.7 function in both rodent and rhesus macaque sensory neurons and both reversed and prevented the development of mechanical allodynia in a neuropathic pain model in male and female rodents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In-vivo fast non-linear microscopy reveals impairment of fast axonal transport induced by molecular motor imbalances in the brain of zebrafish larvae</a></h4>

              
                Cargo transport by molecular motors along microtubules is essential for the function of eucaryotic cells, in particular neurons in which axonal transport defects constitute the early pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Mainly studied in motor and sensory neurons, axonal transport is still difficult to characterize in neurons of the brain in absence of appropriate in vivo tools. Here, we measured fast axonal transport by tracing the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) nanocrystals endocytosed by brain neurons of zebrafish (Zf) larvae. Thanks to the optical translucency of Zf larvae and of the perfect photostability of nanoKTP SHG, we achieved a high scanning speed of 20 frames (of {approx}90 mx60 m size) per second in Zf brain. We focused our study on endosomal transport in axons of known polarization, separately analyzing kinesin and dynein motor-driven displacements. To validate our assay, we used either loss-of-function mutations of dynein or kinesin 1 or the dynein inhibitor dynapyrazole, and quantified several transport parameters. We successfully demonstrated that dynapyrazole reduces nanoKTP mobile fraction and retrograde run length consistently, while the retrograde run length increased in kinesin 1 mutants. Taking advantage of nanoKTP SHG directional emission, we also quantified fluctua- tions of endosome orientation. Thus, by combining endocytosis of nanocrystals having non-linear response, fast two-photon microscopy, and high-throughput analysis, we are able to finely monitor fast axonal transport in vivo in the brain of a vertebrate, and re- veal subtle axonal transport alterations. The high spatiotemporal resolution achieved in our model may be relevant to precisely investigate axonal transport impairment associated to disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromechanical Coupling is Reflected in the Spatial Organization of the Spinal Motoneuron Pools</a></h4>

              
                The anatomy of muscles is complex, so that a given movement can result from the activity of multiple muscle combinations, a concept termed redundancy. The central nervous system must resolve this redundancy to produce coordinated and efficient motion. One proposed mechanism that simplifies motor control is through the neural embedding of musculoskeletal dynamics. We have shown previously that the musculoskeletal anatomy of the upper extremity is organized in functional agonistic and antagonistic groups through mechanical coupling. However, it remains unknown if the neural anatomy of the spinal motoneuron pools somatotopically embeds this musculoskeletal anatomy. Here, we develop a three-dimensional model of the macaque cervical spinal cord and a corresponding OpenSim model of the upper extremity to characterize the structure-function relationship of spinal motoneurons innervating upper limb musculature. We hypothesize that the motoneuron pools of agonistic muscles that perform a coordinated action are located closer together in the spinal cord compared to antagonistic muscles. We used the spinal cord model to quantify the spatial relationship between motoneuron pools, and we used the OpenSim model to quantify the functional relationship between muscles. We used a hierarchical clustering analysis compare the structural and functional relationships. We found that the spatial organization of motoneuron pools in the spinal cord broadly mimics the anatomical relationships between muscle lengths and moment arms. Furthermore, within the same segment, the motoneurons innervating synergistic muscles were located closer to each other than to the motoneurons innervating antagonistic muscles, while across segments the motoneurons innervating specific antagonistic groups of muscles were colocalized. These results suggest that the mechanical coupling of the musculoskeletal system is embedded in the spinal cord anatomy underlying the modular organization of the neural motor control system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel planning through an optimal neural subspace in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Preparatory activity in motor cortex may facilitate movement execution by representing movement parameters (representational theory) or by initializing movement-related dynamics to an optimal state (dynamical system theory). Here, we confronted these two theories using neural data from non-human primates. We analyzed the structure of preparatory activity in a task where animals needed to plan two movements simultaneously. Contrary to what the representational theory predicted, we did not find evidence for the concurrent representation of the two movements. Instead, our data revealed that parallel planning was achieved by adjusting preparatory activity to an intermediate state that served as an optimal initial condition to generate both movements. This optimization quantitatively explained fluctuations in the animals behavior, and directly supported the dynamical system theory. Together, these results uncover a simple mechanism for planning multiple movements in parallel, and shed light on an enduring debate about the nature of preparatory activity in motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reducing Merkel cell activity in the whisker follicle disrupts cortical encoding of whisker movement amplitude and velocity</a></h4>

              
                Merkel cells (MCs) and associated primary sensory afferents of the whisker follicle-sinus complex robustly code whisker self-movement, angle, and whisk phase during whisking. However, direct evidence of their roles in encoding whisker movement at cortical level is currently missing. To this end, spiking activity of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (wS1) neurons was measured in response to varying whisker deflection amplitude and velocity in transgenic mice with previously established reduced mechanoelectrical coupling at MC-associated afferents. Under reduced MC activity, wS1 neurons exhibited increased sensitivity to whisker deflection. This appeared to arise from a lack of variation in response magnitude to varying whisker deflection amplitude and velocity. This latter effect was further indicated by weaker variation in the temporal profile of the evoked spiking activity when whisker deflection amplitude and velocity varied. Nevertheless, under reduced MC activity, wS1 neurons retained the ability to discriminate stimulus features based on the timing of the first post-stimulus spike. Collectively, results from this study suggest that MCs contribute to both cortical encoding of whisker amplitude and velocity predominantly by tuning cortical response magnitude and by patterning evoked spiking activity, rather than in tuning cortical response latency.

                BackgroundIntra-individual variability (IIV) during cognitive task performance is a key behavioral index of attention and consistent marker of ADHD. In adults, lower IIV has been associated with anticorrelation between the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) - thought to underlie effective allocation of attention. However, whether these behavioral and neural markers of attention are (i) associated with each other and (ii) can predict future attention-related deficits has not been examined in a developmental, population-based cohort.

MethodsWe examined relationships at the baseline visit between IIV on three cognitive tasks, DMN-DAN anticorrelation, and parent-reported attention problems using the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study (n=11,878 participants, aged 9-10, female=47.8%). We also investigated whether behavioral and neural markers of attention at baseline predicted attention problems, 1, 2, and 3 years later.

ResultsAt baseline, greater DMN-DAN anticorrelation was associated with lower IIV across all three cognitive tasks (unstandardized {beta}: 0.22-0.25). Older age at baseline was associated with stronger DMN-DAN anticorrelation and lower IIV ({beta}: -0.005--0.0004). Weaker DMN-DAN anticorrelation and IIV were cross-sectionally associated with attention problems ({beta}: 1.41-7.63). Longitudinally, lower IIV at baseline was associated with less severe attention problems, 1-3 years later, after accounting for baseline attention problems ({beta}: 0.288-0.77).

ConclusionsThe results suggest that IIV in early adolescence is associated with worsening attention problems in a representative cohort of US youth. Attention deficits in early adolescence may be important for understanding and predicting future cognitive and clinical outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Network Architecture Constrains Age-related Cortical Thinning</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cortical atrophy, approximated by cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance imaging, follows a characteristic pattern over the lifespan. Although its determinants remain unknown, mounting evidence demonstrates correspondence between the connectivity profiles of structural and functional brain networks and cortical atrophy in health and neurological disease. Here, we performed a cross-sectional multimodal neuroimaging analysis of 2633 individuals from a large population-based cohort to characterize the association between age-related differences in cortical thickness and functional as well as structural brain network topology. We identified a widespread pattern of age-related cortical thickness differences including hotspots of strong age effects located in brain areas with high centrality (structural network hubs). Regional age-related differences were furthermore strongly correlated within the structurally defined node neighborhood. The overall pattern of thickness differences as well as its change throughout the later lifespan was found to be anchored in the functional network hierarchy as encoded by macroscale functional connectivity gradients. Lastly, the identified difference pattern covaried significantly with cognitive and motor performance. Our findings indicate that connectivity profiles of functional and structural brain networks might act as organizing principles behind age-related cortical thinning as an imaging surrogate of cortical atrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CNS myelination requires VAMP2/3-mediated membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Myelin is required for rapid nerve signaling and is emerging as a key driver of CNS plasticity and disease. How myelin is built and remodeled remains a fundamental question of neurobiology. Central to myelination is the ability of oligodendrocytes to add vast amounts of new cell membrane, expanding their surface areas by many thousand-fold. However, how oligodendrocytes add new membrane to build or remodel myelin is unknown. Here, we show that CNS myelin membrane addition requires exocytosis mediated by the vesicular SNARE proteins VAMP2/3. Genetic inactivation of VAMP2/3 in myelinating oligodendrocytes caused severe hypomyelination and premature death without overt loss of oligodendrocytes. Through live imaging, we discovered that VAMP2/3-mediated exocytosis drives membrane expansion within myelin sheaths to initiate wrapping and power sheath elongation. In conjunction with membrane expansion, mass spectrometry of oligodendrocyte surface proteins revealed that VAMP2/3 incorporates axon-myelin adhesion proteins that are collectively required to form nodes of Ranvier. Together, our results demonstrate that VAMP2/3-mediated membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes is indispensable for myelin formation, uncovering a cellular pathway that could sculpt myelination patterns in response to activity-dependent signals or be therapeutically targeted to promote regeneration in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular contributions to ictal population signals</a></h4>

              
                The amplitude of ictal activity is a defining feature of epileptic seizures, but the determinants of this amplitude have not been studied. Pathological synchronization of neuronal activity is assumed to be the main driver of increased ictal amplitudes. However, cell intrinsic changes that drive pathological neuronal discharges may also contribute to ictal amplitude. Clinically, ictal amplitudes are measured electrographically (using e.g. EEG, ECoG, and depth electrodes), but these methods do not enable the assessment of the contributions of the amplitudes of individual neurons as well as synchronization to the amplitude of the ictal signal. We therefore measured ictal population activity by recording both electrographic local field potentials (LFP) and neuronal calcium levels, the latter measured using optical imaging of neuronal transgenic calcium-sensitive fluorophores. Spontaneous seizure activity was first assessed in an awake, behaving mouse model of focal cortical injury, using paired GCaMP6-based calcium imaging and LFP electrical recording. Spontaneous recurrent seizures were then measured in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC), with a combination of GCaMP7 calcium imaging and LFP recordings. OHSC is an in vitro preparation in which all electrical and calcium signals could be unambiguously ascribed to the epileptic network. Population-averaged calcium activity was highly correlated with the time integral of electrographic field recordings, both in vivo and in vitro. We found that cell intrinsic changes were the largest contributor to the population signal during seizure onset. In other words, the network signal was not merely the summation of highly synchronous physiological activity, but that individual neurons were generating pathological discharges. During frank seizure, individual neurons continued to generate pathological activity, which also became highly synchronized. Interestingly, recruitment of newly active neurons accounted for only a small fraction of synchronous activity, particularly in vivo, revealing that network synchrony was largely due to reactivation of the same population of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticostriatal Beta Power Changes Associated with Cognitive Function in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairment (CI) is the most frequent nonmotor symptom in Parkinsons Disease (PD) and is associated with deficits in executive functions such as working memory. Previous studies have demonstrated that caudate beta power underlies learning and working memory. Decreased dopamine in motor cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits results in increased beta power and PD motor symptoms. Analogous changes in cognitive CSTC circuits, including the caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), may contribute to PD CI. A better understanding of anatomic structures and neurophysiologic changes associated with working memory deficits is needed to develop potential neuromodulatory treatment strategies for PD CI. The objective of our study is to evaluate neurophysiologic changes underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD patients via direct local field potential recordings during deep brain stimulation surgery. Fifteen patients were included, one of which completed 2 minutes of resting state data collection while the other fourteen completed resting state collection and task based data collection with a verbal working memory 2-back task with feedback. LFP signals from DLPFC (50 channels) and caudate (25 channels) were sampled at 1000Hz, demeaned by channel and aligned to task events of encoding and feedback. Correlations of resting state beta power and pre-operative neuropsychological testing as well as caudate volumes were performed. Beta power decreased in both DLPFC and caudate during encoding and was significantly different for correct and incorrect trials, whereas beta power increased in DLPFC and caudate during feedback and was significantly different for correct and incorrect trials. Beta power during encoding was inversely correlated with memory scores on pre-operative neuropsychological testing. Understanding neurophysiologic correlates of cognitive dysfunction within cognitive CSTC circuits will aid in development of novel neuromodulatory therapies for patients with PD CI and other cognitive disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult neural stem cells and neurogenesis are resilient to intermittent fasting</a></h4>

              
                Intermittent fasting (IF) is a promising non-pharmacological strategy to counteract ageing which has been shown to increase the number of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus of mice. However, it is still unclear which steps of the adult neurogenesis process are regulated by IF. The number of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) decreases with age in an activation-dependent manner. To counteract the loss of the stem cell pool, adult NSCs are mostly found in an inactive, quiescent state which ensures their long-term maintenance. We aimed to determine if and how IF impacts the activity and maintenance of adult NSCs in the hippocampus. We chose an every-other-day fasting protocol with food re-administration at night, which we found effectively induces fasting features and preserves the circadian activity pattern of mice. To determine the effects of IF on NSCs and all following steps in the neurogenic lineage, we combined fasting with lineage tracing and label retention assays. We found that IF does not affect NSC activation or maintenance. Contrary to previous reports, we also found that IF does not increase hippocampal neurogenesis. We obtained the same results regardless of strain, sex, diet length, tamoxifen administration or new-born neuron identification method. Our data suggest that NSCs maintain homeostasis upon IF and that this intervention is not a reliable strategy to increase adult neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal structural change of gray matter before and after hemispherotomy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hemispherotomy is an effective surgery developed to treat refractory epilepsy caused by diffuse unihemispheric pathologies. Post-surgery neuroplastic mechanisms supporting behavioral recovery after left and right hemispherotomy as well as their difference remain largely unclear. Methods: In a large cohort of 57 pediatric patients who underwent hemispherotomy, voxel-wise GMV in unaffected regions (contralesional cerebrum and bilateral cerebellum) and behavioral abilities were assessed before and after surgery. Using linear mixed models, we evaluated changes in GMV and behavioral scores, and how GMV changes correlated with improvements in behavioral scores. In addition, three machine learning regression algorithms were applied to assess whether preoperative GMV can predict postoperative behavior. Results: In the two patient groups (29 left hemispherotomy patients, age of surgery mean {+/-} standard deviation = 3.5 {+/-} 2.5; 28 right hemispherotomy patients, age of surgery 4.6 {+/-} 2.5), widespread increases in the postoperative GMV in the contralateral cerebrum and ipsilateral cerebellum but decreases in the postoperative GMV in the contralateral cerebellum were consistently observed. Importantly, the decrease in GMV in the contralateral cerebellum was significantly correlated with improvement in behavioral scores in right but not left hemispherotomy patients. Moreover, the preoperative GMV around the most longitudinally changed locations significantly predicted postoperative behavioral scores in left but not right hemispherotomy patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicate an important role for the contralateral cerebellum in the recovery after right hemispherotomy, and postoperative behavioral scores can be predicted with preoperative GMV features.

                The reportability of spontaneous thinking relies significantly on attention and arousal. As these cognitive faculties change with age, we aimed at testing how spontaneous mental state reportability is influenced accordingly. Using experience sampling, 20 senior (65-75yrs) and 20 young participants (20-30yrs) were prompted to report mind-wandering (MW), mind-blanking (MB), or sensory-related (S) mental states at random times. Attention was assessed with the Attentional Style Questionnaire, and arousal with continuous monitoring of pupil diameter. First, we found more MW occurrences than MB or S across all participants. For young responders, we replicated that MW was more prevalent in easily-distracted participants. In seniors, though, MW was more prevalent in participants with a higher focused attentional style. In senior participants who reported being more easily distracted, MW was associated with lower arousal (pupil constriction) and MB with higher arousal (pupil dilation), reversing the pattern found for young adults and focused seniors. We propose that these effects may result from intentional MW, during which senior participants allocate attentional resources to mentally engage inwards, as opposed to younger participants who get more easily distracted by their own mental activity leading to unintentional MW. Together, our results highlight age-dependent mechanisms by which attentional style and pupil-linked arousal regulate the reportability of spontaneous mental states across age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiplexing working memory and time: encoding retrospective and prospective information in neural trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) and timing are generally considered distinct cognitive functions, but similar neural signatures have been implicated in both. To explore the hypothesis that WM and timing may rely on shared neural mechanisms, we used psychophysical tasks that contained either task-irrelevant timing or WM components. In both cases the task-irrelevant component influenced performance. RNN simulations revealed that cue-specific neural sequences, which multiplexed WM and time, emerged as the dominant regime that captured the behavioral findings. Over the course of training RNN dynamics transitioned from low-dimensional ramps to high-dimensional neural sequences, and depending on task requirements, steady-state or ramping activity was also observed. Analysis of RNN structure revealed that neural sequences relied primarily on inhibitory connections, and could survive the deletion of all excitatory-to-excitatory connections. Our results suggest that in some instances WM is encoded in time-varying neural activity because of the importance of predicting when WM will be used.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TPH2 knockout male rats are aggressive, show less anxiety, and exhibit an altered oxytocin system</a></h4>

              
                The central serotoninergic system is critical for stress responsivity and social behavior, and its dysregulations has been centrally implicated in virtually all neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetic serotonin depletion animal models could provide a tool to elucidate the causes and mechanisms of diseases and to develop new treatment approaches. Previously mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) have been developed, showing altered behaviors and neurotransmission. However, the effect of congenital serotonin deficiency on emotional and social behavior in rats is still largely unknown, as are the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we used Tph2 knockout (Tph2-/-) male rat model to study how the lack of serotonin in the rat brain affects anxiety-like and social behaviors. Since oxytocin is centrally implicated in these behaviors, we furthermore explored whether effects of Tph2 knockout on behavior would relate to changes in the oxytocin system. We show that Tph2-/- rats display reduced anxiety-like behavior and a high level of aggression in social interactions. In addition, oxytocin receptor expression was increased in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortex, paraventricular nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and some subregions of hippocampus, which was paralleled by increased levels of oxytocin in the medial frontal cortex, paraventricular nucleus, but not the dorsal raphe nucleus, central amygdala and hippocampus. In conclusion, our study demonstrated reduced anxiety but exaggerated aggression in Tph2-/- male rats and reveals for the first time a potential involvement of altered oxytocin system function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Does vendor breeding colony influence sign- and goal-tracking in Pavlovian conditioned approach? A preregistered empirical replication</a></h4>

              
                Vendor differences are thought to affect Pavlovian conditioning in rats. After observing possible differences in sign-tracking and goal-tracking behaviour with rats from different breeding colonies, we performed an empirical replication of the effect. 40 male Long-Evans rats from Charles River colonies 'K72' and 'R06' received 11 Pavlovian conditioned approach training sessions (or "autoshaping"), with a lever as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and 10% sucrose as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Each 58-min session consisted of 12 CS-US trials. Paired rats (n = 15/colony) received the US following lever retraction. Unpaired control rats (n = 5/colony) received sucrose during the inter-trial interval. Next, we evaluated the conditioned reinforcing properties of the CS, by determining whether rats would learn to nose-poke into a new, active (vs. inactive) port to receive CS presentations alone (no sucrose). Preregistered confirmatory analyses showed that during autoshaping sessions, Paired rats made significantly more CS-triggered entries into the sucrose port (i.e., goal-tracking) and lever activations (sign-tracking) than Unpaired rats did, demonstrating acquisition of the CS-US association. Confirmatory analyses showed no effects of breeding colony on autoshaping. During conditioned reinforcement testing, analysis of data from Paired rats alone showed significantly more active vs. inactive nosepokes, suggesting that in these rats, the lever CS acquired incentive motivational properties. Analysing Paired rats alone also showed that K72 rats had higher Pavlovian Conditioned Approach scores than R06 rats did. Thus, breeding colony can affect outcome in Pavlovian conditioned approach studies, and animal breeding source should be considered as a covariate in such work.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The rostral zona incerta: a subcortical integrative hub and potential DBS target for OCD</a></h4>

              
                Background: The zona incerta (ZI) is involved in mediating survival behaviors and is connected to a wide range of cortical and subcortical structures, including key basal ganglia nuclei. Based on these connections and their links to behavioral modulation, we propose the ZI is a connectional hub for mediating between top-down and bottom-up control and a possible target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder. Methods: We analyzed the trajectory of cortical fibers to the ZI in nonhuman and human primates, based on tracer injections in monkeys and high-resolution diffusion MRI in humans. The organization of cortical and subcortical connections with the ZI were identified in the nonhuman primate studies. Results: Monkey anatomic data and human dMRI data showed a similar trajectory of fibers/streamlines to the ZI. PFC/ACC terminals all converge within the rostral ZI (ZIr), with dorsal and lateral areas most prominent. Motor areas terminate caudally. Dense subcortical reciprocal connections included the thalamus, medial hypothalamus, substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, reticular formation, and pedunculopontine nucleus and a dense nonreciprocal projection to the lateral habenula (LHb). Additional connections included amygdala, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal grey. Conclusions: Dense connections with dorsal and lateral PFC/ACC cognitive control areas and LHb and SN/VTA coupled with inputs from the amygdala, hypothalamus, and brainstem, suggests that the ZIr is a subcortical hub positioned to modulate between top-down and bottom-up control. A DBS electrode placed in the ZIr would involve both connections common to other DBS sites, but also would capture several critically distinctive connections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced brain structure-function tethering in transmodal cortex revealed by high-frequency eigenmodes</a></h4>

              
                The brain's structural connectome supports signal propagation between neuronal elements, shaping diverse coactivation patterns that can be captured as functional connectivity. While the link between structure and function remains an ongoing challenge, the prevailing hypothesis is that the structure-function relationship may itself be gradually decoupled along a macroscale functional gradient spanning unimodal to transmodal regions. However, this hypothesis is strongly constrained by the underlying models which may neglect requisite signaling mechanisms. Here, we transform the structural connectome into a set of orthogonal eigenmodes governing frequency-specific diffusion patterns and show that regional structure-function relationships vary markedly under different signaling mechanisms. Specifically, low-frequency eigenmodes, which are considered sufficient to capture the essence of the functional network, contribute little to functional connectivity reconstruction in transmodal regions, resulting in structure-function decoupling along the unimodal-transmodal gradient. In contrast, high-frequency eigenmodes, which are usually on the periphery of attention due to their association with noisy and random dynamical patterns, contribute significantly to functional connectivity prediction in transmodal regions, inducing gradually convergent structure-function relationships from unimodal to transmodal regions. Although the information in high-frequency eigenmodes is weak and scattered, it effectively enhances the structure-function correspondence by 35% in unimodal regions and 56% in transmodal regions. Altogether, our findings suggest that the structure-function divergence in transmodal areas may not be an intrinsic property of brain organization, but can be narrowed through multiplexed and regionally specialized signaling mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oscillatory mechanisms of intrinsic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies of hemodynamic fluctuations have shown specific network-based organization of the brain at rest, yet the neurophysiological underpinning of these networks in human brain remain unclear. Here, we recorded resting-state activities of neuronal populations in the key regions of default mode network (DMN, posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex), frontoparietal network (FPN, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule), and salience network (SN, anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) from 42 human participants using intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). We observed stronger within-network connectivity of the DMN, FPN and SN in broadband iEEG power, stronger phase synchronization within the DMN across theta and alpha bands, and weaker phase synchronization within the FPN in delta, theta and alpha band. We also found positive power correlations in high frequency band (70-170Hz) and negative power correlations in alpha and beta band for FPN-DMN and FPN-SN. Robust negative correlations in DMN-SN were found in alpha, beta and gamma band. These findings provide intracranial electrophysiological evidence in support of the network model for intrinsic organization of human brain and shed light on the way how the brain networks communicate at rest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale capture of hidden fluorescent labels for training generalizable markerless motion capture models</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in deep learning-based markerless pose estimation have dramatically improved the scale and ease with which body landmarks can be tracked in studies of animal behavior. However, pose estimation for animals in a laboratory setting still faces some specific challenges. Researchers typically need to manually generate new training data for each experimental setup and visual environment, limiting the generalizability of this approach. With each network being trained from scratch, different investigators track distinct anatomical landmarks and analyze the resulting kinematic data in idiosyncratic ways. Moreover, much of the movement data is discarded: only a few sparse landmarks are typically labeled, due to the inherent scale and accuracy limits of manual annotation. To address these issues, we developed an approach, which we term GlowTrack, for generating large training datasets that overcome the relatively modest limits of manual labeling, enabling deep learning models that generalize across experimental contexts. The key innovations are: a) an automated, high-throughput approach for generating hidden labels free of human error using fluorescent markers; b) a multi-camera, multi-light setup for generating large amounts of training data under diverse visual conditions; and c) a technique for massively parallel tracking of hundreds of landmarks simultaneously using computer vision feature matching algorithms, providing dense coverage for kinematic analysis at a resolution not currently available. These advances yield versatile deep learning models that are trained at scale, laying the foundation for standardized behavioral pipelines and more complete scrutiny of animal movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cohort-mean measured macromolecules lead to more robust linear-combination modeling than subject-specific or parameterized ones</a></h4>

              
                Expert consensus recommends linear-combination modeling (LCM) of proton MR spectra with sequence-specific simulated metabolite basis function and experimentally derived macromolecular (MM) basis functions. Measured MM basis functions have been derived from metabolite-nulled spectra averaged across a small cohort. The use of subject-specific instead of cohort-averaged measured MM basis functions has not been studied. Furthermore, measured MM basis functions are not widely available to non-expert users, who commonly rely on parameterized MM signals internally simulated by LCM software. To investigate the impact of the choice of MM modeling, this study, therefore, compares metabolite level estimates between different MM modeling strategies (cohort-mean measured; subject-specific measured; parameterized) in a lifespan cohort and characterizes its impact on metabolite-age associations. 102 conventional (TE = 30 ms) and metabolite-nulled (TI = 650 ms) PRESS datasets, acquired from the medial parietal lobe in a lifespan cohort (20-70 years of age), were analyzed in Osprey. Short-TE spectra were modeled in Osprey using six different strategies to consider the macromolecular baseline. Fully tissue- and relaxation-corrected metabolite levels were compared between MM strategies. Model performance was evaluated by model residuals, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the impact on metabolite-age associations. The choice of MM strategy had a significant impact on metabolite level estimates. The estimates agreed relatively well between different MM strategies (r > 0.6) and had no major impact on the variance. The lowest relative model residuals and AIC values were found for the cohort-mean measured MM. Metabolite-age associations were consistently found for two major singlet signals (tCr, tCho) for all MM strategies, but varied substantially for highly J-coupled metabolites. A variance partition analysis indicated that up to 44% of the total variance was related to the choice of MM strategy. Additionally, the variance partition analysis reproduced the metabolite-age association for tCr and tCho found in the simpler correlation analysis. In summary, the inclusion of a single high-SNR MM basis function (cohort-mean) leads to more robust metabolite estimation (lower model residuals and AIC values) compared to MM strategies with more degrees of freedom (Gaussian parametrization) or subject-specific MM information. Integration of multiple LCM analyses into a single statistical model potentially improves the robustness in the detection of underlying effects (e.g. metabolite vs age), reduces algorithm-based bias, and estimates algorithm-related variance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phenotypic screening using waveform analysis of calcium dynamics in primary cortical cultures</a></h4>

              
                At present, in vitro phenotypic screening methods are widely used for drug discovery. In the field of epilepsy research, measurements of neuronal activity have been utilized for predicting efficacy of anti-epileptic drugs. Fluorescence measurements of calcium oscillations in neurons are commonly used for measurement of neuronal activities, and some anti-epileptic drugs have been evaluated using this assay technique. However, changes in waveforms were not quantified in previous reports. Here, we have developed a high-throughput screening system containing a new analysis method for quantifying waveforms, and our method has successfully enabled simultaneous measurement of calcium oscillations in a 96-well plate. Features of waveforms were extracted automatically and allowed the characterization of some anti-epileptic drugs using principal component analysis. Moreover, we have shown that trajectories in accordance with the concentrations of compounds in principal component analysis plots were unique to the mechanism of anti-epileptic drugs. We believe that an approach that focuses on the features of calcium oscillations will lead to better understanding of the characteristics of existing anti-epileptic drugs and allow prediction of the mechanism of action of novel drug candidates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural substrate of sex-dependent modulation of motivation by value</a></h4>

              
                While there is emerging evidence of sex differences in decision-making behavior, the neural substrates that underlie such differences remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in mice performing a value-based decision-making task, while choices are similar between the sexes, motivation to engage in the task is modulated by action value in females more strongly than in males. Inhibition of activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons that project to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) disrupts this relationship between value and motivation preferentially in females, without affecting choice in either sex. In line with these effects, in females compared to males, ACC-DMS neurons have stronger representations of negative outcomes, and more neurons are active when the value of the chosen option is low. In contrast, the representation of each choice is similar between the sexes. Thus, we identify a neural substrate that contributes to sex-specific modulation of motivation by value.

	<p>The locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system modulates many visceral and cognitive functions, while LC-NE dysfunction leads to neurological and neurodegenerative conditions such as sleep disorders, depression, ADHD, or Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Innovative viral-vector and gene-engineering technology combined with the availability of cell-specific promoters enabled regional targeting and selective control over phenotypically specific populations of neurons. We transduced the LC-NE neurons in adult male rats by delivering the canine adenovirus type 2-based vector carrying the NE-specific promoter PRSx8 and a light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 receptor (ChR2) directly in the LC or retrogradely from the LC targets. The highest ChR2 expression level was achieved when the virus was delivered medially to the trigeminal pathway and ~100 &amp;amp;mu;m lateral to the LC. The injections close or directly in the LC compromised the tissue integrity and NE cell phenotype. Retrograde labeling was more optimal given the transduction of projection-selective subpopulations. Our results highlight a limited inference of ChR2 expression from representative cases to the entire population of targeted cells. The actual fraction of manipulated neurons appears most essential for an adequate interpretation of the study outcome. The actual fraction of manipulated neurons appears most essential for an adequate interpretation of the study outcome. Thus, besides the cell-type specificity and the transduction efficiency, the between-subject variability in the proportion of the remaining viral-transduced targeted cell population must be considered in any functional connectivity study.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have revealed highly reproducible patterns of temporally lagged brain activity in healthy human adults. However, it is unknown whether temporal organization of intrinsic activity is altered in migraines or if it relates to migraine chronification. In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, temporal features of intrinsic activity were investigated using resting-state lag analysis, and 39 episodic migraine patients, 17 chronic migraine patients, and 35 healthy controls were assessed. Temporally earlier intrinsic activity in the hippocampal complex was revealed in the chronic migraine group relative to the other two groups. We also found earlier intrinsic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex in chronic compared with episodic migraines. Both migraine groups showed earlier intrinsic activity in the lateral temporal cortex and sensorimotor cortex compared with the healthy control group. Across all patients, headache frequency negatively correlated with temporal lag of the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal complex. Disrupted propagation of intrinsic activity in regions involved in sensory, cognitive and affective processing of pain may contribute to abnormal brain function during migraines. Decreased time latency in the lateral temporal cortex and sensorimotor cortex may be common manifestations in episodic and chronic migraines. The temporal features of the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal complex were associated with migraine chronification.</p>

	<p>The presence of neurological symptoms within the clinical range of COVID-19 disease infection has increased. This paper presents the situation of a 45-year-old man having the medical antecedent diabetes mellitus, who presented to the emergency department with fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, nine days following vaccination with the Ad26.COV2-S COVID-19 vaccine. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on nasal polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Two weeks after the presentation, he developed Tolosa&amp;amp;ndash;Hunt Syndrome, an autoimmune phenomenon, with painful left ophthalmoplegia. Significant improvement was seen in terms of his discomfort; however, ptosis and ocular mobility improved only moderately after treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, and the patient was discharged on a new insulin regimen. The patient returned after four weeks and the neurological exam results showed significant signs of right hemiparesis, mixed aphasia, incomplete left ophthalmoplegia, severe headache, and agitation; after a few days, the patient experienced a depressed level of consciousness and coma. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s clinical condition worsened and, unfortunately, he died. MRI brain images revealed multiple ischemic strokes, meningitis, infectious vasculitis, and hemorrhagic encephalitis, which are all serious complications of COVID-19.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Control of lymph node activity by direct local innervation</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system detects environmental and internal stimuli and relays this information to immune cells via neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. This is essential to respond appropriately to immunogenic threats and to support system homeostasis. Lymph nodes (LNs) act as sentinels where adaptive immune responses are generated. They are richly innervated by peripheral sympathetic and sensory nerves, which are responsible for the local secretion of neurotransmitters by sympathetic fibers, such as norepinephrine, and neuropeptides by sensory fibers, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P.
