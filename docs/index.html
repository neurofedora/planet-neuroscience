                arXiv:2410.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic studies of cortical tissue reveal a prevalence of oscillatory activity, that reflect a fine tuning of neural interactions. This research extends neural field theories by incorporating generalized oscillatory dynamics into previous work on conservative or semi-conservative neural field dynamics. Prior studies have largely assumed isotropic connections among neural units; however, this study demonstrates that a broad range of anisotropic and fluctuating connections can still sustain oscillations. Using Lagrangian field methods, we examine different types of connectivity, their dynamics, and potential interactions with neural fields. From this theoretical foundation, we derive a framework that incorporates Hebbian and non-Hebbian learning, i.e., plasticity, into the study of neural fields via the concept of a connectivity field.

                arXiv:2410.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurological disorder. However, the multi-faceted symptoms and large individual differences among ASD patients are hindering the diagnosis process, which largely relies on subject descriptions and lacks quantitative biomarkers. To remediate such problems, this paper explores the use of graph theory and topological data analysis (TDA) to study brain activity in ASD patients and normal controls. We employ the Mapper algorithm in TDA and the distance correlation graphical model (DCGM) in graph theory to create brain state networks, then innovatively adopt complex network metrics in Graph signal processing (GSP) and physical quantities to analyze brain activities over time. Our findings reveal statistical differences in network characteristics between ASD and control groups. Compared to normal subjects, brain state networks of ASD patients tend to have decreased modularity, higher von Neumann entropy, increased Betti-0 numbers, and decreased Betti-1 numbers. These findings attest to the biological traits of ASD, suggesting less transitioning in brain dynamics. These findings offer potential biomarkers for ASD diagnosis and deepen our understanding of its neural correlations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16945">IdenBAT: Disentangled Representation Learning for Identity-Preserved Brain Age Transformation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain age transformation aims to convert reference brain images into synthesized images that accurately reflect the age-specific features of a target age group. The primary objective of this task is to modify only the age-related attributes of the reference image while preserving all other age-irrelevant attributes. However, achieving this goal poses substantial challenges due to the inherent entanglement of various image attributes within features extracted from a backbone encoder, resulting in simultaneous alterations during the image generation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture that employs disentangled representation learning for identity-preserved brain age transformation called IdenBAT. This approach facilitates the decomposition of image features, ensuring the preservation of individual traits while selectively transforming age-related characteristics to match those of the target age group. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on both 2D and full-size 3D brain datasets, our method adeptly converts input images to target age while retaining individual characteristics accurately. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superiority over existing state-of-the-art regarding performance fidelity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17199">On the control of recurrent neural networks using constant inputs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability properties of a general class of recurrent neural networks that are widely used for hypothesis generation in theoretical neuroscience, including the modeling of large-scale human brain dynamics. Our study focuses on the control synthesis of such networks using constant and piecewise constant inputs, motivated by emerging applications in non-invasive neurostimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The neural network model considered is a continuous Hopfield-type system with nonlinear activation functions and arbitrary input matrices representing interactions among multiple brain regions. Our main contribution is the formulation and solution of a control synthesis problem for these nonlinear systems. We provide a proper generalization of the variation of the constants formula that constitutes a novel representation of the system's state trajectory. This representation admits a verifiable condition on the existence of the constant control input to solve a short-time two-point boundary value problem in the state space. This formulation admits a synthesis for the input in question, which can be realized using modern algorithmic optimization tools. In the case of linear activation functions, this analysis and synthesis reduces to the verification of algebraic conditions on the system matrices. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategies. These results offer a novel control synthesis for an important class of neural network models that may, in turn, enable the design of brain stimulation protocols to modulate whole-brain activity in therapeutic and cognitive enhancement applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16613">Real-time Sub-milliwatt Epilepsy Detection Implemented on a Spiking Neural Network Edge Inference Processor</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure status of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at providing timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect interictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural network (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time preliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible pathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of epileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The SNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed to process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average power consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when deployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance when tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure detection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable devices in the future.

                arXiv:2410.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to improve the energy efficiency of machine learning models, as they naturally implement event-driven computations while avoiding expensive multiplication operations. In this paper, we develop a hardware-software co-optimisation strategy to port software-trained deep neural networks (DNN) to reduced-precision spiking models demonstrating fast and accurate inference in a novel event-driven CMOS reconfigurable spiking inference accelerator. Experimental results show that a reduced-precision Resnet-18 and VGG-11 SNN models achieves classification accuracy within 1% of the baseline full-precision DNN model within 8 spike timesteps. We also demonstrate an FPGA prototype implementation of the spiking inference accelerator with a throughput of 38.4 giga operations per second (GOPS) consuming 1.54 Watts on PYNQ-Z2 FPGA. This corresponds to 0.6 GOPS per processing element and 2.25,GOPS/DSP slice, which is 2x and 4.5x higher utilisation efficiency respectively compared to the state-of-the-art. Our co-optimisation strategy can be employed to develop deep reduced precision SNN models and port them to resource-efficient event-driven hardware accelerators for edge applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16309">In-the-loop Hyper-Parameter Optimization for LLM-Based Automated Design of Heuristics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automatically generating and optimizing (meta)heuristics, making them valuable tools in heuristic optimization tasks. However, LLMs are generally inefficient when it comes to fine-tuning hyper-parameters of the generated algorithms, often requiring excessive queries that lead to high computational and financial costs. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach, LLaMEA-HPO, which integrates the open source LLaMEA (Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm) framework with a Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) procedure in the loop. By offloading hyper-parameter tuning to an HPO procedure, the LLaMEA-HPO framework allows the LLM to focus on generating novel algorithmic structures, reducing the number of required LLM queries and improving the overall efficiency of the optimization process.
  We empirically validate the proposed hybrid framework on benchmark problems, including Online Bin Packing, Black-Box Optimization, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Our results demonstrate that LLaMEA-HPO achieves superior or comparable performance compared to existing LLM-driven frameworks while significantly reducing computational costs. This work highlights the importance of separating algorithmic innovation and structural code search from parameter tuning in LLM-driven code optimization and offers a scalable approach to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based code generation.

                arXiv:2410.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple in-context learning steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors that allows for combined steering goals that empirically outperforms combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs.

Abstract: Rapid detection of gas concentration is important in different domains like gas leakage monitoring, pollution control, and so on, for the prevention of health hazards. Out of different types of gas sensors, Metal oxide (MOx) sensors are extensively used in such applications because of their portability, low cost, and high sensitivity for specific gases. However, how to effectively sample the MOx data for the real-time detection of gas and its concentration level remains an open question. Here we introduce a simple analog front-end for one MOx sensor that encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between pulses of two separate pathways. This front-end design is inspired by the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. We show that for a gas pulse injected in a constant airflow, the time difference between pulses decreases with increasing gas concentration, similar to the spike time difference between the two principal output neurons in the olfactory bulb. The circuit design is further extended to a MOx sensor array and this sensor array front-end was tested in the same environment for gas identification and concentration estimation. Encoding of gas stimulus features in analog spikes at the sensor level itself may result in data and power-efficient real-time gas sensing systems in the future that can ultimately be used in uncontrolled and turbulent environments for longer periods without data explosion.

                arXiv:2410.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive associative learning has gained significant attention for its ability to mimic fundamental biological learning mechanisms while maintaining system simplicity. In this work, we introduce a high-order memristive associative learning framework with a biologically realistic structure. By utilizing memristors as synaptic modules and their state information to bridge different orders of associative learning, our design effectively establishes associations between multiple stimuli and replicates the transient nature of high-order associative learning. In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments, our design achieves a 230% improvement in learning efficiency compared to previous works, with memristor power consumption in the synaptic modules remaining below 11 {\mu}W. In large-scale image recognition tasks, we utilize a 20*20 memristor array to represent images, enabling the system to recognize and label test images with semantic information at 100% accuracy. This scalability across different tasks highlights the framework's potential for a wide range of applications, offering enhanced learning efficiency for current memristor-based neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Decomposition has been the mainstream approach in classic mathematical programming for multi-objective optimization and multi-criterion decision-making. However, it was not properly studied in the context of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) until the development of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In this two-part survey series, we use MOEA/D as the representative of decomposition-based EMO to review the up-to-date development in this area, and systematically and comprehensively analyze its research landscape. In the first part, we present a comprehensive survey of the development of MOEA/D from its origin to the current state-of-the-art approaches. In order to be self-contained, we start with a step-by-step tutorial that aims to help a novice quickly get onto the working mechanism of MOEA/D. Then, selected major developments of MOEA/D are reviewed according to its core design components including weight vector settings, subproblem formulations, selection mechanisms and reproduction operators. Besides, we also overview some selected advanced topics for constraint handling, optimization in dynamic and uncertain environments, computationally expensive objective functions, and preference incorporation. In the final part, we shed some light on emerging directions for future developments.

                arXiv:2310.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StochGradAdam, a novel optimizer designed as an extension of the Adam algorithm, incorporating stochastic gradient sampling techniques to improve computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance. StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.

                arXiv:2404.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels. The empirical study reveals the potential of the proposed approach.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, leverages multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations within the latent space. Moreover, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which incorporates a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the latent space of the Steinmetz neural network. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Utilizing an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the generalization error upper bound posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments depict the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by these networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.

                arXiv:2410.11488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent insights have revealed that rate-coding is a primary form of information representation captured by surrogate-gradient-based Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in training deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Motivated by these findings, we propose rate-based backpropagation, a training strategy specifically designed to exploit rate-based representations to reduce the complexity of BPTT. Our method minimizes reliance on detailed temporal derivatives by focusing on averaged dynamics, streamlining the computational graph to reduce memory and computational demands of SNNs training. We substantiate the rationality of the gradient approximation between BPTT and the proposed method through both theoretical analysis and empirical observations. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR10-DVS validate that our method achieves comparable performance to BPTT counterparts, and surpasses state-of-the-art efficient training techniques. By leveraging the inherent benefits of rate-coding, this work sets the stage for more scalable and efficient SNNs training within resource-constrained environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tab-ct/rate-based-backpropagation.

Abstract: We describe a proposal for increasing the effective clock speed of a thermodynamic computer, by altering the interaction scale of the units within the computer and introducing to the computer an additional source of noise. The resulting thermodynamic computer program is equivalent to the original computer program, but runs at a higher clock speed. This approach offers a way of increasing the speed of thermodynamic computing while preserving the fidelity of computation.

<p>We investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers such as Aldoc, PLCB3, and PLCB4 in the cerebellar cortex and related nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys. We then compared these findings with those of previous studies on such markers in rodents. The current study shed light on the molecular basis underlying differences in cerebellar function between primates and rodents.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cerebellar molecular signatures in primates remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers, including aldolase C (Aldoc), phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCB3), and phospholipase C beta 4 (PLCB4) in the cerebellar cortex and associated nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>). Our main findings are as follows: First, the cerebellar vermis in macaques exhibited striped compartmentalization for all markers, with the striped expression boundary of PLCB3 being less distinct than those of Aldoc and PLCB4. Second, the striped pattern was less pronounced in the cerebellar hemisphere compared to the vermis, with signals in the hemisphere being predominantly intense throughout. Third, distinct zonal patterns and elevated signals for Aldoc and PLCB3 were observed in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Specifically, the fastigial nucleus displayed intense Aldoc signals in both caudal and rostral regions, while the dentate nucleus displayed strong Aldoc signals in both ventral and dorsal regions. Compared to previous rodent studies, the macaque cerebellum demonstrated a higher proportion of intense signal areas and distinct compartmentalization patterns in both cortical and deep nuclei. These findings offer crucial insights into the unique molecular organization of the primate cerebellum, enhancing our understanding of the advanced neuroplasticity, cognitive, and motor capabilities in primates.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Hypnosis shows great potential for managing patients suffering from fibromyalgia and chronic pain. Several studies have highlighted its efficacy in improving pain, quality of life, and reducing psychological distress. Despite its known feasibility and efficacy, the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Building on these insights, this innovative study aims to assess neural activity during hypnosis in fibromyalgia patients using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and self-reported measures. Methods: Thirteen participants with fibromyalgia were included in this study. EEG recordings were done during resting state and hypnosis conditions. After both conditions, levels of pain, comfort, absorption, and dissociation were assessed using a numerical rating scale. Time perception was collected via an open-ended question. The study was prospectively registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov public registry (NCT04263324). Results: Neural oscillations showed increased theta power during hypnosis in the left parietal and occipital electrodes, increased beta power in the frontal and left temporal electrodes, and increased slow-gamma power in the frontal and left parietal electrodes. Functional connectivity using pairwise-phase consistency measures showed decreased connectivity in the frontal electrodes during hypnosis. Graph-based measures, the node strength, and the cluster coefficient were lower in frontal electrodes in the slow-gamma bands during hypnosis compared to resting state. Key findings indicate significant changes in neural oscillations and brain functional connectivity, suggesting potential electrophysiological markers of hypnosis in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Vulnerability to sound distraction is commonly reported in older adults with dementia and tends to be associated with adverse impacts on daily activity. However, study outcome heterogeneity is increasingly evident, with preserved resistance to distraction also evident. Contributory factors may include individual differences in distractibility in older adulthood per se, and failure to consider the influence of how difficult a person found the test. Methods: We therefore measured distractibility in a group of older adults by comparing the performance of a primary visual task (Swansea Test of Attentional Control), which includes an adaptive algorithm to take into account how difficult a person finds the test under both no-sound and sound conditions. Results: Analysis revealed no significant difference in group mean performance between no-sound versus sound conditions [t (33) = 0.181, p = 0.858; Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size d = &amp;amp;minus;0.028], but individual differences in performance both within and between sound and no-sound conditions were evident, indicating that for older adults, distracting sounds can be neutral, detrimental, or advantageous with respect to visual task performance. It was not possible to determine individual thresholds for whether sound versus no-sound conditions affected a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s actual behaviour. Conclusions: Nevertheless, our findings indicate how variable such effects may be in older adults, which in turn may help to explain outcome heterogeneity in studies including people living with dementia. Furthermore, such within-group heterogeneity highlights the importance of considering a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual performance in order to better understand their behaviour and initiate interventions as required.</p>

	<p>Rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare syndrome presenting in early childhood associated with a high risk of mortality between 50 and 60%. It is characterised by rapid, early onset of obesity between 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;7 years, along with central hypoventilation and hypothalamic dysfunction, such as central hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, disorders of sodium and water balance, growth hormone deficiency, adrenocortical insufficiency, or disorders of puberty and features of autonomic dysregulation. Up to half of cases have neural crest tumours, most commonly ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas. The incidence of ROHHAD syndrome in any population is unknown. Currently, there is no specific diagnostic or genetic biomarker for ROHHAD, and diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, which is often challenging, and consequently may be delayed or unrecognised. Early diagnosis is important, as without intervention, ROHHAD is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Aetiology remains unclear; an autoimmune origin has been postulated, with immunosuppressive agents being used with variable benefit. With no cure, multidisciplinary management is largely supportive. Therefore, there are many unanswered questions in ROHHAD syndrome. In this review article, we outline the challenges posed by ROHHAD syndrome, including aetiology, genetics, diagnosis, screening, management, and prognosis. We present research priorities to tackle these issues to improve outcomes.</p>

                <p>The formation and precise positioning of axons and dendrites are crucial for the development of neural circuits. Although juxtacrine signaling via cell&ndash;cell contact is known to influence these processes, the specific structures and mechanisms regulating neuronal process positioning within the central nervous system (CNS) remain to be fully identified. Our study investigates motoneuron 24 (MN24) in the <I>Drosophila</I> embryonic CNS, which is characterized by a complex yet stereotyped axon projection pattern, known as "axonal routing." In this motoneuron, the primary dendritic branches project laterally toward the midline, specifically emerging at the sites where axons turn. We observed that Scp2-positive neurons contribute to the lateral fascicle structure in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) near MN24 dendrites. Notably, the knockout of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (<I>Dscam1</I>) results in the loss of dendrites and disruption of proper axonal routing in MN24, while not affecting the formation of the fascicle structure. Through cell-type specific knockdown and rescue experiments of Dscam1, we have determined that the interaction between MN24 and Scp2-positive fascicle, mediated by Dscam1, promotes the development of both dendrites and axonal routing. Our findings demonstrate that the holistic configuration of neuronal structures, such as axons and dendrites, within single motoneurons can be governed by local contact with the adjacent neuron fascicle, a novel reference structure for neural circuitry wiring.</p>

                <p>Confirmation bias (CB) is a cognitive bias that allows us to fool ourselves by selectively filtering data and distorting analyses to support favored beliefs or hypotheses. In this article, I will briefly review some classic experiments from cognitive psychology that illustrate what a powerful, pernicious, and insidious force CB is. I will then discuss how to recognize CB in our own thinking and behavior and describe specific elements of good experimental design that can mitigate its effects. These elements&mdash;such as randomization and blinding&mdash;are conceptually straightforward but often difficult in practice and therefore not as widely implemented as they should be.</p>

                Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. Hence cost-effective drugs with fewer side effects as a standard supportive therapy might yield substantial advantages in efficacy and safety. Kadukkai maathirai (KM) is being used as a supplement in hepatocellular carcinoma. We evaluated whether KM has any preventive action on cancer progression in diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) - induced HCC in rats. Methods DEN was injected to produce HCC in rats, which was confirmed after 16 weeks. All the rats were orally administered KM for 4 weeks. Hepatoprotective potential (serum AST, ALT, ALP, Bilirubin) and anticancer efficacy (body weight, nodule count, tumor progression by histopathology, expression of GSTM1 by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and In-silico analysis of phytoconstituents against β catenin and LRP analysis were evaluated. Results KM prevented cancer progression against DEN-induced HCC by an increase in GSTM1, a phase II detoxifying enzyme. It significantly reversed altered nodule count, relative liver weight, body weight, and histopathological features of HCC. In silico analysis of phytoconstituents of KM showed that they modulate the intracellular transcription process by inhibiting the armadillo repeat region of β catenin. Conclusions Our results elucidate the potential of KM as a supplement in HCC by reducing nodule count, protecting the liver from further damage, GSTM1 expression, and inhibiting armadillo repeat region of β catenin.

                Introduction Gastroparesis, a global condition causing bile salt accumulation, is prevalent globally. Diagnosis techniques like bile salt titration and nitric oxide sulfate can improve patient care. However, simptomatic control is needed to reduce inflammation and control potential diseases. Neurological techniques like gyroscope stimulation and endoscopy can diagnose refractive gastroparesis. Interdisciplinary collaboration and bibliometric research are crucial for finding effective treatments. Gastroparesis, a motility issue affecting 0.9-1.3% of diabetics, can be improved by new diagnostic methods like osmotic pressure and gastric emptying, enhancing patient treatment. Methods This study uses a literature review methodology to gather data from the Scopus database on neuroaid, analyzing it using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software. The focus is on dietary adjustments, glucose regulation, and transcutaneous stimulation’s role in gastroparesis treatment, using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, topic dendogram, and country collaboration map. According to our analysis, transcutaneous stimulation holds great promise for treating gastroparesis. We also found the necessity of multidisciplinary collaboration in the management of this illness. Conclusions The study on gastroparesis highlights key themes like diet modification, glucose control, medication therapy, Cajal’s role in smooth muscle concentration, common causes, transcutaneous stimulation, motorcycle themes, vagus nerve, and emerging devices and electronics. Basic themes include gastrointestinal disorders, neuromodulation, patients, diabetes, and gastric electrical stimulation. The management of gastroparesis involves multidisciplinary approaches, lifestyle changes, medication therapy, and bedtime interventions, with further investigation into transcutaneous stimulation being warranted.

                Background Several studies have shown that the retrieval of positive memories may play a role in emotional regulation. However, it is unclear whether the effects of neutral and positive autobiographical memories differ. It is necessary to confirm whether genuinely neutral autobiographical memories can be retrieved without bias when prompted to recall neutral memories. Methods In this pilot study, using “home” and “study” as cue words, we investigated whether participants were able to retrieve appropriate autobiographical memories when asked to recall a limited number of neutral or positive memories. Results Although participants were asked to recall neutral autobiographical memories, they tended to recall positive memories. Conclusions Our results support the concept of positive memory bias and suggest that future work should consider combining neutral and positive autobiographical memories by asking participants to recall neutral–positive memories.

                Background This study delves into the intricate interplay among paradoxical leadership (PL), employees’ proactive work behaviour (PAB), and perceived psychological contract fulfilment (PPCF). PL, characterized by its simultaneous emphasis on apparently contradictory behaviours, has garnered attention due to its potential to foster innovation, adaptability, and creativity. The study’s main objective is to thoroughly explore the complexities of PL, its influence on PAB, and whether the PPCF serves as a mediator. Methods A survey was distributed to 338 hotel and travel agency employees to gather data. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling through a SmartPLS program. Results The results reveal a positive correlation between PL and PAB. Additionally, PPCF partially mediates this relationship, indicating its vital role in exploring the positive impact of PL on boosting proactive behaviours. Conclusions This research brings forth meaningful contributions to both theoretical and practical dimensions. Theoretically, it enhances our comprehension of how PL manifests in the distinctive landscape of the hospitality and tourism domain, substantiating its potential to drive proactive behaviours among employees. The mediation of PPCF enriches our grasp of the underlying mechanisms, accentuating the significance of maintaining harmonized and consistent leadership practices. From a practical vantage point, these findings offer valuable insights for hospitality and tourism establishments aspiring to optimize their leadership strategies for cultivating proactive work behaviour among their workforces.

                Purpose There is no evidence comparing the treatment results of hemoglobin spray and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in chronic wounds. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and role of hemoglobin spray in the treatment of chronic wounds. The probabilities of being the best treatment option were estimated and ranked between hemoglobin spray and HBOT. Methods A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and PROSPERO number: CRD42020161396. Results A total of 934 studies were identified from PUBMED and SCOPUS databases, and 112 articles were deleted. Among the 24 studies, 16 RCTs and eight cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. In direct meta-analysis, HBOT had higher proportion of wound healing rate than control with pooled risk ratios (RRs) of 1.67 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.52). Hemoglobin spray had a higher wound healing rate than the control, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.92 (95%CI: 1.35, 2.73). In the network meta-analysis, the probability of being the best treatment was hemoglobin spray, followed by hyperbaric, with surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRAs) of 67.9, and 32.1, respectively. Conclusions Our evidence suggests that the proportion of wound healing in the hemoglobin spray and HBOT groups was higher than that in the control group. A network meta-analysis demonstrated that hemoglobin spray had the highest chance of treatment success. There is a need for further studies using well-designed RCTs and updated meta-analyses to provide enough evidence to compare the effectiveness of hemoglobin spray and HBOT in clinical practice.

                Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered a global health crisis. It results in injury to the brain from an external impact leading to severe disability, with higher incidence statistics recently observed in young adults and elderly individuals. Purpose The review aims to analyze current research findings explaining the prevalence, incidence, and demographics of such injuries stressing the need for enhanced prevention and management techniques. The pathophysiology involves a complex cascade of biochemical and cellular events, which results in necrotic-apoptotic neuronal cell death. Method The review synthesizes current research on TBI, highlighting epidemiological data, advanced diagnostics, and effective rehabilitation strategies like physical and cognitive therapy. Findings Traumatic Brain Injury is an important public health issue with high morbidity and mortality rates causing extreme damage to a person, such as comas, catatonic states for various years, or lifelong injury or demolition. Early diagnostic imaging techniques include CT, MRI, advanced neuroimaging methods, and blood-based biomarkers. In the acute setting, initial management is directed toward stabilizing and preventing secondary injuries and early mobilization. The goals of rehabilitation are to promote the highest level of functional independence and physical function, cognitive functions, and social integration. Conclusion This review highlights that the use of new rehabilitation technologies, such as VR-based and robot-assisted therapies, might lead to improved recovery. Long-term supportive care combined with community integration is mandatory for enhancing quality of life. A systematic multidisciplinary team approach and family support are needed for traumatic brain injury survivors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-805/v2?src=rss">TOP2DFVT: An Efficient Matlab Implementation for Topology Optimization based on the Finite-Volume Theory [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The finite-volume theory has shown to be numerically efficient and stable for topology optimization of continuum elastic structures. The significant features of this numerical technique are the local satisfaction of equilibrium equations and the employment of compatibility conditions along edges in a surface-averaged sense. These are essential properties to adequately mitigate some numerical instabilities in the gradient version of topology optimization algorithms, such as checkerboard, mesh dependence, and local minima issues. Several computational tools have been proposed for topology optimization employing analysis domains discretized with essential features for finite-element approaches. However, this is the first contribution to offer a platform to generate optimized topologies by employing a Matlab code based on the finite-volume theory for compliance minimization problems. The Top2DFVT provides a platform to perform 2D topology optimization of structures in Matlab, from domain initialization for structured meshes to data post-processing. This contribution represents a significant advancement over earlier publications on topology optimization based on the finite-volume theory, which needed more efficient computational tools. Moreover, the Top2DFVT algorithm incorporates SIMP and RAMP material interpolation schemes alongside sensitivity and density filtering techniques, culminating in a notably enhanced optimization tool. The application of this algorithm to various illustrative cases confirms its efficacy and underscores its potential for advancing the field of structural optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-421/v2?src=rss">A bibliometric review of functional ingredients and their efficacy in developing functional biscuits [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Numerous studies have concluded that the functional ingredients benefit human health. Similarly, present times have seen exponential growth in functional food in bakery product segments like breads and biscuits. However, there is a lack of information on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional bakery products. This bibliometric study addresses this gap by identifying the current research trends in functional ingredients. Objective To investigate current research trends on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional biscuits. Method The study followed the “Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews” standards for retrieving literature. The study went through three major stages, “assembling”, “arranging”, and “assessing” to retrieve 612 articles from the Scopus database from 2013 to 2023. Through further filtering, 395 articles were selected. Result The analysis was conducted using R Studio and VOS viewer. The performance analysis and science mapping tools were used to evaluate the articles. The results showed a 5.76% annual growth in publication trends. The most researched functional ingredients were antioxidants, bioactive compounds, and dietary fiber. The review summarized the most studied foods used to develop functional biscuits and highlighted the most experimented technological advancements. Conclusion The study revealed the need for future research studies on functional ingredients with a focus on studying the implications of technical implications of technical advancements in extracting functional ingredients from foods. The study highlights the significance of future studies based on the acceptance of functional biscuits and their sensory properties focusing on the mass population. The study derives the knowledge on possible applicability of functional ingredients in developing new formulations from publications and their usefulness in developing new formulations. This insight on the applicability of functional ingredients provides an opportunity for biscuit/cookie manufacturing to boost consumption among the population to a new ascending graph.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-443/v2?src=rss">Effect of non-contact induction heating on HA coatings and bone cement, an ex vivo study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Prosthetic joint infection is a serious complication that can arise after total joint replacement surgery. When bacteria colonise an orthopaedic implant, they form biofilms that protect them from their environment, making them difficult to remove. Treatment is further complicated by a global rise of antimicrobial resistance. These protective mechanisms make treatment of prosthetic joint infection increasingly complex. Non-contact induction heating is an upcoming technology that uses heat to eradicate bacteria that are present on the surface of metallic implants. This study aims to provide insight into the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating on metallic implants that are in direct contact with other biomaterials, such as coatings composed of hydroxyapatite and bone cement composed of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Methods Characterisation of hydroxyapatite coatings and adhesion strength tests were conducted according to standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 13779-2). The fixation strength of acrylic bone cement was tested according to an adapted method from ISO. Results It was found that non-contact induction heating did not significantly affect the adhesion strength of hydroxyapatite coatings. In contrast to hydroxyapatite coatings, acrylic bone cement softened temporarily as the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature (83.38 ± 10.88°C). However, the induction heating temperature had no significant effect on the fixation strength after the cement was allowed to cool down. Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating up to 80°C when bone cement or ceramic coatings are present in contact with infected metallic implants.

The translated protein undergoes a specific modification process, which involves the formation of covalent bonds on lysine residues and the attachment of small chemical moieties. The protein’s fundamental physicochemical properties undergo a significant alteration. The change significantly alters the proteins’ 3D structure and activity, enabling them to modulate key physiological processes. The modulation encompasses inhibiting cancer cell growth, delaying ovarian aging, regulating metabolic diseases, and ameliorating depression. Consequently, the identification and comprehension of post-translational lysine modifications hold substantial value in the realms of biological research and drug development. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) at lysine (K) sites are among the most common protein modifications. However, research on K-PTMs has been largely centered on identifying individual modification types, with a relative scarcity of balanced data analysis techniques. In this study, a classification system is developed for the prediction of concurrent multiple modifications at a single lysine residue. Initially, a well-established multi-label position-specific triad amino acid propensity algorithm is utilized for feature encoding. Subsequently, PreMLS: a novel ClusterCentroids undersampling algorithm based on MiniBatchKmeans was introduced to eliminate redundant or similar major class samples, thereby mitigating the issue of class imbalance. A convolutional neural network architecture was specifically constructed for the analysis of biological sequences to predict multiple lysine modification sites. The model, evaluated through five-fold cross-validation and independent testing, was found to significantly outperform existing models such as iMul-kSite and predML-Site. The results presented here aid in prioritizing potential lysine modification sites, facilitating subsequent biological assays and advancing pharmaceutical research. To enhance accessibility, an open-access predictive script has been crafted for the multi-label predictive model developed in this study.

                <p>by Ulisses Rocha, Jonas Coelho Kasmanas, Rodolfo Toscan, Danilo S. Sanches, Stefania Magnusdottir, Joao Pedro Saraiva</p>

We hypothesize that sample species abundance, sequencing depth, and taxonomic relatedness influence the recovery of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). To test this hypothesis, we assessed MAG recovery in three in silico microbial communities composed of 42 species with the same richness but different sample species abundance, sequencing depth, and taxonomic distribution profiles using three different pipelines for MAG recovery. The pipeline developed by Parks and colleagues (8K) generated the highest number of MAGs and the lowest number of true positives per community profile. The pipeline by Karst and colleagues (DT) showed the most accurate results (~ 92%), outperforming the 8K and Multi-Metagenome pipeline (MM) developed by Albertsen and collaborators. Sequencing depth influenced the accurate recovery of genomes when using the 8K and MM, even with contrasting patterns: the MM pipeline recovered more MAGs found in the original communities when employing sequencing depths up to 60 million reads, while the 8K recovered more true positives in communities sequenced above 60 million reads. DT showed the best species recovery from the same genus, even though close-related species have a low recovery rate in all pipelines. Our results highlight that more bins do not translate to the actual community composition and that sequencing depth plays a role in MAG recovery and increased community resolution. Even low MAG recovery error rates can significantly impact biological inferences. Our data indicates that the scientific community should curate their findings from MAG recovery, especially when asserting novel species or metabolic traits.

                <p>by Carrisa V. Cocuzza, Ruben Sanchez-Romero, Takuya Ito, Ravi D. Mill, Brian P. Keane, Michael W. Cole</p>

A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how function-relevant brain activations are generated. Here we test the hypothesis that function-relevant brain activations are generated primarily by distributed network flows. We focused on visual processing in human cortex, given the long-standing literature supporting the functional relevance of brain activations in visual cortex regions exhibiting visual category selectivity. We began by using fMRI data from N = 352 human participants to identify category-specific responses in visual cortex for images of faces, places, body parts, and tools. We then systematically tested the hypothesis that distributed network flows can generate these localized visual category selective responses. This was accomplished using a recently developed approach for simulating – in a highly empirically constrained manner – the generation of task-evoked brain activations by modeling activity flowing over intrinsic brain connections. We next tested refinements to our hypothesis, focusing on how stimulus-driven network interactions initialized in V1 generate downstream visual category selectivity. We found evidence that network flows directly from V1 were sufficient for generating visual category selectivity, but that additional, globally distributed (whole-cortex) network flows increased category selectivity further. Using null network architectures we also found that each region’s unique intrinsic “connectivity fingerprint” was key to the generation of category selectivity. These results generalized across regions associated with all four visual categories tested (bodies, faces, places, and tools), and provide evidence that the human brain’s intrinsic network organization plays a prominent role in the generation of functionally relevant, localized responses.

                <p>by Cecilia De Vicariis, Vinil T. Chackochan, Laura Bandini, Eleonora Ravaschio, Vittorio Sanguineti</p>

Coordinating with others is part of our everyday experience. Previous studies using sensorimotor coordination games suggest that human dyads develop coordination strategies that can be interpreted as Nash equilibria. However, if the players are uncertain about what their partner is doing, they develop coordination strategies which are robust to the actual partner’s actions. This has suggested that humans select their actions based on an explicit prediction of what the partner will be doing—a partner model—which is probabilistic by nature. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials remain unknown. Very much like sensorimotor adaptation of individuals to external perturbations (eg force fields or visual rotations), dynamical models may help to understand how joint coordination develops over repeated trials. Here we present a general computational model—based on game theory and Bayesian estimation—designed to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials. Joint tasks are modeled as quadratic games, where each participant’s task is expressed as a quadratic cost function. Each participant predicts their partner’s next move (partner model) by optimally combining predictions and sensory observations, and selects their actions through a stochastic optimization of its expected cost, given the partner model. The model parameters include perceptual uncertainty (sensory noise), partner representation (retention rate and internale noise), uncertainty in action selection and its rate of decay (which can be interpreted as the action’s learning rate). The model can be used in two ways: (i) to simulate interactive behaviors, thus helping to make specific predictions in the context of a given joint action scenario; and (ii) to analyze the action time series in actual experiments, thus providing quantitative metrics that describe individual behaviors during an actual joint action. We demonstrate the model in a variety of joint action scenarios. In a sensorimotor version of the Stag Hunt game, the model predicts that different representations of the partner lead to different Nash equilibria. In a joint two via-point (2-VP) reaching task, in which the actions consist of complex trajectories, the model captures well the observed temporal evolution of performance. For this task we also estimated the model parameters from experimental observations, which provided a comprehensive characterization of individual dyad participants. Computational models of joint action may help identifying the factors preventing or facilitating the development of coordination. They can be used in clinical settings, to interpret the observed behaviors in individuals with impaired interaction capabilities. They may also provide a theoretical basis to devise artificial agents that establish forms of coordination that facilitate neuromotor recovery.

                <p>by Jiyeon Hwang, Junichi Okada, Li Liu, Jeffrey E. Pessin, Gary J. Schwartz, Young-Hwan Jo</p>

Hepatic lipid metabolism is regulated by the autonomic nervous system of the liver, with the sympathetic innervation being extensively studied, while the parasympathetic efferent innervation is less understood despite its potential importance. In this study, we investigate the consequences of disrupted brain–liver communication on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice exposed to obesogenic conditions. We found that a subset of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes are innervated by parasympathetic nerve terminals originating from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The elimination of the brain–liver axis by deleting parasympathetic cholinergic neurons innervating the liver prevents hepatic steatosis and promotes browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT). The loss of liver-innervating cholinergic neurons increases hepatic <i>Cyp7b1</i> expression and fasting serum bile acid levels. Furthermore, knockdown of the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 gene in ingWAT reverses the beneficial effects of the loss of liver-innervating cholinergic neurons, leading to the reappearance of hepatic steatosis. Deleting liver-innervating cholinergic neurons has a small but significant effect on body weight, which is accompanied by an increase in energy expenditure. Taken together, these data suggest that targeting the parasympathetic cholinergic innervation of the liver is a potential therapeutic approach for enhancing hepatic lipid metabolism in obesity and diabetes.

tRNAs are evolutionarily ancient molecular decoders essential for protein translation. In eukaryotes, tRNAs and other short, noncoding RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III, an enzyme that promotes ageing in yeast, worms, and flies. Here, we show that a partial reduction in Pol III activity specifically disrupts tRNA levels. This effect is conserved across worms, flies, and mice, where computational models indicate that it impacts mRNA decoding. In all 3 species, reduced Pol III activity increases proteostatic resilience. In worms, it activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and direct disruption of tRNA metabolism is sufficient to recapitulate this. In flies, decreasing Pol III’s transcriptional initiation on tRNA genes by a loss-of-function in the TFIIIC transcription factor robustly extends lifespan, improves proteostatic resilience and recapitulates the broad-spectrum benefits to late-life health seen following partial Pol III inhibition. We provide evidence that a partial reduction in Pol III activity impacts translation, quantitatively or qualitatively, in both worms and flies, indicating a potential mode of action. Our work demonstrates a conserved and previously unappreciated role of tRNAs in animal ageing.

Postembryonic development of animals has long been considered an internally predetermined program, while macronutrients were believed to be essential solely for providing biomatters and energy to support this process. However, in this study, by using a nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (abbreviated as <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> hereafter) model, we surprisingly discovered that dietary supplementation of palmitic acid alone, rather than other abundant essential nutrients such as glucose or amino acid mixture, was sufficient to initiate early postembryonic development even under complete macronutrient deprivation. Such a development was evidenced by changes in morphology, cellular markers in multiple tissues, behaviors, and the global transcription pattern and it occurred earlier than the well-known early L1 nutrient checkpoint. Mechanistically, palmitic acid did not function as a biomatter/energy provider, but rather as a ligand to activate the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49/80, leading to the production of an unknown peroxisome-derived secretive hormone in the intestine. This hormonal signal was received by chemosensory neurons in the head, regulating the insulin-like neuropeptide secretion and its downstream nuclear receptor to orchestrate global development. Additionally, the nutrient-sensing hub mTORC1 played a negative role in this process. In conclusion, our data indicate that free fatty acids act as a primary nutrient signal to launch the early development in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, which suggests that specific nutrients, rather than the internal genetic program, serve as the first impetus for postembryonic development.

Pre-babbling infants can track nonadjacent dependencies (NADs) in the auditory domain. While this forms a crucial prerequisite for language acquisition, the neurodevelopmental origins of this ability remain unknown. We applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy in neonates and 6- to 7-month-old infants to investigate the neural substrate supporting NAD learning and detection using tone sequences in an artificial grammar learning paradigm. Detection of NADs was indicated by left prefrontal activation in neonates while by left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and inferior frontal gyrus activation in 6- to 7-month-olds. Functional connectivity analyses further indicated that the neonate activation pattern during the test phase benefited from a brain network consisting of prefrontal regions, left SMG and STG during the rest and learning phases. These findings suggest a left-hemispheric learning-related functional brain network may emerge at birth and serve as the foundation for the later engagement of these regions for NAD detection, thus, providing a neural basis for language acquisition.

<p>Clinicians fear thrombolysis after direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use due to experience with warfarin. In contrast to vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin, DOACs prevent thrombosis by blocking thrombin. Clinical observational data suggest that thrombolysis may be safe in the setting of DOAC use. Thrombin, a serine protease, acts on the PAR1 receptor of brain cells, resulting in cell killing. Thrombin injury to endothelial cells can lead to blood-brain barrier disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. DOACs such as argatroban and dabigatran, by inhibiting thrombin, prevent PAR1 activation leading to cell protection, blood-brain barrier protection, and reduced risk of hemorrhage.

<p>Direct oral anticoagulants are the primary stroke prevention option in patients with atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant use before stroke, however, might inhibit clinician comfort with thrombolysis if a stroke does occur. Resuming anticoagulants after ischemic stroke is also problematic for fear of hemorrhage. We describe extensive literature showing that thrombolysis is safe after stroke with direct anticoagulant use. Early reinstitution of direct anticoagulant treatment is associated with lower risk of embolic recurrence and lower hemorrhage risk. The use of direct anticoagulants before, during, and after thrombolysis appears to be safe and is likely to promote improved outcomes after ischemic stroke.

Because genetic testing approaches evolve rapidly, professional society practice guidelines serve an essential role in guiding clinical care; however, several challenges exist regarding the creation and equitable implementation of these guidelines. In this scoping review, we assessed the current state of United States professional societies' guidelines pertaining to genetic testing for unexplained global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and cerebral palsy.

<p>Despite therapeutic suppression of relapses, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often experience subtle deterioration, which extends beyond the definition of “progression independent of relapsing activity.” We propose the concept of smouldering-associated-worsening (SAW), encompassing physical and cognitive symptoms, resulting from smouldering pathological processes, which remain unmet therapeutic targets. We provide a consensus-based framework of possible pathological substrates and manifestations of smouldering MS, and we discuss clinical, radiological, and serum/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for potentially monitoring SAW. Finally, we share considerations for optimizing disease surveillance and implications for clinical trials to promote the integration of smouldering MS into routine practice and future research efforts.

The OAC group had higher comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation (70% vs 17%), congestive heart failure (28% vs 10%), and hypertension (87% vs 72%), suggesting increased frailty. However, the results were consistent after adjustment for these comorbidities, and was similar regardless of the type of OACs used. Whereas any hemorrhage rates were higher in the OAC group receiving EVT (86% in OAC vs 70% in no OAC), no parenchymal hemorrhage or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed with OAC use in both the EVT and MM arms. Although we did not find evidence that the effect was due to excess hemorrhage or confounded by underlying cardiac disease or older age, OAC use alone should not exclude patients from receiving EVT. Baseline comorbidities and ischemic injury extent should be considered while making individualized treatment decisions. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:887–894</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) can show a very heterogeneous trajectory among patients. Here, we explored the mechanisms involved in the expression and prediction of different cognitive phenotypes over 4 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 2 independent cohorts (total n = 475), we performed a cluster analysis to identify trajectories of cognitive progression. Baseline and longitudinal level II neuropsychological assessments were conducted, and baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging, resting electroencephalogram and neurofilament light chain plasma quantification were carried out. Linear mixed-effects models were used to study longitudinal changes. Risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia were estimated using multivariable hazard regression. Spectral power density from the electroencephalogram at baseline and source localization were computed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two cognitive trajectories were identified. Cluster 1 presented stability (PD-Stable) over time, whereas cluster 2 showed progressive cognitive decline (PD-Progressors). The PD-Progressors group showed an increased risk for evolving to PD mild cognitive impairment (HR 2.09; 95% CI 1.11–3.95) and a marked risk for dementia (HR 4.87; 95% CI 1.34–17.76), associated with progressive worsening in posterior-cortical-dependent cognitive processes. Both clusters showed equivalent clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and neurofilament light chain levels at baseline. Conversely, the PD-Progressors group showed a fronto-temporo-occipital and parietal slow-wave power density increase, that was in turn related to worsening at 2 and 4 years of follow-up in different cognitive measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the absence of differences in baseline cognitive function and typical markers of neurodegeneration, the further development of an aggressive cognitive decline in PD is associated with increased slow-wave power density and with a different profile of worsening in several posterior-cortical-dependent tasks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intellectual disability is often the outcome of neurodevelopmental disorders and is characterized by significant impairments in intellectual and adaptive functioning. X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a subset of these disorders caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome, affecting about 2 out of 1,000 males. In syndromic form, it leads to a broad range of cognitive, behavioral, ocular, and physical disabilities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Employing exome or genome sequencing, here we identified 4 missense variants (c.475C &gt; G; p.H159D, c.1373C &gt; A; p.T458N, and c.1585G &gt; A; p.E529K, c.953C &gt; T; p.S318L) and a putative truncating variant (c.1413_1414del; p.Y471*) in the <i>SRPK3</i> gene in 9 XLID patients from 5 unrelated families. To validate <i>SRPK3</i> as a novel XLID gene, we established a knockout (KO) model of the <i>SRPK3</i> orthologue in zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 8 patients ascertained postnatally shared common clinical features including intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal eye movement, and ataxia. A ninth case, ascertained prenatally, had a complex structural brain phenotype. Together, these data indicate a pathological role of <i>SRPK3</i> in neurodevelopmental disorders. In post-fertilization day 5 larvae (free swimming stage), KO zebrafish exhibited severe deficits in eye movement and swim bladder inflation, mimicking uncontrolled ocular movement and physical clumsiness observed in human patients. In adult KO zebrafish, cerebellar agenesis and behavioral abnormalities were observed, recapitulating human phenotypes of cerebellar atrophy and intellectual disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, these results suggest a crucial role of <i>SRPK3</i> in the pathogenesis of syndromic X-linked intellectual disability and provide new insights into brain development, cognitive and ocular dysfunction in both humans and zebrafish. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:914–931</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), and to understand the genotype/phenotype correlation of structural variants (SVs) in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of 3D genome architectures and topologically associating domains (TADs), new pathomechanisms have been postulated for SVs, regardless of gene dosage changes. ADLD is a rare genetic disease associated with duplications (classical ADLD) or noncoding deletions (atypical ADLD) in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>High-throughput chromosome conformation capture, RNA sequencing, histopathological analyses of postmortem brain tissues, and clinical and neuroradiological investigations were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We collected data from &gt;20 families worldwide carrying SVs in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus and reported strong clinical variability, even among patients carrying duplications of the entire <i>LMNB1</i> gene, ranging from classical and atypical ADLD to asymptomatic carriers. We showed that patients with classic ADLD always carried intra-TAD duplications, resulting in a simple gene dose gain. Atypical ADLD was caused by <i>LMNB1</i> forebrain-specific misexpression due to inter-TAD deletions or duplications. The inter-TAD duplication, which extends centromerically and crosses the 2 TAD boundaries, did not cause ADLD. Our results provide evidence that astrocytes are key players in ADLD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study sheds light on the 3D genome and TAD structural changes associated with SVs in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus, and shows that a duplication encompassing <i>LMNB1</i> is not sufficient per se to diagnose ADLD, thereby strongly affecting genetic counseling. Our study supports breaking TADs as an emerging pathogenic mechanism that should be considered when studying brain diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:855–870</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them, typically during periods of rest. The genetic basis and pathophysiology of RLS are incompletely understood. We sought to identify additional novel genetic risk factors associated with RLS susceptibility.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association meta-analysis of RLS cases (<i>n</i> = 9,851) and controls (<i>n</i> = 38,957) in 3 population-based biobanks (All of Us, Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, and CARTaGENE).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genome-wide association analysis identified 9 independent risk loci, of which 8 had been previously reported, and 1 was a novel risk locus (<i>LMX1B</i>, rs35196838, OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09–1.19, <i>p</i> value = 2.2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>). Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study also identified <i>GLO1</i> and a previously unreported gene, <i>ELFN1</i>. A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = 0.40, se = 0.08, <i>p</i> value = 5.4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), depression (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = 0.35, se = 0.06, <i>p</i> value = 2.17 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), and intelligence (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = −0.20, se = 0.06, <i>p</i> value = 4.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study expands the understanding of the genetic architecture of RLS, and highlights the contributions of common variants to this prevalent neurological disorder. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:994–1005</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Susac syndrome (SuS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. We aimed to enhance diagnostic precision by developing the SPAMS (SuS, PACNS, MS) score, a practical radiological tool.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study included 99 patients (43 SuS, 37 MS, 19 PACNS) from South American countries. Relevant MRI features were identified through an elastic-net model determined key variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SPAMS score assigned 2 points for snowball lesions, 1 point for spokes-like lesions, or if there are more than 4 lesions in the corpus callosum, corpus callosum involvement, or cerebellar involvement. It subtracted 1 point if gadolinium-enhancing lesions or 4 points if Dawson's fingers are present. Bootstrapping validated the optimal cutoff at 2 points, exhibiting a diagnostic performance of area under the curve = 0.931, sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 89%, positive predictive value = 88%, negative predictive value = 89%, and accuracy = 88%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When specific MRI findings coexisted, the SPAMS score differentiated SuS from MS and PACNS. Access to MRI and standard protocol sequences makes it a valuable tool for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially preventing disability progression and severe clinical outcomes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a triplet repeat expansion within the gene huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>). Antagonistic pleiotropy is a theory of aging that posits that some genes, facilitating individual fitness early in life through adaptive evolutionary changes, also augment detrimental aging-related processes. Antagonistic pleiotropy theory may explain a positive evolutionary pressure toward functionally advantageous brain development that is vulnerable to rapid degeneration. The current study investigated antagonistic pleiotropy in HD using a years-to-onset paradigm in a unique sample of children and young adults at risk for HD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitive, behavioral, motor, and brain structural measures from premanifest gene-expanded (n = 79) and gene nonexpanded (n = 112) participants (6–21 years) in the Kids-HD study were examined. All measures in the gene-expanded group were modeled using a mixed-effects regression approach to assess years-to-onset-based changes while controlling for normal growth. Simultaneously, structure–function associations were also examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Decades from motor onset, gene-expanded participants showed significantly better cognitive, behavioral, and motor scores versus gene nonexpanded controls, along with larger cerebral volumes and cortical features. After this initial peak, a prolonged deterioration was observed in both functional and structural measures. Far from onset, brain measures were positively correlated with functional measures, supporting the view that functional advantages were mediated by structural differences.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mutant <i>HTT</i> may drive the development of a larger than normal brain that subserves superior early-life function. These findings support the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of <i>HTT</i> in HD, where this gene drives early advantage followed by accelerated aging processes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system is a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system associated with numerous neurological diseases. However, little is known about glymphatic system development in neonates. We sought to evaluate diffusion along the perivascular space (ALPS) index, a proxy for glymphatic system function, in neonates and investigate its potential associations with maturation, sex, and preterm birth.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 418 neonates, including 92 preterm neonates (57 males) and 326 term neonates (175 males), from the Developing Human Connectome Project were used for evaluating ALPS index. Linear regression modeling was performed to assess group differences in the ALPS index according to preterm birth and sex. Pearson's and partial correlation analysis were performed to assess the association between the ALPS index and gestational age (GA) as well as postmenstrual age (PMA) at MRI. Moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderation effect of preterm birth on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to term neonates, preterm neonates exhibited lower ALPS indices (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The ALPS index positively correlated with PMA (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and GA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Preterm birth (<i>p</i> = 0.013) had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA. Sex had no significant direct effect (<i>p</i> = 0.639) or moderation effect (<i>p</i> = 0.333) on ALPS index.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system development is a dynamic process in neonates, which can be moderated by preterm birth, the ALPS index could serve as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring this process. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:970–980</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27049?af=R">Multiparametric Characterization of Focal Cortical Dysplasia Using 3D MR Fingerprinting</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To develop a multiparametric machine-learning (ML) framework using high-resolution 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting (MRF) data for quantitative characterization of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>We included 119 subjects, 33 patients with focal epilepsy and histopathologically confirmed FCD, 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 26 disease controls (DCs). Subjects underwent whole-brain 3 Tesla MRF acquisition, the reconstruction of which generated T1 and T2 relaxometry maps. A 3D region of interest was manually created for each lesion, and z-score normalization using HC data was performed. We conducted 2D classification with ensemble models using MRF T1 and T2 mean and standard deviation from gray matter and white matter for FCD versus controls. Subtype classification additionally incorporated entropy and uniformity of MRF metrics, as well as morphometric features from the morphometric analysis program (MAP). We translated 2D results to individual probabilities using the percentage of slices above an adaptive threshold. These probabilities and clinical variables were input into a support vector machine for individual-level classification. Fivefold cross-validation was performed and performance metrics were reported using receiver-operating-characteristic-curve analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD versus HC classification yielded mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.945, 0.980, and 0.962, respectively; FCD versus DC classification achieved 0.918, 0.965, and 0.939. In comparison, visual review of the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected 48% (16/33) of the lesions by official radiology report. In the subgroup where both clinical MRI and MAP were negative, the MRF-ML models correctly distinguished FCD patients from HCs and DCs in 98.3% of cross-validation trials. Type II versus non-type-II classification exhibited mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.835, 0.823, and 0.83, respectively; type IIa versus IIb classification showed 0.85, 0.9, and 0.87. In comparison, the transmantle sign was present in 58% (7/12) of the IIb cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The MRF-ML framework presented in this study demonstrated strong efficacy in noninvasively classifying FCD from normal cortex and distinguishing FCD subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:944–957</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) can result from dominant, gain of function variants of neuronal ion channels. More than 450 de novo missense variants of the sodium channel gene <i>SCN8A</i> have been identified in individuals with DEE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied a mouse model carrying the patient <i>Scn8a</i> variant p.Asn1768Asp. An AAV-PHP.eB virus carrying an allele-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. Cas9 was provided by an inherited transgene.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Allele-specific disruption of the reading frame of the pathogenic transcript generated out-of-frame indels in 1/4 to 1/3 of transcripts throughout the brain. This editing efficiency was sufficient to rescue lethality and seizures. Neuronal hyperexcitability was reduced in cells expressing the virus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The data demonstrate efficient allele-specific editing of a dominant missense variant and support the feasibility of allele-specific therapy for DEE epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:958–969</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To understand the etiological landscape and phenotypic differences between 2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) syndromes: DEE with spike–wave activation in sleep (DEE-SWAS) and epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All patients fulfilled International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) DEE-SWAS or EE-SWAS criteria with a Core cohort (n = 91) drawn from our Epilepsy Genetics research program, together with 10 etiologically solved patients referred by collaborators in the Expanded cohort (n = 101). Detailed phenotyping and analysis of molecular genetic results were performed. We compared the phenotypic features of individuals with DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS. Brain-specific gene co-expression analysis was performed for D/EE-SWAS genes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified the etiology in 42/91 (46%) patients in our Core cohort, including 29/44 (66%) with DEE-SWAS and 13/47 (28%) with EE-SWAS. A genetic etiology was identified in 31/91 (34%). D/EE-SWAS genes were highly co-expressed in brain, highlighting the importance of channelopathies and transcriptional regulators. Structural etiologies were found in 12/91 (13%) individuals. We identified 10 novel D/EE-SWAS genes with a range of functions: <i>ATP1A2</i>, <i>CACNA1A</i>, <i>FOXP1</i>, <i>GRIN1</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KCNQ3</i>, <i>PPFIA3</i>, <i>PUF60</i>, <i>SETD1B, and ZBTB18</i>, and 2 novel copy number variants, 17p11.2 duplication and 5q22 deletion. Although developmental regression patterns were similar in both syndromes, DEE-SWAS was associated with a longer duration of epilepsy and poorer intellectual outcome than EE-SWAS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS have highly heterogeneous genetic and structural etiologies. Phenotypic analysis highlights valuable clinical differences between DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS which inform clinical care and prognostic counseling. Our etiological findings pave the way for the development of precision therapies. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:932–943</p>

                Sharma et al. demonstrate that Golgi dispersal and cell motility reported upon EGF stimulation require CARP2. CARP2, an endosomal ubiquitin ligase, targets Golgin45 for ubiquitination and degradation, leading to Golgi dispersal.

                LncRNAs are involved in modulating the individual risk and the severity of progression in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD), but their precise roles remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA <i>Snhg3</i> in the development and progression of MASLD, along with the underlying mechanisms. The result showed that <i>Snhg3</i> was significantly downregulated in the liver of high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Notably, palmitic acid promoted the expression of <i>Snhg3</i> and overexpression of <i>Snhg3</i> increased lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific <i>Snhg3</i> deficiency decreased body and liver weight, alleviated hepatic steatosis and promoted hepatic fatty acid metabolism in DIO mice, whereas overexpression induced the opposite effect. Mechanistically, <i>Snhg3</i> promoted the expression, stability and nuclear localization of SND1 protein via interacting with SND1, thereby inducing K63-linked ubiquitination modification of SND1. Moreover, <i>Snhg3</i> decreased the H3K27me3 level and induced SND1-mediated chromatin loose remodeling, thus reducing H3K27me3 enrichment at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter and enhancing PPARγ expression. The administration of PPARγ antagonist T0070907 improved <i>Snhg3</i>-aggravated hepatic steatosis. Our study revealed a new signaling pathway, <i>Snhg3</i>/SND1/H3K27me3/PPARγ, responsible for mice MASLD and indicates that lncRNA-mediated epigenetic modification has a crucial role in the pathology of MASLD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88318">DYRK1A interacts with the tuberous sclerosis complex and promotes mTORC1 activity</a></h4>

              
                DYRK1A, a ubiquitously expressed kinase<i>,</i> is linked to the dominant intellectual developmental disorder, microcephaly, and Down syndrome in humans. It regulates numerous cellular processes such as cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, and microtubule assembly. DYRK1A is a critical regulator of organ growth; however, how it regulates organ growth is not fully understood. Here, we show that the knockdown of <i>DYRK1A</i> in mammalian cells results in reduced cell size, which depends on mTORC1. Using proteomic approaches, we found that DYRK1A interacts with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, namely TSC1 and TSC2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, we show that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462, a modification known to inhibit TSC activity and promote mTORC1 activity. We also found that the reduced cell growth upon knockdown of DYRK1A can be rescued by overexpression of RHEB, an activator of mTORC1. Our findings suggest that DYRK1A inhibits TSC complex activity through inhibitory phosphorylation on TSC2, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity. Furthermore, using the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction as a model, we show that the <i>mnb,</i> the fly homologs of <i>DYRK1A</i>, is rescued by RHEB overexpression, suggesting a conserved role of <i>DYRK1A</i> in TORC1 regulation.

">Limitations of grouping subjects based on biological sex (males versus females) and a new approach: insights from intra-nucleus accumbens core dopamine-induced psychostimulant activity.</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the field of substance use disorder research, sex-as-a-biological-variable (SABV) is employed to determine the mechanisms governing sex differences. Based on our recently developed MISSING (Mapping Intrinsic Sex Similarities as an Integral quality of Normalized Groups) model, we hypothesized that grouping subjects by biological sex does not represent the most effective way to group behavioral data objectively. To test our hypothesis, we conducted experiments to compare the psychostimulant effect of intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine on groups based on 1) biological sex (current model) and 2) behavioral clustering (MISSING model) for effectiveness in identifying groups of subjects that a) are distinct with regards to behavioral variables, and b) confirm NAc dopamine neurochemical expression/activity topography (NEAT). Methods: For the current model, we separated subjects (n = 37 Sprague Dawley rats, male n = 20, female n = 17) by biological sex prior to all assessments. For the MISSING model, we conducted normal mixtures clustering of baseline activity, dopamine activity (as distance traveled in cm over 60 min) and dopamine activity normalized-to-baseline activity (NBA) of all subjects to identify behavioral clusters. Results: Separating groups by biological sex revealed groups (males and females) that were not clearly distinct with regards to behavioral variables and do not confirm NAc dopamine NEAT. Separating groups using the MISSING model revealed groups (behavioral clusters) that were clearly distinct with regards to behavior and confirm NAc dopamine NEAT. Conclusions: Our results reveal the limitations of grouping subjects based on biological sex. We discuss a new approach.

">Local postural changes elicit extensive and diverse skin stretch around joints, on the trunk, and the face</a></h4>

              
                Skin stretch, induced by bodily movements, offers a potential source of information about the conformation of the body that can be transmitted to the brain via stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptive neurons. While previous studies have primarily focused on skin stretch directly at joints, here we investigate the extent and complexity of natural skin stretch across various body regions, including the face and trunk. We used a quad-camera setup to image large ink-based speckle patterns stamped on participants' skin and calculated the resulting stretch patterns on a millimeter scale during a range of natural poses. We observed that skin stretch associated with joint movement extends far beyond the joint itself, with knee flexion inducing stretch on the upper thigh. Large and uniform stretch patterns were found across the trunk, covering considerable portions of the skin. The face exhibited highly complex and non-uniform stretch patterns, potentially contributing to our capacity to control fine facial movements in the absence of traditional proprioceptors. Importantly, all regions demonstrated skin stretch in excess of mechanoreceptive thresholds, suggesting that behaviorally relevant skin stretch can occur anywhere on the body. These signals might provide the brain with valuable information about body state and conformation, potentially supplementing or even surpassing the capabilities of traditional proprioception.

">Adaptive optical correction in in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy with neural fields</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive optics (AO) techniques are designed to restore ideal imaging performance by measuring and correcting aberrations originating from both the microscope system and the sample itself. Conventional AO methods require additional hardware, such as wavefront sensors and corrective devices, for aberration measurement and correction, respectively. These methods often necessitate microscopes to adhere to strict design parameters, like perfect optical conjugation, to ensure the accurate delivery of corrective patterns for wavefront correction using corrective devices. However, in general microscope systems, including commercially available ones, conjugation errors are more prone to arise due to incomplete conjugation among optical components by design and misalignment of the components, coupled with their limited access and adjustability, which hinders the rigorous integration of AO hardware. Here, we describe a general-purpose AO framework using neural fields, NeAT, that is applicable to both custom-built and commercial two-photon fluorescence microscopes and demonstrate its performance in various in vivo imaging settings. This framework estimates wavefront aberration from a single 3D two-photon fluorescence image stack, without requiring external datasets for training. Additionally, it addresses the issue of incomplete optical conjugation by estimating and correcting any conjugation errors, which enables more accurate aberration correction by the corrective device. Finally, it jointly recovers the sample's 3D structural information during the learning process, potentially eliminating the need for hardware-based AO correction. We first carefully assess its aberration estimation performance using a custom-built two-photon fluorescence microscope equipped with a wavefront sensor which provides the ground truth aberration for comparison. We further characterize and assess the robustness of the aberration estimation to image stacks with low signal-to-noise ratios, strong aberration, and motion artifacts. As practical applications, using a commercial microscope with a spatial light modulator, we first demonstrate NeAT's real-time aberration correction performance in in vivo morphological imaging of the mouse brain. We further show its performance in in vivo functional activity imaging of glutamate and calcium dynamics within the mouse brain.

">Ketosis Elevates Antioxidants and Enhances Neural Function Through Improved Bioenergetics: A 1H MR Spectroscopy Study</a></h4>

              
                Ketosis is known to alter the balance of neuroactive amino acids and enhance neural function when compared to a glycolytic condition. However, its influence on other metabolites, such as antioxidants and neural energy markers, and the mechanisms by which ketosis improves neural function remain unclear. Here, we measure the neurochemical effects of acute ketosis on the human brain using ultra-high-field 1H MR Spectroscopy (MRS) and investigate the subsequent impact on neural function through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). In a within-subjects design, N = 63 healthy adults from across the lifespan underwent 1H MRS and rsfMRI scans before and after consuming individually weight-dosed and calorically-matched ketone monoester or glucose drinks. Ketone monoester administration, but not glucose, significantly elevated cerebral antioxidants and energy markers while decreasing GABA, glutamate, and glutamine levels in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Notably, increased bioenergetics, specifically an increase in total creatine, correlated with greater improvements in neural function as measured using rsfMRI. Our results integrate metabolic and functional neuroimaging findings, offering a comprehensive understanding of ketosis-induced changes in brain chemistry and functional network dynamics, yielding valuable insights into potential mechanisms by which ketosis imparts its neural benefits.

">Space matters: virtual pedestrians with mobility constraints affect individuals' avoidance behaviours</a></h4>

              
                Walking in urban settings requires people to negotiate crowds. In these situations, people typically want to maintain a level of personal space around themselves. Recent work on one-versus-one interactions demonstrated that whether one of the pedestrians looked distracted or interacted with an object (e.g., stroller, bike) predicted the medial-lateral separation between them as they walked past each other. However, this work did not distinguish between the type of object interaction (or mobility constraint) and thus, it is unclear whether different constraints have different effects on avoidance behaviours. Here we tested the hypothesis that the type of object an approaching pedestrian held or pushed would affect the extent of path deviation, which would also depend on whether that pedestrian was distracted. To address this hypothesis, we created an immersive virtual environment that consisted of a 3.5-m-wide paved urban path. Participants had to walk and avoid colliding with approaching virtual pedestrians that often held a shopping bag or pushed a bike or stroller while looking straight ahead or off to the side as if distracted. Distraction did not affect avoidance behaviours. However, participants increased medial-lateral separation with the virtual pedestrian at the time of crossing when a stroller was present compared to the other mobility constraints. The type of mobility constraint also differentially affected onset of deviation and rate of progression before and after a path deviation. These results support the idea that characteristics of the obstacle to avoid (in this case, a virtual pedestrian) influence collision avoidance behaviours.

                Single pulse electrical stimulation experiments produce pulse-evoked potentials used to infer brain connectivity. The choice of recording reference for intracranial electrodes remains non-standardized and can significantly impact data interpretation. When the reference electrode is affected by stimulation or evoked brain activity, it can contaminate the pulse-evoked potentials recorded at all other electrodes and influence interpretation of findings. We highlight this specific issue in intracranial EEG datasets from two subjects recorded at separate institutions. We present several intuitive metrics to detect the presence of reference contamination and offer practical guidance on different mitigation strategies. Either switching the reference electrode or re-referencing to an adjusted common average effectively mitigated the reference contamination issue, as evidenced by increased variability in pulse-evoked potentials across the brain. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of clear quality checks and preprocessing steps that should be performed before analysis of single pulse electrical stimulation data.

While the reinforcing dopamine (DA)-releasing properties of MDMA are on par with methamphetamine (METH), MDMA is a far more potent serotonin (5-HT) releaser, via the 5-HT transporter (SERT). MDMA-mediated 5-HT release in a major reward center, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), drives prosocial behaviors via 5-HT1BR activation. We hypothesized that this prosocial mechanism contributes to the reduced reinforcing properties of MDMA compared to METH and used a platform of assays to predict the balance of prosocial and abuse-linked effects of (R)-MDMA, a novel entactogen in clinical development. NAc DA release, measured by GRAB-DA photometry in vivo, increased in proportion to MDMA (7.5 and 15 mg/kg, i.p.) and METH (2 mg/kg i.p.)-conditioned place preference (CPP). Using conditional knockouts (cKOs) for DAT and SERT, microdialysis, and photometry, we found that MDMA-released 5-HT limited MDMA-released DA through actions in the NAc, rather than at ventral tegmental area DAergic cell bodies. SERT cKO reduced the MDMA dose required for CPP three-fold. This enhanced MDMA-CPP and increased DA release were replicated by intra-NAc infusion of either a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) to prevent MDMA interaction with SERT, or a 5-HT2CR antagonist (SB242084), but not by the 5-HT1BR antagonist NAS-181. These data support separate mechanisms for the low abuse potential versus prosocial effect of MDMA. Using this platform of assays, (R)-MDMA is predicted to have prosocial effects and low abuse potential.

">The neural correlates of shared and individual experience</a></h4>

              
                Contemporary neuroscience research typically focuses on shared contents of experience and common neural states. Conversely, we set out to explore the neural correlates of individual-specific experiences that shape the distinct traits of each person. We propose an approach through which we compute individual-specific dynamics of functional connectivity states. These dynamics do not require estimation of common states across individuals and can be directly related to dynamic behavioural ratings of subjective experience. To this end, we leverage a unique functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset where subjects listened to an engaging naturalistic story while awake and under different levels of anaesthesia, altering or abolishing conscious experience. We find that this method can detect correspondences between neural and subjective dynamics. We then show that the dynamics of the default mode network underlie more personal experiences of the story as they are more dissimilar between participants during awareness compared to unconsciousness. On the other hand, the auditory and posterior dorsal attention networks show higher inter-subject similarity in consciousness compared to unconsciousness and suggest that the dynamics of these networks support more generalisable experiences of the story. We further characterise individual-specific brain dynamics by showing that they are associated with higher complexity in consciousness, whilst conversely, brain dynamics underlying shared experience become less complex during the conscious experience of the story.

">40 Hz light stimulation restores early brain dynamics alterations and associative memory in Alzheimer's disease model mice</a></h4>

              
                Visual gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli (vGENUS) is a promising non-invasive therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD), showing efficacy in improving memory function. However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Using young AppNL-F/MAPT double knock-in (dKI) mice, a model of early AD, we examined brain dynamics alterations before amyloid plaque onset. High-density EEG recordings and novel metrics from fields outside neuroscience were used to assess brain dynamics fluidity - a measure of the brain's ability to transition between activity states. We revealed that dKI mice exhibit early, awake state-specific reductions in brain dynamics fluidity associated with cognitive deficits in complex memory tasks. Daily vGENUS sessions over two weeks restored brain dynamics fluidity and rescued memory deficits in dKI mice. Importantly, these effects built up during the stimulation protocol and persisted after stimulation ended, suggesting long-term modulation of brain function. Based on these results, we propose a "brain dynamics repair" mechanism for vGENUS that goes beyond current amyloid-centric hypotheses. This dual insight - that brain dynamics are both a target for repair and a potential diagnostic tool - provides new perspectives on early Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

                Purpose: To develop and characterize the performance of a 128-channel head array for brain imaging at 10.5 tesla and evaluate the potential of brain imaging at this unique, >10 tesla magnetic field. Methods: The coil is composed of a 16-channel self-decoupled loop transmit/receive array with a 112-loop receive-only (Rx) insert. Interactions between the outer transmitter and the inner 112Rx insert were mitigated using coaxial cable traps placed every 1/16 of a wavelength on each feed cable, locating most preamplifier boards outside the transmitter field and miniaturizing those placed directly on individual coils. Results: The 128-channel array described herein achieved 77% of ultimate intrinsic SNR in the center of the brain. Transmit field maps obtained experimentally on a phantom with and without the receive array were similar and matched EM simulations, leading to FDA approval for human imaging. Anatomical and functional data, including with power demanding sequences, were acquired successfully on human volunteers. Conclusions: Counterintuitive to expectations based on magnetic fields [&le;]7T, the higher channel counts provided SNR gains centrally, capturing ~80% uiSNR. Fraction of uiSNR achieved centrally in 64Rx, 80Rx, and 128Rx arrays suggested that a plateau was being reached at 80%. At this plateau, linear to approximately quadratic B0 dependent SNR gains for the periphery and the center, respectively, were observed for 10.5T relative 7T.

                -Synuclein misfolding and progressive accumulation drives a pathogenic process in Parkinson's disease. To understand cellular and network vulnerability to -synuclein pathology, we developed a framework to quantify network-level vulnerability and identify new therapeutic targets at the cellular level. Full brain -synuclein pathology was mapped in mice over 9 months. Empirical pathology data was compared to theoretical pathology estimates from a diffusion model of pathology progression along anatomical connections. Unexplained variance in the model enabled us to derive regional vulnerability that we compared to regional gene expression. We identified gene expression patterns that relate to regional vulnerability, including 12 kinases that were enriched in vulnerable regions. Among these, an inhibitor of group II PAKs demonstrated protection from neuron death and -synuclein pathology, even after delayed compound treatment. This study provides a framework for the derivation of cellular vulnerability from network-based studies and identifies a promising therapeutic pathway for Parkinson's disease.

">Relationship as resource or burden? Associations of attachment style, relationship quality and dyadic coping with acute psychosocial stress in the presence of the romantic partner</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a wide-spread phenomenon and associated with various detrimental health effects. A significant resource for stress buffering is social support. How social support is perceived, however, depends on a multitude of individual and interindividual factors. This study aimed to explore the stress-reducing properties of relationship-inherent variables. We investigated the association of attachment style, relationship quality and dyadic coping, with subjective and physiological stress responses to a psychosocial laboratory stressor in romantic partners. Seventy-nine couples participated, with one partner ("target") undergoing the Trier Social Stress Test and the other ("observer") observing the situation. Besides examining the role of targets' relationship variables, we also assessed the link between observers' relationship variables and targets' stress reactivity. We found that both targets' and observers' insecure-avoidant attachment scores were associated with targets' stress reactivity. In detail, while targets' insecure-avoidant attachment scores were negatively associated with targets' subjective stress experience, observers' insecure-avoidant attachment scores were positively associated with targets' heart rate reactivity. Further, higher insecure-avoidant attachment scores linked to lower psycho-endocrine covariance, i.e., a lower accordance between self-reported and cortisol stress responding. On the one hand, these data may suggest that under stress, insecure-avoidantly attached individuals suppress their experience of stress to preserve a sense of independence as part of their deactivating attachment strategy. The presence of an insecure-avoidantly attached partner during a stressful experience, on the other hand, seems to be a stressor rather than a source of support. Long-term, an insecure-avoidantly attached partner may negatively impact an individual's stress-related health and wellbeing.

">Oxytocin neurons signal state-dependent transitions to thermogenesis and behavioral arousal in social and non-social settings.</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian thermoregulatory behaviors such as thermal comfort seeking, physical activity, nesting, and huddling operate alongside autonomic responses such as brown fat thermogenesis and peripheral vasodilation to defend core body temperature (Tb) 1-4. The defended Tb is not held constant, but alternates across active/rest and behavioral cycles 5-9. Although the thermoregulatory behaviors facilitating these alternations are controlled by the brain, the underlying neural populations are poorly understood. The oxytocin system has been proposed to contribute to behavioral thermoregulation 10,11, yet evidence for how activity within oxytocin neurons relates to such pathways is lacking. Here, we identify neuronal dynamics underlying behavioral thermoregulation in mice. We show that the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVN) and PVN oxytocin (PVNOT) neurons are selectively activated during two thermoregulatory states: active and quiescent huddling. Next, activation and inhibition of PVNOT neurons reveals effects on Tb, peripheral vasodilation, and warm seeking, establishing a role in thermoeffector pathways. We then demonstrate that in vivo PVNOT calcium activity tracks the patterning of thermoregulatory behaviors. Across social contexts, PVNOT peaks occur during low Tb (~36.0{degrees}C) and during transitions towards physical activity and thermogenesis. In the solo context, PVNOT peaks predict the offset of quiescence and onset of post-quiescence nesting. In the paired context, PVNOT peaks predict the offset of quiescent huddling and onset of post-quiescent active huddling. Our study provides evidence for a role of PVNOT neurons during the offset of rest and the onset of behavioral arousal and thermogenesis and provides a foundation for understanding the coordination between thermal homeostasis and animal behavior.

                Cannabidiol (CBD) has shown potential for treating schizophrenia (SCZ) by targeting its positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. In this study, we investigated if CBD could reverse the memory impairment observed after chronic administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist. MK-801 treatment (0.5 mg/kg i.p., twice a day, for 14 days) resulted in short- and long-term memory deficits and decreased relative power of {gamma} oscillation in freely moving animals. CBD administration (60 mg/kg i.p. daily for seven days after the MK-801 treatment period) reversed these changes. The positive cognitive effects of CBD were prevented by a 5-HT1A, but not a CB2, receptor antagonist. On the cellular level, CBD reversed MK-801-induced reduced number of parvalbumin-positive neurons and their associated perineuronal nets in the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHip). This neuroprotective effect was mediated by 5-HT1A and CB2 receptors in the vHip but was independent of these receptors in the mPFC. Additionally, CBD reversed MK-801-induced microglial activation in both mPFC and vHip, again through 5-HT1A and CB2 receptors. These findings suggest that CBD modulates multiple pathways affected in SCZ-like conditions, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for SCZ treatment.

">Hierarchical emergence of opponent coding in auditory belt cortex</a></h4>

              
                We recorded from neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) and middle-lateral belt area (ML) while rhesus macaques either discriminated amplitude-modulated noise (AM) from unmodulated noise or passively heard the same stimuli. We used several post-hoc pooling models to investigate the ability of auditory cortex to leverage population coding for AM detection. We find that pooled-response AM detection is better in the active condition than the passive condition, and better using rate-based coding than synchrony-based coding. Neurons can be segregated into two classes based on whether they increase (INC) or decrease (DEC) their firing rate in response to increasing modulation depth. In these samples, A1 had relatively fewer DEC neurons (26%) than ML (45%). When responses were pooled without segregating these classes, AM detection using rate-based coding was much better in A1 than in ML, but when pooling only INC neurons, AM detection in ML approached that found in A1. Pooling only DEC neurons resulted in impaired AM detection in both areas. To investigate the role of DEC neurons, we devised two pooling methods that opposed DEC and INC neurons - a direct subtractive method and a two-pool push-pull opponent method. Only the push-pull opponent method resulted in superior AM detection relative to indiscriminate pooling. In the active condition, the opponent method was superior to pooling only INC neurons during the late portion of the response in ML. These results suggest that the increasing prevalence of the DEC response type in ML can be leveraged by appropriate methods to improve AM detection.

">Bcl11b orchestrates subcerebral projection neuron axon development via cell-autonomous, non-cell-autonomous, and subcellular mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Both cell-intrinsic competency and extracellular cues regulate axon projection, but mechanisms that coordinate these elements remain poorly understood. Subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) extend their primary axons from cortex through subcortical structures, including the striatum, targeting the brainstem and spinal cord. We identify that the transcription factor Bcl11b/Ctip2 functions in multiple independent neuron populations to control SCPN axon development. Bcl11b expressed by SCPN is required cell-autonomously for axonal outgrowth and efficient entry into the internal capsule within the striatum, while Bcl11b expressed by medium spiny neurons (MSN) non-cell-autonomously regulates SCPN axon fasciculation within the internal capsule and subsequent pathfinding. Further, integrated investigation of Bcl11b-null SCPN with transcriptomic, immunocytochemical, and in vivo growth cone purification approaches identifies that Cdh13 is localized along axons and on growth cone surfaces of SCPN in vivo, and mediates Bcl11b regulation of SCPN axonal outgrowth. Together, these results demonstrate that Bcl11b controls multiple aspects of SCPN axon development by coordinating intrinsic SCPN cell autonomous subcellular mechanisms and extrinsic MSN non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.

                Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that consist of misfolded tau protein1 cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Tau is released from neurons as free protein or in extracellular vesicles (EVs)3-5 but the role of these different release mechanisms in intercellular tau transmission is unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal gene Arc is critical for packaging tau into EVs. Brain EVs purified from human tau (hTau) transgenic rTg4510 mice (rTgWT) contain high levels of hTau that are capable of seeding tau pathology. In contrast, EVs purified from rTgWT crossed with Arc knock-out mice (rTgArc KO) have significantly less hTau and cannot seed tau aggregation. Arc facilitates the release of hTau in EVs produced via the I-BAR protein IRSp53, but not free tau. Arc protein directly binds hTau to form a fuzzy complex that we identified in both mouse and human brain tissue. We find that pathological intracellular hTau accumulates in neurons in rTgArc KO mice, which correlates with accelerated neuron loss in the hippocampus. Finally, we find that intercellular tau transmission is significantly abrogated in Arc KO mice. We conclude that Arc-dependent release of tau in EVs plays a significant role in intracellular tau elimination and intercellular tau transmission.

">Parkinsonism disrupts neuronal modulation in the pre-supplementary motor area during movement preparation</a></h4>

              
                Multiple studies suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with changes in neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. There are limited electrophysiological data, however, describing how parkinsonism impacts neuronal activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), an area in medial frontal cortex involved in movement planning and motor control. In this study, single unit activity was recorded in the pre-SMA of two non-human primates during a visually cued reaching task in both the naive and parkinsonian state using the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of parkinsonism. In the naive state neuronal discharge rates were dynamically modulated prior to the presentation of the instructional go-cue. In a subset of these modulated cells, the magnitude of modulation correlated linearly with reaction time (RT). In the parkinsonian state, however, modulation of discharge rates in the pre-SMA was disrupted and the predictive encoding of RT was significantly diminished. These findings add to our understanding of the role of pre-SMA in motor behavior and suggest that disrupted encoding in this cortical area contributes to the alteration of early preparatory and pre-movement processes that are present in Parkinson's disease.

">An end-to-end model of active electrosensation</a></h4>

              
                Weakly electric fish localize and identify objects by sensing distortions in a self-generated electric field. Fish can determine the resistance and capacitance of an object, for example, even though the field distortions being sensed are small and highly-dependent on object distance and size. Here we construct a model of the responses of the fish's electroreceptors on the basis of experimental data, and we develop a model of the electric fields generated by the fish and the distortions due to objects of different resistances and capacitances. This provides us with an accurate and efficient method for generating large artificial data sets simulating fish interacting with a wide variety of objects. Using these sets, we train an artificial neural network (ANN), representing brain areas downstream of electroreceptors, to extract the 3D location, size, and electrical properties of objects. The model performs best if the ANN operates in two stages: first estimating object distance and size and then using this information to extract electrical properties. This suggests a specific form of modularity in the electrosensory system that can be tested experimentally and highlights the potential of end-to-end modeling for studies of sensory processing.

">Human short association fibers are thinner and less myelinated than long fibers</a></h4>

              
                The size and complexity of the human brain requires optimally sized and myelinated fibers. White matter fibers facilitate fast communication between distant areas, but also connect adjacent cortical regions via short association fibers. The fundamental questions of i) how thick these fibers are and ii) how strongly they are myelinated, however, remain unanswered. We present a comprehensive analysis of ~400,000 fibers of human white matter regions with long (corpus callosum) and short fibers (superficial white matter). We demonstrate a substantially smaller fiber diameter and lower myelination in superficial white matter than in the corpus callosum. Surprisingly, we do not find a difference in the ratio between axon diameter and myelin thickness (g-ratio), which is close to the theoretically optimal value of ~0.6 in both areas. For the first time, to our knowledge, we shed light on a fundamental principle of brain organization that will be essential to understand the human brain.

">Connectome-based Predictive Models of General and Specific Cognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control, the ability to adapt thoughts and actions to shifting contexts and goals, is composed primarily of three distinct yet interrelated components: Inhibition, Shifting, and Updating. While prior research has examined the nature of different cognitive components as well as their inter-relationships, fewer studies examined whole-brain connectivity to predict individual differences for the three cognitive components and associated tasks. Here, using the Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) approach and open-access data from the Human Connectome Project, we built brain network models to successfully predict individual performance differences on the Flanker task, the Dimensional Change Card Sort task, and the 2-Back task, each putatively corresponding to Inhibition, Shifting, and Updating. We focused on grayordinate fMRI data collected during the 2-Back tasks after confirming superior predictive performance over resting-state and volumetric data. High cross-task prediction accuracy as well as joint recruitment of canonical networks, such as the frontoparietal and default-mode networks, suggest the existence of a common cognitive control factor. To directly investigate the relationships among the three cognitive control components, we developed new measures to disentangle their shared and unique aspects. Our analysis confirmed that a shared control component can be well predicted from functional connectivity patterns densely located around the frontoparietal, default-mode and dorsal attention networks. In contrast, the Shifting-specific and Inhibition-specific components exhibited lower cross-prediction performance, indicating their distinct and specialized roles. Notably, the Updating-specific component showed significant cross-prediction with the general control factor, suggesting its central role in cognitive control. Given the limitation that individual behavioral measures do not purely reflect the intended cognitive constructs, our study demonstrates the need to distinguish between common and specific components of cognitive control.

">Functional Ultrasound Imaging Reveals Activation Properties of Clinical Spinal Cord Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy has long been established as an effective treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. However, methodological limitations have prohibited the detailed investigation of the activation patterns produced in the spinal cord during therapy. Functional ultrasound (fUS) is an emerging technology that monitors local hemodynamic changes in the brain that are tightly coupled to neural functional activity [1-3]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution of fUS can be used to monitor activation in the spinal cord [4, 5]. In this study, fUS was used to investigate neuromodulation patterns produced by clinical SCS paradigms in an ovine model that enabled testing with implanted clinical hardware. Materials and Methods: Activation of local dorsal horn regions during SCS therapy was evaluated using fUS to detect hemodynamic changes in flowing spinal blood volume ({triangleup}SBV). Briefly, male ovine subjects were anesthetized and laminectomies were performed at T12-L1 to expose the spinal cord. The spine was mechanically fixed to reduce breathing-induced motion. Standard SCS leads were percutaneously implanted midline overlying the dura of the exposed cord to enable stimulation and recording. A second lead was implanted in the epidural space anterior to the laminectomy for recording evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs). Motor thresholds were determined from electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from subdermal needle electrodes. Hemodynamic activation patterns produced by SCS therapy were mapped across two vertebral segments in the superficial dorsal horn (SDH) at amplitudes between 100%-200% eCAP threshold (eCAPT). The magnitude and volume of significant {triangleup}SBV during SCS was quantified and compared across conditions. Results: eCAP and motor thresholds varied widely between different representative SCS programs in current clinical use. Compared with motor threshold, we found eCAPT to be a more stable and reliable ratiometric reference to establish neural drive from stimulation, consistent with previous literature [6]. SCS stimulation resulted in significant activation of the SDH in differing patterns across two vertebral segments. The magnitude and volume of {triangleup}SBV increased at higher amplitudes and was typically maximal in the SDH regions underlying the active electrodes. Activation persisted for several seconds following SCS therapy cessation, suggesting the engagement of neurophysiological processes with correspondingly long time constants. In addition, therapy mode significantly influenced total area and depth of {triangleup}SBV. Multiphase therapy produced a larger area of {triangleup}SBV that extended deeper into the spinal cord relative to single phase therapies. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that fUS can effectively measure SCS neural response patterns in the pain processing laminae of a large animal model implanted with a clinical SCS system. Hemodynamic responses in the spinal cord varied significantly across SCS therapy modes, with Multiphase stimulation providing a greater area of coverage and depth of response versus other common stimulation types.

">The forgotten psychedelic: Spatiotemporal mapping of brain organisation following the administration of 2C-B and psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                As psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy gains momentum, clinical investigation of next-generation psychedelics may lead to novel compounds tailored for specific populations. 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B) is a psychedelic phenethylamine reported to produce less dysphoria and subjective impairment than the psychedelic tryptamine psilocybin. Despite its popularity among recreational users and distinct pharmacodynamics, the neural correlates of 2C-B remain unexplored. Using 7T resting-state functional MRI in 22 healthy volunteers, we mapped out the acute effects of matched doses of 20 mg 2C-B, 15 mg psilocybin and placebo across spatiotemporal benchmarks of functional brain organisation. In a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we evaluated the neuropharmacological and neurobehavioural correlates of an array of connectivity measures - including static (sFC) and global connectivity (gFC), dynamic connectivity variability (dFC), and spontaneous brain complexity. Compared to placebo, 2C-B and psilocybin selectively reduced intra-network sFC, while broadly increasing between-network and subcortical-cortical connectivity. Compared to psilocybin, 2C-B exhibited less pronounced reductions in between-network FC but elicited elevations in transmodal sFC. Both compounds yielded spatially divergent increases in gFC yet produced similar increases in brain complexity. Using PET density modelling, the spatial distribution of neural effects aligned with documented differences in monoaminergic transporter and serotonergic receptor binding affinity beyond 5-HT2A, highlighting the role of pharmacology in shaping functional dynamics. Lastly, we show behavioural markers of psychedelic effects are non-linearly reflected by the desynchronisation of the transmodal axis of functional brain organisation. Together, our findings highlight 2C-B as a useful new addition to the study of psychedelic neuroscience and may motivate new pharmacotherapy strategies.

">Vicarious Somatotopic Maps Tile Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Our sensory systems work together to generate a cohesive experience of the world around us. Watching others being touched activates brain areas representing our own sense of touch: the visual system recruits touch-related computations to simulate bodily consequences of visual inputs. One long-standing question is how the brain implements this interface between visual and somatosensory representations. To address this question, we developed a method to simultaneously map somatosensory body part tuning and visual field tuning throughout the brain. Applying this method on ongoing co-activations during rest resulted in detailed maps of the body-part tuning in the brain's endogenous somatotopic network. During movie watching, somatotopic tuning explains responses throughout the entire dorsolateral visual system, revealing an array of somatotopic body maps that tile the cortical surface. The tuning of these maps aligned with those of visual maps, and predicted both preferences for visual field locations and the visual-category preferences for body parts. These results reveal a mode of brain organization in which aligned visual-somatosensory topographic maps connect visual and bodily reference frames. This cross-modal interface is ideally situated to translate raw sensory impressions into more abstract formats useful for action, social cognition, and semantic processing.

">Visual objects refine head direction coding</a></h4>

              
                Animals use visual objects to guide navigation-related behaviors, from hunting prey, to escaping predators, to exploring the world. However, little is known about where visual objects are encoded in the mouse brain or how visual objects impact processing within the spatial navigation system. Using functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging in mice, we conducted a brain-wide screen and identified brain areas that were preferentially activated by images of objects compared to scrambled versions of the same stimuli. While visual cortical areas did not show a significant preference, regions associated with spatial navigation were preferentially activated by visual objects. Electrophysiological recordings in the postsubiculum, the primary cortical area of the head direction (HD) system, further confirmed a preference for visual objects, which was present in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. Finally, we found that visual objects dynamically modulate HD cells, selectively increasing firing rates for HD cells aligned with a visual landmark's direction, while suppressing activity in HD cells coding for other directions. These results reveal that visual objects refine population-level coding of head direction.

">Spatial memory in Alzheimer's disease 5XFAD mice is enhanced by XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330</a></h4>

              
                The proteostatic decline in Alzheimer's disease is well established and improvement in proteostasis could potentially delay cognitive impairment. One emerging entry point to modulate proteostasis is the regulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of proteins across the nuclear pore via karyopherins. The nuclear exportin XPO1 is a key regulator of proteostasis by driving the assembly of ribosomes and by modulating the process of autophagy. We recently found that XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 (Selinexor), an FDA approved drug against multiple myelomas, enhances proteostasis, leading to benefits in models of neurodegenerative diseases in C. elegans and Drosophila. Here, we find that KPT-330 increases autophagy in murine neuronal cells and improves spatial memory performance in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease (5XFAD). Unexpectedly, general amyloid deposition in several brain regions was significantly increased by KPT-330, but specific regions, especially the thalamus, displayed significantly lower deposition, suggesting that XPO1 inhibition has regional-specific effects on proteostasis and amyloid plaque formation. Altogether, we conclude that XPO1 inhibition can improve cognition via spatially specific reductions in amyloid deposition.

">Viral vectors with cluster of differentiation gene promoters to target specific cell types in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding brain function and developing targeted therapies for neurological disorders require precise access to specific cell types, but current methods are limited. Here, we report the development of cell-type specific adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors utilizing promoters of cluster of differentiation genes (CD promoters) for targeted gene delivery in the brain. We newly identified CD promoters that induce gene expression selectively in specific cell types in the mouse brain. These AAVs enable in vivo calcium imaging and chemogenetic applications in specific cerebellar cells, revealing distinct and shared roles of two types of cerebellar interneurons. Notably, chemogenetic modulation of cerebellar molecular layer interneurons using a CD promoter rescued social behavior and motor deficits in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder. Our findings demonstrate the utility of these AAVs in elucidating the functions of individual cell types in brain function and in developing novel, cell-type specific therapies for brain diseases.

">Enhanced human sensorimotor integration via self-modulation of the somatosensory activity</a></h4>

              
                Kinesthetic motor imagery, the mental rehearsal of movement and its associated sensations activates somatosensory and motor cortices. Motor imagery improves performance in neurorehabilitation, sports, and instrument play. However, the mechanism that enhances performance through repetitive motor imagery remains unclear. Here, we combined individually tailored motor imagery training combined with closed-loop neurofeedback training, neurophysiology, and behavioral assessment to characterize how the training can modulate the somatosensory system and improve performance. The closed-loop training using real-time feedback of human electroencephalogram (EEG) signals enhanced participants' self-modulation ability of intrinsic neural oscillations in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) within 30 minutes. Further, the short-term reorganization in S1 was corroborated by the post-training reactivity enhancement revealed by changes in somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) amplitude of early component originating from S1. Meanwhile those derived from peripheral sensory fibers were maintained, suggesting that the closed-loop training manipulated cortical activities. Behavioral evaluation demonstrated improved performance during keyboard touch-typing indexed by resolved the speed-accuracy trade-off. Collectively, our results provide evidence that mentally rehearsed movement during kinesthetic motor imagery induces functional reorganization of S1 activities that can contribute to performance improvement.

">Revealing Acute Consequences of Rapid Protein Elimination at Individual Synapses using Auxin-Inducible Degron 2 Technology</a></h4>

              
                A powerful approach to assess a protein of interest (POI) function is its specific elimination. Common knock-out and knock-down strategies, however, are protracted and often irreversible, challenging the assessment of acute or temporary consequences in the same cells and tissues. Here we describe the use of Auxin-Inducible Degron 2 (AID2) technology to study the real-time consequences of acute POI elimination in nerve cell synapses. We demonstrate its capacity in cultured neurons and in vivo to rapidly eliminate postsynaptic scaffold proteins fused at N-terminal, C-terminal, or nested sites to GFP derivatives or HaloTag. We show that acute PSD-95 or gephyrin elimination leads to the concomitant loss of AMPA or GABAA receptors at the same synapses, and that, surprisingly, acute GKAP, but not PSD-95 elimination reduces postsynaptic scaffold size. Our findings highlight the utility of AID2 technology for rapidly eliminating synaptic POIs and studying real-time consequences in the same neurons and synapses.

	<p>Background: Uremic toxins resulting from chronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause cognitive and emotional disorders, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol are notable uremic toxins found in patients with CKD. However, few studies have investigated whether reducing uremic toxins can alleviate cognitive and emotional disorders associated with CKD. Methods: We studied the effects of AST-120, which lowers IS levels, through behavioral tests, local field potentials, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and histological experiments in a 5/6 nephrectomy CKD model. Results: We confirmed AST-120&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness in CKD by measuring serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and IS levels and performing renal tissue staining. Behavioral phenotypes indicated an alleviation of cognitive and anxiety disorders following AST-120 treatment in CKD-induced rats, which was further validated through local field potentials and field excitatory postsynaptic potential recordings. Double immunofluorescence staining for aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus of CKD rats treated with AST-120 showed reduced coexpression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic effects of AST-120 in lowering IS levels and improving cognitive and emotional impairments associated with CKD.</p>

                <p>In the presence of temporally organized stimuli, there is a tendency to entrain to the beat, even at the neurological level. Previous research has shown that when adults listen to rhythmic stimuli and are asked to imagine the beat, their neural responses are the same as when the beat is physically accented. The current study explores the neural processing of simple beat structures where the beat is physically accented or inferred from a previously presented physically accented beat structure in a passive listening context. We further explore the associations of these neural correlates with behavioral and self-reported measures of musicality. Fifty-seven participants completed a passive listening EEG paradigm, a behavioral rhythm discrimination task, and a self-reported musicality questionnaire. Our findings suggest that when the beat is physically accented, individuals demonstrate distinct neural responses to the beat in the beta (13&ndash;23&nbsp;Hz) and gamma (24&ndash;50&nbsp;Hz) frequency bands. We further find that the neural marker in the beta band is associated with individuals&rsquo; self-reported musical perceptual abilities. Overall, this study provides insights into the neural correlates of spontaneous beat processing and its connections with musicality.</p>

                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common focal epilepsy in adults, and people with TLE exhibit higher rates of reproductive endocrine dysfunction. Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons regulate reproductive function in mammals by regulating gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary. Previous research demonstrated GnRH neuron hyperexcitability in both sexes in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE. Fast-inactivating A-type (<I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB>) and delayed rectifier K-type (<I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB>) K<sup>+</sup> currents play critical roles in modulating neuronal excitability, including in GnRH neurons. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GnRH neuron hyperexcitability is associated with reduced <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> conductances. At 2&nbsp;months after IHKA or control saline injection, when IHKA mice exhibit chronic epilepsy, we recorded GnRH neuron excitability, <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB>, and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. GnRH neurons from both IHKA male and diestrus female GnRH-GFP mice exhibited hyperexcitability compared with controls. In IHKA males, although maximum <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> current density was increased, <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> recovery from inactivation was significantly slower, consistent with a hyperexcitability phenotype. In IHKA females, however, both <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> were unchanged. Sex differences were not observed in <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> or <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> properties in controls, but IHKA mice exhibited sex effects in <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> properties. These results indicate that although the emergent phenotype of increased GnRH neuron excitability is similar in IHKA males and diestrus females, the underlying mechanisms are distinct. This study thus highlights sex-specific changes in voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents in GnRH neurons in a mouse model of TLE and suggesting potential sex differences in GnRH neuron ion channel properties.</p>

                <p>Animals have evolved innate responses to cues including social, food, and predator odors. In the natural environment, animals are faced with choices that involve balancing risk and reward where innate significance may be at odds with internal need. The ability to update the value of a cue through learning is essential for navigating changing and uncertain environments. However, the mechanisms involved in this modulation are not well defined in mammals. We have established a new olfactory assay that challenges a thirsty mouse to choose an aversive odor over an attractive odor in foraging for water, thus overriding their innate behavioral response to odor. Innately, mice prefer the attractive odor port over the aversive odor port. However, decreasing the probability of water at the attractive port leads mice to prefer the aversive port, reflecting a learned override of the innate response to the odors. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a fourth-order olfactory brain area, involved in flexible value association, with behaviorally relevant outputs throughout the limbic system. We performed optogenetic and chemogenetic silencing experiments that demonstrate the OFC is necessary for this learned modulation of innate aversion to odor. Further, we characterized odor evoked c-fos expression in learned and control mice and found significant suppression of activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septum, and central and medial amygdala. These findings reveal that the OFC is necessary for the learned override of innate behavior and may signal to limbic structures to modulate innate response to odor.</p>

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                Background Prediabetes, a reversible condition before the onset of diabetes, is a significant concern in healthcare globally. The global prediabetes epidemic has emerged and has considerably impacted health expenditures. Various risk factors play important roles in the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Intensive lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes progression. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of prediabetes state of Medan in August 2023. Methods The sample consisted of 89 participants. This was an analytical cross-sectional study in the community that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The determination of prediabetes is based on the results of blood tests, namely, the examination of fasting blood sugar levels (FBGL), 2-hour postprandial oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C). Other examinations included lipid profiling (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Data processing was performed using SPSS via univariate and bivariate analyses (chi-square test). Results Of the 89 participants, the prevalence of prediabetes based on HbA1c, FBGL and 2-hours OGTT levels was 28.1%, 50.6%, and 28.1%, respectively. 82% of the participants were female, and 53.9% were overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI). The risk factors for prediabetes were age >64 years, female, physical inactivity, and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg (p<0.05). Other risk factors such age <45-64 years, consumption of vegetables/fruits, BMI, HDL, LDL, trygliceride, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, achantosis nigricans, and waist-hip circumference did not associate significantly (p>0.05). Conclusion This study found that the prevalence of prediabetes was 67.4% in Medan. Age >64 years, female, physical inactivity, and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg were the most important risk factors for prediabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1261/v1?src=rss">The most common neonatal presentations to the pediatric emergency department [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The first 28 days of life are considered the neonatal period, when pediatric health is most vulnerable. While crises can undoubtedly arise during this time, many ED or urgent care visits could be avoided with sufficient preventive hospital care during the newborn period and suitable follow-up with a primary care physician. The use of emergency rooms for non-urgent care could be the cause of rising healthcare costs and ineffective resource use. Purpose This study aimed to determine the presenting features, management, and disposition of neonatal attendance in the emergency department. Methods This was a retrospective observational cross-sectional study of medical records identified via the emergency department of neonatal visits (≤28 days) to King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Khobar, Saudi Arabia, over 12 months (2021–2022). The Chi-square test was performed to compare various etiologies, with a 5% significance level. Results A total of 649 neonate visited pediatric emergency department with a mean age of 15.5 ± 7.4 days and almost equal distribution of the gender. The most common presentation was upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (26.8%), followed by physiological jaundice (20.2%), and colic (14%). A total of 205 (31.6%) neonates who visited the ED showed significant laboratory findings. Seventy-nine patients (12.2%) presenting with PED were admitted to the hospital. Conclusion Healthcare systems must devise strategies to address the growing number of non-urgent visits to emergency departments in a more efficient manner, while simultaneously reallocating scarce resources to higher-acuity cases. This emphasizes the necessity of health personnel educating caregivers. It’s also critical that medical professionals understand the common ailments that affect newborns and are skilled at correctly identifying ailments that could indicate a serious pathology.

                Introduction Antiseptic and antibacterial solutions are increasingly used in the treatment of various types of wounds. The successful stabilization of wounds using a combination Sodium Hypochlorite/Hypochlorous acid (NaOCl/HOCl) or superoxidized solution (SOS) has been reported, serving as an effective solution without irritating mammal cells and without posing a carcinogenic hazard. Presently, no systematic review or meta-analysis is available that compares the effectiveness of these antiseptic solutions. The present study aims to investigate the role of NaOCl/HOCl in the treatment of wounds. Methods The systematic review with extended to network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using NaOCl/HOCl, povidone-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexamethylene biguanide, alcohol, and silver compared with normal saline. The primary outcome was wound healing. Using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), the direct and indirect comparisons were conducted with the probability of selecting the best treatment. Results A total of 507 studies were identified from PUBMED and SCOPUS databases, and 64 articles were duplicates. Among 29 studies included, 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. NaOCl/HOCl had a higher chance of wound healing 1.07-1.30 times compared with all the regimens. NaOCl/HOCl has the probability of providing the best treatment, followed by silver and octenidine with SUCRAs of 36.9, 23.1, and 21.8, respectively. Conclusions NaOCl/HOCl ranks first and proves to have the highest efficacy, followed by silver, octenidine, and PHMB for treatment.

                Hydatid disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus and is found globally. Although the liver and lungs are the most prevalent sites of involvement, sub-cutaneous hydatid cysts are rare especially in the primary occurrence. Sub-cutaneous hydatid cysts usually are noticed as slow growing, painless, and mobile masses beneath the overlying skin which is usually normal and are generally found on the trunk and proximal extremities. To the best of our knowledge, very few cases of primary subcutaneous hydatid cysts of the thigh have been documented. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman from a rural setting, who has a large, painless swelling on her thigh. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of a primary subcutaneous hydatid cyst, which is an atypical presentation of the disease. The entire lesion was excised surgically without any evidence of recurrence for a long period postoperatively. This case illustrates the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis and the importance of early surgical management in these cases.

                Introduction Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH)2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH)2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). Materials and methods A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. On the 1st and 3rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. Results The results showed a decrease in COX-2 expression, but not significantly while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing inflammation (COX-2 expression and number of neutrophils) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).

                Abstract Background Moldova strives for universal health coverage (UHC) and considers health technology assessment (HTA) an important policy instrument to inform the choice of services that should be covered to progressively realize UHC. It plays a key role in determining which technologies are coved, considering various dimensions often including cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and feasibility. This paper reports on work undertaken to develop a roadmap for HTA implementation, using evidence-informed deliberative processes (EDPs) as the guiding framework. Methods Between 2020 and 2022, we undertook several activities that informed the roadmap. We conducted a needs assessment and an assessment of European HTA best practices using a combination of desk research, interviews and surveys. We then conducted a document review of six selected HTA systems, complimented by expert interviews from three neighbouring countries. Results The roadmap provided a suggested HTA process, which included instructions on how to execute the different steps of the EDP framework to enhance the legitimacy of HTA-informed decision-making. The roadmap encompasses several aspects such as how to organize stakeholder involvement, how to identify and operationalize decision criteria, and how to make the decision process transparent. Guidance was given to the country on establishing a legal framework for HTA; a communication strategy; strengthening capacity and leveraging HTA expertise. The country was also given tailored advice on the positioning of the HTA-agency, first as an entity within the Ministry of Health or the National Agency of Public Health but with the long-term vision for it to be independent of any state institution. Conclusions Despite several challenges, including a partial disruption because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development of the roadmap for HTA implementation was completed and agreed upon by the Ministry of Health in Moldova. This work has helped motivate and support the country in HTA institutionalization.

                Background Misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of misconduct (KoM) level in this population is lacking. This study assessed KoM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey with 11 questions on KoM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoM. Results The mean±SD KoM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). The two groups of PGDSs with low (n=91) and acceptable or excellent (n=15) KoM levels showed comparable characteristics in terms of age, sex, discipline, post-graduate-level, experience-level, graduation-status, and survey-response modality. Conclusion This study identified a low-level of KoM among North-African PGDSs. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoM in this population.

                <p>by Lachlan Webb, Andrew JK Phillips, James A Roberts</p>

Sleep patterns in infancy and early childhood vary greatly and change rapidly during development. In adults, sleep patterns are regulated by interactions between neuronal populations in the brainstem and hypothalamus, driven by the circadian and sleep homeostatic processes. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the sleep patterns and their variations across infancy and early childhood are poorly understood. We investigated whether a well-established mathematical model for sleep regulation in adults can model infant sleep characteristics and explain the physiological basis for developmental changes. By fitting longitudinal sleep data spanning 2 to 540 days after birth, we inferred parameter trajectories across age. We found that the developmental changes in sleep patterns are consistent with a faster accumulation and faster clearance of sleep homeostatic pressure in infancy and a weaker circadian rhythm in early infancy. We also find greater sensitivity to phase-delaying effects of light in infancy and early childhood. These findings reveal fundamental mechanisms that regulate sleep in infancy and early childhood. Given the critical role of sleep in healthy neurodevelopment, this framework could be used to pinpoint pathophysiological mechanisms and identify ways to improve sleep quality in early life.

                <p>by Anika T. Löwe, Léo Touzo, Paul S. Muhle-Karbe, Andrew M. Saxe, Christopher Summerfield, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. Sudden strategy adaptations are often linked to insights, considered to be a unique aspect of human cognition tied to complex processes such as creativity or meta-cognitive reasoning. Here, we take a learning perspective and ask whether insight-like behaviour can occur in simple artificial neural networks, even when the models only learn to form input-output associations through gradual gradient descent. We compared learning dynamics in humans and regularised neural networks in a perceptual decision task that included a hidden regularity to solve the task more efficiently. Our results show that only some humans discover this regularity, whose behaviour was marked by a sudden and abrupt strategy switch that reflects an aha-moment. Notably, we find that simple neural networks with a gradual learning rule and a constant learning rate closely mimicked behavioural characteristics of human insight-like switches, exhibiting delay of insight, suddenness and selective occurrence in only some networks. Analyses of network architectures and learning dynamics revealed that insight-like behaviour crucially depended on a regularised gating mechanism and noise added to gradient updates, which allowed the networks to accumulate “silent knowledge” that is initially suppressed by regularised gating. This suggests that insight-like behaviour can arise from gradual learning in simple neural networks, where it reflects the combined influences of noise, gating and regularisation. These results have potential implications for more complex systems, such as the brain, and guide the way for future insight research.

                <p>by Xubin Zheng, Dian Meng, Duo Chen, Wan-Ki Wong, Ka-Ho To, Lei Zhu, JiaFei Wu, Yining Liang, Kwong-Sak Leung, Man-Hon Wong, Lixin Cheng</p>

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by an exaggerated immune response to pathogens, leading to organ damage and high mortality rates in the intensive care unit. Although deep learning has achieved impressive performance on prediction and classification tasks in medicine, it requires large amounts of data and lacks explainability, which hinder its application to sepsis diagnosis. We introduce a deep learning framework, called scCaT, which blends the capsulating architecture with Transformer to develop a sepsis diagnostic model using single-cell RNA sequencing data and transfers it to bulk RNA data. The capsulating architecture effectively groups genes into capsules based on biological functions, which provides explainability in encoding gene expressions. The Transformer serves as a decoder to classify sepsis patients and controls. Our model achieves high accuracy with an AUROC of 0.93 on the single-cell test set and an average AUROC of 0.98 on seven bulk RNA cohorts. Additionally, the capsules can recognize different cell types and distinguish sepsis from control samples based on their biological pathways. This study presents a novel approach for learning gene modules and transferring the model to other data types, offering potential benefits in diagnosing rare diseases with limited subjects.

Vividly imagining a song or a melody is a skill that many people accomplish with relatively little effort. However, we are only beginning to understand how the brain represents, holds, and manipulates these musical “thoughts.” Here, we decoded perceived and imagined melodies from magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain data (<i>N</i> = 71) to characterize their neural representation. We found that, during perception, auditory regions represent the sensory properties of individual sounds. In contrast, a widespread network including fronto-parietal cortex, hippocampus, basal nuclei, and sensorimotor regions hold the melody as an abstract unit during both perception and imagination. Furthermore, the mental manipulation of a melody systematically changes its neural representation, reflecting volitional control of auditory images. Our work sheds light on the nature and dynamics of auditory representations, informing future research on neural decoding of auditory imagination.

                Background Several students use hostel facilities offered by their colleges and universities while pursuing higher education. A crucial change is witnessed in their food habits during their stay at the campus, which is vastly different from their home experience. Method The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand the food choices of university students while following the qualitative research methodology and the phenomenological approach. The snowball sampling method is applied to select participants for the study. We selected twenty-six undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing programs in technical and health science from a private university at Udupi with residence in the university campus for two to four years. Interviews with candidates were conducted online and audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results The transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to obtain themes, which were then conceptualized to develop the model based on the theory of planned behaviour. The duration of their stay on campus allowed students to gain a perspective on the food events and the food they consumed at the university dining facility (UDF) guided by factors, such as taste, price, availability of time(during academic activity), accessibility to healthy food, academic stress and lack of knowledge on nutrition. Two factors emerged from the interviews, one, there was no display in the dining facility about the nutritional value of the food served; and, second, students preferred to dine out on unhealthy food rather than at the university because food from outside the campus, even though unhealthy, was easier on the pocket. Conclusion The study provides insights into the role of UDF in serving healthy and nutritional food to students for better health and improved academic performance. This work brings to light the relationship between students’ food choices and their impact on academic performance.

     alt="Hypothalamus Connectivity in Adolescent Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"/>
<p>This study examined hypothalamus connectivity in adolescents with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). We identified weak-to-moderate evidence of increased connectivity (as measured by the number of connections) in the bilateral anterior-inferior, left anterior-superior, and total left hypothalamus in adolescents with ME/CFS compared with healthy controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adolescent Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling illness of unknown etiology. Increasing evidence suggests hypothalamic involvement in ME/CFS pathophysiology, which has rarely been explored using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the condition. This work aimed to use MRI to examine hypothalamus connectivity in adolescents with ME/CFS and explore how this relates to fatigue severity and illness duration. 25 adolescents with ME/CFS and 23 healthy controls completed a neuroimaging protocol consisting of structural and multishell diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, in addition to the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale to assess fatigue severity. Information about illness duration was acquired at diagnosis. Preprocessing and streamlines tractography was performed using <i>QSIPrep</i> combined with a custom parcellation scheme to create structural networks. The number (degree) and weight (strength) of connections between lateralized hypothalamus regions and cortical and subcortical nodes were extracted, and relationships between connectivity measures, fatigue severity, and illness duration were performed using Bayesian regression models. We observed weak-to-moderate evidence of increased degree, but not strength, of connections from the bilateral anterior-inferior (left: <i>pd</i> [%] = 99.18, median [95% CI] = −22.68[−40.96 to 4.45]; right: <i>pd</i> [%] = 99.86, median [95% CI] = −23.35[−38.47 to 8.20]), left anterior-superior (<i>pd</i> [%] = 99.33, median [95% CI] = −18.83[−33.45 to 4.07]) and total left hypothalamus (<i>pd</i> [%] = 99.44, median [95% CI] = −47.18[−83.74 to 11.03]) in the ME/CFS group compared with controls. Conversely, bilateral posterior hypothalamus degree decreased with increasing ME/CFS illness duration (left: <i>pd</i> [%] = 98.13, median [95% CI]: −0.47[−0.89 to 0.03]; right: <i>pd</i> [%] = 98.50, median [95% CI]:-0.43[−0.82 to 0.05]). Finally, a weak relationship between right intermediate hypothalamus connectivity strength and fatigue severity was identified in the ME/CFS group (<i>pd</i> [%] = 99.35, median [95% CI] = −0.28[−0.51 to 0.06]), which was absent in controls. These findings suggest changes in hypothalamus connectivity may occur in adolescents with ME/CFS, warranting further investigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-958/v2?src=rss">The macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries: A panel data analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Background The global challenge of the novel coronavirus has led to an unprecedented downturn, adversely affecting the health and mental wellbeing of communities worldwide. The objective of this study is to assess mental health and psychological distress levels within the general population of Peshawar, Pakistan amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 715 residents of Peshawar, Pakistan. The questionnaire collected data on demographics, socioeconomic status, and residential area. The Modified K10 Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to measure mental well-being. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, were calculated, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM, USA, version 22). Results A total of 715 responses were collected. The comprehensive psychological distress score was identified as 25.55, signifying moderate stress levels. Among the respondents, 53.3% were females, 46.7% had completed a bachelor’s degree, 41% were employed, 78.7% were single, 93.1% were non-smokers, and 69.4% resided in urban areas. The study revealed that both gender (p=0.001) employment status (p=0.018) were linked to a more pronounced psychological impact of the outbreak. Conclusions This study highlights age, gender, employment status, and urbanization as influential factors contributing to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak. As we face the challenges of the new normal, it is essential for policymakers to address these mental health concerns through targeted support and interventions, ensuring that mental health resources are accessible and responsive to the needs of affected populations.

                Advancements in sequencing technologies and the development of new data collection methods produce large volumes of biological data. The Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) provides a cloud-based platform for democratizing access to large-scale genomics data and analysis tools. However, utilizing the full capabilities of AnVIL can be challenging for researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise, especially for executing complex workflows. We present the AnVILWorkflow R package, which enables the convenient execution of bioinformatics workflows hosted on AnVIL directly from an R environment. AnVILWorkflow simplifies the setup of the cloud computing environment, input data formatting, workflow submission, and retrieval of results through intuitive functions. We demonstrate the utility of AnVILWorkflow for three use cases: bulk RNA-seq analysis with Salmon, metagenomics analysis with bioBakery, and digital pathology image processing with PathML. The key features of AnVILWorkflow include user-friendly browsing of available data and workflows, seamless integration of R and non-R tools within a reproducible analysis pipeline, and accessibility to scalable computing resources without direct management overhead. AnVILWorkflow lowers the barrier to utilizing AnVIL’s resources, especially for exploratory analyses or bulk processing with established workflows. This empowers a broader community of researchers to leverage the latest genomics tools and datasets using familiar R syntax. This package is distributed through the Bioconductor project (https://bioconductor.org/packages/AnVILWorkflow), and the source code is available through GitHub (https://github.com/shbrief/AnVILWorkflow).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1256/v1?src=rss">SCUBA implements a storage format-agnostic API for single-cell data access in R [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                While robust tools exist for the analysis of single-cell datasets in both Python and R, interoperability is limited, and analysis tools generally only accept one object class. Considerable programming expertise is required to integrate tools across package ecosystems into a comprehensive analysis, due to their differing languages and internal data structures. This complicates validation of results and leads to inconsistent visualizations between analysis suites. Conversion between object formats is the most common solution, but this is difficult and error-prone due to the rapid pace of development of the analysis suites and their underlying data structures. To address this, we created SCUBA (Single-Cell Unified Backend API), an R package that implements a unified data access API for all common R and Python single-cell object formats. SCUBA extends the data access approach from the widely used Seurat package to SingleCellExperiment and anndata objects. SCUBA also implements new data-specific access functions for all supported object types. Performance scales well across all SCUBA-supported formats. In addition to performance, SCUBA offers several advantages over object conversion for the visualization and further analysis of pre-processed single-cell data. First, SCUBA extracts only data required for the operation at hand, leaving the original object unmodified. This process is simpler, less error prone, and less memory intensive than object conversion, which operates on the entire dataset. Second, code written with SCUBA can use any supported object class as input, with simple and consistent syntax across object formats. This allows a single analysis script or package (like our interactive single-cell browser, scExploreR) to work seamlessly with multiple object types, reducing the complexity of the code and improving both readability and reproducibility. Adoption of SCUBA will ultimately improve collaboration and reproducible research in single-cell analysis by lowering the barriers between package ecosystems.

                <p>Obesity is implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), but its effect on disability is less well-established. This study examined the effects of various obesity measures on MS severity in 12,584 MS cases, using Mendelian randomization to mitigate confounding. Results showed a significant association between higher genetically-determined body mass index (N = 806,834) and increased MS severity (<i>P</i> = 0.02). This finding was supported by additional measures of general obesity but not adiposity distribution. The convergence of this genetic evidence with prior observational studies strengthens the association between obesity and adverse long-term disability in MS, suggesting weight management as a potential therapeutic strategy.

                Injury to the central nervous system (CNS) often results in permanent neurological impairments because axons fail to regenerate and re-establish lost synaptic contacts. By contrast, peripheral neurons can activate a pro-regenerative program and regenerate following a nerve lesion. This relies on an intricate intracellular communication system between the severed axon and the cell body. Locally activated signaling molecules are retrogradely transported to the soma to promote the epigenetic and transcriptional changes required for the injured neuron to regain growth competence. These signaling events rely heavily on intra-axonal translation and mitochondrial trafficking into the severed axon. Here, we discuss the interplay between these mechanisms and the main intrinsic barriers to axonal regeneration. We also examine the potential of manipulating these processes for driving CNS repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93855">Polysaccharide breakdown products drive degradation-dispersal cycles of foraging bacteria through changes in metabolism and motility</a></h4>

              
                Most of Earth’s biomass is composed of polysaccharides. During biomass decomposition, polysaccharides are degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as a nutrient and energy source and are thereby partly remineralized into CO<sub>2</sub>. As polysaccharides are heterogeneously distributed in nature, following the colonization and degradation of a polysaccharide hotspot the cells need to reach new polysaccharide hotspots. Even though many studies indicate that these degradation-dispersal cycles contribute to the carbon flow in marine systems, we know little about how cells alternate between polysaccharide degradation and motility, and which environmental factors trigger this behavioral switch. Here, we studied the growth of the marine bacterium <i>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</i> ZF270 on the abundant marine polysaccharide alginate, both in its soluble polymeric form as well as on its breakdown products. We used microfluidics coupled to time-lapse microscopy to analyze motility and growth of individual cells, and RNA sequencing to study associated changes in gene expression. We found that single cells grow at reduced rate on alginate until they form large groups that cooperatively break down the polymer. Exposing cell groups to digested alginate accelerates cell growth and changes the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation and catabolism, central metabolism, ribosomal biosynthesis, and transport. However, exposure to digested alginate also triggers cells to become motile and disperse from cell groups, proportionally increasing with the group size before the nutrient switch, and this is accompanied by high expression of genes involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. The motile cells chemotax toward polymeric but not digested alginate, likely enabling them to find new polysaccharide hotspots. Overall, our findings reveal cellular mechanisms that might also underlie bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles, which influence the remineralization of biomass in marine environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88981">DGRPool, a web tool leveraging harmonized Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel phenotyping data for the study of complex traits</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of complex traits, but studying how a GWAS variant can affect a specific trait in the human population remains challenging due to environmental variability. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is in this regard an excellent model organism for studying the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation due to its simple handling, standardized growth conditions, low cost, and short lifespan. The <i>Drosophila</i> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) in particular has been a valuable tool for studying complex traits, but proper harmonization and indexing of DGRP phenotyping data is necessary to fully capitalize on this resource. To address this, we created a web tool called <i>DGRPool</i> (<a href="https://dgrpool.epfl.ch/">dgrpool.epfl.ch</a>), which aggregates phenotyping data of 1034 phenotypes across 135 DGRP studies in a common environment. DGRPool enables users to download data and run various tools such as genome-wide (GWAS) and phenome-wide (PheWAS) association studies. As a proof-of-concept, DGRPool was used to study the longevity phenotype and uncovered both established and unexpected correlations with other phenotypes such as locomotor activity, starvation resistance, desiccation survival, and oxidative stress resistance. DGRPool has the potential to facilitate new genetic and molecular insights of complex traits in <i>Drosophila</i> and serve as a valuable, interactive tool for the scientific community.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93369">Working memory gating in obesity is moderated by striatal dopaminergic gene variants</a></h4>

              
                Everyday life requires an adaptive balance between distraction-resistant maintenance of information and the flexibility to update this information when needed. These opposing mechanisms are proposed to be balanced through a working memory gating mechanism. Prior research indicates that obesity may elevate the risk of working memory deficits, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Dopaminergic alterations have emerged as a potential mediator. However, current models suggest these alterations should only shift the balance in working memory tasks, not produce overall deficits. The empirical support for this notion is currently lacking, however. To address this gap, we pooled data from three studies (N = 320) where participants performed a working memory gating task. Higher BMI was associated with overall poorer working memory, irrespective of whether there was a need to maintain or update information. However, when participants, in addition to BMI level, were categorized based on certain putative dopamine-signaling characteristics (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]; specifically, Taq1A and DARPP-32), distinct working memory gating effects emerged. These SNPs, primarily associated with striatal dopamine transmission, appear to be linked with differences in updating, specifically, among high-BMI individuals. Moreover, blood amino acid ratio, which indicates central dopamine synthesis capacity, combined with BMI shifted the balance between distractor-resistant maintenance and updating. These findings suggest that both dopamine-dependent and dopamine-independent cognitive effects exist in obesity. Understanding these effects is crucial if we aim to modify maladaptive cognitive profiles in individuals with obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103355">Distinct trafficking routes of polarized and non-polarized membrane cargoes in Aspergillus nidulans</a></h4>

              
                Membrane proteins are sorted to the plasma membrane (PM) via Golgi-dependent trafficking. However, our recent studies challenged the essentiality of Golgi in the biogenesis of specific transporters. Here, we investigate the trafficking mechanisms of membrane proteins by following the localization of the polarized R-SNARE SynA versus the non-polarized transporter UapA, synchronously co-expressed in wild-type or isogenic genetic backgrounds repressible for conventional cargo secretion. In wild-type, the two cargoes dynamically label distinct secretory compartments, highlighted by the finding that, unlike SynA, UapA does not colocalize with the late-Golgi. In line with early partitioning into distinct secretory carriers, the two cargoes collapse in distinct ERES in a <i>sec31</i><sup>ts</sup> background. Trafficking via distinct cargo-specific carriers is further supported by showing that repression of proteins essential for conventional cargo secretion does not affect UapA trafficking, while blocking SynA secretion. Overall, this work establishes the existence of distinct, cargo-dependent, trafficking mechanisms, initiating at ERES and being differently dependent on Golgi and SNARE interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95453">Proteogenomic analysis of air-pollution-associated lung cancer reveals prevention and therapeutic opportunities</a></h4>

              
                Air pollution significantly impacts lung cancer progression, but there is a lack of a comprehensive molecular characterization of clinical samples associated with air pollution. Here, we performed a proteogenomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in 169 female never-smokers from the Xuanwei area (XWLC cohort), where coal smoke is the primary contributor to the high lung cancer incidence. Genomic mutation analysis revealed XWLC as a distinct subtype of LUAD separate from cases associated with smoking or endogenous factors. Mutational signature analysis suggested that Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is the major risk factor in XWLC. The BaP-induced mutation hotspot, EGFR-G719X, was present in 20% of XWLC which endowed XWLC with elevated MAPK pathway activations and worse outcomes compared to common <i>EGFR</i> mutations. Multi-omics clustering of XWLC identified four clinically relevant subtypes. These subgroups exhibited distinct features in biological processes, genetic alterations, metabolism demands, immune landscape, and radiomic features. Finally, <i>MAD1 and TPRN</i> were identified as novel potential therapeutic targets in XWLC. Our study provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians to explore prevention and treatment strategies for air-pollution-associated lung cancers.

	<p>Background/Objectives: One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the accumulation of aggregated beta-amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;) protein in the form of senile plaques within brain tissue. Senile plaques contain various post-translational modifications of A&amp;amp;beta;, including prevalent isomerization of Asp7 residue. The Asp7 isomer has been shown to exhibit increased neurotoxicity and induce amyloidogenesis in brain tissue of transgenic mice. The toxicity of A&amp;amp;beta; peptides may be partly mediated by their structure and morphology. In this respect, in this study we analyzed the structural and aggregation characteristics of the Asp7 isoform of A&amp;amp;beta;42 and compared them to those of synthetic A&amp;amp;beta;42. We also investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of these peptides, a method often used to induce AD-like symptoms in rodent models. Methods: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to compare the morphological and aggregation properties of A&amp;amp;beta;42 and Asp7 iso-A&amp;amp;beta;42. The effects of i.c.v. stereotaxic administration of the proteins were assessed via behavioral analysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) estimation in vivo using a scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module. Results: AFM measurements revealed structural differences between the two peptides, most notably in their soluble toxic oligomeric forms. The i.c.v. administration of Asp7 iso-A&amp;amp;beta;42 induced spatial memory deficits in rats and elevated oxidative stress levels in vivo, suggesting a potential of ROS in the pathogenic mechanism of the peptide. Conclusions: The findings support the further investigation of Asp7 iso-A&amp;amp;beta;42 in translational research on AD and suggest its involvement in neurodegenerative processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Supporting the mental well-being of students through their educational journey is of vital importance. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between metacognition, personality traits, and various factors affecting mental health in a cohort of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) students. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study involved a self-administered questionnaire (distributed in October to November 2020) that gathered demographic information and included six scales measuring personality characteristics, health literacy, self-management skills, exercise habits (benefits and barriers), cognitive thinking, and cognitive deliberateness and impulsivity. Results: A cohort of 195 PT and OT students participated in the study. The findings revealed significant associations between metacognition and personality, particularly the association between low cognitive self-confidence and high emotional instability. This link suggests that students who struggle with cognitive self-confidence may also experience greater emotional instability, highlighting a need for targeted mental health support. Additionally, health literacy was negatively correlated with anxiety, while metacognition was positively correlated with perceived exercise benefits. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of individualized metacognitive approaches to support students&amp;amp;rsquo; mental well-being. Interventions should focus on strengthening cognitive self-confidence through methods such as resilience training, cognitive restructuring, and mindfulness practices to help manage emotional instability. Furthermore, promoting physical activity, particularly among female students, and incorporating gender-specific strategies could enhance mental health outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The dysregulation of the hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis has been associated with various mental disorders. One of the most commonly described parameters of HPA axis functioning is the cortisol awakening response (CAR). To date, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between personality disorders and CAR. The present study aimed to compare the CAR between individuals with personality disorders and healthy controls. Moreover, the study aimed to assess the association of CAR with cognitive biases and psychopathological symptoms in people with personality disorders. Methods: A total of 43 individuals with personality disorders and 45 healthy controls were enrolled. Participants completed questionnaires measuring the severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive biases, and psychotic-like experiences. Cortisol levels were measured in four morning saliva samples: immediately after awakening, and after 15, 30, and 45 min. Results: A significantly lower CAR was found among individuals with personality disorders, even after adjustment for age, sex, and the level of education. However, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed a relatively low area under the curve (AUC = 0.362). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between the CAR and the level of external attribution bias among individuals with personality disorders. No significant associations of the CAR with psychopathological symptoms and other cognitive biases were observed. Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate that the HPA axis activity might be altered in personality disorders. However, the clinical utility of this observation needs further studies in larger samples. External attribution might be related to the HPA axis alterations in this population.</p>

<p>Previous studies have observed liver abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. This study aimed to investigate whether early signs of liver disease, measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived iron-corrected T1-mapping (cT1), are risk factors for developing ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cT1 and proton density fat fraction were measured and automatically analyzed using LiverMultiScan® software. The Fibrosis-4 index was calculated using an established formula based on age and blood markers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between liver disease, liver biomarkers, and incident ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 533,707 individuals from UK Biobank, 24 ALS cases were identified among 28,328 participants with liver disease during the follow-up period. Among a total of 33,959 individuals with complete liver imaging data, 15 incident ALS cases were observed during a median follow-up period of 5.6 years. Individuals with liver disease had a higher risk of developing ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.35 (95% CI 4.47–12.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in cT1 was also associated with a higher risk of ALS. After adjusting for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, body mass index, proton density fat fraction, Fibrosis-4, and metabolic syndrome, an increase in cT1 remained significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.79–5.55) per 1-SD increase. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these robust results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Liver disease activity, indicated by cT1, increases the risk of developing ALS, independent of metabolic syndrome, liver fat, or fibrosis. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Changes in nuclear morphology, alterations to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), including loss, aggregation, and dysfunction of nucleoporins (Nups), and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) abnormalities have become hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous RNA sequencing data utilizing knockdown of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) identified enrichment for pathways and changes in RNAs related to nuclear morphology and showed differential expression of key nuclear targets. This suggests that dysfunction of hnRNP A1, which is observed in neurodegenerative diseases, may contribute to abnormalities in nuclear morphology, NPC, and NCT. Methods: We performed knockdown of hnRNP A1 in Neuro-2A cells, a neuronal cell line, to examine nuclear morphology, NPC, and NCT. Results: First, we examined nuclear morphology using Lamin B, wherein we observed increased nuclear envelope abnormalities in cells with hnRNP A1 knockdown as compared to control. To quantify changes in Lamin B, we designed and validated an automated computer-based model, which quantitatively confirmed our observations. Next, we investigated the impact of hnRNP A1 knockdown on components of the NPC and NCT. In line with the previous literature, we found changes in Nups, including altered distribution and reduced protein expression, as well as disrupted NCT. Finally, we validated our findings in multiple sclerosis (MS) brains, a disease with a significant neurodegenerative component caused by hnRNP A1 dysfunction, where neuronal nuclear envelope alterations were significantly increased as compared to controls. Conclusions: Together, these data implicate hnRNP A1 as an important contributor to nuclear morphology, Nup expression and distribution, and NCT and suggest that hnRNP A1 dysfunction may lead to defects in these processes in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cranioplasty (CP) is the main surgical procedure aiming to repair a morphological defect in the skull. It has been shown that early CP is useful for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to achieve functional recovery, whereas few studies have investigated the clinical effects of ultra-late CP on TBI outcomes. Methods: Here, we describe the clinical course over 2 years of a TBI patient who underwent CP 19 months after fronto-parietal decompressive craniectomy (DC) of a limited size. Results: We found that after ultra-late CP, a meaningful functional recovery (cognitive and motor), with emergence from a minimally conscious state and recovery of functional communication, was revealed. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings contribute to the actual debate on the timing of CP for this neurosurgical procedure&amp;amp;rsquo;s therapeutic success, as early CP has already been shown.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Internet addiction (IA) and related behaviors, such as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and social media addiction (SMA), have gained increasing research attention. Studies show gender differences, with males more likely to develop gaming-related addictions and females more prone to social media and phubbing behaviors. This study aimed to explore gender differences in Internet addiction and related behaviors in a Spanish sample, with the goal of identifying predictors and gender-specific patterns of IA. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 585 participants (265 male, 320 female) aged 18 to 35 years (M = 22.11, SD = 3.08). Data were collected using standardized questionnaires to assess IA, IGD, SMA, phubbing, Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), emotional dysregulation, personality traits, and prosociality. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify gender-specific predictors of IA. Results: Males exhibited significantly higher scores for IA and IGD, while females showed higher scores for SMA and the &amp;amp;ldquo;phone obsession&amp;amp;rdquo; dimension of phubbing. No significant gender differences were found in the &amp;amp;ldquo;communication disturbance&amp;amp;rdquo; dimension of phubbing or in FoMO. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between IA and psychological as well as technological variables. Gender-specific predictors of IA included social media engagement and emotional regulation for females, while gaming behaviors and communication patterns were more relevant for males. Conclusions: These findings highlight gender differences in IA, suggesting that tailored interventions should address unique online behaviors and emotional regulation challenges in males and females. Future research should refine gender-specific patterns to develop more effective, targeted prevention and treatment strategies.</p>

                Background Spin-offs play a significant role in organizational development strategies, particularly in Islamic banking, by fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and Shariah-compliant management practices. Indonesia stands as a pioneer in implementing the dual banking system and has established a spin-off policy to foster the growth of Islamic banking. This study investigates whether the spin-off decision has a significant impact on financing risk in Indonesian Islamic banks. Methods Financing risk is measured by the non-performing financing ratio, while the spin-off decision is represented by a dummy variable equal to 1 for the post-spin-off period and 0 for the pre-spin-off period. This study utilizes data from semi-annual reports of 35 Indonesian Islamic banks and analyzes it using a dynamic panel model with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Results The findings reveal that spin-offs significantly reduce financing risk, thereby enhancing the financial resilience and boosting investor appeal. Notably, this implies that Islamic banks operating as Islamic windows exhibit a higher level of financing risk compared to fully-fledged Islamic banks. Furthermore, a noteworthy pattern emerges that spin-off Islamic banks with substantial assets demonstrate greater risk in comparison to their counterparts with more modest assets. System GMM also confirmed the result. Conclusions Islamic banks can significantly reduce their financing risks by establishing independent Islamic banks, or spin-offs. Unlike Islamic windows, which are typically integrated within conventional banks and face higher risk levels, standalone Islamic banks offer greater flexibility and control over their operations.

                Background Physical activity plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of older adults, positively influencing various aspects of their quality of life. This study aims to explore the relationship between physical activity and body segments, as well as the risk indices of non-communicable chronic diseases in healthy elderly individuals. Methods The analyzed variables include weekly physical activity, the Postural Correction Index (PCI), measured using the system developed by Portland State University (PSU), and predictors of non-communicable chronic diseases assessed through body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio. Results The results reveal a moderate positive relationship between physical activity and the PCI (r=0.45; p≤0.05), with significant correlations in specific components of the PCI, such as thoracic depression (r=0.51; p<0.01), anteroposterior shoulder alignment (r=0.51; p<0.01), and upper back (r=0.53; p<0.001). Conclusions It is concluded that physical activity has a significant positive impact on the posture of older adults, particularly in the trunk, contributing 40% to the improvement of PCI components. The PCI values obtained, exceeding 82.67 in men and 84.67 in women according to the PSU evaluation, underscore the effectiveness of physical activity in postural correction and the prevention of issues associated with chronic diseases.

                <p>by Ted Moskovitz, Kevin J. Miller, Maneesh Sahani, Matthew M. Botvinick</p>

Dual-process theories play a central role in both psychology and neuroscience, figuring prominently in domains ranging from executive control to reward-based learning to judgment and decision making. In each of these domains, two mechanisms appear to operate concurrently, one relatively high in computational complexity, the other relatively simple. Why is neural information processing organized in this way? We propose an answer to this question based on the notion of compression. The key insight is that dual-process structure can enhance adaptive behavior by allowing an agent to minimize the description length of its own behavior. We apply a single model based on this observation to findings from research on executive control, reward-based learning, and judgment and decision making, showing that seemingly diverse dual-process phenomena can be understood as domain-specific consequences of a single underlying set of computational principles.

                <p>by Rakesh Maharjan, Zhemin Zhang, Philip A. Klenotic, William D. Gregor, Marios L. Tringides, Meng Cui, Georgiana E. Purdy, Edward W. Yu</p>

The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) pathogen, the causative agent of the airborne infection tuberculosis (TB), harbors a number of mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) transporters. These membrane proteins can be separated into 2 distinct subclasses, where they perform important functional roles, and thus, are considered potential drug targets to combat TB. Previously, we reported both X-ray and cryo-EM structures of the MmpL3 transporter, providing high-resolution structural information for this subclass of the MmpL proteins. Currently, there is no structural information available for the subclass associated with MmpL4 and MmpL5, transporters that play a critical role in iron homeostasis of the bacterium. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the <i>M</i>. <i>smegmatis</i> MmpL4 and MmpL5 transporters to resolutions of 2.95 Å and 3.00 Å, respectively. These structures allow us to propose a plausible pathway for siderophore translocation via these 2 transporters, an essential step for iron acquisition that enables the survival and replication of the mycobacterium.

Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins can engage in complex interactions to detect pathogens and execute a robust immune response via downstream helper NLRs. However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 from <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher-order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The cryo-EM structure of NbNRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation and contribute to immune receptor autoinhibition. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways, possibly to minimise undesired cross-activation and evade pathogen suppression of immunity. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Clemastine has emerged as a promising therapy for the restoration of neurologic function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, clemastine and other agents with prodifferentiative effects on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in rodent models have underperformed in clinical trials. We hypothesized that the preclinical studies showed more robust effects because of the abundance of OPCs in rodent models. To better examine the therapeutic potential of clemastine, we examined its effect on demyelinated white matter lesions in rabbits, which exhibit progenitor densities and limited remyelination more closely matching those found in tissues from patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used lysolecithin to induce demyelination in white matter of New Zealand rabbits and then administered oral clemastine (10mg/kg/day) for various periods before assessing the OPC and oligodendrocyte (OL) populations in these lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Daily administration of clemastine for the full study period (56 days) increased oligodendrogenesis in white matter lesions. However, shorter durations of treatment failed to increase overall OL density despite enhancing OPC-to-OL differentiation. This effect was due to exhaustion of the OPC pool, as the differentiating progenitors were not replaced because of reduced OPC proliferation. Notably, delayed administration of clemastine led to an accumulation of activated OPCs expressing markers of senescence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although capable of driving OL differentiation, clemastine treatment in rabbits hampered progenitor pool replenishment, induced senescence, and promoted conversion of microglia/macrophages to a proinflammatory phenotype. Whether these effects would also occur in humans or with other prodifferentiative therapies should be studied further, but our data suggest the need to carefully consider progenitor dynamics in the treatment of MS.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the advances in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), unremitting neurodegeneration continues to drive disability and disease progression. Smoldering/slowly expanding lesions (SELs) and dysfunction of the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) are pathologic hallmarks of MS cortex and intricately tied to disability and neurodegeneration, respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and is exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization of hnRNP A1) was examined in healthy control and MS brains using immunohistochemistry. MS cases were stratified by severity of hnRNP A1 pathology to examine the link between RBP dysfunction, demyelination, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that smoldering/SELs were only present within a subset of MS tissues characterized by elevated neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup>) in adjacent cortical gray matter. In contrast to healthy controls and MS with low hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>low</i>
</sup>), MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> showed elevated markers of neurodegeneration, including neuronal loss and injury, brain atrophy, axonal loss, and axon degeneration. Additionally, we discovered a subpopulation of morphologically intact neurons lacking expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific RBP, in cortical projection neurons in MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and may be exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS. The discovery of NeuN-negative neurons suggests that some cortical neurons may only be injured and not lost. By characterizing RBP pathology in MS cortex, this study has important implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, the substrate of disability and disease progression.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early life, or juvenility, stands out as the most pivotal phase in neurodevelopment due to its profound impact over the long-term cognition. During this period, significant changes are made in the brain's connections both within and between different areas, particularly in tandem with the development of more intricate behaviors. The hippocampus is among the brain regions that undergo significant postnatal remodeling, including dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, the formation of complex spines and neuron proliferation. Given the crucial role of the hippocampus in spatial memory processing, it has been observed that spatial memory abilities continue to develop as the hippocampus matures, particularly before puberty. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor channel is crucial for the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation in both rodents and humans. Although extensive evidence shows the role of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, the studies addressing the role of NMDAr in spatial memory of juveniles are sparse and mostly limited to adult males. In the present study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMDAr blockade by the MK-801 on spatial memory (novel object location memory, OLM) and hippocampal plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of both male and female juvenile rats. Our results show the sex-dimorphic role of NMDAr in spatial memory and plasticity during juvenility, as systemic NMDAr blockade impairs the OLM and LTP in juvenile males without an effect on juvenile females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity are NMDAr-dependent in juvenile males and NMDAr-independent in juvenile females. These sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of spatial memory and plasticity may imply gender-specific treatment for spatial memory disorders even in children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23633?af=R">Estrogens dynamically regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition. How they influence the maturation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, however, is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on the maturation timeline of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized (a model of surgical menopause) young adult Sprague–Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17β-estradiol, estrone or vehicle. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BrdU injection and daily hormone treatment. Brains were sectioned and processed for various markers including: sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), antigen kiel 67 (Ki67), doublecortin (DCX), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Immunofluorescent labeling or co-labelling of BrdU with Sox2 (progenitor cells), Sox2/GFAP (neural progenitor cells), Ki67 (cell proliferation), DCX (immature neurons), NeuN (mature neurons) was used to examine the trajectory and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estrogens had early (1 week of exposure) effects on different stages of neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells, cell proliferation and early maturation of new cells into neurons) but these effects were less pronounced after prolonged treatment. Estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced cell proliferation after 1 week but not after longer exposure to either estrogen. Both estrogens increased the density of immature neurons (BrdU/DCX-ir) after 1 week of exposure compared to vehicle treatment but this increased density was not sustained over longer durations of treatments to estrogens, suggesting that the enhancing effects of estrogens on neurogenesis were short-lived. Longer duration post-ovariectomy, without treatments with either of the estrogens, was associated with reduced neural progenitor cells in the DG. These results demonstrate that estrogens modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently in the short term, but may lose their ability to influence neurogenesis after long-term exposure. These findings have potential implications for treatments involving estrogens after surgical menopause.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1 KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23632?af=R">Spatial memory encoding is associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampus: An fMRI activation likelihood estimation meta‐analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that differential processing occurs along the longitudinal (anterior–posterior) axis of the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that spatial memory (during both encoding and retrieval) is associated with the posterior hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis is that memory encoding (either spatial or nonspatial) is associated with the anterior hippocampus and memory retrieval is associated with the posterior hippocampus. Of importance, during spatial memory encoding, the spatial–posterior hypothesis predicts posterior hippocampal involvement, whereas the encoding–retrieval hypothesis predicts anterior hippocampal involvement. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted a coordinate-based fMRI activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 26 studies (with a total of 435 participants) that reported hippocampal activity during spatial memory encoding and/or spatial memory retrieval. Both spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced extensive activity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the contrast of spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced activations in both the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus. That spatial memory encoding produced activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus can be taken to reject strict forms of the spatial–posterior hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of spatial memory produce activity in the posterior hippocampus, and the encoding–retrieval hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of encoding versus retrieval produce activity in only the anterior hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory encoding can involve the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23635?af=R">Time cells in the retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a key component of the brain's memory systems, with anatomical connections to the hippocampus, anterior thalamus, and entorhinal cortex. This circuit has been implicated in episodic memory and many of these structures have been shown to encode temporal information, which is critical for episodic memory. For example, hippocampal time cells reliably fire during specific segments of time during a delay period. Although RSC lesions are known to disrupt temporal memory, time cells have not been observed there. In this study, we reanalyzed archival RSC neuronal firing data during the intertrial delay period from two previous experiments involving different behavioral tasks, a blocked alternation task and a cued T-maze task. For the blocked alternation task, rats were required to approach the east or west arm of a plus maze for reward during different blocks of trials. Because the reward locations were not cued, the rat had to remember the goal location for each trial. In the cued T-maze task, the reward location was explicitly cued with a light and the rats simply had to approach the light for reward, so there was no requirement to hold a memory during the intertrial delay. Time cells were prevalent in the blocked alternation task, and most time cells clearly differentiated the east and west trials. We also found that RSC neurons could exhibit off-response time fields, periods of reliably inhibited firing. Time cells were also observed in the cued T-maze, but they were less prevalent and they did not differentiate left and right trials as well as in the blocked alternation task, suggesting that RSC time cells are sensitive to the memory demands of the task. These results suggest that temporal coding is a prominent feature of RSC firing patterns, consistent with an RSC role in episodic memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23637?af=R">Curved multiplanar reformatting allows the accurate histological delineation of hippocampal subfields</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields perform specific roles in normal cognitive functioning and have distinct vulnerabilities in neurological disorders. However, measurement of subfields with MRI is technically difficult in the head and tail of the hippocampus. Recent studies have utilized curved multiplanar reconstruction (CMPR) to improve subfield visualization in the head and tail, but this method has not yet been applied to histological data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized BigBrain data, an open-source database of serially sectioned histological data for our analyses. The left hippocampus was segmented according to histological criteria by two raters in order to evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability of histology-based segmentation throughout the long axis. Segmentation according to our previous protocol for the hippocampal body was then compared to these histological measurements to evaluate for histological validity. Agreement between segmentations was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intra-rater reliability (DSCs) of histological segmentation was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8599), CA2 (0.7586), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8907), SLM (0.9123), subiculum (0.8149). Similarly, inter-rater reliability analysis demonstrated excellent agreement (DSCs) for all subfield locations: CA1 (0.8203), CA2 (0.7253), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8439), SLM (0.8700), subiculum (0.7794). Finally, histological accuracy (DSCs) for our previous protocol was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8821), CA2 (0.8810), CA3/CA4/DG (0.9802), SLM (0.9879), subiculum (0.8774). When subfields in the hippocampus head, body, and tail were analyzed independently, DSCs also showed excellent agreement.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>CMPR allows reliable subfield segmentation based on histological criteria throughout the hippocampal head, body, and tail. Our previous protocol for the hippocampal body can be applied to provide histologically valid subfield measurements throughout the entire hippocampal long axis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subregions using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a confined border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct whole-brain connectivity profiles. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A key question for understanding the function of the hippocampus in memory is how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. This was investigated in a neuronal network model of the hippocampal system in which “What” and “Where” neuronal firing rate vectors were applied to separate neocortical modules, which then activated entorhinal cortex “What” and “Where” modules, then the dentate gyrus, then CA3, then CA1, then the entorhinal cortex, and then the backprojections to the neocortex. A rate model showed that the whole system could be trained to recall “Where” in the neocortex from “What” applied as a retrieval cue to the neocortex, and could in principle be trained up towards the theoretical capacity determined largely by the number of synapses onto any one neuron divided by the sparseness of the representation. The trained synaptic weights were then imported into an integrate-and-fire simulation of the same architecture, which showed that the time from presenting a retrieval cue to a neocortex module to recall the whole memory in the neocortex is approximately 100 ms. This is sufficiently fast for the backprojection synapses to be trained onto the still active neocortical neurons during storage of the episodic memory, and this is needed for recall to operate correctly to the neocortex. These simulations also showed that the long loop neocortex–hippocampus–neocortex that operates continuously in time may contribute to complete recall in the neocortex; but that this positive feedback long loop makes the whole dynamical system inherently liable to a pathological increase in neuronal activity. Important factors that contributed to stability included increased inhibition in CA3 and CA1 to keep the firing rates low; and temporal adaptation of the neuronal firing and of active synapses, which are proposed to make an important contribution to stabilizing runaway excitation in cortical circuits in the brain.</p>

A study to evaluate the practicality of using plants in reducing formaldehyde levels [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Formaldehyde a commonly used embalming fluid for the preservation of cadavers, produces numerous short and long-term side effects on the students and staff working with it. Indoor plants have been shown to reduce atmospheric formaldehyde levels. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air to levels deemed safe by WHO standards Methods The study was conducted in the storage room of the Anatomical dissection hall. 7 potted plants of one variety were kept in the storage room for 14 days and the Formaldehyde reading was measured using a VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) monitor. Then the same was done with no plant. This cycle was repeated 2 more times, with two different plant species. The three spieces of plants used for this study were as follows: Dracaena trifasciata, Epipremnum aureum, Spathiphyllum. Results The results were analysed and compared and it was determined that the effect of having a plant present versus having no plant present on the Formaldehyde concentration in the air was inconclusive as Dracaena trifasciata failed to reject the null hypothesis altogether (p-value>0.05), while Epipremnum aureum and Spathiphyllum rejected the null hypothesis (p-value<0.05), however they both had a weak positive correlation with formaldehyde concentration. Conclusion The efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air needs to be further explored and validated since all the prior studies conducted were in controlled environment and should be done in a real time scenario for its practical and beneficial uses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-304/v2?src=rss">Knowledge and Attitude of self-medication with leftover antibiotics in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Antimicrobial resistance is increasing at an alarming rate. The use of antibiotics without a prescription by a patient or other family members and their inappropriate storage have caused serious health issues as it would lead to antibiotic resistance and exposure to the risk of harmful adverse effects unnecessarily. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the current behaviour of antibiotic usage, storage, re-usage and misuse among the residents of Saudi Arabia. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. Our target study population was the residents of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected by an online questionnaire and analysed by SPSS. Results A total of 738 participants answered the online questionnaire from all ages, genders, nationalities, and socioeconomic backgrounds residing in different regions across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 76.42% knew that an antibiotic is a chemical substance used to treat infections. The participants were questioned about when they started using antibiotics, to which 95.66% (n=706) responded after consulting a physician, 3.25% (n=24) said when they felt ill for any reason, and 1.08% (n=8) replied after first attempting herbal medicine. A total of 147 participants admitted that they store excess pills of antibiotics after being prescribed for an infection and reuse them later on for symptoms like sore throat and fever. Conclusions The results indicated that nearly half of the participants used leftover antibiotics. Participants having children in their homes significantly reuse antibiotics. However, one-third of the participants didn’t complete the antibiotics course. A large portion of the population, regardless of age, level of education, or professional background, have continued to store leftover antibiotics after an infection treatment and reuse them once they think they need them for new symptoms. This advice further revises the current measures to fill those gaps and reduce this habit.
