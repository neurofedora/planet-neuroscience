              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70037?af=R">Changes in Naturalistic Viewing in Healthy Aging and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Visual exploration—where the eyes move and when—is guided by prior experiences. Memory-guided viewing behavior is altered in healthy aging and is further disrupted in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a condition in which there is accelerated structural and functional decline of the hippocampus and associated medial temporal lobe structures (HC/MTL). Computational modeling has demonstrated the potential for rapid information flow from the HC/MTL to regions responsible for the cognitive control of eye movements, such that visual exploration behavior could be impacted in the moment and on an ongoing fashion. It was predicted here, then, that older adults and individuals with aMCI would show changes in naturalistic viewing compared to younger adults, even in the absence of any memory task. Multivariate analyses revealed that viewing for younger adults was characterized by larger saccade amplitudes and a larger area of exploration; the opposite pattern was reliably expressed by individuals with aMCI. Viewing patterns of healthy older adults were associated with shorter gaze durations. The entropy of viewing in older adults was associated with overall cognitive status, as determined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, highlighting the top-down influence of cognitive function on active vision. Lower scores on the memory subtest were reliably associated with a pattern of viewing characterized by fewer fixations (with longer durations), saccades, regions explored, smaller area of exploration, and lower entropy, mimicking some of the viewing features of the aMCI group and suggesting that increasing HC/MTL decline results in less exploratory viewing patterns. These findings reveal the ongoing influence of the hippocampus and its extended system on moment-to-moment naturalistic viewing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23104">Feedback promotes efficient-coding while attenuating bias in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.23104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of human decision-making demonstrate that environmental regularities, such as natural image statistics or intentionally nonuniform stimulus probabilities, can be exploited to improve efficiency (termed `efficient-coding'). Conversely, from a machine learning perspective, such nonuniform stimulus properties can lead to biased neural networks with poor generalization performance. Understanding how the brain flexibly leverages stimulus bias while maintaining robust generalization could lead to novel architectures that adaptively exploit environmental structure without sacrificing performance on out-of-distribution data. To address this disconnect, we investigated the impact of stimulus regularities in a 3-layer hierarchical continuous-time recurrent neural network (ctRNN) to better understand how artificial networks might exploit statistical regularities to improve efficiency while avoiding undesirable biases. We trained the model to reproduce one of six possible inputs under biased conditions (stimulus 1 more probable than stimuli 2-6) or unbiased conditions (all stimuli equally likely). Across all hidden layers, more information was encoded about high-probability stimuli, consistent with the efficient-coding framework. Importantly, reducing feedback from the final hidden layer of trained models selectively magnified representations of high-probability stimuli, at the expense of low-probability stimuli, across all layers. Together, these results suggest that models exploit nonuniform input statistics to improve efficiency, and that feedback pathways evolve to protect the processing of low-probability stimuli by regulating the impact of biased input statistics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23333">Targeted perturbations reveal brain-like local coding axes in robustified, but not standard, ANN-based brain models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.23333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures. Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23342">Consciousness Self and Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.23342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories of consciousness depend on data, and it needs to be appropriate data, without overwhelming confounding factors. The reports of Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE) in [Metzinger 2024] relate to consciousness in a state purer than everyday consciousness, which may have fewer confounding factors. This essay suggests that the confounding factors, which are absent or diminished in MPE states, are related to language. The self which is absent in mindful states is a product of language. The link between language and MPE states is demonstrated by reference to the phenomenal reports in [Metzinger 2024]. Language, emotion, and mindfulness are analysed in terms of Bayesian pattern matching, or equivalently minimisation of Free Energy, using three types of pattern which are specific to humans. These types are the word patterns of language, self-patterns which drive our emotions and which are also a part of language, and mindful patterns. The practice of mindfulness involves learning mindful patterns, which compete with self-patterns and displace them, allowing mindful states to occur. Consequences of this picture for theories of consciousness, and their relation to MPE states, are explored.

                arXiv:2509.23479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social communication fundamentally involves at least two interacting brains, creating a unique modeling problem. We present the first application of Contrastive Embedding for Behavioral and Neural Analysis (CEBRA) to dyadic EEG hyperscanning data, extending modeling paradigms to interpersonal neural dynamics. Using structured social interactions between participants, we demonstrate that CEBRA can learn meaningful representations of joint neural activity that captures individual roles (speaker-listener) and other behavioral metrics. Our approach to characterizing interactions, as opposed to individual neural responses to stimuli, addresses the key principles of foundational model development: scalability and cross-subject generalization, opening new directions for representation learning in social neuroscience and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23524">EEG-Based Framework for Reflexive and Perceptual Assessment in CLIS: Preliminary Study in Healthy Volunteers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.23524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the general assumption that completely locked-in state (CLIS) patients remain conscious and aware of their environment, the effectiveness of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in facilitating communication has been limited, as reported both in the literature and in our own findings. This limitation is likely attributable to impairments in executive functions, working memory, and vigilance, which appear to hinder the establishment of reliable BCI-based communication. The main goal of this research is to develop a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs. To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Pilot testing with five healthy participants demonstrates the feasibility of generating a neurophysiological report for cognitive assessment at both levels.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24039">End-to-end Topographic Auditory Models Replicate Signatures of Human Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.24039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models, TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to achieve biologically aligned representations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24693">Brain Harmony: A Multimodal Foundation Model Unifying Morphology and Function into 1D Tokens</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.24693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Brain Harmony (BrainHarmonix), the first multimodal brain foundation model that unifies structural morphology and functional dynamics into compact 1D token representations. The model was pretrained on two of the largest neuroimaging datasets to date, encompassing 64,594 T1-weighted structural MRI 3D volumes (~ 14 million images) and 70,933 functional MRI (fMRI) time series. BrainHarmonix is grounded in two foundational neuroscience principles: structure complements function - structural and functional modalities offer distinct yet synergistic insights into brain organization; function follows structure - brain functional dynamics are shaped by cortical morphology. The modular pretraining process involves single-modality training with geometric pre-alignment followed by modality fusion through shared brain hub tokens. Notably, our dynamics encoder uniquely handles fMRI time series with heterogeneous repetition times (TRs), addressing a major limitation in existing models. BrainHarmonix is also the first to deeply compress high-dimensional neuroimaging signals into unified, continuous 1D tokens, forming a compact latent space of the human brain. BrainHarmonix achieves strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder classification and cognition prediction - consistently outperforming previous approaches. Our models - pretrained on 8 H100 GPUs - aim to catalyze a new era of AI-driven neuroscience powered by large-scale multimodal neuroimaging.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24715">Dark Signals in the Brain: Augment Brain Network Dynamics to the Complex-valued Field</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.24715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recordings of brain activity, such as functional MRI (fMRI), provide low-dimensional, indirect observations of neural dynamics evolving in high-dimensional, unobservable spaces. Embedding observed brain dynamics into a higher-dimensional representation may help reveal functional organization, but precisely how remains unclear. Hamiltonian mechanics suggests that, by introducing an additional dimension of conjugate momenta, the dynamical behaviour of a conservative system can be formulated in a more compact and mathematically elegant manner. Here we develop a physics-informed, data-driven framework that lifts whole-brain activity to the complex-valued field. Specifically, we augment observed signals (generalized coordinates) with latent ``dark signals'' that play the role of conjugate momenta in a whole-brain Hamiltonian system. We show that the Hilbert transform provides an augmentation approach with optimal fitting accuracy within this framework, yielding a Schr\"odinger-like equation governing complex-valued, augmented brain dynamics. Empirically, this complex-valued model consistently outperforms its real-valued counterpart, improving short-horizon prediction in the linear regime (correlation 0.12$\to$0.82) and achieving superior fits under nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics (0.47$\to$0.88). The framework strengthens structure-function coupling, recovers hierarchical intrinsic timescales, and yields biologically plausible directed effective connectivity that varies systematically with age and reconfigures from rest to task via global rescaling plus targeted rewiring. Together, these results establish a principled, testable paradigm for network neuroscience and offer transformative insight into the spatiotemporal organization and functional roles of large-scale brain dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23195">Estimating the strength and timing of syntactic structure building in naturalistic reading</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.23195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads, suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to -10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences, supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction, and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static, non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended, natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation. These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible interfaces between brain activity and language.

                arXiv:2509.24919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure. This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in neuroscience and beyond.

                arXiv:2505.03919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dravet syndrome is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by the early onset of drug-resistant seizures and various comorbidities. Most cases of this severe and complex pathology are due to mutations of NaV1.1, a sodium channel mainly expressed in fast-spiking inhibitory neurons. Layer et al. (Front. Cell. Neurosci. 15, 2021) showed that one of these mutations alters the voltage dependence of channel activation, as well as the voltage dependence and kinetics of slow inactivation. Implementing the three effects into a computational model, they predict that altered activation has the largest impact on channel function, as it causes the most severe firing rate reduction. Using a conductance-based model tailored to the dynamics of fast-spiking inhibitory neurons, we look deeper into slow inactivation. We exploit the timescale difference between this very slow process and the rest of the system to conduct a multiple-timescale analysis. We find that, upon prolonged stimulation, the onset of slow inactivation at lower voltage in mutant channels promotes depolarization block, another possible firing deficit aside from frequency reduction. The accelerated kinetics of slow inactivation in mutant channels hastens this transition. This suggests that slow inactivation alterations might for some Dravet variant contribute to the pathological mechanism.

Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

                arXiv:2508.01992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer~(ST)-based models require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs, thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.

                arXiv:2501.06762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous, adaptive learning-the ability to adapt to the environment and improve performance-is a hallmark of both natural and artificial intelligence. Biological organisms excel in acquiring, transferring, and retaining knowledge while adapting to dynamic environments, making them a rich source of inspiration for artificial neural networks (ANNs). This study explores how neuromodulation, a fundamental feature of biological learning systems, can help address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and enhance the robustness of ANNs in continuous learning scenarios. Driven by neuromodulators including dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA), neuromodulatory processes in the brain operate at multiple scales, facilitating dynamic responses to environmental changes through mechanisms ranging from local synaptic plasticity to global network-wide adaptability. Importantly, the relationship between neuromodulators, and their interplay in the modulation of sensory and cognitive processes are more complex than expected, demonstrating a "many-to-one" neuromodulator-to-task mapping. To inspire the design of novel neuromodulation-aware learning rules, we highlight (i) how multi-neuromodulatory interactions enrich single-neuromodulator-driven learning, (ii) the impact of neuromodulators at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and correspondingly, (iii) strategies to integrate neuromodulated learning into or approximate it in ANNs. To illustrate these principles, we present a case study to demonstrate how neuromodulation-inspired mechanisms, such as DA-driven reward processing and NA-based cognitive flexibility, can enhance ANN performance in a Go/No-Go task. By integrating multi-scale neuromodulation, we aim to bridge the gap between biological learning and artificial systems, paving the way for ANNs with greater flexibility, robustness, and adaptability.

                arXiv:2509.04633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.

                arXiv:2509.23253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention as a central paradigm in neuromorphic computing, owing to their energy efficiency and biological plausibility. However, training deep SNNs has critically depended on explicit normalization schemes, such as batch normalization, leading to a trade-off between performance and biological realism. To resolve this conflict, we propose a normalization-free learning framework that incorporates lateral inhibition inspired by cortical circuits. Our framework replaces the traditional feedforward SNN layer with a circuit of distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that complies with Dale's law. The circuit dynamically regulates neuronal activity through subtractive and divisive inhibition, which respectively control the activity and the gain of excitatory neurons. To enable and stabilize end-to-end training of the biologically constrained SNN, we propose two key techniques: E-I Init and E-I Prop. E-I Init is a dynamic parameter initialization scheme that balances excitatory and inhibitory inputs while performing gain control. E-I Prop decouples the backpropagation of the E-I circuits from the forward propagation and regulates gradient flow. Experiments across several datasets and network architectures demonstrate that our framework enables stable training of deep SNNs with biological realism and achieves competitive performance without resorting to explicit normalizations. Therefore, our work not only provides a solution to training deep SNNs but also serves a computational platform for further exploring the functions of lateral inhibition in large-scale cortical computation.

Abstract: Radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) offers privacy and robustness over camera-based methods, yet remains computationally demanding for edge deployment. We present the first use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for radar-based HAR on aircraft marshalling signal classification. Our novel hybrid architecture combines convolutional modules for spatial feature extraction with Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for temporal processing, inherently capturing gesture dynamics. The model reduces trainable parameters by 88\% with under 1\% accuracy loss compared to baselines, and generalizes well to the Soli gesture dataset. Through systematic comparisons with Artificial Neural Networks, we demonstrate the trade-offs of spiking computation in terms of accuracy, latency, memory, and energy, establishing SNNs as an efficient and competitive solution for radar-based HAR.

                arXiv:2509.23516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event-driven computation suited to time-critical networking tasks such as anomaly detection, local routing control, and congestion management at the edge. Classical units, including Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for resource constrained deployments.

                arXiv:2509.23762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23791">CaRe-BN: Precise Moving Statistics for Stabilizing Spiking Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.23791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision-making on neuromorphic hardware by mimicking the event-driven dynamics of biological neurons. However, due to the discrete and non-differentiable nature of spikes, directly trained SNNs rely heavily on Batch Normalization (BN) to stabilize gradient updates. In online Reinforcement Learning (RL), imprecise BN statistics hinder exploitation, resulting in slower convergence and suboptimal policies. This challenge limits the adoption of SNNs for energy-efficient control on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, we propose Confidence-adaptive and Re-calibration Batch Normalization (CaRe-BN), which introduces (\emph{i}) a confidence-guided adaptive update strategy for BN statistics and (\emph{ii}) a re-calibration mechanism to align distributions. By providing more accurate normalization, CaRe-BN stabilizes SNN optimization without disrupting the RL training process. Importantly, CaRe-BN does not alter inference, thus preserving the energy efficiency of SNNs in deployment. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that CaRe-BN improves SNN performance by up to $22.6\%$ across different spiking neuron models and RL algorithms. Remarkably, SNNs equipped with CaRe-BN even surpass their ANN counterparts by $5.9\%$. These results highlight a new direction for BN techniques tailored to RL, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that are both efficient and high-performing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24411">Hybrid Layer-Wise ANN-SNN With Surrogate Spike Encoding-Decoding Structure</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.24411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However, existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions, causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new directions for future research.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models has significantly expanded global demand for computing; addressing this growing demand requires novel approaches that introduce new capabilities while addressing extant needs. Although inspiration from biological systems served as the foundation on which modern artificial intelligence (AI) was developed, many modern advances have been made without clear parallels to biological computing. As a result, the ability of techniques inspired by "natural intelligence" (NI) to inflect modern AI systems may be questioned. However, by analyzing remaining disparities between AI and NI, we argue that further biological inspiration is indeed necessary to diversify the capabilities of artificial systems and enable them to succeed in real-world environments and adapt to niche applications. To elucidate which NI mechanisms can contribute toward this goal, we review and compare elements of biological and artificial computing systems, emphasizing areas of NI that have not yet been effectively captured by AI. We then suggest areas of opportunity for NI-inspired mechanisms that can inflect AI hardware and software.

                arXiv:2509.24844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their temporal processing capabilities and biologically plausible dynamics, offer a natural platform for unsupervised representation learning. However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints, substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.

                arXiv:2509.24852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a bio-inspired alternative to conventional real-valued deep learning models, with the potential for substantially higher energy efficiency. Interest in SNNs has recently exploded due to a major breakthrough: surrogate gradient learning (SGL), which allows training SNNs with backpropagation, strongly outperforming other approaches. In SNNs, each synapse is characterized not only by a weight but also by a transmission delay. While theoretical works have long suggested that trainable delays significantly enhance expressivity, practical methods for learning them have only recently emerged. Here, we introduce ''DelRec'', the first SGL-based method to train axonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with any spiking neuron model. DelRec leverages a differentiable interpolation technique to handle non-integer delays with well-defined gradients at training time. We show that trainable recurrent delays outperform feedforward ones, leading to new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two challenging temporal datasets (Spiking Speech Command, an audio dataset, and Permuted Sequential MNIST, a vision one), and match the SOTA on the now saturated Spiking Heidelberg Digit dataset using only vanilla Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons with stateless (instantaneous) synapses. Our results demonstrate that recurrent delays are critical for temporal processing in SNNs and can be effectively optimized with DelRec, paving the way for efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware with programmable delays. Our code is available at : https://github.com/alexmaxad/DelRec.

                arXiv:2509.22849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich representations across domains such as natural language processing and generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.

Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models, advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming in educational settings.

                arXiv:2509.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models (LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.

                arXiv:2509.24372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters, was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

                arXiv:2509.24436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large language models(LLM). The models are divided into several experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

                arXiv:2504.17827v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

                arXiv:2505.11037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing multiple objective properties while satisfying structural constraints is a major challenge in 3D molecular discovery. This difficulty arises because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable and the structure-property relationship is often unknown. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used for multi-objective optimization to find Pareto fronts and can naturally handle structural constraints without any explicit modelling; however, in the 3D molecular space they lack mechanisms to guarantee chemical validity and are therefore prone to producing invalid structures. Conversely, diffusion models excel at generating chemically valid 3D molecules but typically require modifying the model and retraining to incorporate structural constraints. Moreover, diffusion models are not inherently designed for direct multi-objective optimization and struggle to explore the Pareto front of the learned property distribution - a critical capability for discovering novel, high-performing molecules. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel 3D molecular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that leverages the generative power of a pretrained diffusion model. Instead of manipulating molecules directly in the complex chemical space, our method performs crossover operations in the noise space defined by the diffusion model's forward process, thereby enabling parental features or desired fragments to be fused into offspring. The pretrained model's denoising process then restores structural validity. The approach is highly composable and, requiring no retraining, can be readily integrated with existing guidance methods to improve discovery. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance on single-objective, multi-objective, and structurally constrained optimization tasks.

                arXiv:2508.02995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization.

                arXiv:2504.06006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing the performance of neural networks in computer vision, particularly as architectures become more complex. This work explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The resulting model produces accurate and computationally efficient hyperparameter recommendations across a wide range of vision architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on resource-intensive trial-and-error procedures, our approach achieves competitive or superior Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while substantially reducing computational overhead. Importantly, the models evaluated span image-centric tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation, fundamental components in many image manipulation pipelines including enhancement, restoration, and style transfer. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only rivals established Bayesian methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), but also accelerates tuning for real-world applications requiring perceptual quality and low-latency processing. All generated configurations are publicly available in the LEMUR Neural Network Dataset (https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset), which serves as an open source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research and provides a practical resource to improve training efficiency in image manipulation systems.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.

                arXiv:2505.02369v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants. The code repository is available at: https://github.com/YUNBLAK/Sharpness-Aware-Minimization-with-Z-Score-Gradient-Filtering

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a leading approach for near-term quantum computing but face major optimization challenges from noise, barren plateaus, and complex energy landscapes. We benchmarked more than fifty metaheuristic algorithms for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) using a three-phase procedure: initial screening on the Ising model, scaling tests up to nine qubits, and convergence on a 192-parameter Hubbard model. Landscape visualizations revealed that smooth convex basins in noiseless settings become distorted and rugged under finite-shot sampling, explaining the failure of gradient-based local methods. Across models, CMA-ES and iL-SHADE consistently achieved the best performance, while Simulated Annealing (Cauchy), Harmony Search, and Symbiotic Organisms Search also showed robustness. In contrast, widely used optimizers such as PSO, GA, and standard DE variants degraded sharply with noise. These results identify a small set of resilient algorithms for noisy VQE and provide guidance for optimization strategies on near-term quantum devices.

                Astrocytes, which are increasingly recognized as pivotal constituents of brain circuits governing a wide range of functions, express GABA transporter 3 (Gat3), an astrocyte-specific GABA transporter responsible for maintenance of extra-synaptic GABA levels. Here, we examined the functional role of Gat3 in astrocyte-mediated modulation of neuronal activity and information encoding. First, we developed a multiplexed CRISPR construct applicable for effective genetic ablation of Gat3 in the visual cortex of adult mice. Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging of visual cortex neurons in Gat3 knockout mice, we observed changes in spontaneous and visually driven single neuronal response properties such as response magnitudes and trial-to-trial variability. Gat3 knockout exerted a pronounced influence on population-level neuronal activity, altering the response dynamics of neuronal populations and impairing their ability to accurately represent stimulus information. These findings demonstrate that Gat3 in astrocytes profoundly shapes the sensory information encoding capacity of neurons and networks within the visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97839">Adaptations in wing morphology rather than wingbeat kinematics enable flight in small hoverfly species</a></h4>

              
                Due to physical scaling laws, size greatly affects animal locomotor ability and performance. Whether morphological and kinematic traits always jointly respond to size variation remains poorly known. Here, we examine the relative importance of morphological and kinematic changes in mitigating the consequence of size reduction on aerodynamic force production for weight support, focusing on the flight of hoverflies (Syrphidae). We compared the morphology of 28 hoverfly species, and the flight biomechanics and aerodynamics of eight species with body masses ranging from 5 to 100 mg. Our study reveals no significant effect of body mass on wingbeat kinematics among species, suggesting that morphological rather than kinematics changes compensate for the reduction in weight support associated with an isometric reduction in wing size. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that adaptations in wing morphology drive the ability of small hoverfly species to generate weight support, although variations in wingbeat kinematics among species cannot be entirely ignored. We show that smaller hoverflies have evolved relatively larger wings and aerodynamically more effective wing shapes, mitigating the reduction in aerodynamic weight support associated with isometric size reduction. Altogether, these results suggest that hoverfly flight underpins highly specialised wingbeat kinematics, largely conserved throughout evolution; instead, evolutionary adaptations in wing morphology enabled flight of small hoverflies.

">Lifespan Trajectories of Asymmetry in White Matter Tracts</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetry in white matter is believed to give rise to the brain's capacity for specialized processing and is involved in the lateralization of various cognitive processes, such as language and visuo-spatial reasoning. Although studies of white matter asymmetry have been previously documented, they have often been constrained by limited age ranges, sample sizes, or the scope of the tracts and structural features examined. While normative lifespan charts for brain structures are emerging, comprehensive charts detailing white matter asymmetries across numerous pathways and diverse structural measures have been notably absent. This study addresses this gap by leveraging a large-scale dataset of 26,199 typically developing and aging individuals, ranging from 0 to 100 years of age, from 42 primary neuroimaging studies. We generated comprehensive lifespan trajectories for 30 lateralized association and projection white matter tracts, examining 14 distinct microstructural and macrostructural features of these pathways. Our findings reveal that: (1) asymmetries are widespread across the brain's white matter and are present in all 30 pathways; (2) for a given pathway, the degree and direction of asymmetry differ between features of tissue microstructure and pathway macrostructure; (3) asymmetries vary across and within pathway types (association and projection tracts); and (4) these asymmetries are not static, following unique trajectories across the lifespan, with distinct changes during development, and a general trend of becoming more asymmetric with increasing age (particularly in later adulthood) across pathways. This study represents the most extensive characterization of white matter asymmetry across the lifespan to date, charting how lateralization patterns emerge, mature, and change throughout life. It provides a foundational resource for understanding the principles of white matter organization from early to late life, its relation to functional specialization and inter-individual variability, and offers a key reference for interpreting deviations during healthy development and aging as well as those associated with clinical populations.

">Edge communities in functional brain networks reveal heterogeneous, overlapping organization across the human lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Understanding changes in functional brain organization and their implications in development and aging is one of the central questions in neuroscience. In this study, we used an edge-centric approach to examine cross-sectional differences in functional brain network organization across the human lifespan using resting state functional MRI data from the Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample dataset. By creating edge time series - a framewise multiplication of nodal time series - and clustering them based on their temporal similarities, we were able to identify clusters of edges instead of nodes. This method naturally allows multiple community affiliations per node (brain region), providing a nuanced perspective on network participation compared to conventional hard-partition approaches. To do so, we created age-neutral templates of edge communities - or "eFC lures" - that, when applied, yielded consistent edge communities across non-overlapping subsamples of data. The communities of edges revealed a trajectory of desegregation with aging, suggested to be linked to neural dedifferentiation of activity and cognitive decline in older adults. Additionally, age group-specific lures significantly enhanced the detection of edge community organization compared to the age-neutral version. Combined, these results offer new insights into the heterogeneous, event cluster-level shifts in brain functional organization as well as underscore the importance of age-targeted analytical frameworks throughout the human lifespan.

">Single-Neuron Encoding of Learnability in the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                In natural environments, associations that indicate true learnable regularities are intermixed with those that arise from random and ultimately unlearnable relationships between events. To efficiently allocate cognitive resources and avoid inferring spurious patterns, organisms must distinguish learnable from unlearnable associations, but the mechanisms underlying this ability are not understood. We recently showed that monkeys performing a transitive inference task, while discovering the true hidden order in learnable image sets, also behaved to varying degrees as if they inferred subjective order in objectively random (unlearnable) image sets. Here, we show that the ability to detect learnability is encoded by neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, area 24c). dACC neurons responded strongly after a decision outcome as reported in previous studies and, additionally, signaled whether a trial was from a learnable vs unlearnable set before outcome delivery, and showed interactions whereby their selectivity for the outcome (reward vs lack of reward) was stronger for learnable versus unlearnable sets. Learnability and interaction responses were independent of sensory or reward cues (which were equated for learnable and unlearnable sets) but their strength correlated with the monkeys ability to avoid inferring false order in unlearnable sets. The findings suggest that the dACC is part of a network that monitors learnability and enables animals to appropriately focus learning on true patterns while avoiding false inferences about spurious and random associations.

">Neural dynamics reveal foraging-like computations in the frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex has a central role in flexible behavior. Computations for weighing alternatives, committing to an option, integrating evidence, and abandoning an option are dominantly formalized in reinforcement learning (RL). Yet, ecological considerations showcase foraging as a competing account. Identifying how the brain actually solves efficient weighing of options requires the identification of the neural representation of this abstract yet precise computation. We recorded neural populations from three areas of the primate frontal cortex involved in decision making to characterize neural dynamics while animals performed a standard RL task. By combining behavioral and neuron population analysis, we found a neural subspace in midcingulate (MCC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) that precisely tracked value computations. We demonstrated that MCC dynamics showed signatures of foraging-like computation but conflicted with RL requirements. Our study thus provides a detailed neural account of foraging-like flexibility in the primate frontal cortex.

">Sensorimotor beta burst dynamics and interhemispheric connectivity in children with developmental coordination disorder</a></h4>

              
                Activity in the beta frequency band appears to play a critical role in various sensorimotor processes, with transient "bursts" of beta displaying distinct waveform motifs reflecting different neural processes. However, much remains unknown about how beta bursts develop, and hence the role they may play in sensorimotor difficulties associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. Here, we used EEG to investigate sensorimotor beta bursts in children with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD), which is associated with impaired motor control and atypical brain connectivity. However, the neural dynamics underlying these differences remain unclear. We characterized beta bursts during action execution and observation of gross and fine motor actions. Although overall burst features were similar across groups in the spectral domain, children with DCD showed disrupted rate modulation of specific burst waveform motifs, characterized by atypical lateralization and altered interhemispheric connectivity. These disruptions were strongest for a subset of burst types identified by principal component analysis, and individual differences in motif-specific burst rates correlated with motor ability. Our findings suggest that selective recruitment of distinct beta burst motifs and related disruption of interhemispheric communication may represent an important mechanism underlying motor difficulties in DCD. This work highlights the importance of burst waveform diversity for understanding typical and atypical motor development.

">Working memory expands shared task representations in cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cognition is thought to emerge from the flexible organization of neural activity, yet how this organization reconfigures across behaviors varying in cognitive load remains unclear. We investigated how the structure of working-memory representations in the cortex compares to task representations that do not involve working memory. We used a task-switching paradigm in virtual reality, where mice alternated between a navigation-based working-memory task and a simpler task with matched sensorimotor demands. During behavior, we simultaneously imaged three cortical areas: higher visual area AM, and two association areas-premotor (M2) and retrosplenial cortex. At the single-neuron level, trial-averaged activity appeared similar across tasks. However, pairwise correlations decreased during the working-memory task, particularly in association areas. In addition, the corresponding linear task subspace explained the variance of both tasks equally well, whereas the simpler task subspace failed to do so, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between them. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed a shared low-dimensional structure across tasks. Yet, the organization of neuronal firing fields along this shared structure accounted for the difference in pairwise correlations: in the working-memory task, firing fields were more disjoint, especially among neurons in association areas that formed sequences along the memory dimension. Moreover, the degree of overlap between these firing fields predicted the mice's behavioral reliance on working memory. We conclude that behaviors varying in cognitive demands are supported by a single low-dimensional neural structure, which can expand or contract depending on cognitive load. We thus provide a framework for how task representations across the cortex reconfigure to support cognitive processes.

">Inferring learning rules during de novo task learning</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the learning rules that govern behavior is a central problem in neuroscience. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a unifying theoretical framework, most empirical studies of animal learning behavior have focused on non-stationary environments (e.g. changing reward probabilities in a known task), as opposed to acquiring an entirely new task from scratch. Here we introduce a statistical framework to infer reinforcement learning rules directly from single-animal behavior. Applied to mice learning a perceptual decision-making task, our approach reveals that policy-gradient-like rules capture de novo task learning better than classical temporal-difference algorithms. By fitting flexible parametric learning rules, we uncover systematic deviations from standard RL models, including side-specific learning rates and negative reward baselines. Together, these parameters account for side-biased learning, as well as forgetting and consecutive errors due to aversive responses to incorrect trials. Extending the framework with latent, dynamic learning rates further reveals that animals adapt their learning rates over training and across curricula. These results provide a statistical account of how animals learn from scratch and highlight key departures from classical reinforcement learning algorithms.

                Background Academic staff performance plays a critical role in the success of higher education institutions. In Uganda’s private university sector, understanding how demographic characteristics affect academic staff performance can inform more equitable and effective human resource practices. This study investigated the extent to which demographic factors influence academic performance among academic staff in private universities in Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional quantitative research design was used, involving 386 academic staff members from selected private universities. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using Pearson product-moment correlation to assess the relationships between demographic characteristics (gender, age, education level, position, years of teaching experience, and field of specialty) and indicators of academic performance. Results The analysis revealed several statistically significant correlations. The highest level of education attained was positively associated with years of teaching experience (r = .504, p < .01) and academic position (r = .619, p < .01). Years of teaching experience also showed a positive correlation with academic performance (r = .230, p < .01). Gender exhibited a weak but significant negative relationship with education level (r = –.123, p < .05) and teaching experience (r = –.115, p < .05), suggesting gender-related disparities in academic progression. Additionally, age group correlated moderately with education level (r = .292, p < .01) and academic position (r = .295, p < .01), reflecting career advancement over time. Beyond these statistical associations, the findings show that demographic characteristics such as gender, qualifications, academic rank, and field of specialty actively shape academic staff performance through access to opportunities, research engagement, and teaching responsibilities. Conclusions The study demonstrates that demographic factors particularly education level, experience, and academic rank significantly influence academic staff performance in private universities in Uganda. These findings highlight the need for universities to develop staff management and development policies that account for demographic diversity. Tailored interventions in recruitment, promotion, and retention can enhance institutional effectiveness and equity in academic staff development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1192/v4?src=rss">Conceptualizing university students’ food choices based on theory of planned behavior [version 4; peer review: 5 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Campus cuisine differs substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study uses the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand university students’ food choices, employing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students in technical and health science programs from a private university in Udupi who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The duration of students’ campus residence provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, there was an absence of nutritional information displayed in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation provides insights into the role of UDF in offering nutritionally balanced meals to students, potentially contributing to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

                Infant nutrition, especially during the first 1000 days of life, is an important determinant of future health outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the first six months of life, though the prevalence of EBF varies greatly in the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. The aim of this study is to determine how infant nutrition and feeding practices may be linked to cardiovascular risk in South Africa and Tanzania. This cross-sectional study will recruit 3-9-month-old infants. Data collected will include sociodemographic and nutrition information, weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), head circumference, blood pressure and spot urine samples for determination of urine-creatinine ratio, 8-Hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine and nitric oxide concentrations. Home-made food samples will be collected from the mothers of infants for macronutrient content analysis. SPSS will be used for statistical analysis, such as frequency, proportion, means, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression, to assess associations and regional variations. This will be the first prospective study to assess the impact of infant nutrition and feeding habits on cardiovascular risk in infants in two SSA countries, which will be useful for advising policy on infant nutrition.

                Background Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a complex disease with multiple phenotypes varying between individuals, as well as by age and sex. Males are diagnosed with PD at a much higher rate than females, and females experience later onset yet faster disease progression than males; the sexes also differ in PD by neuron composition, gene expression, and symptom progression. Because only a fraction of PD cases can be tied to genetic variants, it is likely that a complicated interaction between gene expression, hormones, the environment, and modifications to RNA transcripts plays a role in PD pathology and progression. Methods Here we explored changes in RNA editing through analysis of RNAseq between 243 healthy controls and PD patients aged 65 years or older enrolled in the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. Specifically, we analyzed editing through the actions of the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), which may cause nonsynonymous alterations to gene expression products including those that result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Results We observe differences in ADAR expression, number of putative ADAR edits, and the number of high/moderate impact edits between comparison groups and PD samples, which often show higher levels of ADAR expression and edits. PD males and females also differ in ADAR expression, number of edits, and the number of high and moderate impact edits with males exhibiting elevations compared to females in all three categories except in those edits associated with NMD, particularly in edits affecting SLC11A2, a gene coding for a transmembrane iron transporter. Likewise, differentially expressed genes between comparison groups were tied to NMD-related pathways Conclusion Our findings suggest that the dysregulation of ADAR editing may play a role in PD and that ADAR editing associated with NMD and genes functioning in NMD-related pathways may be integral to PD pathophysiology, particularly when comparing the sexes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1009/v1?src=rss">Development of an Instrument for Evaluating the Implementation of Occupational Health Programmes in Hospitals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hospitals pose a high level of hazard and risks, particularly ones related to occupational health, whose overarching objective is to ensure both healthy workers and a healthy workplace, which can be achieved through effective risk management. This research aims to develop an assessment instrument tailored to hospital occupational safety and health units and their stakeholders across Indonesia to assess hospitals’ efforts to protect workers, with a focus on occupational health services programmes based on identified hazards. It is a qualitative exploratory study. Data collection was made through an in-depth literature review to identify occupational health risk factors in hospitals, focusing primarily on studies involving health risk assessment and/or reports of occupational disease or suspected cases of diseases. This was supported by in-depth interviews and field observations in three hospitals: a government hospital, a private hospital and a teaching hospital. The identified risk factors contributing to hospital workers’ mortality and morbidity were then analysed and formed into measurable indicators. These indicators serve as the basis for developing an instrument prototype to semi quantitatively assess the implementation of occupational health services in the hospitals. The prototype was developed by adapting and modifying the Hospital Safety and Health Management System Self-Assessment Questionnaire from OSHA and then subjected to validation through a 2-day FGD involving experts, practitioners, professional organisations, and other authorities in similar fields of study. The instrument consists of seven main sections; 53 statements with a maximum total score of 159; in addition to guidance. In conclusion, the instrument is a strategic tool that can be used by hospitals to improve the effectiveness of occupational health service implementation in a sustainable manner. Regulatory support, management commitment, and involvement of all elements in a hospital are the keys to realising a healthy, safe, productive workplace for the whole hospital community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1008/v1?src=rss">The Effect of Teachers’ Housing Conditions on Teachers’ Attitude Towards Work in Government-Aided Secondary Schools in Kyeizooba Sub-County, Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Globally, declining teacher performance has been associated with absenteeism, inadequate preparation, and low motivation, often driven by poor remuneration and unfavorable working conditions. In Uganda, teachers in rural government-aided secondary schools face additional challenges such as inadequate housing, which may negatively impact their commitment and instructional quality. This study investigated the effect of teachers’ housing conditions on their attitudes toward work in Kyeizooba Sub-County, Bushenyi District, Uganda. Methods The study was guided by Taylor’s Scientific Management Theory and employed a cross-sectional design integrating both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The target population comprised 202 participants (199 teachers and 3 headteachers). Using the Cochran formula, the entire population (n = 202) was included for statistical robustness. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and interviews, with responses measured on a four-point Likert scale. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results The findings showed that housing conditions had a statistically significant effect on teachers’ attitudes toward their work (p < 0.05). Poor housing was associated with increased health problems (mean = 3.67), reduced motivation (mean = 3.62), and limited professional growth opportunities (mean = 3.56). Conversely, adequate housing promoted stronger teacher–student relationships (mean = 3.41) and moderate community engagement (mean = 3.01). Teacher performance records also revealed declining student outcomes, with failure rates of 17% in 2021 and 11.4% in 2022, partly linked to inadequate teacher housing and welfare. Qualitative data from headteachers further highlighted overcrowding, poor ventilation, and high commuting costs as major barriers to teacher effectiveness. Conclusion Housing stability is a critical determinant of teacher motivation, professional commitment, and instructional quality. The study recommends that policymakers invest in affordable and proximate housing for teachers, alongside supportive measures such as meal provision and medical care. Addressing these welfare needs would enhance teacher retention, strengthen classroom engagement, and improve educational outcomes in Uganda’s rural secondary schools.

                Patient education on appropriate self-care has the potential to play a crucial role in preventing foot complications. No current reviews explored the evidence of foot care interventions (FCIs) for diabetic patients who are at low risk for diabetic foot ulcers (LR-DFUs). This mapping review aimed to identify existing evidence of the core components of FCI for diabetic patients who are LR-DFUs and without DFUs. Methods: This review was undertaken using the Joanne Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance. The following electronic databases were searched for articles from data first indicated date through to June 2021: CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Science Direct, and ASSIA. APA PsycArticles, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and institutional websites by using search terms related to foot care and diabetes mellitus. A narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data. Results: In total, 18 studies were included in this review. Of these, there were 12 comparative studies, six observational studies and 12 reports of footcare education. The review included studies representing low- and high-resource settings and presented the core components of FCI for patients who are LR-DFUs and without DFUs. Conclusion: Core components of FCIs can be applied to develop targeted FCIs for education.

                Background This study develops and validates an Advanced Optimized Adaptive Differential Conductance (AOADC) algorithm for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems, aiming to improve tracking efficiency, responsiveness, and resilience under varying environmental conditions. Methods The AOADC algorithm was implemented in MATLAB 2020b using a nonlinear single-diode PV model governed by Kirchhoff’s law. Performance evaluation was conducted under two conditions: (i) irradiance levels of 500 W/m2, 750 W/m2, and 1000 W/m2 at a constant temperature of 298 K, and (ii) temperatures of 250 K, 298 K, and 350 K at a constant irradiance of 1000 W/m2 to examine the impact of temperature-induced variations in module saturation current (MSC). Results AOADC consistently tracked the Maximum Power Point, identified when differential conductance approached zero (σ ≈ 0 mho). At 298 K and 1000 W/m2, it achieved 139.80 W at 17.406 V, validating the theoretical dP/dV = 0 condition as conductance shifted from positive to negative around the MPP. A temperature rise from 250 K to 350 K reduced peak power by 54.4% (204.42 W to 93.19 W) and current by 48.3% (14.05 A to 7.27 A). Strong negative correlations were observed between temperature and power (r = –0.89, p < 0.01) as well as current (r = –0.91, p < 0.01), with a regression coefficient of R2 = 0.94 for power–temperature dependence. Conversely, increasing irradiance from 500 W/m2 to 1000 W/m2 raised power by 120% (63.89 W to 139.80 W) and current by 45% (5.48 A to 10.04 A), supported by strong P–V curve fitting (R2 > 0.98). Comparative analysis confirmed AOADC’s superiority over the conventional Optimized Adaptive Differential Conductance (OADC) technique. At 750 W/m2 and 298 K, AOADC delivered 100.17 W compared to 83.33 W by OADC (20.2% improvement), while at 500 W/m2 it produced 65.03 W versus 50.08 W (29.9% enhancement), yielding an average of 20.21% higher power output across all test cases. Conclusion AOADC demonstrated enhanced efficiency, faster dynamic response, and superior thermal resilience compared to OADC. These results establish AOADC as a reliable next-generation MPPT solution suitable for both standalone and grid-connected PV systems.

                <p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of expression of the maternal <I>UBE3A</I> allele and is characterized by a constellation of impactful neurologic symptoms. While previous work has uncovered outsized contributions of GABAergic neuron-selective <I>Ube3a</I> deletion to seizure susceptibility and electroencephalography (EEG) phenotypes in a mouse model of AS, the neuronal populations governing a broader range of behaviors have not been studied. Here, we used male and female mice to test the consequences of <I>Ube3a</I> deletion from GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons across a well-characterized battery of AS-relevant behaviors. Surprisingly, we observed deficits in numerous motor and innate behaviors in mice with glutamatergic <I>Ube3a</I> deletion and relatively few consequences of GABAergic <I>Ube3a</I> deletion. Furthermore, genetic <I>Ube3a</I> reinstatement in glutamatergic neurons rescued multiple motor and innate behaviors. When tested for sleep&ndash;wake behaviors, the selective loss of <I>Ube3a</I> from glutamatergic neurons disrupted sleep similarly to that of AS model mice (<I>Ube3a<sup>m&ndash;/p+</sup></I>), and glutamatergic <I>Ube3a</I> reinstatement overcame the lack of active cycle "siesta" and decreased REM phenotypes observed in AS model mice. Altogether, this work demonstrates a major role of glutamatergic neuron UBE3A loss in mediating multiple AS behavioral features, suggesting a divergence from the circuitry underlying enhanced seizure susceptibility. Our findings imply that neuronal cell type-agnostic UBE3A reinstatement is likely required for successful AS genetic therapies&mdash;with reinstatement of UBE3A in GABAergic neurons necessary for overcoming epileptic and EEG phenotypes, and reinstatement in glutamatergic neurons necessary for overcoming most other behavioral phenotypes.</p>

                <p>Current models of motor control emphasize the critical role of sensory feedback, as demonstrated by movement coordination deficits following sensory impairment. When both vision and touch are available for object-oriented manual behaviors, they serve distinct roles; vision guides the execution of planned movements, while touch provides more direct feedback on hand&ndash;object interactions. The impact of losing somatosensory feedback on eye&ndash;hand coordination during dexterous object manipulation tasks has not been thoroughly studied. Conceivably, vision is recruited to compensate for the feedback lost when touch is abolished based on the dexterity demands of the behavior. To investigate this, we tested healthy participants of either sex on a manual dexterity task requiring the movement of small metal pegs, both before and after the administration of digital anesthesia, which selectively abolished cutaneous sensations in the fingertips while preserving motor function. We recorded participants' gaze and hand positions. Despite loss of cutaneous feedback, participants successfully completed the pegboard task. However, they exhibited significantly longer trial times and altered force profiles. Notably, acute somatosensory loss triggered a rapid shift in visual behavior, characterized by a tighter coupling between gaze and hand positions across all task actions, even those not directly involving object manipulation. These changes, which occurred with anesthesia of the dominant and nondominant hands, were not evident with sham (saline) injections. Our findings underscore the contributions of sensory feedback to force control in service of dexterous object manipulation and reveal the nonselective nature of compensatory gaze&ndash;hand coordination processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/9/ENEURO.0587-24.2025?rss=1">Distinct Roles of the Premotor and Occipitotemporal Cortices in the Full-Body Illusion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sense of body ownership, a core aspect of self-recognition, has been studied using illusions such as the full-body illusion. Although the premotor cortex is considered central to body ownership in first-person full&ndash;body illusions, the occipitotemporal cortex&mdash;including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the extrastriate body area (EBA)&mdash;also plays a critical role in third-person full&ndash;body illusions. However, their distinct contributions to the full-body illusion remain unclear, partly due to the challenges of applying neuroimaging in such experiments. This study employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate brain activity during a third-person full&ndash;body illusion in virtual reality. Eighteen healthy human adult males participated in the study. The experiment consisted of two sessions. In Session 1, participants observed an avatar's back receiving either synchronous or asynchronous visual&ndash;tactile stimulation. In Session 2, visual stimuli alone were presented to participants after they experienced the full-body illusion to induce visuotactile discrepancies. In the synchronous condition of Session 1, we found significant deactivation in the superior and middle temporal gyri (partially including the TPJ), followed by higher activity than in the asynchronous condition in the left middle occipital gyrus (likely EBA). The left premotor cortex also showed significant activation (uncorrected), although this did not survive multiple-comparison adjustment. In Session 2, the visuotactile discrepancy induced significant left premotor activation only in the synchronous condition (FDR-corrected). These findings suggest that the occipitotemporal cortex supports receptivity to third-person full&ndash;body illusions, whereas the premotor cortex contributes to maintaining illusory body ownership by reconciling multisensory conflicts.</p>

                Background With growing focus on the environmental and social impacts of the food industry, sustainability has become a central topic in scientific research. Understanding the dynamics of this scientific production motivated a bibliometric analysis to identify trends, key themes, and emerging topics in this field. Methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted using Scopus and Web of Science to examine the evolution of scientific output related to sustainability in the food industry. Techniques such as keyword co-occurrence analysis, evaluation of country and author productivity, and thematic evolution analysis were applied. Additionally, a Cartesian system was used to classify the relevance and recency of identified key terms. Results An exponential growth pattern in scientific output was identified, particularly in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, with a statistical significance of 99.65%. Three main country clusters were observed, with the United Kingdom, United States, and Italy standing out for their productivity and impact. At the author level, Mangla and Luthra were notable for productivity, while Land, Beske, and Van Der Vorst stood out for their impact on the discipline. Thematic evolution analysis revealed a shift from early research on “soil erosion” to current themes like “circular economy,” “supply chain management,” “food safety,” and “wastewater treatment.” The keyword co-occurrence network showed seven thematic clusters, with the purple cluster—comprising “sustainability,” “waste management,” and “short supply chain”—being most prominent. Emerging topics such as “Covid-19,” “blockchain,” and the “agri-food sector” were found in the emerging topics quadrant. Conclusions This study highlights the evolution and diversification of sustainability research in the food industry, emphasizing the relevance of emerging topics and international collaboration. A multidisciplinary agenda is proposed to address critical areas such as food security, sustainable agriculture, and supply chain management, stressing the need to incorporate innovative technologies to meet current environmental, economic, and social challenges.

                Background Class imbalance is a frequent and severe problem in medical datasets, where instances from the minority class are usually high risk or disease positive. Most traditional classifiers suffer from a biasness towards the majority class, resulting in a poor detection rate of the minority class and, therefore, decreased confidence in prediction systems in medical applications. Methods In this paper, we present an optimized ensemble by differential evolution (OEDE), a novel ensemble learning framework, to address this problem. OEDE harmonizes three dissimilar base learners (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and trains each using class-balancing techniques. Next, the model utilized Differential Evolution (DE) to discover the most appropriate ensemble weights to maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC) on a validation dataset. Result We conducted experiments on four real-world medical datasets, whose imbalance ratios vary from 1.89 to 14.6, using OEDE in the original, SMOTE, and ADASYN balanced conditions. The results indicate that the proposed OEDE consistently outperforms or is competitive with traditional ensemble models in terms of AUC, F1-score, and Recall. ROC curve analysis also approved the OEDE’s superior discriminative capabilities. Conclusion The proposed OEDE framework effectively improves minority class detection in imbalance medical datasets. Its robust and flexible design makes it a promising tool for healthcare risk prediction tasks where minority class groups need to be well identified.

                Background Immunization is a cornerstone of global health and preventive efforts. However, persistent barriers and inequalities in healthcare access continue to delay the eradication of preventable diseases through vaccination, increase the burden of infantile diseases and mortality rates, and contributes to the emergence of epidemics. This scoping review seeks to understand how the intensity of armed conflicts as a societal determinant influences vaccination rate. By exploring existing literature, it intends to provide insights into the complex relationship between armed conflict intensity and vaccination coverage. Methods This study follows the methodological framework outlined by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. A comprehensive search strategy was established using electronic databases. Keywords related to armed conflict and vaccination coverage were used to retrieve articles within a specified population, timeframe, and geographical location. Online research was conducted to identify grey literature. Articles undergo a single reviewer screening process based on titles and abstracts to assess eligibility for full-text review based on predefined criteria. Data extraction captures key findings, including the association between armed conflict intensity and vaccination rates, and the mechanisms underlying this relationship. A narrative synthesis approach is employed to analyze and interpret the findings. Results The search identified 35 articles published from 2014 to 2023 and several other documents. It reveals factors linked to conflict intensity intertwined with other factors, which are challenging to measure and reproduce. It summarizes future study suggestions to elucidate the context-specific impact of conflict intensity on routine immunization coverage and potential strategies to overcome these barriers. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the impact of armed conflict intensity on vaccination coverage rates, highlighting the complex interplay of factors influencing immunization outcomes. The evidence synthesized underscores the challenges faced by vaccination programs and the necessity for context-specific strategies and evidence-informed policies.

                Background Orthognathic surgery corrects severe skeletal discrepancies that cannot be addressed by orthodontics alone. With advancements in digital workflows and CAD/CAM technologies, clear aligner therapy (CAT) has emerged as a potential adjunct in surgical cases. However, its clinical application remains under-researched. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, experience, and attitudes of orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons in Saudi Arabia regarding CAT in orthognathic surgery patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 1 to May 31, 2023, using a closed-ended online questionnaire distributed to specialists across Saudi Arabia. The survey gathered demographic and clinical data. Statistical analysis included descriptive methods, chi-square testing (p < 0.05), and univariate regression to identify demographic predictors of CAT use. Results Out of 278 expected responses, 46 were received. Most participants were aged 31–40 years (p < 0.05) and had 6–10 years of experience (p = 0.03). Orthodontists accounted for 65.2% of the respondents, with oral and maxillofacial surgeons at 34.8% (p = 0.03). While most treated 1–4 orthognathic patients monthly, 80% had no experience using CAT in these cases. Although general CAT usage was significant (p < 0.05), its clinical application in orthognathic surgery was minimal. Challenges included pre-surgical alignment, intraoperative fixation, and post-operative occlusion control. Regression analysis showed that age was significantly associated with CAT use (p < 0.05; R2 = 0.38), while gender and experience were not. Conclusion The study indicates limited clinical experience with CAT in orthognathic surgery in Saudi Arabia. Age may influence CAT adoption, but further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and inform future integration of aligner protocols in surgical orthodontics.

                Background The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) crosses the blood-brain barrier, compromising cortical networks and cognition. Neuropharmacological intervention in the form of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) does not reverse cognitive decline in pediatric and adolescent HIV. In search of options to enhance cognition in affected adolescents, we evaluated the effectiveness of attention training. Methods The training was evaluated by pairing participants’ outcomes on the Stroop Colour Word Test (SCWT), a test of attention and inhibitory control, to brain hemodynamic responses measured by functional near-infrared spectrometry (fNIRS) both prior to, and after, the training. Changes in oxygenated haemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex during the SCWT were compared in 15 HIV+ participants who received attention training with that of 13 HIV+ participants who did not receive the intervention. Results Intragroup analyses showed differences in oxygenated haemoglobin levels between congruent and incongruent conditions of the SCWT only for participants who received the attention training. Specifically, there was a significant decrease in oxygenated haemoglobin in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and frontopolar brain areas in the training group. Conclusions Findings suggest that customised attention training maybe an effective complementary adjunct to cART for children and adolescents living with HIV.

                Hyperspectral band selection has become a key focus in hyperspectral image processing as it reduces the spectral redundancy and computational overhead, thereby improving classification performance. However, optimal band selection remains challenging due to its combinatorial nature. Although numerous metaheuristic algorithms have been introduced in recent years to address this problem, achieving an effective balance between exploration and exploitation continues to pose a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines a parameter-free binary Jaya algorithm with a mutation operator to enhance exploration and maintain solution diversity within the search space. We employ Opposition-based Leaning (OBL) for population initialization and Quasi-Reflection reinitialization strategy to add diversity whenever fitness stagnation occurs. To simultaneously improve classification performance and band reduction we adopt weighted sum multi-objective fitness function that minimizes redundancy and enhances model generalization. Our proposed method is evaluated using three benchmark datasets, namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed method outperforms recent metaheuristic-based band selection techniques. Its superior performance makes it well suited for various HSI applications.

                <p>by Richard Schweitzer, Thomas Seel, Jörg Raisch, Martin Rolfs</p>

Eye movements routinely induce motion streaks as they shift visual projections across the retina at high speeds. To investigate the visual consequences of intra-saccadic motion streaks, we co-registered eye tracking and EEG while gaze-contingently shifting target objects during saccades, presenting either continuous, ‘streaky’ or apparent, step-like motion in four directions. We found significant reductions of secondary saccade latency, as well as improved decoding of the post-saccadic target location from the EEG signal when motion streaks were available. These signals arose as early as 50 ms after saccade offset and had a clear occipital topography. Using a physiologically plausible visual processing model, we provide evidence that the target’s motion trajectory is coded in orientation-selective channels and that speed of gaze correction was linked to the visual dynamics arising from the combination of saccadic and target motion, providing a parsimonious explanation of the behavioral benefits of intra-saccadic motion streaks.

                <p>by Yun Lin, James A. Hay, Yu Meng, Benjamin J. Cowling, Bingyi Yang</p>

Population-level viral load distributions, measured by RT-qPCR or qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from surveillance testing, can be used to estimate the time-varying reproductive number (Rt) in real-time during COVID-19 outbreaks. However, it remains unclear whether this approach can be broadly applied to other pathogens, sources of virologic test data, or surveillance strategies beyond those specifically implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We systematically evaluated the accuracy of Ct-based Rt estimates using simulated epidemics under different surveillance testing systems and pathogen viral kinetics. Using area under the ROC curve (AUC) to assess accuracy in detecting epidemic growth or decline, we found that case ascertainment rates minimally impacted estimation accuracy, except when detection was heavily biased towards severe patients (AUC: 0.64, 95% CIs: 0.59 - 0.71) or during prolonged waves with stable Rt near one (AUC: 0.54, 0.48 - 0.64), compared to stable detection patterns over time (AUC 0.76, 0.66 - 0.82). By comparing model accuracies across different viral shedding patterns and by parameterizing our model using data from six respiratory pathogens, we found that model performance largely depends on a monotonic viral shedding trajectory following case detection. A pathogen that lacks such shedding pattern – for example, those with a viral peak after onset – exhibited lower accuracy (AUC: 0.58, 0.49 - 0.65). Overall, our findings demonstrate that Ct-based Rt estimation methods are generally accurate across diverse surveillance conditions and pathogen shedding patterns, supporting their practical use as a supplementary tool for timely transmission monitoring while highlighting limitations that warrant further consideration.

                <p>by Biplab Maity, Swarnendu Banerjee, Abhishek Senapati, Jon Pitchford, Joydev Chattopadhyay</p>

Despite extensive control efforts over the centuries, cholera remains a globally significant health issue. Seasonal emergence of cholera cases has been reported, particularly in the Bengal delta region, which is often synchronized with plankton blooms. This phenomenon has been widely attributed to the commensal interaction between <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and zooplankton in aquatic environments. The role of plankton dynamics in cholera epidemiology has been acknowledged but remains poorly understood, and consequently, its importance in effective policymaking is largely overlooked. To this end, we propose and analyze a novel compartment-based transmission model that integrates phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions into a human-bacteria cholera framework. Our study shows that, beyond the reproduction number, the relative contribution of bacterial versus zooplankton-mediated transmission plays a crucial role in shaping epidemic progression and severity. In presence of zooplankton-mediated transmission, an outbreak with a delayed and lower peak may still result in a larger overall outbreak size. Additionally, contrary to common intuition, even for a large and early outbreak, the epidemic overshoot may intensify due to the maintenance of lower-level infections during the post-peak phase. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the timing of filtration-like interventions can be strategically guided by ecological indicators, such as phytoplankton blooms. Our study underscores the importance of incorporating ecological aspects in epidemiological research to better predict and manage disease outbreaks.

                <p>by Théotime Grohens, Sam Meyer, Guillaume Beslon</p>

DNA supercoiling—the level of twisting and writhing of the DNA molecule around itself—plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria by modulating promoter activity. The level of DNA supercoiling is a dynamic property of the chromosome which varies both at local and global scales, in response to both external factors such as environmental perturbations and internal factors including gene transcription. As such, local variations in supercoiling could in theory couple the expression levels of neighboring genes by creating feedback loops at the transcriptional level. However, the impact of such supercoiling-mediated interactions on the regulation of gene expression still remains uncertain. In this work, we study how this coupling between transcription and supercoiling could shape genome organization and help regulate gene transcription. We present a model of genome evolution in which individuals whose gene transcription rates are coupled to local supercoiling must adapt to two environments that induce different global supercoiling levels. In this model, we observe the evolution of whole-genome regulatory networks that provide control over gene expression by leveraging the transcription-supercoiling coupling, and show that the structure of these networks is underpinned by the organization of genes along the chromosome at several scales. Local variations in DNA supercoiling could therefore help jointly shape both gene regulation and genome organization during evolution.

                <p>by Laurent Loiseau, Nathan De Visch, Alexandra Vergnes, Jean Armengaud, Maxence S. Vincent, Benjamin Ezraty</p>

The bacterial cell envelope is exposed to various stresses, including oxidative stress caused by different types of oxidants, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive chlorine species (RCS). In Escherichia <i>coli,</i> the reduction of chlorate into chlorite, a toxic RCS compound, induces the expression of the MsrPQ system, which repairs periplasmic proteins oxidized at methionine residues (methionine sulfoxide, Met-O). In this study, using a proteomic-based approach, we show that chlorite stress also triggers the overproduction of the periplasmic molecular chaperone Spheroplast Protein Y (Spy). This response is mediated by the activation of the BaeSR two-component system. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro evidence reveal that Spy’s susceptibility to oxidation is critical for its chaperone activity. We demonstrate that the MsrPQ repair system ensures Spy’s functionality by reducing its Met-O, thereby safeguarding its role in periplasmic protein homeostasis. Overall, this work reveals Spy as a key target of chlorite-induced oxidative damage and underscores the essential role of MsrPQ in preserving periplasmic protein quality control.

                <p>by Enrico Ferrea, Pierre Morel, Alexander Gail</p>

Perturbing visual feedback is a powerful tool for studying visuomotor adaptation. However, unperturbed proprioceptive signals in common paradigms inherently co-varies with physical movements and causes incongruency with the visual input. This can create challenges when interpreting underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We employed a brain–computer interface (BCI) in rhesus monkeys to investigate spatial encoding in frontal and parietal areas during a 3D visuomotor rotation task where only visual feedback was movement-contingent. We found that both brain regions better reflected the adapted motor commands than the perturbed visual feedback during movement preparation and execution. This adaptive response was observed in both local and remote neurons, even when they did not directly contribute to the BCI input signals. The transfer of adaptive changes in planning activity to corresponding movement corrections was stronger in the frontal than in the parietal cortex. Our results suggest an integrated large-scale visuomotor adaptation mechanism in a motor-reference frame spanning across frontoparietal cortices.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) consensus diagnostic criteria and functional rating scale (PLSFRS) were recently established to facilitate and optimize future PLS clinical trials. We examined the trajectory of the PLSFRS and other functional outcome measures and biomarkers in the PLS Natural History Study (PLS NHS) to understand their performance in this prospective cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The PLS NHS is a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study of people living with PLS in different diagnostic categories: early (disease duration &lt;2 years); probable (2–4 years); and definite PLS (4–15 years). PLSFRS scores and other functional outcome measures were collected at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up visits. Baseline characteristics were compared between the groups. The slopes of the PLSFRS and other functional outcome measures over 12 months were examined in the overall cohort and subgroups using linear mixed-effect models. The associations between baseline characteristics and the rate of PLSFRS decline were analyzed with linear regression models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 76 participants were included: early (n = 6); probable (n = 26); and definite (n = 44) PLS. Baseline PLSFRS total scores were highest in the early PLS group, followed by the probable and definite PLS groups. In the overall cohort, the PLSFRS total score declined by 0.33 points/month (95% confidence interval [0.27–0.39], adjusted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The rate of decline was steepest in the early PLS group, followed by the probable and definite PLS groups. Baseline neurofilament light chain level was associated with the rate of PLSFRS decline over 1 year (<i>p</i> = 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In PLS, the rate of functional decline, as measured by the PLSFRS total score, is faster during the early phase of the disease. Neurofilament light might serve as a prognostic biomarker in PLS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Biomarkers with clear contexts of use are important tools for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapy development. Understanding their longitudinal trajectory in the untreated state is key to their use as potential markers of pharmacodynamic response. To this end, we undertook a large-scale proteomic study in well-phenotyped cohorts to identify biomarker candidates of ALS disease state and disease progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical phenotypic data and biofluid samples, collected from patients with ALS and healthy controls through multiple longitudinal natural history studies, were used to identify biomarker candidates. Slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer)-based relatively quantitative measurement of ~7,000 proteins was performed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with immunoassay validation of candidates of interest.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 329 plasma proteins significantly differentially regulated between ALS and controls (adjusted <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05), with 25 showing &gt;40% relative abundance. PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11 had the greatest log-fold elevation, whereas ANTXR2 and ART3 had the greatest log-fold reduction. A similar set of plasma proteins was found to increase (eg, PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11) or decrease (eg, ANTXR2, ART3, and MSTN) with disease progression. CSF proteins with the greatest log-fold elevation included NEFL, NEFH, CHIT1, CA3, MYL11, and GPNMB. These results were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. Moreover, tissue-specific signature enrichment suggests a significant contribution of muscle as a source of these biomarkers. Plasma KCNIP3 was elevated by ~60% in those on riluzole. Immunoassays provided orthogonal validation of plasma TNNT2 and CSF GPNMB.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified an array of novel biomarkers with the potential to serve as response biomarkers to aid therapy development, as well as to shed light on the underlying biology of disease. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Growing evidence suggests that hippocampal gray matter microstructure, assessed through diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While hippocampal atrophy is a characteristic feature of AD, microstructural changes likely precede macrostructural changes such as volumetric loss, offering important insights into the early phases of the disease. This study assessed the relationships between hippocampal microstructure (assessed with mean diffusivity [MD] from DWI) and Braak-staged tau burden (measured by positron emission tomography [PET]) with performance on an episodic memory composite score, among individuals with and without amyloid burden, assessed by PET imaging. The study included 192 participants without dementia (14 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) from the BIOCARD cohort (mean age = 68), of which 52 (27%) were amyloid positive. In multiple linear regression analyses, increased hippocampal MD was associated with worse memory and greater tau PET burden in Braak stages II–IV, but only in individuals who were amyloid positive (e.g., significant amyloid × hippocampal MD interactions). Building on prior findings linking early Braak-staged tau to memory, we further assessed whether tau PET burden statistically mediated the relationship between elevated hippocampal MD and poorer memory performance. Tau PET burden in Braak stages II–IV was found to statistically mediate the relationship between elevated hippocampal MD and poorer memory performance, independent of hippocampal volume, but only in amyloid-positive participants. These associations were only significant when MCI participants were included in the analysis. These findings suggest hippocampal microstructure may be sensitive to AD-related pathological burden and associated neurodegeneration, particularly in the early symptomatic phase, and is associated with tau PET and cognitive decline, even after accounting for hippocampal volume.</p>

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 29 September 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02070-6">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-02070-6</a></p>The promise of genomics-focused neuroscience to improve health outcomes for Indigenous Peoples depends on ensuring more equitable data relationships though culturally appropriate data governance and the technical infrastructure to enable its implementation. Although ethical frameworks and legal policy mechanisms affirm Indigenous rights, there is a persistent gap in translating these commitments into practice. Here we discuss how embedding Indigenous data governance across research infrastructures and data ecosystems is needed to strengthen the field’s capacity to deliver beneficial outcomes for all.

                    correspondence in human brain connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain structure-function coupling has been studied in health and disease by many
                    different researchers in recent years. Most of the studies have estimated
                    functional connectivity matrices as correlation coefficients between different
                    brain areas, despite well-known disadvantages compared with partial correlation
                    connectivity matrices. Indeed, partial correlation represents a more sensible
                    model for structural connectivity since, under a Gaussian approximation, it
                    accounts only for direct dependencies between brain areas. Motivated by this and
                    following previous results by different authors, we investigate
                    structure-function coupling using partial correlation matrices of functional
                    magnetic resonance imaging brain activity time series under various
                    regularization (also known as noise-cleaning) algorithms. We find that, across
                    different algorithms and conditions, partial correlation provides a higher match
                    with structural connectivity retrieved from density-weighted imaging data than
                    standard correlation, and this occurs at both subject and population levels.
                    Importantly, we also show that regularization and thresholding are crucial for
                    this match to emerge. Finally, we assess neurogenetic associations in relation
                    to structure-function coupling, which presents promising opportunities to
                    further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly
                    concerning brain disorders.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent machine learning techniques have improved connectome-based predictions by
                    modeling complex dependencies between brain connectivity and cognitive traits.
                    However, they typically require large datasets that are costly and
                    time-consuming to collect. To address this, we propose Task-guided generative
                    adversarial network (GAN) II, a novel data augmentation method that uses GANs to
                    expand sample sizes in connectome-based prediction tasks. Our method
                    incorporates a task-guided branch within the Wasserstein GAN framework,
                    specifically designed to synthesize structural connectivity matrices and improve
                    prediction accuracy by capturing task-relevant features. We evaluated
                    Task-guided GAN II on the prediction of fluid intelligence using the NIMH Health
                    Research Volunteer Dataset. Results showed that data augmentation improved
                    prediction accuracy. To further assess whether augmentation can substitute for
                    increasing actual collected sample sizes, we conducted additional validation
                    using the Human Connectome Project WU-Minn S1200 dataset. Task-guided GAN II
                    improved prediction performance with limited real data, with gains of up to
                    twofold augmentation observed. However, excessive augmentation did not result in
                    further improvements, suggesting that augmentation complements, but does not
                    fully replace, real data augmentation. These results suggest that Task-guided
                    GAN II is a promising tool for harnessing small datasets in human connectomics
                    research, improving predictive modeling where large-scale data collection is
                    impractical.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods are the most widely applied
                    tools in the network neurosciences, but their reliability remains an active area
                    of study. We use back-to-back 10-min resting-state scans in a healthy aging
                        (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 41) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) sample
                        (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 45) composed of older adults to assess the
                    replicability of RSFC using a “mini” multiverse approach. The goal
                    was to evaluate the reproducibility of commonly used graph metrics and determine
                    if aging and moderate-severe TBI influences RSFC reliability using intraclass
                    correlation coefficients (ICCs). There is clear evidence for reliable results in
                    aging and TBI. Global network metrics such as within-network connectivity and
                    segregation were most reliable whereas other whole-brain connectivity estimates
                    (e.g., clustering coefficient, eigenvector centrality) were least reliable.
                    Analysis of canonical networks revealed the default mode and salience networks
                    as most reliable. There was a notable influence of motion scrubbing on ICCs,
                    with diminished reliability proportional to the number of volumes removed.
                    Choice of brain atlas had a modest effect on findings. Overall, RSFC
                    reproducibility is preserved in older adults and after significant neurological
                    compromise. We also identify a subset of graph metrics and canonical networks

">Neural field patient-specific super resolution for enhanced 1.5 Tesla brain MRI visualization</a></h4>

              
                Brain magnetic resonance imaging serves as a cornerstone of preoperative neurosurgical assessment. Neural fields represent an emerging machine learning approach capable of super-resolution reconstruction and novel view synthesis without requiring large training datasets. Ten 1.5-Tesla brain MRI sequences (nine anisotropic and one isotropic) were used to train patient-specific neural field models using a closed source machine learning framework (Radscaler). Image quality assessment was performed on reconstructions upscaled by factors of 2, 3, and 4 relative to original resolution. The method achieved favorable quality metrics across all scaling factors: mean (sd) SSIM of 0.85 (0.04), MS-SSIM of 0.95 (0.01), and LPIPS of 0.09 (0.04). Neural field reconstruction enabled enhanced visualization of micro-anatomical structures through improved spatial resolution and interpolation of intermediate views not present in the original acquisition. These findings demonstrate that neural fields provide a clinically viable approach for volumetric MRI super-resolution and novel view synthesis, particularly valuable for addressing anisotropic acquisition limitations in neurosurgical planning.

">Aphasia severity mediates the relationship between attention and sentence comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attention deficits are common after stroke and exacerbate communication challenges in people with aphasia (PWA). Prior studies report mixed associations between attention and language, raising the possibility that these links are explained by aphasia severity. We examined whether alerting, orienting, and executive control attention differ by aphasia severity and whether severity mediates their relationship with sentence comprehension. Methods: Fifty-eight PWA (latent, mild, moderate, severe) and 21 neurotypical controls completed the Attention Network Test, Western Aphasia Battery-Revised, and a sentence-picture matching task. Group differences were tested with ANOVA and linear mixed-effects models. Correlations and structural equation modeling evaluated associations among attention, aphasia severity, and sentence comprehension efficiency. Results: Orienting and executive control differed by aphasia severity, with the severe group performing worse than all others; alerting did not differ across groups. Within group analyses showed that controls and mild aphasia participants demonstrated all three effects, latent aphasia participants showed orienting and executive control effects, while the moderate and severe groups only showed the executive control effect. Stronger orienting and executive control correlated with milder aphasia and more efficient canonical comprehension. Mediation confirmed that orienting influenced canonical and non-canonical comprehension indirectly through aphasia severity; executive control showed trend-level mediation. Alerting attention was unrelated to aphasia severity or comprehension. Conclusions: Orienting and executive control, but not alerting, are closely tied to aphasia severity and indirectly support sentence comprehension. Attentional profiling may enhance individualized rehabilitation planning for PWA. Keywords: aphasia, stroke, attention, orienting, executive control, sentence comprehension

">The Reinstatement of a Forgotten Infantile Memory</a></h4>

              
                Infantile memories present a striking paradox: while early-life experiences are typically forgotten, reflecting the phenomenon of infantile amnesia, traumatic events from infancy can profoundly shape adult cognition and behavior. How do memories that are seemingly inaccessible persistently influence cognitive processes and behaviors throughout life? Rodent studies have demonstrated that forgotten infantile memories remain encoded as latent "infantile memory engrams" (iEngrams) within neuronal circuits, capable of memory reinstatement under artificial experimental conditions. Still, the network mechanisms underpinning the natural reinstatement of a forgotten infantile memory are unknown. Here, we show that infantile memories, though physiologically irretrievable in adults, remain stored within hippocampal circuits and their engrams contribute to hippocampal network dynamics. Crucially, reinstating these memories requires a carefully orchestrated network process. An initial contextual reminder primes the hippocampal network to increase activity of the iEngram during a subsequent aversive reminder, which tags iEngram neurons for offline reactivation. This reactivation facilitates the integration of previously latent infantile memories with novel neuronal ensembles, reinstating behavior consistent with the original memory. These findings critically advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying physiological memory encoding, retrieval, and reinstatement across development. Furthermore, they delineate the temporal boundaries and underlying physiological substrate of the process by which a latent representation becomes associated with a novel neuronal substrate, suggesting potential interventions to prevent the maladaptive reinstatement of traumatic infantile memories.

">Age-related Reorganization of Corticomuscular Connectivity During Locomotor Perturbations</a></h4>

              
                Locomotor perturbations elicit cortical and muscular responses that help minimize motor errors through neural processes involving multiple brain regions. The anterior cingulate cortex monitors motor errors, the supplementary motor areas integrate sensory and executive control, and the posterior parietal cortices process sensorimotor predictions, while muscles show increased activation and co-contraction patterns. With aging, these neural control strategies shift; older adults demonstrate less flexible cortical and muscular responses, using compensatory overactivation and simpler muscle synergies to maintain performance comparable to young adults. We investigated corticomuscular connectivity patterns during perturbed recumbent stepping in seventeen young adults (age 25{+/-}4.9 years) and eleven older adults (age 68{+/-}3.6 years) using high-density EEG (128 electrodes) and EMG from six bilateral muscles. Brief mechanical perturbations (200ms of increased resistance) were applied at left or right leg extension-onset or mid-extension during continuous stepping at 60 steps per minute. We applied independent component analysis, source localization, and direct directed transfer function to quantify bidirectional information flow between cortical clusters and muscles in theta (3-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) bands. Young adults demonstrated concentrated electrocortical sources in anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral supplementary motor areas, and bilateral posterior parietal cortices, with strong theta-band synchronization following perturbations. In contrast, older adults showed fewer differentiated cortical sources, particularly lacking distinct anterior cingulate activity, and exhibited only minimal synchronization changes. Baseline corticomuscular connectivity was significantly stronger in older adults compared to young adults (p=0.012), suggesting fundamental differences in resting motor control states. During perturbations, young adults employed flexible, task-specific connectivity modulation involving error-processing networks, with the anterior cingulate showing selective bidirectional connectivity changes with specific muscles. Older adults relied on more diffuse (i.e., not focused to specific brain area) connectivity patterns dominated by motor and posterior parietal cortices, with strong connections to multiple upper and lower limb muscles simultaneously. These findings reveal an age-related strategic reorganization from dynamic, error-driven neural control to a more constrained, stability-focused approach that may reflect compensation for sensorimotor changes. The distinct connectivity signatures establish perturbed recumbent stepping as a valuable tool for assessing corticomuscular communication and provide normative benchmarks for developing targeted rehabilitation interventions to restore efficient motor control in aging and neurological populations.

">Metabolic organization of macaque visual cortex reflects retinotopic eccentricity and category selectivity</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity requires energy metabolism, and the brain's metabolic architecture varies across regions. Yet, it remains unclear whether these variations are meaningfully related to the functional and perceptual demands of cortical processing. In high-level visual cortex, category-selective regions, such as those preferentially responding to faces and scenes, are consistently distributed along a topographic axis that varies in sensitivity to spatial scale, a feature dimension that imposes differing metabolic demands at the level of the retina. This axis reflects a broader organizing principle of the visual system: retinotopic eccentricity, the topographic mapping of visual space relative to gaze. Here, we tested whether cortical metabolic architecture reflects this principle by aligning in vivo fMRI maps of eccentricity and visual category selectivity with ex vivo cytochrome oxidase (CO) histology, a marker of oxidative metabolism, in macaque visual cortex. We found that face-selective region ML, which is biased toward central vision, exhibits higher CO intensity than the peripherally-biased scene-selective region LPP. More broadly, CO intensity covaries with eccentricity across the entire occipitotemporal cortex, though this gradient only partially accounts for the elevated CO in ML. These findings reveal a close correspondence between cortical energy consumption and retinotopic representation, suggesting that metabolic resources are shaped by the processing demands of visual perception.

">Multimodal Fusion Analysis of Florbetapir PET and Multiscale Functional Network Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and disruption of intrinsic brain networks are two important characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the relationship between amyloid accumulation and network dysfunction remains unclear. In this study, we integrated [18F]Florbetapir PET and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) derived Functional Network Connectivity (FNC) from 552 temporally matched longitudinal PET-rsfMRI sessions across 395 participants spanning Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD stages. With a model order of 11, joint Independent Component Analysis (jICA) was applied to the fused PET-FNC data, identifying 11 stable components, of which 9 PET-derived components corresponded to previously characterized brain regions or networks. The multimodal analysis revealed disease progression markers, including (1) a pattern of reduced subject loadings across clinical stages (CN > MCI > AD) in white matter and cerebellar regions, reflecting structural degeneration; (2) increased amyloid accumulation in affected individuals in grey matter regions, particularly in frontal, sensori-motor, extended hippocampal, and default mode network (DMN) regions, accompanied by functional connectivity alterations that reflected both compensatory and disruptive network dynamics. We identified PET-derived components that captured distinct stages of disease progression, with the DMN component emerging as a late-stage biomarker and a white matter component showing early-stage changes with limited progression thereafter. Additionally, several components showed significant variation in loadings between APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers and non-carriers, linking the multimodal signatures to a well-established genetic risk factor for AD.

">Astrocytic Activation Completely Corrects Memory Performancein an Alzheimer's Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                Neural and glial dysfunction are thought to underlie memory impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conversely, astrocytes are known to play a central role in the healthy brain, and their activation has been shown to enhance memory. To test whether activation of astrocytes can correct memory deficits associated with AD, we expressed hM3Dq in CA1 astrocytes of 7 months old 5XFAD AD model mice, enabling astrocytic chemogenetic Gq pathway activation, following exposure to CNO. We report that astrocytic activation results in complete memory correction, and even memory improvement of AD model mice beyond that of untreated WT levels. We went further to discover the mechanisms underlying this memory improvement in AD mice: First, using 2-photon imaging and electrophysiology, we observed increased neuronal activity (displayed as elevated cFos expression and amplified awake Ca2+ events) as well as augmented in-vivo long term plasticity following astrocytic activation. Subsequently, we observed increased astrocytic endocytosis of A{beta} plaques. Finally, we report that the beneficial effects of astrocytic activation remained stable for an entire year, and persisted beyond the window of astrocytic Gq activation. Our findings that astrocytes correct memory impairments in an AD model could have important clinical implications towards treating this disease.

">Deep Brain Ultrasound Augments Human Attention</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deep brain ultrasound offers a novel means of modulating human cognition by noninvasively targeting subcortical structures that were previously accessible only through invasive procedures. While decades of research have mapped cortical circuits of attention, the causal roles of deep hubs such as the basal ganglia and thalamus remain poorly understood in the healthy human brain. Objectives/Hypothesis: To test whether low intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) of two nodes in the basal ganglia-thalamic network, the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and the pulvinar, causally alters visual attention. We hypothesized that TUS-induced modulations in attentional performance would be site specific, reflecting distinct circuit functions. Results: Across sessions, focal TUS accelerated reaction time in a visual search task, indicating augmented attention. Reaction time improvements were observed after stimulation relative to baseline. A dissociation emerged across sites: both GPi and pulvinar enhanced reaction times, but pulvinar yielded more robust benefits for target present trials at peripheral eccentricities, and improved search efficiency in the same trials. Conclusions: These findings provide causal evidence that human attentional control can be steered at deep subcortical sites. TUS offers a practical approach for dissecting circuit level contributions to cognition and a potential noninvasive avenue for enhancing attention and other cognitive or affective functions.

                Pure awareness (PA) is described in contemplative traditions as a wakeful state largely devoid of cognitive content, often considered a case of minimal phenomenal experience (MPE). Transcendental Meditation (TM) provides an excellent empirical model for PA because it is standardized, effortless, and reliably induces reports of awareness with minimal content. We combined phenomenological and electrophysiological approaches to study PA in 33 experienced TM practitioners and matched controls (performing mental counting). Using Temporal Experience Tracing, TM practitioners reported greater intensity and variability of PA than controls, regardless of years of meditation practice, consistent with the notion of 'automatic self-transcendence'. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and multivariate classification analyses, our large-scale screening of theoretically motivated EEG markers revealed a double dissociation in neural signatures. When contrasting TM with controls, temporal entropy and aperiodic dynamics were the strongest discriminators, while functional connectivity based on phase coherence contributed the least. In contrast, when TM was compared with its own baseline, low-frequency functional connectivity dominated, while temporal entropy contributed minimally to classification. This dissociation suggests that PA is characterized by enhanced EEG signals' diversity and aperiodic neural dynamics compared to ordinary cognition but stabilized by slow-frequency oscillatory synchronization relative to rest. Finally, TM showed little evidence of carry-over effects from meditation into subsequent rest, in contrast to controls, where counting induced residual changes. Together, these results provide the most systematic electrophysiological characterization of PA to date and establish neurophenomenology as a robust framework for advancing the neuroscience of minimal phenomenal experience.

">Early Aβ-induced changes in the enteric nervous system and gut: structure, function, and motility</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease is increasingly recognized as affecting not only the central nervous system but also the autonomic nervous system, comprising the enteric nervous system, and thus the gut. Given the structural and functional similarities between the enteric and central nervous system, including susceptibility to A{beta}, this study investigated the early and acute effects of monomeric A{beta} on primary enteric neurons in vitro and on intestinal motility ex vivo. Acute A{beta} application caused marked neuronal hyperexcitability, with increased spike frequencies and calcium influx, and led to enhanced intestinal contractility without altering frequency or timing. Prolonged 72-hour exposure did not induce cell death or apoptosis but significantly reduced neurite outgrowth and decreased synaptic markers and beta II tubulin. These findings suggest that acute A{beta} primarily drives the excitability of enteric neurons and intestinal motility, while prolonged exposure subsequently leads to structural and synaptic changes. Overall, the study points to early dysfunction of the enteric nervous system in Alzheimer's disease and highlights the gut as a potential target for early interventions.

">α2A-AR-Kv dysfunction drives LC hyperactivity and early sleep disturbance in amyloidogenic mice</a></h4>

              
                Disrupted sleep-wake patterns are common in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), can emerge early, and are proposed as potent risk factors for disease onset and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report that 5xFAD transgenic mice exhibit hyperarousal and reduced brain-state transitions, particularly during the dark phase, as early as two months of age. The Locus Coeruleus (LC), a key regulator of arousal and brain-state transitions and a region highly vulnerable in AD, shows time-specific hyperactivity during this phase. This increased tonic LC activity is mediated by heightened neuronal excitability due to impaired Kv4 and Kv7 potassium channel conductance. Pharmacological activation of 2A adrenergic receptors restored Kv4 and Kv7 function and normalized LC activity. Furthermore, local administration of the 2A agonist guanfacine or the Kv7 positive allosteric modulator retigabine substantially rescued the sleep-wake disturbances in young 5xFAD mice. These findings identify dark-phase-selective LC hyperexcitability as a key driver of early-onset sleep disruption in AD mice and implicate 2A adrenergic receptors and Kv7 channels as promising targets for early intervention.

We recorded rating scores and brain activities related to nationalism and patriotism statements that were dissected into affective (ie positive emotions pertaining to one’s own country or negative emotions pertaining to other countries) and cognitive (ie beliefs of the excellence of one’s own country or superiority of one’s own country over other countries) dimensions. Principal component analyses of the rating scores showed that the affective and cognitive components of nationalism vs. patriotism are disjointed to a larger degree. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results revealed that, while the right middle temporal cortex responded differentially to the affective and cognitive components of patriotism, a more extensive neural network, including the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral/orbital frontal cortices, insula, and temporal–parietal junction, responded differentially to the 2 components of nationalism statements. Moreover, the left frontal response to the affective nationalism statements mediated the link between nationalism-related emotions and behavioral tendencies to help other countries. Our findings unravel distinct psychological and neural constructs of patriotism and nationalism that advance our understanding of nation-related decision-making and behaviors.</span>

">Flexible Working Memory in the Peripheral Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) representations that are distributed across the brain can be flexibly recruited to best guide behavior. For instance, information may be represented relatively more strongly in visual cortex when a WM task requires fine visual detail, or more strongly in motor cortex when a specific response can be prepared. If WM is geared to prospectively guide actions, then we might also expect such task-oriented neural signals to propagate to the peripheral sensors and effectors that realize WM goals. Likewise, there is now evidence that oculomotor signals like saccade biases can track simple visuo-spatial WM features. However, it is unclear if such signatures are functionally meaningful, and how much information is contained in them. Here, we test the idea that WM content is adaptively distributed across the nervous system according to behavioral demands. Namely, we test whether visual WM stimulus features are expressed in patterns of both eye and hand movements during a WM delay, and whether the distribution of such peripheral motor activity shifts with the task context. In a delayed recall task, we manipulated how human participants reported their memory by having them either draw a line or adjust a wheel to match a remembered orientation. Via eye- and stylus-tracking, we found that remembered orientations were decodable from small inflections in both gaze and hand movements during the blank WM delay. Moreover, this decoding strength varied by response format: gaze patterns tracked memorized features relatively better in the wheel condition (vs. draw), while hand movements were better in the draw condition (vs. wheel). Individuals who showed greater wheel benefits in gaze-based decoding also showed greater draw benefits in hand-based decoding, suggesting a strategic processing shift to the more relevant system. Therefore, visually encoded WM contents may be adaptively allocated to the most task-relevant motor effectors, balancing WM representations across peripheral activity according to behavioral needs.

">Human dorsal root ganglia neuronal cell line to study nociceptive signaling: a new pipeline for pain therapy.</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptive afferent neurons within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) detect and relay painful stimuli from the periphery to the brain, and the malfunctioning of this process leads to sustained pain states. Animal model studies have been invaluable for demonstrating the importance of the DRG nociceptor in pain sensation and the development of related analgesic targets. However, there are functional biological differences between human and animal model nociceptors. Therefore, a complementary in vitro model of human nociception is critical to confirming the relevance of preclinical findings for therapeutic drug development. We characterized the nociceptive properties of differentiated cells from the human DRG-derived immortalized cell line HD10.6. Within differentiated HD10.6 cells, we documented the abundance and localization of nociceptive machinery central to regulating excitability and linked with pain sensation including ion channels TRPV1 and NaV1.7 and afferent peptides CGRP and Substance P. Using calcium influx imaging assays, we confirmed the electrical functionality of TRPV1 and NaV1.7 in HD10.6 cells, and through whole-cell patch clamp, we found similar baseline electrophysiological parameters of HD10.6 cells to those previously observed in human patient DRGs. Further, we found that differentiated HD10.6 cells express the mu opioid receptor 1 protein, and DAMGO, a mu agonist, blocks depolarization-evoked calcium influx in a naloxone-reversible fashion. Importantly, using an inflammatory cocktail, excitation and peripheral sensitization are induced within HD10.6 cells, mirroring nociceptors in a pain state during or after tissue damage or inflammation. Finally, HD10.6 cells were also cultured into dual-chambered microfluidic devices to mirror the biological anatomy of the nociceptor. Within this system, we demonstrated the uptake of adeno-associated-virus (AAV) by the peripheral terminals and AAV transport to the soma. Altogether, we have developed the use of HD10.6 cells to create a system of human nociceptive signaling on a chip to study human nociceptor physiology and intervention.

">Human patient-specific FOXG1 syndrome mouse model revealed FOXG1-MYCN-mediated regulation of protein homeostasis in neurodevelopmental disorder</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by disruptions in brain development, resulting in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments. FOXG1 syndrome (FS), caused by heterozygous mutations in the FOXG1 gene, exemplifies a severe monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder. To investigate its pathogenesis, we generated a patient-specific W300X mouse model carrying a truncation variant of FOXG1. We found that the truncated FOXG1 protein in W300X-heterozygous (W300X-Het) mice is more abundant and more nuclear-localized than the full-length FOXG1 protein, implicating a pathogenic mechanism involving the truncated protein. Interestingly, W300X-Het mice exhibited profound abnormalities in the dentate gyrus, including disrupted neurogenesis, impaired granule cell migration, and altered dendritic morphology. Transcriptomic profiling identified broad dysregulation in protein homeostasis pathways, particularly ribosomal biogenesis, translation, and proteostasis. Disruption of the FOXG1-MYCN pathway, critical for robust protein synthesis during neural stem cell division, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, emerged as a key mechanism underlying these defects. In parallel, microglial activation and inflammation were markedly increased in the dentate gyrus, contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment that exacerbates neurogenic and structural deficits. Consistent with hippocampal dysfunction in FS patients, W300X-Het mice exhibited significant spatial learning and memory impairments. Together, our study highlights disrupted protein homeostasis and neuroinflammation as key drivers of FS pathogenesis, providing a framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

">Parkinson's disease LRRK2 mutations dysregulate iron homeostasis and promote oxidative stress and ferroptosis in human neurons and astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Background: Iron accumulation is a hallmark of sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology and correlates with clinical motor symptom severity. The biochemical mechanisms driving iron dyshomeostasis in PD brain and whether these are early or late event in the neurodegenerative process remain unknown. Elevated nigral iron levels have been reported in LRRK2 mutation carriers, both in PD patients compared to idiopathic PD and in asymptomatic carriers relative to controls, suggesting that iron accumulation precedes clinical onset in LRRK2-associated PD. However, the precise consequence of pathogenic LRRK2 mutations on cellular iron handling within neurons and glial cells remains unclear. Methods: Here, we investigated different readouts of iron homeostasis in iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes from PD patients harboring G2019S or R1441C/G LRRK2 mutations or healthy controls, as well as an isogenic iPSC panel with the same variants. By using high-content and super-resolution microscopy of iron-specific probes, we assayed iron content and distribution in cells and examined the downstream effects of iron dyshomeostasis on ferroptosis signaling. Results: We show that heterozygous LRRK2 mutations dysregulate cellular iron across iPSCs, neurons and astrocytes, in a kinase-dependent manner. Lysosomal ferrous iron storage was consistently elevated across iPSCs, iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes carrying LRRK2 mutations. LRRK2 regulates Rab GTPase function through their direct phosphorylation, and our prior work revealed significant but divergent lysosomal phenotypes between Rab8a and Rab10 knockout models. Here, we report that Rab8a knockout recapitulates key aspects of LRRK2 mutation phenotypes on intracellular iron and ferritin levels, although with differences in magnitude and specificity. By contrast, Rab10 deficiency showed opposing effects, suggesting distinct roles for these well-established LRRK2 substrates in iron homeostasis. Finally, we show that basal lipid peroxidation and ROS levels are elevated in isogenic LRRK2 mutant neurons, while iron chelation was sufficient to reduce LRRK2-dependent ROS. Conclusions: Together, our findings demonstrate that LRRK2 mutations disrupt iron homeostasis across disease-relevant cell types and establish a discrete biochemical pathway linking LRRK2 signaling and vulnerability to ferroptosis. Ongoing work aims to further dissect the roles of Rab substrates in these pathways.

">Dendritic Interaction of Timescales in Afterdepolarization Potentials and Nonmonotonic Spike--adding</a></h4>

              
                Depolarizations that occur after action potentials, known as afterdepolarization potentials or ADPs, are important for neuronal excitability and stimulus evoked transient bursting. Slow inward and fast outward currents underlie the generation of such ADPs with modulation of ADP amplitudes occurring as a result of neuronal morphology. However, the relative contribution and role of these slow inward and fast outward currents in ADP generation is poorly understood in the context of somatic and dendritic localization as well as with varied dendritic properties. Using a two compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley type model, the role of somatic and dendritic compartmentalization of ADP associated currents is investigated, revealing that dendritic (rather than somatic) slow inward and fast outward currents are the main contributors to ADP and spike-adding during both brief step current and AMPA current input. Additionally, dendritic size and passive properties of the dendrites were found to be key modulators of ADP amplitude. However, increasing magnitudes of NMDA current conductance resulted in nonmonotonic spike-adding in a manner dependent on dendritic Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ activated K+ currents, which was found to be the result of tight regulation of stimulus evoked transient bursting through positive feedback on action potential generation by dendritic Ca2+ and subsequent negative feedback through Ca2+ activated K+ currents. This novel mechanism of ADP and spike-adding regulation highlights the role of currents with slow timescales in ADPs, stimulus evoked bursting and neuronal excitability with implications for Ca2+ dependent synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation.

">Tmem117, an oligodendrocyte-enriched regulator of NCX activity, links myelin homeostasis to counterregulation and metabolic health.</a></h4>

              
                The counterregulatory response (CRR) to hypoglycemia is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanism orchestrated by the central nervous system (CNS) to ensure survival during glucose scarcity. In individuals with diabetes, this response is frequently impaired, contributing to life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemia. Tmem117 was previously identified in a genetic screen as a promising hypothalamic regulator of CRR. Our previous work highlighted its contribution to CRR through regulation of vasopressin secretion. Here, we reveal that Tmem117 is also enriched in cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage and we characterize the contribution of oligodendrocytic Tmem117 in CRR. We show that depletion of Tmem117 from either all oligodendrocyte lineage cells or only mature oligodendrocytes leads to myelin deficits and male-specific defects in CRR. Furthermore, we reveal that transient, adult-onset depletion of Tmem117 in mature oligodendrocytes is sufficient to induce long-lasting metabolic imbalances in male mice, suggesting that defects in oligodendrocytes and myelin can affect peripheral glucose homeostasis. Mechanistically, we provide for the first-time insights on the function of Tmem117 showing that it regulates intracellular calcium dynamics through its interaction with the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1. Together, these results redefine our understanding of the cellular contributors to the CRR, highlight the importance of oligodendrocytes in systemic glucose regulation, and position Tmem117 as a promising molecular target for cell-specific manipulation of NCX activity.

">Mapping the Structural Brain Network of Psychopathy: Convergent Evidence from Humans and Chimpanzees</a></h4>

              
                Psychopathy, a condition characterized by profound emotional and interpersonal deficits, has long been hypothesized to stem, in part, from structural brain abnormalities. Yet, neuroimaging findings remain inconsistent. To address these discrepancies, we applied a novel structural network mapping approach combined with cross-species analyses. Traditional meta-analysis revealed weak spatial convergence across 20 samples. Nevertheless, we found that heterogeneous peak locations coalesced into a distributed set of regions encompassing the insular, and prefrontal cortices. This network overlapped strikingly (r = .93) with a lesion-derived network causally linked to antisocial behaviour, and variation within it predicted volumetric risk scores in both humans (n = 107, R2 = .16) and chimpanzees (n = 148, R2 = .21). These findings suggest that psychopathy reflects abnormalities across a collection of distributed regions rather than isolated areas, providing a unifying explanation for decades of inconsistent results and advancing our understanding of its clinical, biological, and evolutionary bases.

">PRRT2 as an auxiliary regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation</a></h4>

              
                During sustained activity, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels enter a slow inactivation state to limit cellular hyperexcitability. Disruption of this regulatory process has been implicated in skeletal, cardiac and neurological disorders. While the kinetics of this process are well characterized, its endogenous modulators remain unclear. Here, we identify Proline-Rich Transmembrane Protein 2 (PRRT2) as a native regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation. We show that PRRT2 facilitates the entry of Nav channels into slow-inactivated state and delays their recovery, a regulatory effect conserved from zebrafish to humans. PRRT2 forms molecular complexes with Nav channels both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse cortex, PRRT2 deficiency impairs the slow inactivation of Nav channels in neuronal axons, leading to reduced cortical resilience in response to hyperexcitable challenges. Together, these findings establish PRRT2 as a physiological modulator of Nav channel slow inactivation and reveal a mechanism that supports cortical resilience to pathological perturbations.

">Postpartum enhancement of spatial learning and cognitive flexibility: an IntelliCage study</a></h4>

              
                The transition to motherhood has been shown to result in significant changes in the structure and function of the brain, with particular emphasis on the enhancement of cognitive abilities that are essential for survival. Specifically, in murine models, spatial learning and cognitive flexibility have been identified as critical components of mothering. These abilities facilitate efficient navigation of the environment, resource acquisition, and responsiveness to offspring's needs. While cognitive enhancements during the postpartum period have been observed in various experimental setups, research using long-term data collection with automated monitoring in home cage setup is completely lacking even though it provides a more reliable approach than other experimental procedures. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by systematically examining spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in female mice during the reproductive stages using IntelliCage, with the objective of offering a more comprehensive understanding of maternal cognitive adaptations. Utilising the IntelliCage system, we observed that female mice in the postpartum phase outperformed pregnant and nulliparous females in place learning, reversal learning, and fixed schedule drinking tasks, demonstrating faster adaptation and superior retention of information. These paradigms mirror real-world challenges faced by mothers, such as navigating resources and balancing caregiving with self-maintenance. The enhanced performance demonstrated by the mothers could be attributed to their heightened motivation and cognitive abilities, potentially influenced by substantial hormonal shifts, which have been known to modify neuroplasticity in critical brain regions. The identification of these improvements in maternal behaviour may offer novel insights into the impact of reproductive experiences on brain function, with implications for maternal health and broader cognitive research.

">Sustained dynamics of saccadic inhibition and adaptive oculomotor responses during continuous exploration</a></h4>

              
                In natural environments, stimuli often recur across time and space, requiring the visual system to remain sensitive to novelty while managing predictability. A central question in systems neuroscience is how motor systems adapt to repeated sensory events without compromising responsiveness. We investigated this adaptive capacity using saccadic inhibition (SI), a reflexive suppression of eye movements triggered by sudden visual transients, as a probe of oculomotor dynamics during naturalistic viewing. Human participants (N = 21) freely explored visual arrays while brief gaze-contingent flashes appeared five times at random intervals, either foveally or parafoveally. SI reliably occurred ~120 ms post-flash across repetitions and locations, indicating robust sensory-driven inhibition. However, the rebound phase, reflecting saccade reprogramming, showed a progressive decline. In a second experiment (N = 19), only the first or the fifth flash was visible on each trial. In this case, neither inhibition nor rebound was altered, suggesting that the rebound decline is driven by repeated sensory stimulation rather than exploration time. This dissociation reveals selective habituation of motor re-engagement mechanisms, while reflexive inhibitory gating remains stable. We propose that inhibition is mediated by circuitry that transiently suppresses saccade initiation and resists habituation. By contrast, the weakening rebound reflects a separate, habituation-prone route that reduces saccade generation to irrelevant events. Functionally, this imbalance implies a recalibration within the saccade generator, preserving inhibitory capacity while constraining motor output. Our findings uncover a distinct form of oculomotor habituation and demonstrate how SI reveals dynamic decoupling of sensory input and motor output under repeated stimulation.

">Exercise-induced DNA damage response and memory formation in mice</a></h4>

              
                This study reveals that acute aerobic exercise enhances memory formation through a controlled DNA damage mechanism, offering crucial insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention. This work challenges the traditional view that DNA damage is inherently harmful, demonstrating that minor, reversible DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) induced by exercise serve as necessary primers for memory consolidation - a mechanism that may be impaired in AD pathogenesis. AD affects 1 in 9 adults over 65, with ~95% being late-onset cases where up to 40% of risk factors are modifiable through lifestyle interventions like exercise. While exercise demonstrably lowers AD risk, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study provides a missing mechanistic link by showing how exercise-induced DNA damage repair systems could counteract the DNA damage accumulation and repair dysregulation that are established hallmarks of brain aging and AD. In data presented herein, young mice showed significantly higher SSB rates in active genomic regions compared to aged mice, suggesting the decline of a protective mechanism (i.e., hormesis) with aging - potentially explaining increased AD susceptibility in older adults. The present study also suggests that exercise-induced SSBs are not random cellular damage but precisely targeted events that occur at genes essential for neuroplasticity, synaptic function, and memory formation. These breaks activate PARP1 (Poly ADP ribose polymerase 1), a crucial DNA damage sensor that simultaneously initiates repair processes while facilitating transcriptional programs necessary for memory consolidation. This mechanism may represent how exercise "primes" the brain against the pathological DNA damage accumulation seen in AD. In support of this, in behavioral experiments, a single exercise bout converted sub-threshold learning into robust long-term memory formation. This memory enhancement correlated with upregulation of both neurotrophic genes (BDNF, Fos) and DNA repair enzymes (PARP1, PARP2), demonstrating coordinated damage-repair processes that appear compromised in AD. We identify HPF1 as a critical cofactor enabling PARP1 to perform trans-ADP-ribosylation of histones, linking DNA damage sensing to epigenetic chromatin remodeling required for memory-related gene expression. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic target for AD, as restoring efficient DNA repair mechanisms might slow or prevent memory loss.

">Combinatorial protein barcodes enable self-correcting neuron tracing with nanoscale molecular context</a></h4>

              
                Mapping nanoscale neuronal morphology with molecular annotations is critical for understanding healthy and dysfunctional brain circuits. Current methods are constrained by image segmentation errors and by sample defects (e.g., signal gaps, section loss). Genetic strategies promise to overcome these challenges by using easily distinguishable cell identity labels. However, multicolor approaches are spectrally limited in diversity, whereas nucleic acid barcoding lacks a cell-filling morphology signal for segmentation. Here, we introduce PRISM (Protein-barcode Reconstruction via Iterative Staining with Molecular annotations), a platform that integrates combinatorial delivery of antigenically distinct, cell-filling proteins with tissue expansion, multi-cycle imaging, barcode-augmented reconstruction, and molecular annotation. Protein barcodes increase label diversity by >750-fold over multicolor labeling and enable morphology reconstruction with intrinsic error correction. We acquired a [~]10 million m3 volume of mouse hippocampal area CA2/3, multiplexed across 23 barcode antigen and synaptic marker channels. By combining barcodes with shape information we achieve an 8x increase in automatic tracing accuracy of genetically labelled neurons. We demonstrate PRISM supports automatic proofreading across micron-scale spatial gaps and reconnects neurites across discontinuities spanning hundreds of microns. Using PRISM's molecular annotation capability, we map the distribution of synapses onto traced neural morphology, characterizing challenging synaptic structures such as thorny excrescences (TEs), and discovering a size correlation among spatially proximal TEs on the same dendrite. PRISM thus supports self-correcting neuron reconstruction with molecular context.

                <p>Behavioral neuroscience research often requires substantial financial investment in specialized equipment and software, creating barriers for new investigators and limiting the flexibility of established laboratories. This study explores how 3D printing and machine learning can be combined to reduce startup and operational costs while maintaining research quality. Using 3D printing, we designed and manufactured a mouse T-maze and elevated plus maze to assess cognition and anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. These custom-built mazes demonstrated comparable efficacy with commercial alternatives while offering greater affordability, scalability, and customization. To complement the hardware, we integrated machine learning for automated tracking and analysis of mouse behavior, achieving accuracy equivalent to commercial solutions or experienced human scoring at significantly reduced cost. By combining 3D printing with machine learning, our approach significantly lowers financial barriers for new investigators and enables established research groups to allocate resources more effectively. This approach not only expands research possibilities for established labs but also lowers the barrier to entry for early-career scientists and institutions with limited funding.</p>

                <p>Visual responses in the cortex are strongly influenced by shifts in spatial attention. This modulation of visual processing includes changes in firing rate, decreased response variability, and decreased interneuronal correlations; all of which are thought to underlie enhanced perception near the center of attention at the cost of perception at other locations. Information from the retina is relayed to primary visual cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Although early studies describe an enhancement of LGN activity with spatial attention, more recent work has cast doubt on this view. Given its strategic position as the gateway to the cortex, an understanding of the effects of attention on visual processing in the LGN is important. We therefore performed experiments to reexamine the influence of spatial attention on spiking activity in macaque LGN (one male, one female) and applied a broad set of analyses and functional metrics to assess possible effects. Our results reveal a statistically significant effect of spatial attention in the LGN: firing rates were slightly higher and more reliable when monkeys directed attention toward the receptive fields of recorded neurons compared with when attention was directed to different retinotopic locations. However, effects were much smaller than previously reported (~1 vs ~4%) and further analyses suggest that effects are weak, inconsistent, and restricted to a small subset of parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Thus, while spatial attention does exert an influence in the LGN, its effects are weak and may have limited impact on downstream processing.</p>

                <p>The environment experienced by children, such as exposure to chronic early life adversity (ELA), increases lifespan brain disorder risk. The mechanisms that link ELA exposure to functional brain disruptions are not well understood. A limited-bedding and nesting paradigm, in which ELA is induced in mouse pups over the first postnatal week through disruption of maternal care, is characterized by limited resources, environment unpredictability, and disruption of reward and cognitive behaviors. Studies using this model demonstrated sex-selective alterations in hippocampal mitochondrial-associated proteins in response to ELA compared with care as usual (CAU). Further, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and complex I activity are increased in ELA juveniles, yet decreased in adults, with the impact of ELA moderated by sex in adults. Given that altered mitochondrial function is a key mediator in metabolic adaptations, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of reversing mitochondrial dysfunction and the anhedonia that accompanies ELA by addressing oxidative stress. Treatment with the antioxidant MitoQ began at weaning and extended to 3&nbsp;months. Measures of complex I activity demonstrated full recovery in adults. Female-specific deficits in the sucrose preference task, which is a measure of rewarding behavior in rodents, also exhibited recovery, with preference for sucrose comparable with that of CAU mice. These data indicate that mitochondrial health is one component of responses to early life adversity that has lifespan implications, but with the capacity to recover normal functioning in adults.</p>

A majority of all infectious diseases manifest some climate-sensitivity. However, many of those sensitivities are not well understood as meteorological drivers of infectious diseases co-occur with other drivers exhibiting complex non-linear influences and feedback. This makes it hard to dissect their individual contributions. Here we apply a novel deep learning Explainable AI (XAI) compartment model with covariate drivers and dynamic feedback to predict and explain the dengue incidence across Sri Lanka. We compare the compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model to a deep learning model without a compartmental structure. We find that the covariate compartmental hybrid model performs better and can describe drivers of the dengue spatiotemporal incidence over time. The strongest drivers in our model in order of importance are precipitation, socio-demographics, and normalized vegetation index. The novel method demonstrated can be used to leverage known infectious disease dynamics while accounting for the influence of other drivers and different population immunity contexts. While allowing for interpretation of the covariate driver influences, the approach bridges the gap between dynamical compartmental and data driven dynamical models.

The spread of infectious diseases is shaped by spatial and temporal aspects, such as host population structure or changes in the transmission rate or number of infected individuals over time. These spatiotemporal dynamics are imprinted in the genomes of pathogens and can be recovered from those genomes using phylodynamics methods. However, phylodynamic methods typically quantify either the temporal or spatial transmission dynamics, which leads to unclear biases, as one can potentially not be inferred without the other. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a structured coalescent skyline approach, MASCOT-Skyline, that allows us to jointly infer spatial and temporal transmission dynamics of infectious diseases using Markov chain Monte Carlo inference. To do so, we model the effective population size dynamics in different locations using a non-parametric function, allowing us to approximate a range of population size dynamics. We show, using a range of different viral outbreak datasets, potential issues with phylogeographic methods. We then use these viral datasets to motivate simulations of outbreaks that illuminate the nature of biases present in the different phylogeographic methods. We show that spatial and temporal dynamics should be modeled jointly, even if one seeks to recover just one of the two. Further, we showcase conditions under which we can expect phylogeographic analyses to be biased, particularly different subsampling approaches, as well as provide recommendations on when we can expect them to perform well. We implemented MASCOT-Skyline as part of the open-source software package MASCOT for the Bayesian phylodynamics platform BEAST2.

                <p>by Jennifer D. Senta, Sonia J. Bishop, Anne G.E. Collins</p>

Anxiety has been robustly linked to deficits in frontal executive function including working memory (WM) and attentional control processes. However, although anxiety has also been associated with impaired performance on learning tasks, computational investigations of reinforcement learning (RL) impairment in anxiety have yielded mixed results. WM processes are known to contribute to learning behavior in parallel to RL processes and to modulate the effective learning rate as a function of load. However, WM processes have typically not been modeled in investigations of anxiety and RL. In the current study, we leveraged an experimental paradigm (RLWM) which manipulates the relative contributions of WM and RL processes in a reinforcement learning and retention task using multiple stimulus set sizes. Using a computational model of interactive RL and WM processes, we investigated whether individual differences in physiological or cognitive anxiety impacted task performance via deficits in RL or WM. Elevated physiological, but not cognitive, anxiety scores were strongly associated with worse performance during learning and retention testing across all set sizes. Computationally, higher physiological anxiety scores were significantly related to reduced learning rate and increased rate of WM decay. To highlight the importance of modeling WM contributions to learning, we considered the effect of fitting RL models without WM modules to the data. Here we found that reduced learning performance for higher physiological anxiety was at least partially misattributed to stochastic decision noise in 9 out of 10 RL-only models considered. These findings reveal a dual-process impairment in learning in anxiety that is linked to a more physiological than cognitive anxiety phenotype. More broadly, this work also points to the importance of accounting for the contribution of WM to RL when investigating psychopathology-related deficits in learning.

                <p>by Martin Sládek, Pavel Houdek, Tomáš Čajka, Alena Sumová</p>

The ontogenesis of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and its sensitivity to maternal signals are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the development of the clock in the rat SCN from the fetal to the postweaning period and identified rhythmic metabolic signals from the mother to the fetal SCN. We determined daily expression profiles of clock genes (<i>Per2</i>, <i>Nr1d1</i>, <i>Bmal1</i>) and clock- and metabolism-related genes (<i>Dbp</i>, <i>E4bp4</i>) and performed time-resolved analysis of the metabolome and lipidome in the SCN and plasma of 19-day-old embryos (E19) and 2-, 10-, 20-, and 28-day-old pups (P02–28). Our data show that rhythms in the expression of canonical clock genes are absent at E19 and develop gradually until P10, but the <i>Dbp</i> rhythm was still developing between P20 and P28. Expression of the metabolism-sensitive gene <i>E4bp4</i> and levels of essential amino acids and other metabolites supplied by maternal food are rhythmic in the fetal SCN, which is lost after birth at P02 and reappears later in the postnatal period. Maternal food-derived metabolites were also rhythmic in fetal plasma. The temporal coherence of the fetal SCN metabolome and lipidome declines markedly and its rhythmicity disappears immediately after birth. The results revealed previously unforeseen pathways by which the fetal SCN may receive rhythmic information from the mother before its clock develops.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binds exclusively the c-Met surface receptor, and the HGF/c-Met axis regulates T cell function in autoimmune diseases. We analyzed c-Met expression on human CD4 T cells in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) versus non-inflammatory neurological disease (NIND), to better understand the role of CD4 T cells in MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 34 untreated MS patients (age 28–44 years) and 13 NIND (age 34–51 years) who underwent paired blood and CSF sampling at the time of diagnosis work-up. Phenotypic and functional CD4 T cells characterization was determined by flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing. Adhesion and transmigration capacities were studied to further characterize the function of c-Met<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>c-Met<sup>+</sup> memory CD4 T cells were detected at higher levels in both blood (median of 1.98%) and CSF (5.88%) in MS compared to NIND (0.37% and 0.68%, respectively) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Ex vivo c-Met<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells exhibited higher levels of GM-CSF, interleukin (IL)-17, interferon (IFN)-γ$$ \upgamma $$, and double positive IL-17<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ$$ \gamma $$<sup>+</sup> expression, compared with c-Met<sup>−</sup> CD4 T cells. c-Met<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells expressed increased levels of integrins—Itgα4β1 (VLA-4) and ItgαLβ2 (LFA-1)—compared with c-Met<sup>−</sup> CD4 T cells. Anti-Itgα4 (natalizumab) and anti-ItgαLβ2 (odulimomab) inhibited CD4 T cell transmigration with predominant inhibition of CD4 T cells expressing c-Met.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results emphasize c-Met as an immune marker of highly pro-inflammatory and migratory CD4 T lymphocytes in both the periphery and central nervous system of MS patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="Back Again to the Future: A New Era for Cerebroprotection"/>
<p>Cerebroprotection is a fresh framework for designing neurological therapy that targets glia and vascular cells, in addition to neurons. In the future, successful cerebroprotection will involve targeting all elements of the neurovascular unit. Preclinical trials must include functional outcomes, as well as lesion morphometry. Utmost rigor and transparency must be required of preclinical studies. With optimal targeting, proper endpoints, and improved rigor, future clinical trials will have a higher likelihood of success. Created with Biorender.
</p>
<br/>
<p>In multiple disease areas, neurology has failed to translate promising treatments from positive preclinical studies to successful clinical trial results. Despite this history, we persist in testing new, putative neuroprotectants using the same concepts, approaches, and methods without much modification. Recent novel data and new concepts offer an opportunity to break with past doctrine decisively, and open a new era of different approaches, methods, and strategies for studying future protections for brain injury.
