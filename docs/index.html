              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11494">Rhythm Generation, Robustness, and Control in Stick Insect Locomotion: Modeling and Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stick insect stepping patterns have been studied for insights about locomotor rhythm generation and control, because the underlying neural system is relatively accessible experimentally and produces a variety of rhythmic outputs. Harnessing the experimental identification of effective interactions among neuronal units involved in stick insect stepping pattern generation, previous studies proposed computational models simulating aspects of stick insect locomotor activity. While these models generate diverse stepping patterns and transitions between them, there has not been an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying their dynamics. In this study, we focus on modeling rhythm generation by the neurons associated with the protraction-retraction, levitation-depression, and extension-flexion antagonistic muscle pairs of the mesothoracic (middle) leg of stick insects. Our model features a reduced central pattern generator (CPG) circuit for each joint and includes synaptic interactions among the CPGs; we also consider extensions such as the inclusion of motoneuron pools controlled by the CPG components. The resulting network is described by an 18-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We use fast-slow decomposition, projection into interacting phase planes, and a heavy reliance on input-dependent nullclines to analyze this model. Specifically, we identify and elucidate dynamic mechanisms capable of generating a stepping rhythm, with a sequence of biologically constrained phase relationships, in a three-joint stick insect limb model. Furthermore, we explain the robustness to parameter changes and tunability of these patterns. In particular, the model allows us to identify possible mechanisms by which neuromodulatory and top-down effects could tune stepping pattern output frequency.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12188">Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14477">RISE-iEEG: Robust to Inter-Subject Electrodes Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is increasingly used for clinical and brain-computer interface applications due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. However, inter-subject variability in electrode implantation poses a challenge for developing generalized neural decoders. To address this, we introduce a novel decoder model that is robust to inter-subject electrode implantation variability. We call this model RISE-iEEG, which stands for Robust to Inter-Subject Electrode Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier. RISE-iEEG employs a deep neural network structure preceded by a participant-specific projection network. The projection network maps the neural data of individual participants onto a common low-dimensional space, compensating for the implantation variability. In other words, we developed an iEEG decoder model that can be applied across multiple participants' data without requiring the coordinates of electrode for each participant. The performance of RISE-iEEG across multiple datasets, including the Music Reconstruction dataset, and AJILE12 dataset, surpasses that of advanced iEEG decoder models such as HTNet and EEGNet. Our analysis shows that the performance of RISE-iEEG is about 7\% higher than that of HTNet and EEGNet in terms of F1 score, with an average F1 score of 0.83, which is the highest result among the evaluation methods defined. Furthermore, Our analysis of the projection network weights reveals that the Superior Temporal and Postcentral lobes are key encoding nodes for the Music Reconstruction and AJILE12 datasets, which aligns with the primary physiological principles governing these regions. This model improves decoding accuracy while maintaining interpretability and generalization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13729">Emergence of the Primacy Effect in Structured State-Space Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.13729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of the sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11568">Adaptively Pruned Spiking Neural Networks for Energy-Efficient Intracortical Neural Decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracortical brain-machine interfaces demand low-latency, energy-efficient solutions for neural decoding. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) deployed on neuromorphic hardware have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in neural decoding by leveraging sparse binary activations and efficient spatiotemporal processing. However, reducing the computational cost of SNNs remains a critical challenge for developing ultra-efficient intracortical neural implants. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive pruning algorithm specifically designed for SNNs with high activation sparsity, targeting intracortical neural decoding. Our method dynamically adjusts pruning decisions and employs a rollback mechanism to selectively eliminate redundant synaptic connections without compromising decoding accuracy. Experimental evaluation on the NeuroBench Non-Human Primate (NHP) Motor Prediction benchmark shows that our pruned network achieves performance comparable to dense networks, with a maximum tenfold improvement in efficiency. Moreover, hardware simulation on the neuromorphic processor reveals that the pruned network operates at sub-$\mu$W power levels, underscoring its potential for energy-constrained neural implants. These results underscore the promise of our approach for advancing energy-efficient intracortical brain-machine interfaces with low-overhead on-device intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11620">Graph-Theoretic Measures for Interpretable Multicriteria Decision Making in Emergency Department Layout Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcrowding in emergency departments (ED) is a persistent problem exacerbated by population growth, emergence of pandemics, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. Thus, automated approaches for ED layout design have recently emerged as promising tools for boosting healthcare service quality. Still, ED design typically involves multiple conflicting objectives, where the interpretability of the associated solutions depends on the availability of intuitive metrics that can capture ED layout complexity. In this paper, we propose graph-theoretic measures to evaluate and rank ED layouts produced by a multi-objective metaheuristic optimization framework with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and generalized differential evolution (GDE3). Indeed, Pareto-optimal ED layouts were sought to minimize patient flow cost while maximizing closeness between ED service areas. Then, the layouts were evaluated based on local graph measures (degree centrality, betweenness, clustering coefficient, closeness centrality, nodal strength, and eccentricity) as well as global ones (global efficiency, network characteristic path length and transitivity). Then, a multi-criteria decision-making technique was employed to rank the layouts based on either the objective functions, the graph measures, or combinations of both. The ranking results on a real-world scenario show that the top-ranking layouts are the ones with the best graph-theoretic values. This shows that the graph-theoretic measures can enhance solution interpretability and hence help medical planners in selecting the best layouts. In comparison with the input layout, optimal NSGA-II and GDE3 solutions reduce the patient flow cost by 18.32% and 11.42%, respectively. Also, the two solutions improve the closeness by 14.5% and 18.02%, respectively.

                arXiv:2504.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a known growing challenge for radio astronomy, intensified by increasing observatory sensitivity and prevalence of orbital RFI sources. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution for real-time RFI detection by exploiting the time-varying nature of radio observation and neuron dynamics together. This work explores the inclusion of polarisation information in SNN-based RFI detection, using simulated data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) instrument and provides power usage estimates for deploying SNN-based RFI detection on existing neuromorphic hardware. Preliminary results demonstrate state-of-the-art detection accuracy and highlight possible extensive energy-efficiency gains.

                arXiv:2504.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature has long inspired the development of swarm intelligence (SI), a key branch of artificial intelligence that models collective behaviors observed in biological systems for solving complex optimization problems. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is widely adopted among SI algorithms due to its simplicity and efficiency. Despite numerous learning strategies proposed to enhance PSO's performance in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and adaptability, no comprehensive and systematic analysis of these strategies exists. We review and classify various learning strategies to address this gap, assessing their impact on optimization performance. Additionally, a comparative experimental evaluation is conducted to examine how these strategies influence PSO's search dynamics. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for self-adaptive, intelligent PSO variants capable of addressing increasingly complex real-world problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11840">GT-SVQ: A Linear-Time Graph Transformer for Node Classification Using Spiking Vector Quantization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs), which simultaneously integrate message-passing and self-attention mechanisms, have achieved promising empirical results in some graph prediction tasks. Although these approaches show the potential of Transformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues concerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption severely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as brain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the development of graph representation learning methods with lower computational and storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using Spiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ reconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and injects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global information in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization effectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery (distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector quantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved competitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.

                arXiv:2504.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces EngramNCA, a neural cellular automaton (NCA) that integrates both publicly visible states and private, cell-internal memory channels, drawing inspiration from emerging biological evidence suggesting that memory storage extends beyond synaptic modifications to include intracellular mechanisms. The proposed model comprises two components: GeneCA, an NCA trained to develop distinct morphologies from seed cells containing immutable "gene" encodings, and GenePropCA, an auxiliary NCA that modulates the private "genetic" memory of cells without altering their visible states. This architecture enables the encoding and propagation of complex morphologies through the interaction of visible and private channels, facilitating the growth of diverse structures from a shared "genetic" substrate. EngramNCA supports the emergence of hierarchical and coexisting morphologies, offering insights into decentralized memory storage and transfer in artificial systems. These findings have potential implications for the development of adaptive, self-organizing systems and may contribute to the broader understanding of memory mechanisms in both biological and synthetic contexts.

                arXiv:2504.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, Supply Chain Management (SCM) faces challenges in adopting advanced optimization techniques due to the "black-box" nature of most AI-based solutions, which causes reluctance among company stakeholders. To overcome this issue, in this work, we employ an Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (IAI) approach that combines evolutionary computation with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to generate interpretable decision-making policies in the form of decision trees. This IAI solution is embedded within a simulation-based optimization framework specifically designed to handle the inherent uncertainties and stochastic behaviors of modern supply chains. To our knowledge, this marks the first attempt to combine IAI with simulation-based optimization for decision-making in SCM. The methodology is tested on two supply chain optimization problems, one fictional and one from the real world, and its performance is compared against widely used optimization and RL algorithms. The results reveal that the interpretable approach delivers competitive, and sometimes better, performance, challenging the prevailing notion that there must be a trade-off between interpretability and optimization efficiency. Additionally, the developed framework demonstrates strong potential for industrial applications, offering seamless integration with various Python-based algorithms.

                arXiv:2504.11757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) represents a class of state-space models (SSMs) characterized by a fixed state transition mechanism (the reservoir) and a flexible readout layer that maps from the state space. It is a paradigm of computational dynamical systems that harnesses the transient dynamics of high-dimensional state spaces for efficient processing of temporal data. Rooted in concepts from recurrent neural networks, RC achieves exceptional computational power by decoupling the training of the dynamic reservoir from the linear readout layer, thereby circumventing the complexities of gradient-based optimization. This work presents a systematic exploration of RC, addressing its foundational properties such as the echo state property, fading memory, and reservoir capacity through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We formalize the interplay between input signals and reservoir states, demonstrating the conditions under which reservoirs exhibit stability and expressive power. Further, we delve into the computational trade-offs and robustness characteristics of RC architectures, extending the discussion to their applications in signal processing, time-series prediction, and control systems. The analysis is complemented by theoretical insights into optimization, training methodologies, and scalability, highlighting open challenges and potential directions for advancing the theoretical underpinnings of RC.

                arXiv:2404.19165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently rely on the timing of signals for representing and processing information. Incorporating trainable transmission delays, alongside synaptic weights, is crucial for shaping these temporal dynamics. While recent methods have shown the benefits of training delays and weights in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency, they rely on discrete time, approximate gradients, and full access to internal variables like membrane potentials. This limits their precision, efficiency, and suitability for neuromorphic hardware due to increased memory requirements and I/O bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, we propose DelGrad, an analytical, event-based method to compute exact loss gradients for both synaptic weights and delays. The inclusion of delays in the training process emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Moreover, DelGrad, grounded purely in spike timing, eliminates the need to track additional variables such as membrane potentials. To showcase this key advantage, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of DelGrad on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform, by training SNNs in a chip-in-the-loop fashion. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the memory efficiency and accuracy benefits of adding delays to SNNs on noisy mixed-signal hardware. Additionally, these experiments also reveal the potential of delays for stabilizing networks against noise. DelGrad opens a new way for training SNNs with delays on neuromorphic hardware, which results in fewer required parameters, higher accuracy and ease of hardware training.

                arXiv:2504.07157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, with their performance heavily dependent on the quality of input prompts. While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on manual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This paper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a novel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm principles to evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic approaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO integrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its evolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets including ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important point for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods: importance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of generations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of different LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically generate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into the relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their evolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in improving LLM performance.

                arXiv:2504.07884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on mixed-variable black-box optimization (MV-BBO), addressing continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Many real-world MV-BBO problems involve dependencies among these different types of variables, requiring efficient methods to optimize them simultaneously. Recently, stochastic optimization methods leveraging the mechanism of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy have shown promising results in mixed-integer or mixed-category optimization. However, such methods cannot handle the three types of variables simultaneously. In this study, we propose CatCMA with Margin (CatCMAwM), a stochastic optimization method for MV-BBO that jointly optimizes continuous, integer, and categorical variables. CatCMAwM is developed by incorporating a novel integer handling into CatCMA, a mixed-category black-box optimization method employing a joint distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions. The proposed integer handling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and following the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer problems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence performance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM effectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply incorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.

                arXiv:2412.13541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.

                <p>The importance of animal models to an understanding of the development and plasticity of visual functions was evident from the outset of the long experimental collaboration of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in the early 1960s. Their initial work on kittens had massive impact in part because of the recognition that kittens share with primates substantial similarities of visual system organization and plasticity (e.g., eye-specific lamination of the thalamus and columnar organization of the visual cortex), as well as comparable visual abilities (including stereoscopic vision). In addition the plasticity demonstrated in response to early periods of selected visual exposure provided a glimpse into the origins of amblyopia. Five decades ago my laboratory developed a method for the fast measurement of visual thresholds in kittens in order to capture the consequences for spatial vision of the rapid physiological changes that occurred in the visual cortex during both typical development and those that follow various forms of early selected visual exposure. This paper describes the further evolution of the method with an emphasis on the testing procedures that enable fast capture of spatial visual thresholds such as visual acuity on every animal and occasion. In these respects, the method emulated features of basic tests of human spatial vision as applied in clinical settings. As with clinical tests for humans, the method includes benchmarks of low vision necessary to document the profound immediate consequences of early selected visual deprivation and the speed and extent of the subsequent recovery.</p>

                Background In computer vision and image processing, face recognition is increasingly popular field of research that identifies similar faces in a picture and assigns a suitable label. It is one of the desired detection techniques employed in forensics for criminal identification. Methods This study explores face recognition system for monozygotic twins utilizing three widely recognized feature descriptor algorithms: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)—with region-specific facial landmarks. These landmarks were extracted from 468 points detected through the Mediapipe frame-work, which enables simultaneous recognition of multiple faces. Quantitative similarity metrics t served as inputs for four classification methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM), and Nearest Centroid (NC). The effectiveness of these algorithms was tested and validated using challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets, the most difficult data sets for 2D and 3D face recognition research at Notre Dame University. Results Testing with Notre Dame University’s challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets re- vealed significant performance differences. Results demonstrated that 2D facial images achieved notably higher recognition accuracy than 3D images. The 2D images produced accuracy of 88% (SVM), 83% (LGBM), 83% (XGBoost), and 79% (NC). In contrast, the 3D TEC dataset yielded a lower accuracy r of 74%, 72%, 72%, and 70%, with the same classifiers. Conclusion The hybrid feature extraction approach proved most effective, with maximum accuracy rates reaching 88% for 2D facial images and 74% for 3D facial images. This work contributes significantly to forensic science by enhancing the reliability of facial recognition systems when confronted with indistinguishable facial characteristics of monozygotic twins.

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by tumors in the parathyroid, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior pituitary. This study discusses two distinct clinical cases to illustrate the diverse manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for MEN 1. Methods A case-based approach was employed to examine the clinical presentation, biochemical findings, imaging results, and therapeutic interventions in two patients with MEN 1. Relevant literature was reviewed to contextualize the findings. Results Case 1 involved a 47-year-old female presenting with hyperparathyroidism and a gastrinoma, managed conservatively due to comorbid chronic kidney disease. Case 2 featured a 26-year-old female with aggressive manifestations, including severe osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, and a pancreatic tail lesion, necessitating prompt surgical intervention. Both cases highlighted the utility of advanced imaging (Tc99 MIBI scans, MRI) and biochemical markers (serum calcium, iPTH, chromogranin A) in diagnosis and management. Genetic testing was emphasized as a key component of family screening and long-term surveillance. Discussion MEN 1 requires a multidisciplinary approach due to its multisystemic nature. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions, including parathyroidectomy and medical therapies like cinacalcet and somatostatin analogs, are critical to optimizing outcomes. The variability in clinical presentations underscores the need for personalized management plans. Conclusion The diverse spectrum of MEN 1 demands vigilant surveillance and a collaborative healthcare approach. Advances in diagnostics and targeted treatments continue to improve patient outcomes, but long-term management and genetic counseling remain pivotal.

                Background We conducted an overview of systematic reviews about the effects of teaching strategies that can be used to teach primary and secondary school students to think critically. Our objective was to inform decisions about what teaching strategies to use in resources that we developed to teach critical thinking about health in secondary schools. Methods We mapped characteristics of systematic reviews of teaching strategies and summarised findings from the most relevant reviews to teaching students to think critically about health. We included reviews that assessed the effects of teaching strategies that could potentially be used in primary or secondary schools to teach students to think critically, had a Methods section with explicit selection criteria, reported at least one outcome measure of the ability to undertake one of four basic types of cognitive tasks (memory, procedural, comprehension, or opinion), and were published after 1999. Results We included 326 systematic reviews. The reviews evaluated a wide range of teaching strategies for a variety of purposes. Important limitations of the reviews included not considering adverse effects (99% of the reviews), not assessing the risk of bias for included studies (93% of the reviews), and not assessing the credibility of subgroup effects (100% of the reviews). We summarised the findings for 37 teaching strategies that we considered most relevant. The certainty of the evidence of the effects varied from very low to moderate. We used 12 of the strategies in resources that we developed to teach secondary students to think critically about health. Conclusions A tremendous amount of work has gone into evaluating the effects of a wide range of teaching strategies. The results of this research can inform decisions about how to teach critical thinking and future research. However, well-designed, up-to-date systematic reviews are still needed for many teaching strategies.

Mosser</p>

In many settings, ongoing measles transmission is maintained due to pockets of un- or under-vaccinated individuals even if the critical vaccination threshold is reached nationwide. Therefore, assessing the underlying gaps in measles susceptibility within a population is essential for vaccination programs and measles control efforts. Recently, there have been increased efforts to use geospatial and small area methods to estimate subnational measles vaccination coverage in high-burden settings, such as in Ethiopia. However, the distribution of remaining susceptible individuals, either unvaccinated or having never previously been infected, across age groups and subnational geographies is unknown. In this study, we developed a dynamic transmission model that incorporates geospatial estimates of routine measles vaccination coverage, available data on supplemental immunization activities, and reported cases to estimate measles incidence and susceptibility across time, age, and space. We use gridded population estimates and subnational estimates of routine and supplemental measles vaccination coverage. To account for mixing between age-groups, we used a synthetic contact matrix, and travel times via a friction surface were used in a modified gravity model to account for spatial movement. We explored model fitting using Ethiopia as a case study. To address data-related and statistical challenges, we investigated a range of model parameterization and possible fitting algorithms. The approach with the best performance was a model fitted to case notifications adjusted for case ascertainment by using maximum likelihood estimation with block coordinate descent. This strategy was chosen because many data observations (and likely presence of unquantified uncertainty) yielded a steep likelihood surface, which was challenging to fit using Bayesian approaches. We ran sensitivity analyses to explore variations in vaccine effectiveness and compared patterns of susceptibility across space, time, and age. Substantial heterogeneity in reported measles cases as well as susceptibility persists across ages and second-administrative units. These methods and estimates could contribute towards tailored subnational and local planning to reduce preventable measles burden. However, computational and data challenges would need to be addressed for these methods to be applied on a large scale.

The tumor microenvironment aids cancer progression by promoting several cancer hallmarks, independent of cancer-related mutations. Biophysical properties of this environment, such as the stiffness of the matrix cells adhere to and local cell density, impact proliferation, apoptosis, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The latter is a rate-limiting step for invasion and metastasis, enhanced in hypoxic tumor environments but hindered by soft matrices and/or high cell densities. As these influences are often studied in isolation, the crosstalk between hypoxia, biomechanical signals, and the classic EMT driver TGF-β is not well mapped, limiting our ability to predict and anticipate cancer cell behaviors in changing tumor environments. To address this, we built a Boolean regulatory network model that integrates hypoxic signaling with a mechanosensitive model of EMT, which includes the EMT-promoting crosstalk of mitogens and biomechanical signals, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Our model reproduces the requirement of Hif-1α for proliferation, the anti-proliferative effects of strong Hif-1α stabilization during hypoxia, hypoxic protection from anoikis, and hypoxia-driven mechanosensitive EMT. We offer experimentally testable predictions about the effect of VHL loss on cancer hallmarks, with or without secondary oncogene activation. Taken together, our model serves as a predictive framework to synthesize the signaling responses associated with tumor progression and metastasis in healthy vs. mutant cells. Our single-cell model is a key step towards more extensive regulatory network models that cover damage-response and senescence, integrating most cell-autonomous cancer hallmarks into a single model that can, in turn, control the behavior of in silico cells within a tissue model of epithelial homeostasis and carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012390">Contributions of mechanical loading and hormonal changes to eccentric hypertrophy during volume overload: A Bayesian analysis using logic-based network models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Johane H. Bracamonte, Lionel Watkins, Betty Pat, Louis J. Dell’Italia, Jeffrey J. Saucerman, Jeffrey W. Holmes</p>

Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a pathology that alters mechanical loading on the left ventricle, triggers an array of compensatory neurohormonal responses, and induces a distinctive ventricular remodeling response known as eccentric hypertrophy. Drug therapies may alleviate symptoms, but only mitral valve repair or replacement can provide significant recovery of cardiac function and dimensions. Questions remain about the optimal timing of surgery, with 20% of patients developing systolic dysfunction post-operatively despite being treated according to the current guidelines. Thus, better understanding of the hypertrophic process in the setting of ventricular volume overload (VO) is needed to improve and better personalize the management of MR. To address this knowledge gap, we employ a Bayesian approach to combine data from 70 studies on experimental volume overload in dogs and rats and use it to calibrate a logic-based network model of hypertrophic signaling in myocytes. The calibrated model predicts that growth in experimental VO is mostly driven by the neurohormonal response, with an initial increase in myocardial tissue stretch being compensated by subsequent remodeling fairly early in the time course of VO. This observation contrasts with a common perception that volume-overload hypertrophy is driven primarily by increased myocyte strain. The model reproduces many aspects of 43 studies not used in its calibration, including infusion of individual hypertrophic agonists alone or in combination with various drugs commonly employed to treat heart failure, as well as administration of some of those drugs in the setting of experimental volume overload. We believe this represents a promising approach to using the known structure of an intracellular signaling network to integrate information from multiple studies into quantitative predictions of the range of expected responses to potential interventions in the complex setting of cardiac hypertrophy driven by a combination of hormonal and mechanical factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-442/v1?src=rss">Addressing socio-cultural barriers to improve contraceptive use in Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ethiopia encounters significant socio-cultural barriers to contraceptive use, affecting maternal health, poverty reduction, and women's empowerment. With a fertility rate of 4.6 children per woman and only 25.9% of women of reproductive age intending to use contraceptives, significant challenges remain. This policy brief analyzes data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) and 2019 Mini-EDHS, revealing key barriers such as fatalistic beliefs, religious prohibitions, postpartum amenorrhea, and spousal opposition. Socioeconomic factors, including wealth, literacy, and urban residency, greatly influence contraceptive use. Multivariable and structural equation modeling underscore the complex interplay of cultural norms, economic status, and individual autonomy in shaping contraceptive behavior. The brief recommends culturally tailored education programs, male engagement strategies, targeted interventions for underserved regions, and enhanced healthcare systems to improve contraceptive uptake. Implementing these evidence-based policies is essential for improving reproductive health and empowering women in Ethiopia.

                Izumi Shinya (1930-2022) participated in all the international expos held in Japan from the 1970 Osaka Expo to the 2005 Aichi Expo in important positions, and in particular oversaw the entire project as general producer for the 1990 Osaka International Garden and Greenery Exposition and the Aichi Expo. It is not easy to evaluate how producers conceived and realised a mega-event such as an international exposition. In this short report, I have taken a look at the concept of the San'in Yumeminato Expo held in Sakaiminato City in 1997, summarising its formulation process and uniqueness. In terms of the number of visitors, it was a regional exposition with around one-tenth the size of the Aichi Expo, but it clearly represents the methods used by Izumi and his team in order to realise expositions. This exposition can be seen as a step in the development of Izumi's exposition production, which followed the 1996 Tokyo World City Exposition (cancelled), through the 2001 Kitakyushu Expo (Kita Kyushu Hakuran Sai), and on to the Aichi Expo.

                In this issue of Neuron, Xu et al. demonstrate that activating GPR37L1, a G-protein-coupled receptor that negatively regulates astrocytes, suppresses the onset and maintenance of neuropathic pain, an intractable chronic pain caused by nerve damage, thereby serving as a therapeutic target.

                In this issue of Neuron, Yang et al. reveal that primary cilia in mouse prefrontal cortex excitatory neurons regulate stress responses via cAMP/PKA signaling. Stress induces ciliary elongation, enhancing corticosterone-mediated neuronal inhibition. Cilia loss reduces stress sensitivity, highlighting their role in stress adaptation, with potential therapeutic relevance.

                Interpretation of variants identified during genetic testing is a significant clinical challenge. In this study, we developed a high-throughput CDKN2A functional assay and characterized all possible human <i>CDKN2A</i> missense variants. We found that 17.7% of all missense variants were functionally deleterious. We also used our functional classifications to assess the performance of in silico models that predict the effect of variants, including recently reported models based on machine learning. Notably, we found that all in silico models performed similarly when compared to our functional classifications with accuracies of 39.5–85.4%. Furthermore, while we found that functionally deleterious variants were enriched within ankyrin repeats, we did not identify any residues where all missense variants were functionally deleterious. Our functional classifications are a resource to aid the interpretation of <i>CDKN2A</i> variants and have important implications for the application of variant interpretation guidelines, particularly the use of in silico models for clinical variant interpretation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100085">Ventral tegmental area interneurons revisited: GABA and glutamate projection neurons make local synapses</a></h4>

              
                The ventral tegmental area (VTA) contains projection neurons that release the neurotransmitters dopamine, GABA, and/or glutamate from distal synapses. VTA also contains GABA neurons that synapse locally on to dopamine neurons, synapses widely credited to a population of so-called VTA interneurons. Interneurons in cortex, striatum, and elsewhere have well-defined morphological features, physiological properties, and molecular markers, but such features have not been clearly described in VTA. Indeed, there is scant evidence that local and distal synapses originate from separate populations of VTA GABA neurons. In this study, we tested whether several markers expressed in non-dopamine VTA neurons are selective markers of interneurons, defined as neurons that synapse locally but not distally. Challenging previous assumptions, we found that VTA neurons genetically defined by expression of parvalbumin, somatostatin, neurotensin, or Mu-opioid receptor project to known VTA targets including nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, lateral habenula, and prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we provide evidence that VTA GABA and glutamate projection neurons make functional inhibitory or excitatory synapses locally within VTA. These findings suggest that local collaterals of VTA projection neurons could mediate functions prior attributed to VTA interneurons. This study underscores the need for a refined understanding of VTA connectivity to explain how heterogeneous VTA circuits mediate diverse functions related to reward, motivation, or addiction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92539">A neurocomputational account of the link between social perception and social action</a></h4>

              
                People selectively help others based on perceptions of their merit or need. Here, we develop a neurocomputational account of how these social perceptions translate into social choice. Using a novel fMRI social perception task, we show that both merit and need perceptions recruited the brain’s social inference network. A behavioral computational model identified two non-exclusive mechanisms underlying variance in social perceptions: a consistent tendency to perceive others as meritorious/needy (bias) and a propensity to sample and integrate normative evidence distinguishing high from low merit/need in other people (sensitivity). Variance in people’s merit (but not need) bias and sensitivity independently predicted distinct aspects of altruism in a social choice task completed months later. An individual’s merit <i>bias</i> predicted <i>context-independent</i> variance in people’s overall other-regard during altruistic choice, biasing people toward prosocial actions. An individual’s merit <i>sensitivity</i> predicted <i>context-sensitive</i> discrimination in generosity toward high and low merit recipients by influencing other- and self-regard during altruistic decision-making. This context-sensitive perception–action link was associated with activation in the right temporoparietal junction. Together, these findings point toward stable, biologically based individual differences in perceptual processes related to abstract social concepts like merit, and suggest that these differences may have important behavioral implications for an individual’s tendency toward favoritism or discrimination in social settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93338">The potential of inversions to accumulate balanced sexual antagonism is supported by simulations and Drosophila experiments</a></h4>

              
                Chromosomal inversion polymorphisms can be common, but the causes of their persistence are often unclear. We propose a model for the maintenance of inversion polymorphism, which requires that some variants contribute antagonistically to two phenotypes, one of which has negative frequency-dependent fitness. These conditions yield a form of frequency-dependent disruptive selection, favoring two predominant haplotypes segregating alleles that favor opposing antagonistic phenotypes. An inversion associated with one haplotype can reduce the fitness load incurred by generating recombinant offspring, reinforcing its linkage to the haplotype and enabling both haplotypes to accumulate more antagonistic variants than expected otherwise. We develop and apply a forward simulator to examine these dynamics under a tradeoff between survival and male display. These simulations indeed generate inversion-associated haplotypes with opposing sex-specific fitness effects. Antagonism strengthens with time, and can ultimately yield karyotypes at surprisingly predictable frequencies, with striking genotype frequency differences between sexes and between developmental stages. To test whether this model may contribute to well-studied yet enigmatic inversion polymorphisms in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we track inversion frequencies in laboratory crosses to test whether they influence male reproductive success or survival. We find that two of the four tested inversions show significant evidence for the tradeoff examined, with <i>In(3 R)K</i> favoring survival and <i>In(3 L)Ok</i> favoring male reproduction. In line with the apparent sex-specific fitness effects implied for both of those inversions, <i>In(3 L)Ok</i> was also found to be less costly to the viability and/or longevity of males than females, whereas <i>In(3 R)K</i> was more beneficial to female survival. Based on this work, we expect that balancing selection on antagonistically pleiotropic traits may provide a significant and underappreciated contribution to the maintenance of natural inversion polymorphism.

">Enhanced Tactile Coding in Rat Neocortex Under Darkness</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems are known for their adaptability, responding dynamically to changes in environmental conditions. A key example of this adaptability is the enhancement of tactile perception in the absence of visual input. Despite behavioral studies showing visual deprivation can improve tactile discrimination, the underlying neural mechanisms, particularly how tactile neural representations are reorganized during visual deprivation, remain unclear. In this study, we explore how the absence of visual input alters tactile neural encoding in the rat somatosensory cortex (S1). Rats were trained on a custom-designed treadmill with distinct tactile textures (rough and smooth), and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from S1 under light and dark conditions. Machine learning techniques, specifically a convolutional neural network, were used to decode the high-dimensional LFP signals. We found that the neural representations of tactile stimuli became more distinct in the dark, indicating a reorganization of sensory processing in S1 when visual input was removed. Notably, conventional amplitude-based analyses failed to capture these changes, highlighting the power of machine learning in uncovering subtle neural patterns. These findings offer new insights into how the brain rapidly adapts tactile processing in response to the loss of visual input, with implications for multisensory integration and potential strategies for sensory rehabilitation.

">Finite element model predicts micromotion-induced strain profiles that correlate with the functional performance of Utah arrays in humans and non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Utah arrays are widely used in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) for intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), primarily for detecting electrical signals from cortical tissue to decode motor commands. Recently, these arrays have also been applied to deliver electrical stimulation aimed at restoring sensory functions. A key challenge limiting their longevity is the micromotion between the array and cortical tissue, which may induce mechanical strain in surrounding tissue and contribute to performance decline. This strain, due to mechanical mismatch, can exacerbate glial scarring around the implant, reducing the efficacy of Utah arrays in recording neuronal activity and delivering electrical stimulation. Approach. To investigate this, we employed a finite element model (FEM) to predict tissue strains resulting from micromotion. Main Results. Our findings indicated that strain profiles around edge and corner electrodes were greater than those around interior shanks, affecting both maximum and average strains within 50 micron of the electrode tip. We then correlated these predicted tissue strains with in-vivo electrode performance metrics. We found negative correlations between 1 kHz impedance and tissue strains in human motor arrays and NHP area V4 arrays at 1-mo, 1-yr, and 2-yrs post-implantation. In human motor arrays, the peak-to-peak waveform voltage (PTPV) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spontaneous activity were also negatively correlated with strain. Conversely, we observed a positive correlation between the evoked SNR of multi-unit activity and strain in NHP area V4 arrays. Significance. This study establishes a spatial dependence of electrode performance in Utah arrays that correlates with tissue strain.

">Posterior parietal cortex activity during visually cued gait: a preliminary study</a></h4>

              
                Safe gait requires visually cued (VC) step adjustments for negotiating targets and obstacles. Effective step adjustments rely on good visuospatial processing. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is implicated in visuospatial processing, yet empirical evidence is limited for the PPC's role during gait in humans. Increased cortical control of gait is associated with higher gait variability, a marker of gait performance and fall risk among older adults. However, the cortical underpinnings of gait variability in visually complex environments are not well established. The primary aim of this preliminary study was to assess PPC activity during VC gait and VC gait with perturbations (VCP). A secondary aim was to determine how PPC activity relates to gait variability during VC and VCP gait. Twenty-one healthy young adults completed three treadmill gait conditions at preferred speed: non-cued (NC) gait, VC gait, where stepping targets were presented in a regular pattern, and VCP gait, where stepping target positions were pseudorandomly shifted. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy quantified relative changes in deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin ({Delta}HbO2) concentrations in the PPC. Inertial measurement units quantified gait variability. Moderate effects were observed for more positive {Delta}HbO2 from NC to both VC and VCP gait, likely reflecting the increased visuospatial processing demands. Stride time variability was positively correlated with PPC {Delta}HbO2 during VC gait, suggesting a potential role for the PPC in modulating temporal components of VC gait. Extending these findings to older adults will help to elucidate the PPC's role in gait adaptability and fall risk with aging.

">Design and Biological Activity of a Novel Brain Penetrant Urea Compound Against Glioblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most lethal primary brain tumor, largely due to therapy-resistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) and the ability of non-stem cells to dedifferentiate under therapeutic pressure. We developed MXC-017, a novel urea-based compound that crosses the blood-brain-barrier, directly targets GSCs, and prevents radiation-induced GSC formation. Using click chemistry pull-down and mass spectrometry, we identified vimentin as the target of MXC-017, further validated by in silico docking. Global transcriptomic profiling (bulk RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq analyses revealed MXC-017's efficacy with minimal off-target effects, supported by metabolic and kinome assays. Normal cell toxicity was negligible in fibroblasts, microglia, astrocytes, and murine neural progenitors. Maximum tolerated dose was identified and we observed significantly extended median survival in 17 PDOX GBM models when treated with MXC-017 plus radiation, benchmarked against standard-of-care temozolomide. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of vimentin-targeting agents to overcome radiation resistance and improve outcomes for GBM patients.

">Juvenile mice are susceptible to infarct-induced neurodegeneration that causes delayed cognitive decline in a new model of pediatric ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Over half of pediatric stroke survivors have permanent neurologic and cognitive deficits, and some children develop new or worsening cognitive impairment late after stroke. Their cognitive symptoms are associated with chronic alterations of brain structure in regions distant from the infarct, including in the uninjured hemisphere. However, the mechanisms that cause children's late cognitive symptoms and disrupted brain growth outside the infarcted tissue remain unknown. We therefore developed and validated a mouse model of pediatric ischemic stroke that causes infarct-induced, delayed cognitive decline accompanied by chronic innate and adaptive neuroinflammation in the infarct and in uninjured subcortical regions that are connected to the infarct. Methods: Male and female C57BL/6J mice were randomized to stroke or sham surgery at p28 to model stroke in late childhood and compared to adult 6-month-old mice. We used permanent distal MCAO followed by 60 minutes of hypoxia, an established model for focal ischemia that generates a purely cortical stroke. Mice underwent behavioral testing at 1- and 7-weeks post stroke Barnes Maze protocol adapted for reversal learning. We performed immunostaining to quantify stroke size, atrophy, and innate and adaptive neuroinflammation at 3 days and 7 weeks after surgery. Results: At 7 weeks post-stroke, juvenile stroke mice performed significantly worse on reversal learning on Barnes Maze testing than sham mice (n = 7 stroke, 7 sham, p = 0.0265 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures). At 3 days after stroke, juvenile mice had greater innate immune cell activation at subcortical sites of secondary neurodegeneration; however, by 7 weeks after surgery, this relationship was reversed, and adults had greater chronic innate immune cell activation at these uninjured subcortical sites (corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, thalamus). Like adult mice, pediatric mice exhibited chronic innate and adaptive neuroimmunity in the infarct scar; the inflammation in the stroke scar did not differ by age. Conclusions: In a model of pediatric ischemic stroke, juvenile mice develop a delayed cognitive deficit that is associated with chronic innate and adaptive neuroinflammation in uninjured subcortical structures that undergo secondary neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that infarct-induced neurodegeneration occurs after stroke in juvenile mice and that juvenile and adult mice have divergent trajectories in the innate immune response to stroke.

">Domain-general neural effects of associative learning and expectations on pain and hedonic taste perception</a></h4>

              
                Predictive cues significantly influence perception through associative learning. However, it is unknown whether circuits are conserved across domains. We investigated how associative learning influences perceived intensity and valence of pain and hedonic taste and whether the mechanisms that support expectancy-based modulation vary as a function of aversiveness and modality. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to receive either painful heat, unpleasant liquid saline, or pleasant liquid sucrose during fMRI scanning. Following conditioning, cues that were initially associated with low or high intensity outcomes were intermittently followed by stimuli calibrated to elicit medium intensity ratings. Learned cues modulated expectations and subjective outcomes similarly across domains. Consistent with this, the orbitofrontal cortex exhibited domain-general anticipatory activation. The left anterior insula mediated domain-general cue effects on subjective intensity, whereas the thalamus mediated cue effects on subjective valence. Notably, these two regions were nearly identical to those previously implicated in mediating cue effects on pain (nearly identical to those previously implicated in cue effects on mediating pain (Atlas et al., 2010). Pain specificity was evident when we measured variations in stimulus intensity, whether we used univariate or multivariate approaches, but there was minimal evidence of specificity by modality or aversiveness when we examined cue effects on medium trials. These findings suggest that shared neural circuits mediate the effects of learned expectations on perception, linking pain with other areas of affective processing and perception across domains.

">Artemin sensitises mouse (Mus musculus) and naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                The naked mole-rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber) is a subterranean rodent that exhibits a range of unusual physiological traits, including diminished inflammatory pain. For example, nerve growth factor (NGF), a key inflammatory mediator, fails to induce sensitization of sensory neurons and thermal hyperalgesia in NMRs. This lack of NGF-induced neuronal sensitization and thermal hyperalgesia results from hypofunctional signaling of the NGF receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). Like NGF-TrkA signaling, the neurotrophic factor artemin, a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, is implicated in mediating inflammatory pain through its receptor, GDNF family receptor 3 (GFR3), which is expressed by a subset of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Here we investigated GFR3 expression in DRG neurons of mice and NMRs, as well as measuring the impact of artemin on DRG sensory neuron function in both species. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed a similar abundance of GFR3 in mouse and NMR DRG sensory neurons, high coexpression with the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel suggesting that these neurons are nociceptors. Using electrophysiology, we observed that artemin induced depolarization of the resting membrane potential and decreased the rheobase of sensory neurons in both species, as well as diminishing the degree of TRPV1 desensitization to multiple capsaicin stimuli. Overall, results indicate that artemin sensitizes sensory neurons in both mice and NMRs, suggesting a conserved mechanism of sensory modulation.

">Non-linearity of spatial integration varies across layers of primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The receptive field (RF) of visual cortical neurons is highly dynamic and context-dependent, shaped by both the spatial and temporal properties of stimuli and the complex architecture of cortical circuits. While classical RF mapping through extracellular recordings reveals only the area triggering spiking responses, intracellular recordings reveal a much broader region of subthreshold synaptic input. We investigated how neurons in different cortical layers integrate visual input across space, with a focus on the linearity of spatial summation. Using intracellular recordings, we found that supragranular complex cells integrate input in a highly sublinear manner, in contrast to infragranular complex cells and simple cells, which exhibited near-linear summation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we employed a large-scale recurrent spiking model of cat primary visual cortex (V1). Modeling results point to the differential patterning of long-range horizontal connections - particularly their targeting of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons - as a potential source of the observed layer-specific integration properties. These findings suggest that RFs emerge from interaction of feedforward, horizontal, and possibly feedback inputs, that are continuous in space, challenging the conventional notions of fixed spatial RF boundaries in early visual processing.

">Functional validation of human SK channels variants causing NEDMAB and Zimmermann-Laband syndrome-3 in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels) are widely expressed in the central nervous system, where they play a crucial role in modulating neuronal excitability. Recent studies have identified missense variants in the genes encoding SK2 and SK3 channels as the cause of two rare neurodevelopmental disorders: NEDMAB and ZLS3, respectively. Here, we used C. elegans as an in vivo model to investigate the functional consequences of these patient variants. The C. elegans ortholog KCNL-1 regulates neuronal and muscle excitability in the egg-laying system, a well-characterized model circuit. To visualize KCNL-1 expression and localization, we generated a fluorescent translational reporter at the endogenous kcnl-1 locus. We then introduced eight point mutations corresponding to pathogenic variants reported in NEDMAB or ZLS3 patients. Our study confirmed the molecular pathogenicity of the ZLS3-associated mutations, revealing a gain-of-function effect that led to increased in utero egg retention, likely due to electrical silencing of the egg-laying circuitry. NEDMAB mutations exhibited more complex phenotypic effects. Most caused a loss-of-function phenotype, indistinguishable from null mutants, while one displayed a clear gain-of-function effect. Additionally, a subset of NEDMAB variants altered KCNL-1 localization, suggesting an impairment in channel biosynthesis, trafficking or stability. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NEDMAB and ZLS3 physiopathology, enhancing our understanding of SK channel dysfunction in human disease. Moreover, they establish C. elegans as a robust and cost-effective in vivo model for rapid functional validation of new SK channel mutations, paving the way for future investigations.

">Regulation of input excitability in human and mouse parvalbumin interneurons by Kir potassium channels</a></h4>

              
                Compared to rodents, inhibitory interneurons in the human neocortex exhibit high input excitability because of reduced passive ion leakage across their extracellular membrane. However, the regulation of intrinsic excitability by voltage-gated ion channels activated over a wide range of membrane potentials in human interneurons remains poorly understood. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp microelectrode recordings in mouse and human neocortical slices obtained from surgically resected non-pathological brain tissue finding that Kir channels control the electrical resistance of parvalbumin (Pvalb) neurons in an identical manner in the human and mouse. Molecular analyses revealed predominantly Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 channels in Pvalb neurons in both species. Using whole-cell recordings from synaptically connected neuron pairs and a computational model, we demonstrated that physiological Kir activation inhibits human Pvalb interneurons during postsynaptic potentials evoked by presynaptic neurogliaform cells. The similarity of Kir-mediated inhibition across species suggests that it is an archetypal property of Pvalb neurons.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>High-frequency oscillations are oscillatory high-frequency (&gt;80 Hz) signals that can be physiological or pathological. Physiological high-frequency oscillations related to sleep spindles have been reported. In addition, some reports indicate that high-frequency oscillations are a marker for the prediction of seizures. Our aim was to explore the presence of high-frequency oscillations in children with autism spectrum disorder and their relationship with clinical symptoms. Fifty-two children with autism spectrum disorder and 49 healthy children were enrolled in the study. EEG records were evaluated via the open-source Python library magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MNE)-high-frequency oscillation for the detection of scalp high-frequency oscillations and sleep spindles detected by open-source YASA. SPSS version 22 used for statistical analysis. The duration of sleep spindle was shorter, and the frequency was significantly greater, in children with autism spectrum disorder than in healthy controls. High-frequency oscillations unrelated to sleep spindle were more common in children with autism spectrum disorder (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.01). Younger children with autism spectrum disorder had particularly more high-frequency oscillations unrelated to sleep spindle (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.01). Within the autism spectrum disorder group of patients, high-frequency oscillations unrelated to sleep spindle were significantly greater in subgroups with moderate–severe social interaction problems (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.01), moderate–severe restricted interest (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> = 0.018), and severe linguistic delays (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> = 0.006). High-frequency oscillations might be a candidate marker for autism spectrum disorder that might be used in clinical settings that warrants further studies.</span>

                Objectives Degenerative lumbar spine disease, a leading cause of chronic pain and disability in older adults, results from the progressive degeneration of intervertebral discs. This systematic review evaluates the role of mean kurtosis (MK) as a diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameter in the early diagnosis of degenerative spine disease and its potential to enhance patient outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with a comprehensive search yielding 7,290 articles. After screening, three studies met the inclusion criteria. Quality assessment was performed using the QUADAS tool, considering studies with a score of ≥10 as high-quality. Data extraction focused on DKI parameters, particularly MK, in assessing early disc degeneration. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024554902) on June 5, 2024. Results Findings indicate that MK plays a crucial role in detecting microstructural changes in the intervertebral disc space of the lumbar spine. These changes closely correlate with clinical symptoms and the extent of degeneration observed on conventional MRI. DKI-derived MK appears to offer greater sensitivity in identifying early-stage microstructural degeneration compared to traditional imaging methods Conclusions MR DKI demonstrates significant potential for detecting subtle, early changes in lumbar spine degeneration. Integrating DKI into clinical practice could enhance diagnostic accuracy, enable earlier interventions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-439/v1?src=rss">Contrafactual analysis: Comparing voucher systems with taxes, subsidies, and public spending to reduce income inequality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines how voucher systems compare to traditional redistributive policies—such as progressive taxation, subsidies, and public spending—in reducing income inequality. Methods We apply a counterfactual analysis approach, using panel data from twelve countries over 22 years. By employing econometric modelling, we simulate a series of “what-if” scenarios to assess the impact of each policy on the Gini coefficient, a key measure of income inequality. Results The results suggest that voucher systems can be particularly effective at targeting essential services, like education and healthcare, improving access for lower-income groups, and helping to reduce inequality. Public spending on education and healthcare proves to be incredibly potent in narrowing income disparities. These sectors are vital for addressing systemic inequalities, improving overall access and providing long-term benefits to disadvantaged groups. In contrast, progressive taxation and subsidies show mixed effectiveness. While higher tax revenues often correlate with reduced inequality, their impacts vary across countries and contexts. The effectiveness of progressive taxation depends on factors such as the efficiency of tax systems and the political environment, which can influence how well these policies work. Similarly, subsidies generally produce only modest or inconsistent reductions in income gaps, suggesting that while they provide temporary relief, they do not always address the root causes of inequality. Conclusions These findings suggest that well-designed voucher programs, when combined with progressive taxation and strategic public spending, can play a key role in enhancing redistribution efforts. By improving access to essential services and targeting lower-income groups, vouchers have the potential to reduce income inequality. However, achieving equitable economic outcomes requires careful policy design and attention to the broader economic context.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1369/v2?src=rss">Financial inclusion and stability in Ethiopia using bank-level data: A two-step system GMM estimation [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper examines the impact of FI on bank stability within Ethiopian context, using panel data from 17 commercial banks over the period 2015-2023. Given the scarcity of research focused on the relationship between FI and bank stability in Ethiopia, this paper seeks to address a crucial gap by analyzing both conventional and digital aspects of FI in relation with bank stability. Methods A two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to construct a composite FI index, integrating 10 conventional and 5 digital indicators. The study applied a two-step robust system generalized method of moments (GMM) to analyze the effects of FI on bank stability, tests nonlinearities using Lind and Mehlum’s (2010) U-test, and examines causality through Dumitrescu-Hurlin (2012) and Juodis et al. (2021) causality tests. Results The result reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between FI and bank stability. FI enhances stability up to a 30.3% threshold, beyond which increased transaction costs, information asymmetries, and adverse selection risks weaken stability. Capital adequacy moderates this effect, raising the threshold to 35.1%, but its stabilizing role diminishes at higher levels. Granger causality tests confirm a bidirectional relationship. Additionally, bank efficiency and GDP growth enhance stability, while real interest rates, total assets, and income diversification exert destabilizing effects. Conclusions This study makes three key contributions. First, it provides the first empirical analysis of the FI-stability nexus in Ethiopia. Second: (i), it develops a multidimensional FI index; (ii), explores both linear and nonlinear relationships, and (iii) examines macroprudential regulation as a moderating factor. Third, it tests causality, offering policy insights. To enhance stability while mitigating risks, policymakers must balance FI expansion, enforce regulatory frameworks, and implement targeted capital requirements. Regulators should strengthen consumer protection and financial literacy, while banks must optimize outreach, manage credit risk, and ensure prudent asset allocation and liquidity management to sustain financial stability.

                <p>by Sarit F.A. Szpiro, Charlie S. Burlingham, Eero P. Simoncelli, Marisa Carrasco</p>

Human perceptual sensitivity often improves with training, a phenomenon known as “perceptual learning.” Another important perceptual dimension is appearance, the subjective sense of stimulus magnitude. Are training-induced improvements in sensitivity accompanied by more accurate appearance? Here, we examined this question by measuring both discrimination (sensitivity) and estimation (appearance) responses to near-horizontal motion directions, which are known to be repulsed away from horizontal. Participants performed discrimination and estimation tasks before and after training in either the discrimination or the estimation task or none (control group). Human observers who trained in either discrimination or estimation exhibited improvements in discrimination accuracy, but estimation repulsion did not decrease; instead, it either persisted or increased. Hence, distortions in perception can be exacerbated after perceptual learning. We developed a computational observer model in which perceptual learning arises from increases in the precision of underlying neural representations, which explains this counterintuitive finding. For each observer, the fitted model accounted for discrimination performance, the distribution of estimates, and their changes with training. Our empirical findings and modeling suggest that learning enhances distinctions between categories, a potentially important aspect of real-world perception and perceptual learning.

                <p>by Yee Chuen Teoh, Mohammed Sakib Noor, Sina Aghakhani, Jack Girton, Guiping Hu, Ratul Chowdhury</p>

A generalizable computational platform, CTRL-V (Computational TRacking of Likely Variants), is introduced to design selective binding (dual bait) biosensor proteins. The iteratively evolving receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been construed as a model dual bait biosensor which has iteratively evolved to distinguish and selectively bind to human entry receptors and avoid binding neutralizing antibodies. Spike RBD prioritizes mutations that reduce antibody binding while enhancing/ retaining binding with the ACE2 receptor. CTRL-V’s through iterative design cycles was shown to pinpoint 20% (of the 39) reported SARS-CoV-2 point mutations across 30 circulating, infective strains as responsible for immune escape from commercial antibody LY-CoV1404. CTRL-V successfully identifies ~70% (five out of seven) single point mutations (371F, 373P, 440K, 445H, 456L) in the latest circulating KP.2 variant and offers detailed structural insights to the escape mechanism. While other data-driven viral escape variant predictor tools have shown promise in predicting potential future viral variants, they require massive amounts of data to bypass the need for physics of explicit biochemical interactions. Consequently, they cannot be generalized for other protein design applications. The publicly availably viral escape data was leveraged as <i>in vivo</i> anchors to streamline a computational workflow that can be generalized for dual bait biosensor design tasks as exemplified by identifying key mutational loci in Raf kinase that enables it to selectively bind Ras and Rap1a GTP. We demonstrate three versions of CTRL-V which use a combination of integer optimization, stochastic sampling by PyRosetta, and deep learning-based ProteinMPNN for structure-guided biosensor design.

                <p>by Emma B Hodcroft, Martin S Wohlfender, Richard A Neher, Julien Riou, Christian L Althaus</p>

The wealth of genomic data that was generated during the COVID-19 pandemic provides an exceptional opportunity to obtain information on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, there is great interest to better understand how the effective reproduction number Re and the overdispersion of secondary cases, which can be quantified by the negative binomial dispersion parameter <i>k</i>, changed over time and across regions and viral variants. The aim of our study was to develop a Bayesian framework to infer Re and <i>k</i> from viral sequence data. First, we developed a mathematical model for the distribution of the size of identical sequence clusters, in which we integrated viral transmission, the mutation rate of the virus, and incomplete case-detection. Second, we implemented this model within a Bayesian inference framework, allowing the estimation of Re and <i>k</i> from genomic data only. We validated this model in a simulation study. Third, we identified clusters of identical sequences in all SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 2021 from Switzerland, Denmark, and Germany that were available on GISAID. We obtained monthly estimates of the posterior distribution of Re and <i>k</i>, with the resulting Re estimates slightly lower than resulting obtained by other methods, and <i>k</i> comparable with previous results. We found comparatively higher estimates of <i>k</i> in Denmark which suggests less opportunities for superspreading and more controlled transmission compared to the other countries in 2021. Our model included an estimation of the case detection and sampling probability, but the estimates obtained had large uncertainty, reflecting the difficulty of estimating these parameters simultaneously. Our study presents a novel method to infer information on the transmission of infectious diseases and its heterogeneity using genomic data. With increasing availability of sequences of pathogens in the future, we expect that our method has the potential to provide new insights into the transmission and the overdispersion in secondary cases of other pathogens.

                <p>by David N. White, Johannes Burge</p>

Stimulus variability—a form of nuisance variability—is a primary source of perceptual uncertainty in everyday natural tasks. How do different properties of natural images and scenes contribute to this uncertainty? Using binocular disparity as a model system, we report a systematic investigation of how various forms of natural stimulus variability impact performance in a stereo-depth discrimination task. With stimuli sampled from a stereo-image database of real-world scenes having pixel-by-pixel ground-truth distance data, three human observers completed two closely related double-pass psychophysical experiments. In the two experiments, each human observer responded twice to ten thousand unique trials, in which twenty thousand unique stimuli were presented. New analytical methods reveal, from this data, the specific and nearly dissociable effects of two distinct sources of natural stimulus variability—variation in luminance-contrast patterns and variation in local-depth structure—on discrimination performance, as well as the relative importance of stimulus-driven-variability and internal-noise in determining performance limits. Between-observer analyses show that both stimulus-driven sources of uncertainty are responsible for a large proportion of total variance, have strikingly similar effects on different people, and—surprisingly—make stimulus-by-stimulus responses more predictable (not less). The consistency across observers raises the intriguing prospect that image-computable models can make reasonably accurate performance predictions in natural viewing. Overall, the findings provide a rich picture of stimulus factors that contribute to human perceptual performance in natural scenes. The approach should have broad application to other animal models and other sensory-perceptual tasks with natural or naturalistic stimuli.

Information theory has deeply influenced the conceptualization of brain information processing and is a mainstream framework for analyzing how neural networks in the brain process information to generate behavior. Information theory tools have been initially conceived and used to study how information about sensory variables is encoded by the activity of small neural populations. However, recent multivariate information theoretic advances have enabled addressing how information is exchanged across areas and used to inform behavior. Moreover, its integration with dimensionality-reduction techniques has enabled addressing information encoding and communication by the activity of large neural populations or many brain areas, as recorded by multichannel activity measurements in functional imaging and electrophysiology. Here, we provide a Multivariate Information in Neuroscience Toolbox (MINT) that combines these new methods with statistical tools for robust estimation from limited-size empirical datasets. We demonstrate the capabilities of MINT by applying it to both simulated and real neural data recorded with electrophysiology or calcium imaging, but all MINT functions are equally applicable to other brain-activity measurement modalities. We highlight the synergistic opportunities that combining its methods afford for reverse engineering of specific information processing and flow between neural populations or areas, and for discovering how information processing functions emerge from interactions between neurons or areas. MINT works on Linux, Windows and macOS operating systems, is written in MATLAB (requires MATLAB version 2018b or newer) and depends on 4 native MATLAB toolboxes. The calculation of one possible way to compute information redundancy requires the installation and compilation of C files (made available by us also as pre-compiled files). MINT is freely available at https://github.com/panzerilab/MINT with DOI doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13998526 and operates under a GNU GPLv3 license.

A shallow neural network was used to embed lipid structures in a 2- or 3-dimensional space with the goal that structurally similar species have similar vectors. Tests on complete lipid databanks show that the method automatically produces distributions which follow conventional lipid classifications. The embedding is accompanied by the web-based software, Lipidome Projector. This displays user lipidomes as 2D or 3D scatterplots for quick exploratory analysis, quantitative comparison and interpretation at a structural level. Examples of published data sets were used for a qualitative comparison with literature interpretation.

                <p>by Lukáš Lochman, Ellen Tanaka Kahiya, Bechara Saade, Tomáš Smutný, Jurjen Duintjer Tebbens, Petr Pávek, Veronika Bernhauerová</p>

Xenoreceptors of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as pregnane X receptor (PXR), are liver-enriched ligand-activated transcription factors regarded as crucial sensors in xenobiotic exposure and detoxification. PXR controls transcription of many drug-handling genes and influx/eﬄux transporters, thus playing a crucial role in drug metabolism and excretion. Liver functions have been studied using primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), which, when conventionally cultured, undergo rapid de-differentiation, leaving them unsuitable for long-term studies. Recently, 3D PHHs called spheroids have emerged as an <i>in vitro</i> model that is similar to <i>in vivo</i> hepatocytes regarding phenotype and function and represents the first <i>in vitro</i> model to study the long-term regulation of drug-handling genes by PXR. In this study, we used mathematical modelling to analyze the long-term activation of PXR in 3D PHHs through expression kinetics of three key PXR-regulated drug-metabolizing enzymes, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6 and the P-glycoprotein eﬄux transporter encoding gene, MDR1. PXR action in 3D PHHs was induced by the antibiotic rifampicin at two clinically relevant concentrations. The results confirmed that high rifampicin concentrations activated PXR nearly to its full capacity. The analysis indicated the highest PXR-induced transcription rate constant for CYP2B6. The rate constant dictating mRNA degradation associated with activated PXR was highest for CYP3A4. Moreover, we measured the metabolic activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6 and quantified their metabolic rate constants. Metabolic activity rate constant of CYP3A4 was found to be the highest whereas that of CYP2B6 was found to be the lowest among the studied enzymes. Our results provide important insight into the regulation of PXR-target genes in 3D PHHs and show that mRNA expression and metabolic activity data can be combined with quantitative analysis to reveal the long-term action of PXR and its effects on drug-handling genes.

                <p>by Gabriele Pozzati, Samuel Coulbourn Flores</p>

Introductory bioinformatics courses can be challenging to teach. Students with a biological background may have never encountered computer science, and computer science students are likely to have minimal knowledge of biology. To improve learning, we implemented a flipped spaced-repetition course. We repeated the topics through various activities across different days while applying an unusually high number of examinations. The examinations were synergistic with the flipped classroom, encouraging reading and watching recorded lectures before in-person discussions. Additionally, they helped us structure and assess laboratory practicals. We analyzed grades, pass rates, student satisfaction, and student comments qualitatively and quantitatively over 7 years of the course, documenting progress as well as the effect of disruptions such as COVID-19 and changes in teaching staff. We share our results and insights into the opportunities and challenges of this pedagogical approach. An open online version of this course is freely provided for students and teachers.

                <p>by Sharmilla Chandrasegaran, James P. Sluka, Daryl Shanley</p>

Cellular senescence is known to drive age-related pathology through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, it also plays important physiological roles such as cancer suppression, embryogenesis and wound healing. Wound healing is a tightly regulated process which when disrupted results in conditions such as fibrosis and chronic wounds. Senescent cells appear during the proliferation phase of the healing process where the SASP is involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis after damage. Interestingly, SASP composition and functionality was recently found to be temporally regulated, with distinct SASP profiles involved: a fibrogenic, followed by a fibrolytic SASP, which could have important implications for the role of senescent cells in wound healing. Given the number of factors at play a full understanding requires addressing the multiple levels of complexity, pertaining to the various cell behaviours, individually followed by investigating the interactions and influence each of these elements have on each other and the system as a whole. Here, a systems biology approach was adopted whereby a multi-scale model of wound healing that includes the dynamics of senescent cell behaviour and corresponding SASP composition within the wound microenvironment was developed. The model was built using the software CompuCell3D, which is based on a Cellular Potts modelling framework. We used an existing body of data on healthy wound healing to calibrate the model and validation was done on known disease conditions. The model clearly shows how differences in the spatiotemporal dynamics of different senescent cell phenotypes lead to several distinct repair outcomes. These differences in senescent cell dynamics can be attributed to variable SASP composition, duration of senescence and temporal induction of senescence relative to the healing stage. The range of outcomes demonstrated strongly highlight the dynamic and heterogenous role of senescent cells in wound healing, fibrosis and chronic wounds, and their fine-tuned control. Further specific data to increase model confidence could be used to explore senolytic treatments in wound disorders.

                <p>by Fillipe Georgiou, Camille Buhl, J. E. F. Green, Bishnu Lamichhane, Ngamta Thamwattana</p>

Collective behaviour occurs at all levels of the natural world, from cells aggregating to form tissues, to locusts interacting to form large and destructive plagues. These complex behaviours arise from relatively simple interactions amongst individuals and between individuals and their environment. For simplicity, mathematical models of these phenomena often assume that the population is homogeneous. However, population heterogeneity arising due to the internal state of individuals can affect these interactions and thus plays a role in the dynamics of group formation. In this paper, we present a partial differential equation model that accounts for this heterogeneity by introducing a state space that models an individual’s internal state (<i>e.g.</i> age, level of hunger) which affects its movement characteristics. We then apply the model to a concrete example of locust foraging to investigate the dynamic interplay of food availability, hunger, and degree of gregarisation (level of sociability) on locust group formation and structure. We find that including hunger lowers group density and raises the percentage of the population that needs to be gregarious for group formation. Within the group structure itself we find that the most gregarious and satiated locusts tend to be located towards the centre with hunger driving locusts towards the edges of the group. These two effects may combine to give a simple mechanism for locust group dispersal, in that hunger lowers the group density, which in turn lowers the gregarisation, further lowering density and creating a feedback loop. We also note that a previously found optimal food patch size for group formation may be driven by hunger. In addition to our locust results, we provide more general results and methods in the attached appendices.

                <p>by Alexis Hervais-Adelman, Simon W. Townsend</p>

Whether human language evolved via a gestural or a vocal route remains an unresolved and contentious issue. Given the existence of two preconditions—a “language faculty” and the capacity for imitative learning both vocally and manually—there is no compelling evidence for gesture being inherently inferior to vocalization as a mode of linguistic expression; indeed, signed languages are capable of the same expressive range as spoken ones. Here, we revisit this conundrum, championing recent methodological advances in human neuroimaging (specifically, in utero functional magnetic resonance imaging) as a window into the role of the prenatal gestational period in language evolution, a critical, yet currently underexplored environment in which fetuses are exposed to, and become attuned to, spoken language. In this Unsolved Mystery, we outline how, compared to visual sensitivity, the ontogenically earlier development of auditory sensitivity, beginning in utero and persisting for several months <i>post-partum,</i> alongside the relative permeability of the uterine environment to sound, but not light, may constitute a small but significant contribution to the current dominance of spoken language.

                <p>by Buse Isbilir, Anna Yeates, Vikram Alva, Tanmay A. M. Bharat</p>

<i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> is a diderm bacterium extensively used in the industrial-scale production of amino acids. Corynebacteria belong to the bacterial family <i>Mycobacteriaceae</i>, which is characterized by a highly unusual cell envelope with an outer membrane consisting of mycolic acids, called mycomembrane. The mycomembrane is further coated by a surface (S-)layer array in <i>C. glutamicum</i>, making this cell envelope highly distinctive. Despite the biotechnological significance of <i>C. glutamicum</i> and biomedical significance of mycomembrane-containing pathogens, ultrastructural and molecular details of its distinctive cell envelope remain poorly characterized. To address this, we investigated the cell envelope of <i>C. glutamicum</i> using electron cryotomography and cryomicroscopy of focused ion beam-milled single and dividing cells. Our cellular imaging allowed us to map the different components of the cell envelope onto the tomographic density. Our data reveal that <i>C. glutamicum</i> has a variable cell envelope, with the S-layer decorating the mycomembrane in a patchy manner. We further isolated and resolved the structure of the S-layer at 3.1 Å-resolution using single particle electron cryomicroscopy. Our structure shows that the S-layer of <i>C. glutamicum</i> is composed of a hexagonal array of the PS2 protein, which interacts directly with the mycomembrane via an anchoring segment containing a coiled-coil motif. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the PS2 S-layer is sparsely yet exclusively present within the <i>Corynebacterium</i> genus and absent in other genera of the <i>Mycobacteriaceae</i> family, suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways in the development of their cell envelopes. Our structural and cellular data collectively provide a topography of the unusual <i>C. glutamicum</i> cell surface, features of which are shared by many pathogenic and microbiome-associated bacteria, as well as by several industrially significant bacterial species.

Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1), also known as lactate receptor or GPR81, is a class A G-protein-coupled receptor with key roles in regulating lipid metabolism, neuroprotection, angiogenesis, cardiovascular function, and inflammatory response in humans. HCAR1 is highly expressed in numerous types of cancer cells, where it participates in controlling cancer cell metabolism and defense mechanisms, rendering it an appealing target for cancer therapy. However, the molecular basis of HCAR1-mediated signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we report four cryo-EM structures of human HCAR1 and HCAR2 in complex with the Gi1 protein, in which HCAR1 binds to the subtype-specific agonist CHBA (3.16 Å) and apo form (3.36 Å), and HCAR2 binds to the subtype-specific agonists MK-1903 (2.68 Å) and SCH900271 (3.06 Å). Combined with mutagenesis and cellular functional assays, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying ligand recognition, receptor activation, and G protein coupling of HCAR1. More importantly, the key residues that determine ligand selectivity between HCAR1 and HCAR2 are clarified. On this basis, we further summarize the structural features of agonists that match the orthosteric pockets of HCAR1 and HCAR2. These structural insights are anticipated to greatly accelerate the development of novel HCAR1-targeted drugs, offering a promising avenue for the treatment of various diseases.

                <p>by Douglas C. Sloan, Yini Liao, Forest Ray, Brian S. Muntean</p>

G proteins (Gα and Gβγ subtypes) drive adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) synthesis of cAMP in striatal neurons, which is essential for motor coordination. KCTD5 directly interacts with Gβγ to delimit signaling events, yet downstream impact of KCTD5 in striatal circuits is not known. Here, generation of a conditional <i>Kctd5</i> knockout mouse identified that loss of striatal KCTD5 leads to a dystonic phenotype, coordination deficits, and skewed transitions between behavioral syllables. 2-photon imaging of a cAMP biosensor revealed electrically evoked dopaminergic responses were significantly augmented in the absence of KCTD5 in striatal circuits. cAMP sensitization was rescued in situ by expression of Gβγ-scavenging nanobody and motor deficits were partially rescued in vivo by pharmacological antagonism of the indirect striatal cAMP pathway. Therefore, KCTD5 acts as a brake on cAMP signaling in striatal neurons important for tuning dopaminergic signaling and motor coordination.

Multiple viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans are known to have evolved in bats. How bats tolerate infection with these viruses, however, is poorly understood. As viruses engage in a wide range of interactions with their hosts, it is essential to study bat viruses in a system that resembles their natural environment like bat-derived in vitro cellular models. However, stable and accessible bat cell lines are not widely available for the broader scientific community. Here, we generated in vitro reagents for the Seba’s short-tailed bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>), tested multiple methods of immortalization, and characterized their susceptibility to virus infection and response to immune stimulation. Using pseudotyped virus library and authentic virus infections, we show that these <i>C. perspicillata</i> cell lines derived from a diverse array of tissues are susceptible to viruses bearing the glycoprotein of numerous orthohantaviruses, including Andes and Hantaan virus and are also susceptible to live hantavirus infection. Furthermore, stimulation with synthetic double-stranded RNA prior to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus induced a protective antiviral response, demonstrating the suitability of our cell lines to study the bat antiviral immune response. Taken together, the approaches outlined here will inform future efforts to develop in vitro tools for virology from non-model organisms and these <i>C. perspicillata</i> cell lines will enable studies on virus–host interactions in these bats.

Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin secreted by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> strains that cause severe infections. Bicomponent PVL kills phagocytes depending on cell surface receptors, such as complement 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). How the PVL-receptor interaction enables assembly of the leukocidin complex, targeting of membranes, and insertion of a pore channel remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that PVL binds the anionic phospholipids, phosphatidic acid, and cardiolipin, under acidic conditions and targets lipid bilayers that mimic lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes, but not the plasma membrane. The PVL–lipid interaction was sufficient to enable leukocidin complex formation as determined by neutron reflectometry and the rupture of model membranes, independent of protein receptors. In phagocytes, PVL and its C5aR1 receptor were internalized depending on sphingomyelin and cholesterol, which were dispensable for the interaction of the toxin with the plasma membrane. Internalized PVL compromised the integrity of lysosomes and mitochondria before plasma membrane rupture. Preventing the acidification of organelles or the genetic loss of PVL impaired the escape of intracellular <i>S. aureus</i> from macrophages. Together, the findings advance our understanding of how an <i>S. aureus</i> toxin kills host cells and provide key insights into how leukocidins target membranes.

The regeneration of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) reinstates nerve health and function, yet its decreased efficiency with aging and progression of neurodegenerative disease contributes to axonal loss and/or degeneration. Although CNS myeloid cells have been implicated in regulating the efficiency of remyelination, the distinct contribution of blood monocytes versus that of resident microglia is unclear. Here, we reveal that monocytes have non-redundant functions compared to microglia in regulating remyelination. Using a transgenic mouse in which classical monocytes have reduced egress from bone marrow (<i>Ccr2</i><sup>−/−</sup>), we demonstrate that monocytes drive the timely onset of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin protein expression, yet impede myelin production. Ribonucleic acid sequencing revealed a Wnt signature in wild-type mouse lesion monocytes, which was confirmed in monocytes from multiple sclerosis white matter lesions and blood. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Wnt release by monocytes increased remyelination. Our findings reveal monocytes to be critical regulators of remyelination and identify monocytic Wnt signaling as a promising therapeutic target to inhibit for increased efficiency of CNS regeneration.

                <p>by Christina M. Homer, Mark Voorhies, Keith Walcott, Elena Ochoa, Anita Sil</p>

<i>Coccidioides spp</i>. are highly understudied but significant dimorphic fungal pathogens that can infect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised people. In the environment, they grow as multicellular filaments (hyphae) that produce vegetative spores called arthroconidia. Upon inhalation by mammals, arthroconidia undergo a process called spherulation. They enlarge and undergo numerous nuclear divisions to form a spherical structure, and then internally segment until the spherule is filled with multiple cells called endospores. Mature spherules rupture and release endospores, each of which can form another spherule, in a process thought to facilitate dissemination. Spherulation is unique to <i>Coccidioides</i>, and its molecular determinants remain largely unknown. Here, we report the first high-density transcriptomic analyses of <i>Coccidioides</i> development, defining morphology-dependent transcripts and those whose expression is regulated by <i>RYP1</i>, a major regulator required for spherulation and virulence. Of approximately 9,000 predicted transcripts, we discovered 273 transcripts with consistent spherule-associated expression, 82 of which are <i>RYP1</i>-dependent, a set likely to be critical for <i>Coccidioides</i> virulence. ChIP-Seq revealed two distinct regulons of <i>RYP1</i>: one shared between hyphae and spherules and the other unique to spherules. Spherulation regulation was elaborate, with the majority of 227 predicted transcription factors in <i>Coccidioides</i> displaying spherule-enriched expression. We identified provocative targets, including 20 transcripts whose expression is endospore-enriched and 14 putative secreted effectors whose expression is spherule-enriched, of which six are secreted proteases. To highlight the utility of these data, we selected a cluster of <i>RYP1</i>-dependent, arthroconidia-associated transcripts and found that they play a role in arthroconidia cell wall biology, demonstrating the power of this resource in illuminating <i>Coccidioides</i> biology and virulence.

                Background The Indonesian National Data for 2023 shows that the proportion of older adults has reached 11.75%. The Indonesian retirement age is the lowest in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries: 56 or 58. To extend the retirement age, attention must be paid to the elderly population so that they remain healthy and productive. Therefore, this study aims to examine the health conditions of pre-retirement Indonesian workers and compare them to those of workers in urban and rural areas. Methods It used the Indonesian Health Survey 2023 (Survei Kesehatan Indonesia 2023), which comprised 103,730 respondents aged 50–58. A t-test analysis was used to determine the difference between any two categories of data, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for more than two categories. Results The analysis found that male workers in urban areas were 1.087 times more than male workers in rural areas (95% CI: 1.061–1.114). Moreover, the chronic diseases identified are different, namely cancer and diabetes mellitus (DM), which are more common in urban areas, with 1,954 and 1,719 more cases than in urban areas (95% CI: 1.5–2.53 and 1.617–1.827, respectively). Meanwhile, mental disorders in urban workers were significantly higher than in rural areas (95% CI: 1.09–2.46). Conclusion This study indicates that conditions such as cancer, diabetes and mental disorders are found among pre-retirement workers more frequently in urban areas than in rural areas.

                Background Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has emerged as a global health concern due to the migration of infected individuals. With its epidemiological complexity, by difficulty to obtain appropriate diagnoses and poor treatment, the search for novel therapeutic options remains. Methods In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies employing animal models to verify the progress in CD treatment. We searched the PubMed database for CD treatment studies published between 1990 and 2023, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Results Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the fifteen treatment alternatives examined, mainly between 2010 and 2014, demonstrated efficacy in experimental CD models, evidenced by significant parasitemia reduction. Bis-triazole DO870 and VNI were effective in the acute and chronic phases, respectively. However, of these emerging therapies, only posaconazole and fexinidazole have progressed to clinical trials, yielding unsatisfactory outcomes as CD monotherapies Conclusions This meta-analysis highlights the existence of promising new drug candidates for CD treatment, but most remain in the preclinical stages. Those that reached clinical trials did not demonstrate optimal results, underscoring the ongoing challenges in CD therapy. Collaborative efforts among the academic community, pharmaceutical industries, funding agencies, and government agencies are urgently needed to accelerate the development of more effective medications against CD.

                Background People with dementia have a yearly risk of falling of 60 to 80 percent. Therefore, a walker is often recommended. However, the use of a walker in people with dementia is associated with a threefold increased odds of falls compared to their healthy peers who walk with a walker. Better advice and training could reduce fall risk. Therefore, a tool to assess functional walking skills with a walker is needed. The SUMAC was developed to fill this gap. So far, there is no Dutch instrument available that can assess functional walking skills with a walker in people with dementia. Methods Reliability was evaluated by scoring videos of people with dementia (n = 9) using a walker performing the SUMAC-NL. ICC was used to assess inter-rater and test-retest reliability. An expert panel (n = 8) evaluated the content validity using the content validity index (CVI) and the content validity ratio (CVR). Results Inter-rater reliability of the SUMAC-NL was statistically significant for the physical function (PF) domain (ICC = 0.94, 95%CI (0.84, 0.98, p < 0.001) and for the interaction with equipment (EQ) domain (ICC = 0.79, 95%CI (0.49 – 0.95), p < 0.001). Test-retest reliability was statistically significant for both the PF domain (ICC = 0.95, 95%CI (0.89, 0.99), p < 0.001) and EQ domain (ICC = 0.92, 95%CI (0.82, 0.98), p < 0.001). The SUMAC-NL shows content validity with a CVI >0.79 for both domains and a CVR of 0.53 on the PF domain and 0.78 on the EQ domain. Conclusions The SUMAC-NL shows good to excellent reliability and content validity for both the PF and the EQ domain. The SUMAC-NL seems to be a promising tool to assess walking with a walker in people with dementia in the Netherlands.

                Background At the 2020 UN General Assembly, China pledged to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, the traditional social development model has led to increasing carbon emissions annually, highlighting the need to resolve the contradiction between development and carbon reduction. This study examines the relationship between carbon emissions, economy, population, and energy consumption in a specific region to support carbon peak and neutrality goals. Methods A comprehensive indicator system was established, encompassing economic, population, energy consumption, and carbon emissions indicators. The study analyzed these factors during the 12th and 13th Five Year Plans, comparing total carbon emissions in 2010 and across the plans, and assessing trends. It also comprehensively analyzed the relationships and mutual influences among these factors. The study identified the main challenges in achieving carbon peak and neutrality. Using the Kaya model and various factor models, it calculated carbon peak times for three scenarios: baseline (2022), natural (2036), and ambitious (2021). These findings provide a basis for dual carbon path planning. Result The research results indicate that carbon emissions are closely related to the economy, population, and energy consumption. The prediction shows that the future trend of carbon emissions is controllable. Suggestions for dual carbon path planning are proposed to provide empirical basis for policy formulation. Under the baseline scenario, the peak carbon emissions are expected to occur around 2022; Under natural circumstances, the peak carbon emissions will be postponed to 2036; In the ambitious scenario, the carbon peak time can be advanced to 2021. Conclusion The research results are crucial for achieving carbon reduction targets and sustainable development and can be used to formulate targeted policies to promote regional development and support China's carbon neutrality commitments.
