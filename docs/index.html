<p>One adverse social experience in adulthood such as social defeat promotes vulnerability. Two adverse social experiences during development (maternal separation + social defeat) foster resilience. Activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC seems to be crucial for resilience to social adversity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Individuals considered resilient can overcome adversity, achieving normal physical and psychological development, while those deemed vulnerable may not. Adversity promotes structural and functional alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. Moreover, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is intricately linked to neuronal shaping resulting from experiences. We hypothesize that this plasticity plays a crucial role in resilience processes. However, there is a notable absence of studies investigating this plasticity and behavioral changes following social adversity at different life stages. Consequently, we evaluated the impact of social adversity during early postnatal development (maternal separation [MS]), adulthood (social defeat [SD]), and a combined exposure (MS + SD) on behavioral outcomes (anxiety, motivation, anhedonia, and social interaction). We also examined cFos expression induced by social interaction in mPFC and hippocampus of adult male rats. Behavioral analyses revealed that SD-induced anhedonia, whereas MS + SD increased social interaction and mitigated SD-induced anhedonia. cFos evaluation showed that social interaction heightened plasticity in the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices, dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1. Social interaction-associated plasticity was compromised in IL and PrL cortices of the MS and SD groups. Interestingly, social interaction-induced plasticity was restored in the MS + SD group. Furthermore, plasticity was impaired in DG by all social stressors, and in CA3 was impaired by SD. Our findings suggest in male rats (i) two adverse social experiences during development foster resilience; (ii) activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC is a foundation for resilience to social adversity; (iii) plasticity in DG is highly susceptible to social adversity.</p>

                The cis interaction between CD80 and PD-L1 disrupts PD-L1 function. Robinson et al. show that CTLA-4 restores PD-L1 activity, but this requires rigid bivalent binding of CTLA-4 to CD80. The unusual angle of the PD-L1-CD80 interaction indicates that PD-L1 release occurs via a physical reorientation of CD80, which is then unfavorable for PD-L1 binding.

">Operation of spinal sensorimotor circuits controlling phase durations during tied-belt and split-belt locomotion after a lateral thoracic hemisection</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion is controlled by spinal circuits that interact with supraspinal drives and sensory feedback from the limbs. These sensorimotor interactions are disrupted following spinal cord injury. The thoracic lateral hemisection represents an experimental model of an incomplete spinal cord injury, where connections between the brain and spinal cord are abolished on one side of the cord. To investigate the effects of such an injury on the operation of the spinal locomotor network, we used our computational model of cat locomotion recently published in eLife (Rybak et al., 2024) to investigate and predict changes in cycle and phase durations following a thoracic lateral hemisection during treadmill locomotion in tied-belt (equal left-right speeds) and split-belt (unequal left-right speeds) conditions. In our simulations, the hemisection was always applied to the right side. Based on our model, we hypothesized that following hemisection, the contralesional (intact, left) side of the spinal network is mostly controlled by supraspinal drives, whereas the ipsilesional (hemisected, right) side is mostly controlled by somatosensory feedback. We then compared the simulated results with those obtained during experiments in adult cats before and after a mid-thoracic lateral hemisection on the right side in the same locomotor conditions. Our experimental results confirmed many effects of hemisection on cat locomotion predicted by our simulations. We show that having the ipsilesional hindlimb step on the slow belt, but not the fast belt, during split-belt locomotion substantially reduces the effects of lateral hemisection. The model provides explanations for changes in temporal characteristics of hindlimb locomotion following hemisection based on altered interactions between spinal circuits, supraspinal drives, and somatosensory feedback.

">Pro-inflammatory mediators sensitise Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 cation channel (TRPM3) signalling in mouse sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Pro-inflammatory mediators can directly activate pain-sensing neurons, known as nociceptors. Additionally, these mediators can potentiate or sensitise ion channels and receptors expressed by these cells through transcriptional and post-translational modulation, leading to nociceptor hypersensitivity. A well-characterised group of ion channels that subserve nociceptor sensitisation is the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of cation channels. For example, the roles of TRP channels vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) in nociceptor sensitisation and inflammatory pain have been extensively documented. In the case of TRP melastatin 3 (TRPM3), however, despite the increasing recognition of this channel's role in inflammatory pain, the mechanisms driving its sensitisation during inflammation remain poorly understood. Here, we found that an inflammatory soup of bradykinin, interleukin 1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) and tumour necrosis factor  (TNF) sensitised TRPM3 function in isolated mouse sensory neurons; IL-1{beta} and TNF, but not bradykinin, independently potentiated TRPM3 function. TRPM3 expression and translocation to the membrane remained unchanged upon individual or combined exposure to these inflammatory mediators, which suggests post-translational modification occurs. Finally, using the model of complete Freund's adjuvant-induced knee inflammation, we found that pharmacological blockade of TRPM3 does not alleviate inflammatory pain, which contrasts with previous reports using different pain models. We propose that the nuances of the immune response may determine the relative contribution of TRPM3 to nociceptive signalling in different neuro-immune contexts. Collectively, our findings improve insight into the role of TRPM3 sensitisation in inflammatory pain.

">Boosting forward connectivity between primary visual and body selective cortex reduces interference of task irrelevant dimensions on body judgements</a></h4>

              
                We effortlessly categorise other people along socially relevant categories such as sex, age, and emotion. A core question in social vision relates to whether we perceive these categories independently or in relation to each other. Here, we investigated categorisation of sex and emotion from the body, finding that participants generally fail to fully ignore task-irrelevant variations of sex while judging body emotional expressions. In contrast, sex categorisation was unaffected by variations in emotional expression. We propose that this asymmetric interaction between sex and emotion may arise because of bottom-up visual processing, due to partially shared visual features used for both judgments, or because of top-down, categorical associations between sex and emotion categories. To disentangle these possibilities, we used cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to modulate the connectivity between primary visual cortex and the extrastriate body area. We posited that boosting forward connectivity between these regions would increase efficiency of feature-based processing, while boosting feedback connectivity would enhance the separability of semantic categories related to sex and emotion. We found that boosting forward connectivity eliminated the interference of the irrelevant variation of body sex on body emotion judgments, while the same interference remained unaffected with modulation of feedback connectivity. These findings suggest that interactions between sex and emotion in body perception emerge during the perceptual analysis of the stimuli, and add to our understanding of person perception and social categorization.

">Predicting Task Activation Maps from Resting-State Functional Connectivity using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has shown that deep learning is a powerful tool for predicting brain activation patterns evoked through various tasks using resting state features. We replicate and improve upon this recent work to introduce two models, BrainSERF and BrainSurfGCN, that perform at least as well as the state-of-the-art while greatly reducing memory and computational footprints. Our performance analysis observed that low predictability was associated with a possible lack of task engagement derived from behavioral performance. Furthermore, a deficiency in model performance was also observed for closely matched task contrasts, likely due to high individual variability confirmed by low test-retest reliability. Overall, we successfully replicate recently developed deep learning architecture and provide scalable models for further research.

">Adult oligodendrogenesis gates arcuate neuronal glucose sensing through remodelling of the blood-hypothalamus barrier via ADAMTS4</a></h4>

              
                Brain glucose sensing is critical for survival during hypoglycaemia and tunes the level of defended blood glucose, which goes up in diabetes. Neuronal glucose sensing neurons and mechanisms have been identified, but how these neurons access blood concentrations of glucose to adjust their output and maintain glucose homeostasis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adult oligodendrogenesis in the median eminence (ME) is modulated by changes in circulating glucose levels and rapidly upregulated by hypoglycaemia. We show that genetic blockade of new OL production in adult mice impairs the regulation of glucose homeostasis, the integrity of the ME blood-hypothalamus barrier, and neuronal glucose sensing in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH). Unexpectedly, functional integrity of adult-formed myelin is not required for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Instead, newly formed OLs exert their glucoregulatory actions via the synthesis of A disintegrin and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin motifs 4 (ADAMTS4), a metallopeptidase expressed exclusively by OLs and dependent on adult OL genesis to maintain its expression in the ME. Both lack of Adamts4 and ADAMTS4 gain-of-function are associated with impaired glucose homeostasis and remodelling of the blood-hypothalamus barrier, indicating that optimal ADAMTS4 expression is required for the integrity of vascular permeability and normal glycaemic control. Finally, we show that ME ADAMTS4 expression is regulated by changes in peripheral glycaemia and is dysregulated in diabetes, providing a mechanism by which ME OLs contribute to the regulation of glucose homeostasis.

">Protective variant in PLCgamma2 mitigates Alzheimer's disease associated pathology via enhancing beneficial microglia functions</a></h4>

              
                PLCgamma2-P522R (phospholipase C gamma 2, proline 522 to arginine) is a protective variant that reduces the risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Recently, it was shown to decrease beta-amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mouse model of AD. In this study, our goal was to investigate the protective functions of PLCgamma2-P522R variant in less aggressive mouse model of AD as well as to assess underlying mechanisms at the molecular and cellular level using mouse and human microglia models. The effects of the protective PLCgamma2-P522R variant on microglia activation, AD-related beta-amyloid and neuronal pathologies, as well as behavioral changes were investigated in PLCgamma2-P522R knock-in mice crossbred with an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional studies were carried out in cultured and acutely isolated adult PLCgamma2-P522R mouse microglia to study molecular mechanisms. Finally, microglia-like cell models generated from blood and skin biopsy samples of the PLCgamma2-P522R variant carriers were employed to translate the key findings in human cells. Our results demonstrate that the PLCgamma2-P522R variant reduces brain beta-amyloid plaque burden of APP/PS1 mice. Simultaneously, PLCgamma2-P522R variant increased non-proinflammatory microglia activation and microglia clustering around beta-amyloid plaques, leading to reduced beta-amyloid plaque-associated neuronal dystrophy. In cultured mouse primary microglia, PLCgamma2-P522R variant decreased accumulation of large lipid droplets, reduced cell stress, and increased acute response to strong inflammatory stimuli. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in acutely isolated adult mouse microglia as well as in human monocyte-derived microglial cells showed that PLCgamma2-P522R upregulates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and downregulates inflammatory/interferon signaling pathways. Accordingly, PLCgamma2-P522R increased mitochondrial respiration in iPSC -derived microglial cells. Together, these findings suggest that PLCgamma2-P522R variant exerts protection against AD-associated beta-amyloid and neuronal pathologies via enhancing microglial barrier formation around beta-amyloid plaques, but suppressing pro-inflammatory activation. Observed changes in fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial flexibility as well as the downregulation of genes involved in inflammatory signaling pathways suggest that these protective effects of the PLCgamma2-P522R variant are mediated through an anti-ageing mechanism.

">Operant conditioning of cortical waves through a brain-machine interface</a></h4>

              
                At the surface of the cerebral cortex, activity dynamics measured at a mesoscopic (about 0.1 to 1 mm in mouse cortex) scale are characterized by both spontaneous and behavior-related dynamical waves of synchronized neuronal activity. These waves are thought to participate in information propagation and processing, but remain poorly understood. To assess if such mesoscopic coordinated neuronal dynamics can be controlled in a goal-directed manner, we implemented a task in which mice are trained to generate waves with specific trajectories in order to obtain rewards. We tracked propagating waves at the surface of the somatosensory-motor cortex of head-fixed mice in real time by means of wide field calcium imaging, and conditioned the delivery of rewards to the detection of wave trajectories responding to specific spatiotemporal criteria. We found that the majority of the trained mice significantly increased their performance, mainly by increasing the frequency of rewardable waves. As the mice learned to achieve this task, we observed changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of the cortical waves. By revealing that, upon learning, neuronal activity can be shaped at the mesoscopic scale to generate specific waves patterns, our work opens up new perspectives for brain-machine interfacing.

">Validity of a New Stress Induction Protocol using Speech Improvisation (IMPRO)</a></h4>

              
                This paper proposes a novel stress induction protocol utilizing speech improvisation -- Interactive Multitask Performance Response Observation (IMPRO) -- in front of an audience. This approach aims to induce stress through a combination of public speaking, cognitive effort, and challenge to maintain a spontaneous narrative. We investigate the validity of this novel approach by examining physiological responses of 35 healthy participants aged 18 to 38. Saliva cortisol was measured as the ground truth for mental stress assessment. In addition, electrodermal activity (EDA) was used as a non-invasive measure of sympathetic activation, offering real-time data with high resolution. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurement was performed to assess the cortical hemodynamic responses induced by the IMPRO protocol. We focused on hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region associated with stress processing. We found that cortisol levels and EDA significantly increased in response to the stress task compared to the baseline. We also observed a significant change in PFC hemodynamic levels in a set of channels compared to the baseline, with a higher overall increase in the right frontopolar area compared to the left. In conclusion, our findings validated IMPRO as an effective and easy to perform method for mental stress induction.

">Influence of the Glymphatic System on α-Synuclein Propagation: Role of Aquaporin-4 and the Dystrophin-Associated Protein Complex</a></h4>

              
                Propagation and aggregation of prion proteins, such as tau and -synuclein (Syn), are key pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Extracellular clearance pathways, such as the glymphatic system, may play a crucial role in the removal of these toxic proteins from the brain. Primarily active during sleep, this system relies on aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel expression and polarisation to astrocytic endfeet, facilitating interstitial solute clearance. Glymphatic dysfunction has recently been implicated in Parkinsons disease, however the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenic effect of this dysfunction remain unclear. This includes how impaired glymphatic function influences Syn propagation dynamics, and the role of propagating Syn itself on glymphatic function. In this study, we used a mouse model of Syn propagation to elucidate the impact of Syn aggregation on glymphatic function, by measuring CSF-ISF exchange and assessing AQP4 and associated endfoot complex proteins in the brain over time and across different regions. Our results show that direct injection of Syn pre-formed fibrils leads to reduced expression of the AQP4 endfoot complex, but propagation of endogenous Syn induces an enhancement of glymphatic function suggesting compensatory upregulation in response to increasing endogenous Syn burden. To determine the influence of glymphatic dysfunction on Syn propagation dynamics, we then employed a pharmacological approach to inhibit glymphatic function in this model. Acute glymphatic inhibition significantly reduced brain to CSF Syn clearance, and chronic treatment exacerbated Syn pathology, neurodegeneration, and motor behavioural deficits in mice. Together our findings show that Syn clearance and propagation are modulated by glymphatic function and suggest that AQP4 complex dysregulation may contribute to glymphatic impairment associated with Parkinsons diseases.

">Pathogenic microbiota disrupts the intact structure of cerebral organoids by altering energy metabolism</a></h4>

              
                This study investigated the impact of different bacterial populations on the biomolecular structures of cerebral organoids (COs) at various levels. COs were co-cultured with non- pathogenic (NM) and pathogenic (PM) bacterial populations. PM reduced the number of TUJ1+ neurons and disrupted the intact structure of COs. In addition, PM was found to induce changes in the transcript profile of COs, including a decrease in the activity of the glycolysis pathway and an increase in the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to deterioration in cellular energy metabolism, which is linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Proteomic analysis revealed a unique cluster of proteins in COs. PM exposure upregulated proteins related to neurological diseases, consistent with RNA-seq data. Communication between bacteria and neural cells was demonstrated using 18O-stable isotope labeling (SIL)-based metabolic flux analysis. COs showed higher 18O-enrichment of TCA cycle intermediates when co-cultured with NM and PM, indicating increased oxidative phosphorylation activity upon exposure to bacteria. This study provides a useful platform to monitor metabolic signals and communication between microbiotas and human brain cells. The findings suggest that pathogenic bacteria release metabolites that alter biomolecular structures in brain organoids, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases.

">Anisotropy of object non-rigidity: High-level perceptual consequences of cortical anisotropy</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates a compelling instance where variations in a complex, higher-level perceptual phenomenon. Specifically, the anisotropy in object non-rigidity are explained by the distribution of low-level neural properties in the primary visual cortex. Through a combination of mathematical derivations and computational simulations, we replicate psychophysical experiment results that explore the perception of non-rigidity in what should be rigidly rotating objects. Specifically, we examine the visual interpretation of two connected circular rings in rotation. When these rigidly connected rings rotate horizontally, observers predominantly perceive rigid rotation. However, when the image is rotated by 90 degrees, observers perceive only non-rigid wobbling. Additionally, vertically elongated rings appear narrower and longer compared to their horizontal counterparts. Our analysis first shows that these perceived shape changes can be decoded from V1 outputs by considering anisotropies in orientation-selective cells. We then empirically demonstrate that even when the vertically rotating ellipses are widened or the horizontally rotating ellipses are elongated to match shapes, the perceived difference in non-rigidity is reduced, but increased non-rigidity persists in vertical rotations, suggesting that the motion mechanism also plays role. By incorporating cortical anisotropies into motion flow computations, we found that the motion gradients for vertical rotations more closely align with physical wobbling, while horizontal rotations fall between wobbling and rigid rotation. This suggests that intrinsic cortical anisotropies contribute to the heightened perception of non-rigidity when orientation shifts from horizontal to vertical. The study underscores the importance of these cortical anisotropies in shaping perceptual outcomes and raises intriguing questions about their evolutionary significance, particularly regarding their impact on shape constancy and motion perception.

">Distinct roles of general anesthesia activated CeA neurons in acute versus late phase of neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                A previous study discovered a distinct population of GABAergic neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) that can be activated by general anesthesia (CeA-GA) and exert analgesic functions (Hua et al., 2020). To independently reproduce these prior findings and to investigate the electrophysiological properties of CeA-GA neurons, we first used 1.2 percent isoflurane to induce c-Fos activation in the mouse brain and validated the Fos expression by RNAscope in situ hybridization. Indeed, isoflurane induced robust Fos expression in CeA and these Fos+ CeA-GA neurons are GABAergic neurons (Vgat+). We next used Fos-TRAP2 method (different from the CANE method used in the prior study) to label CeA-GA neurons (tdTomato+). Our ex vivo electrophysiological recordings in brain slices revealed that compared to Fos-negative CeA neurons, CeA-GA neurons had significantly higher excitability and exhibited distinct patterns of action potentials. Chemogenetic activation of Fos-TRAPed CeA-GA neurons was effective at increasing pain thresholds in naive mice and mice with early-phase neuropathic pain 2 weeks after spared nerve injury (SNI). However, the same chemogenetic activation of CeA-GA neurons only had modest analgesia in the late phase of SNI at 8 weeks, although it was highly effective in reducing chronic pain-associated anxiety behaviors at this stage. We found that Fos-negative CeA neurons, but not CeA-GA neurons, exhibited increased excitability in the late-phase of SNI, suggesting that chronic pain causes a shift in the relative activity of the CeA microcircuit. Interestingly, Fos-negative neurons exhibited much higher expression of K/Cl cotransporter-2 (KCC2), and KCC2 expression was downregulated in the CeA in the late-phase of neuropathic pain. These results support the idea that targeting CeA-GA neurons may provide therapeutic benefits for pain relief and chronic pain-associated anxiety. Our findings also suggest distinct roles of CeA-GA neurons in regulating physiological pain, acute pain, and chronic pain with a possible involvement of KCC2.

">Longitudinal trajectories of aperiodic EEG activity in early to middle childhood</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging evidence suggests that aperiodic EEG activity may follow a nonlinear growth trajectory in childhood. However, existing studies are limited by small assessment windows and cross-sectional samples that are unable to fully capture these patterns. The current study aimed to characterize the developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity longitudinally from infancy to middle childhood. We examined potential trajectory differences by sex and brain region. We further investigated whether different developmental trajectories resulted in differential associations between aperiodic activity and maternal anxiety symptoms. Methods: A community sample of children and their parents (N=391) enrolled in a longitudinal study of emotion processing were assessed at infancy, and at ages 3 years, 5 years, and 7 years. Analyses included individual growth curve and mixed effect models. Developmental trajectories of the aperiodic slope and offset were investigated across whole brain, frontal, central, temporal, and posterior regions. Associations of whole brain slope and offset with maternal anxiety symptoms were also examined. Results: Developmental trajectories for both slope and offset were generally characterized by a relative increase in early childhood and a subsequent decrease or stabilization by age 7, with variation by brain region. Females showed relatively steeper slopes at some ages, and males showed relatively greater offset at certain ages. Maternal anxiety was negatively associated with slope at 3 years and positively associated with slope at 7 years. Conclusions: The longitudinal developmental trajectory of aperiodic slope in early childhood is nonlinear and shows variation by sex and brain region. The magnitude and direction of associations with maternal anxiety varied by age, corresponding with changes in trajectories. Developmental stage should be considered when interpreting findings related to aperiodic activity in childhood.

">In the brain of the beholder: bi-stable motion reveals mesoscopic-scale feedback modulation in V1</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural processes underlying conscious perception remains a central goal in neuroscience. Visual illusions, whether static or dynamic, provide an effective ecological paradigm for studying conscious perception, as they induce subjective experiences from constant visual inputs. While previous neuroimaging studies have dissociated perceptual interpretation of visual motion from sensory input within the motion-sensitive area (hMT+) in humans, less is known about the role of V1 and its relationship to hMT+ during a bistable perception. To address this, we conducted a layer-fMRI study at 7 T with human participants exposed to a bistable motion quartet stimulus. Despite a constant sensory input, the bistable motion quartet elicits switching horizontal and vertical apparent motion percepts likely due to lateral and feedback connections across low and high-level brain regions (feedback processing). As control, we used an unambiguous version of the motion quartet, hereafter referred to as physical motion stimulus, where horizontal and vertical motion is physically presented as visual stimulus in an alternated fashion (feedforward processing). With the advantage of a sub-millimeter resolution gained at ultra-high field (7 Tesla), we aimed to unveil the differential laminar modulation of V1 (low visual area) and hMT+ (high-visual area) during the physical and bistable condition. Our results indicate that: 1) hMT+ functional activity correlates with conscious perception during both physical and ambiguous stimuli with similar strength. There is no evidence of differential laminar profiles in hMT+ between the two experimental conditions. 2) Between inducer squares, V1 shows a significantly reduced functional response to the ambiguous stimulus compared to the physical stimulus, as it primarily reflects feedback signals with diminished feedforward input. Distinct V1 laminar profiles differentiate the two experimental conditions. 3) The temporal dynamics of V1 and hMT+ become more similar during the ambiguous condition. 4) V1 exhibits reduced specificity to horizontal and vertical motion perception during the ambiguous condition at the retinotopic locations corresponding to the perceived motion. Our findings demonstrate that during the ambiguous condition, there is a stronger temporal coupling between hMT+ and V1 due to feedback signals from hMT+ to V1. Such feedback to V1 might be contributing to the stabilization of the vivid perception of directed motion at the face of constant ambiguous stimulation.

">Cholinergic feedback for context-specific modulation of sensory representations</a></h4>

              
                The brain's ability to prioritize behaviorally relevant sensory information is crucial for adaptive behavior, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in modulating olfactory bulb (OB) circuits in mice. Calcium imaging of cholinergic feedback axons in OB revealed that their activity is strongly 15 correlated with orofacial movements, with little responses to passively experienced odor stimuli. However, when mice engaged in an odor discrimination task, OB cholinergic axons rapidly shifted their response patterns from movement-correlated activity to odor-aligned responses. Notably, these odor responses during olfactory task engagement were absent in cholinergic axons projecting to the dorsal cortex. The level of odor responses correlated with task 20 performance. Inactivation of OB-projecting cholinergic neurons during task engagement impaired performance and reduced odor responses in OB granule cells. Thus, the cholinergic system dynamically modulates sensory processing in a modality-specific and context-dependent manner, providing a mechanism for a flexible and adaptive sensory prioritization.

                Advanced 3D imaging techniques and image segmentation and classification methods can profoundly transform biomedical research by offering deep insights into the cytoarchitecture of the human brain in relation to pathological conditions. Here, we propose a comprehensive pipeline for performing 3D imaging and automated quantitative cellular phenotyping on Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) human brain specimens, a valuable yet underutilized resource. We exploited the versatility of our method by applying it to different human specimens from both adult and pediatric, normal and abnormal brain regions. Quantitative data on neuronal volume, ellipticity, local density, and spatial clustering level were obtained from a machine learning-based analysis of the 3D cytoarchitectural organization of cells identified by different molecular markers in two subjects with malformations of cortical development (MCD). This approach will grant access to a wide range of physiological and pathological paraffin-embedded clinical specimens, allowing for volumetric imaging and quantitative analysis of human brain samples at cellular resolution. Possible genotype-phenotype correlations can be unveiled, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of various brain diseases and enlarging treatment opportunities.

">Reduction of RAD23A extends lifespan and mitigates pathology in TDP-43 mice</a></h4>

              
                Protein misfolding and aggregation are cardinal features of neurodegenerative disease (NDD) and they contribute to pathophysiology by both loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms. This is well exemplified by TDP-43 which aggregates and mislocalizes in several NDDs. The depletion of nuclear TDP-43 leads to reduction in its normal function in RNA metabolism and the cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 leads to aberrant protein homeostasis. A modifier screen found that loss of rad23 suppressed TDP-43 pathology in invertebrate and tissue culture models. Here we show in a mouse model of TDP-43 pathology that genetic or antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated reduction in rad23a confers benefits on survival and behavior, histological hallmarks of disease and reduction of mislocalized and aggregated TDP-43. This results in improved function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and correction of transcriptomic alterations evoked by pathologic TDP-43. RAD23A-dependent remodeling of the insoluble proteome appears to be a key event driving pathology in this model. As TDP-43 pathology is prevalent in both familial and sporadic NDD, targeting RAD23A may have therapeutic potential.

">Parechovirus-3 infection disrupts immunometabolism and leads to glutamate excitotoxicity in neural organoids</a></h4>

              
                Parechovirus ahumpari 3 (HPeV-3), is among the main agents causing severe neonatal neurological infections such as encephalitis and meningitis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and changes to the host cellular landscape leading to neurological disease has been understudied. Through quantitative proteomic analysis of HPeV-3 infected neural organoids, we identified unique metabolic changes following HPeV-3 infection that indicate immunometabolic dysregulation. Protein and pathway analyses showed significant alterations in neurotransmission and potentially, neuronal excitotoxicity. Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and neurofilament light (NfL) confirmed glutamate excitotoxicity to be a key mechanism contributing to neuronal toxicity in HPeV-3 infection and can lead to apoptosis induced by caspase signaling. These insights are pivotal in delineating the metabolic landscape following severe HPeV-3 CNS infection and may identify potential host targets for therapeutic interventions.

">The cardiac, respiratory and gastric rhythms independently modulate corticospinal excitability</a></h4>

              
                Interoception refers to the sensing of the internal state of the body and encompasses various bodily axes. Yet many interoceptive signals display unique qualities. The heart, lungs, and stomach each have their distinct frequencies, afferent pathways, and respective functions. At the same time each of these organs has been demonstrated to interact with neural activity and behaviour. To what extent then should different organs be treated as separate modalities in interoception? We here aim to answer this question by assessing in human participants whether the phase of these visceral rhythms is coupled to the corticospinal excitability of the motor system, and whether this coupling happens in an organ-specific or organ-general manner. We combined continuous physiological recordings with single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to probe phase-amplitude coupling between the phase of the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythm and the amplitude of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP). All three visceral rhythms contributed to MEP amplitude with similar effect sizes at the group level. However, we found no relation between coupling strengths with corticospinal excitability between the three organs. Thus, participants displaying high coupling with one organ did not necessarily display high coupling to the other organs, suggestive of unique interoceptive profiles. There was also no link between self-reported awareness of the organ and the actual coupling, suggesting these are distinct dimensions of interoception. Together these results show that each coupling is mediated by at least partially independent mechanisms.

">TAAR2-9 Knockout Mice Exhibit Reduced Wakefulness and Disrupted REM Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) has gained attention for its roles in modulating neural systems, sleep/wake control, and as a therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders. Although TAARs 2-9 were initially identified as non-canonical olfactory receptors, recent studies have identified extra-nasal receptor distribution of multiple TAARs. To evaluate whether TAARs 2-9 have a role in arousal state regulation, we investigated sleep/wake control in male TAAR2-9 knockout (KO) mice. After determination of baseline sleep/wake patterns, the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation and response to TAAR1 agonists were compared between KO and C57BL/6J mice. Although the EEG of TAAR2-9 KO mice had lower power in the delta and theta bands and higher power in the gamma range, sleep/wake states were readily identified. KO mice had more NREM sleep during the dark phase and more REM sleep during the light phase. Sleep/wake was fragmented in KO mice with shorter Wake and REM bouts during the dark phase and more REM bouts during the light phase. KO mice exhibited more REM sleep during a sleep latency test but the homeostatic response to sleep loss did not differ between the strains. A high dose of the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 increased Wake and reduced NREM sleep in KO mice whereas RO5256390 and the partial TAAR1 agonist RO5263397 suppressed REM sleep. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the ventral tegmental area was significantly elevated in KO mice. These dopaminergic and sleep/wake alterations in TAAR2-9 KO mice highlight the need for further elucidation of the functions of TAAR2-9.

">A brain-body feedback loop driving HPA-axis dysfunction in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Breast cancer patients often exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms in circulating glucocorticoids (GCs), such as cortisol. This disruption correlates with reduced quality of life and higher cancer mortality. The exact cause of this phenomenon; whether due to treatments, stress, age, co-morbidities, lifestyle factors, or the cancer itself remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that primary breast cancer alone blunts host GC rhythms by disinhibiting neurons in the hypothalamus, and that circadian phase-specific neuromodulation of these neurons can attenuate tumor growth by enhancing anti-tumor immunity. We find that mice with mammary tumors exhibit blunted GC rhythms before tumors are palpable, alongside increased activity in paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing corticotropin-releasing hormone (i.e., PVNCRH neurons). Tumor-bearing mice have fewer inhibitory synapses contacting PVNCRH neurons and reduced miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current (mIPSC) frequency, leading to net excitation. Tumor-bearing mice experience impaired negative feedback on GC production, but adrenal and pituitary gland functions are largely unaffected, indicating that alterations in PVNCRH neuronal activity are likely a primary cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction in breast cancer. Using chemogenetics (hM3Dq) to stimulate PVNCRH neurons at different circadian phases, we show that stimulation just before the light-to-dark transition restores normal GC rhythms and reduces tumor progression. These mice have significantly more effector T cells (CD8+) within the tumor than non-stimulated controls, and the anti-tumor effect of PVNCRH neuronal stimulation is absent in mice lacking CD8+ T cells. Our findings demonstrate that breast cancer distally regulates neurons in the hypothalamus that control output of the HPA axis and provide evidence that therapeutic targeting of these neurons could mitigate tumor progression.

                The other-race effect, a disadvantage at recognizing faces of other races than one's own, has received considerable attention, especially regarding its wide scope and underlying mechanisms. Here, we aim to elucidate its neural and representational basis by relating behavioral performance in East Asian and White individuals to neural decoding and image reconstruction relying on electroencephalography data. Our investigation uncovers a reliable neural counterpart of the other-race effect (i.e., a decoding disadvantage for other-race faces) along with its extended dynamics and prominence across individuals. Further, it retrieves, via neural-based image reconstruction, visual representations underlying other-race face perception and their intrinsic biases. Notably, our data-driven approach reveals that other-race faces are perceived not just as more typical but, also, as younger and more expressive. These findings, pointing to multiple visual biases surrounding the other-race effect, speak to the complexity of its neural mechanisms and its social implications.

                Astrocytes exhibit dual roles in central nervous system (CNS) recovery, offering both beneficial and detrimental effects. Following CNS injury, a subset of astrocytes undergoes proliferation, de-differentiation, and acquires self-renewal and neurosphere-forming capabilities in vitro. This subset of astrocytes represents a promising target for initiating brain repair processes and holds potential for neural recovery. However, studying these rare plastic astrocytes is challenging due to the absence of distinct markers. In our study, we characterized these astrocytic subpopulations using comparative single-cell transcriptome analysis. By leveraging the regenerative properties observed in radial glia of zebrafish, we identified and characterized injury-induced plastic astrocytes in mice. These injury-induced astrocytic subpopulations were predominantly proliferative and demonstrated the capacity for self-renewal and neurosphere formation, ultimately differentiating exclusively into astrocytes. Integration with scRNAseq data of the subependymal zone (SEZ) allowed us to trace the origins of these injury-induced plastic astrocytic subpopulations to parenchymal astrocytes. Our analysis revealed that a subset of these injury-induced astrocytes shares transcriptional similarities with endogenous transient amplifying progenitors (TAPs) within the SEZ, rather than with neural stem cells (NSCs). Notably, these injury-induced TAP-like cells exhibit distinct differentiation trajectories, favoring gliogenic over neurogenic differentiation. In summary, our study identifies a rare subset of injury-induced, proliferative plastic astrocytes with neurosphere-forming capacities. These cells originate from reactive astrocytes and resemble TAPs in their transcriptional profile. This study enhances our understanding of astrocyte plasticity post-injury.

">Modulation of cortico-muscular coupling associated with split-belt locomotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Humans can adjust their walking patterns according to the demands of their internal and external environments, referred to as locomotor adaptation. Although significant functional coupling (i.e. cortico-muscular coherence [CMC]) has been shown between cortical and lower-limb muscle activity during steady-state walking, little is known about CMC in locomotor adaptation. Therefore, we investigated the adaptation-dependent modulation of the CMC between the sensorimotor region and the tibialis anterior muscle using a split-belt locomotor adaptation paradigm that can impose an asymmetric perturbation. We hypothesized that the CMC would temporarily decrease after exposure to the asymmetric perturbation and removal of the perturbation because of a mismatch between the predicted and actual sensory feedback. We also hypothesized that the CMC would increase as adaptation and de-adaptation to perturbation progressed because the motor system could become able to predict sensory feedback. Our findings revealed that the CMC temporarily decreased after exposure to and removal of the perturbation. Moreover, the CMC increased with adaptation and de-adaptation to perturbation. Although these results depend on the leg, frequency bands, and gait phases, they partially support our hypothesis. These findings suggest that flexible updating of cortico-muscular coupling in the motor system is a key mechanism underlying locomotor adaptation in humans. The results from our study on healthy young individuals contribute to the understanding of neuromuscular control of gait and provide valuable insight for optimising gait rehabilitation.

                Despite tremendous progress in characterizing the myriad cellular structures in the nervous system, a full appreciation of the interdependent and intricate interactions between these structures is as yet unfulfilled. Indeed, few more so than the interaction between the myelin internode and its ensheathed axon. More than a half-century after the ultrastructural characterization of this axomyelin unit, we lack a reliable understanding of the physiological properties, the significance and consequence of pathobiological processes, and the means to gauge success or failure of interventions designed to mitigate disease. Herein, we highlight shortcomings in the most common statistical procedures used to characterize the axomyelin unit, with particular emphasis on the underlying principles of simple linear regression. These shortcomings lead to insensitive detection and/or ambiguous interpretation of normal physiology, disease mechanisms and remedial methodologies. To address these problems, we syndicate insights from early seminal myelin studies and use a statistical model of the axomyelin unit that is established in the accompanying article. Herein, we develop and demonstrate a statistically-robust analysis pipeline with which to examine and interpret axomyelin physiology and pathobiology in two disease states, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and the rumpshaker mouse model of leukodystrophy. On a cautionary note, our pipeline is a relatively simple and streamlined approach that is not necessarily a panacea for all g ratio analyses. Rather, it approximates a minimum effort needed to elucidate departures from normal physiology and to determine if more comprehensive studies may lead to deeper insights.

">Ultrastructural analysis of the brain endothelium by electron tomography</a></h4>

              
                Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful imaging technique, yielding ultrastructural investigation of organic and non-organic samples. Despite its ability to reach nanoscale resolutions, conventional TEM presents a major disadvantage by only acquiring two-dimensional snapshots, thus hindering our volumetric understanding of samples. Electron tomography (ET) overcomes this limitation by offering detailed views of a thin specimen in 3 dimensions (3D). This technique is widely used in biology and has expanded our understanding of mitochondrial structure or synaptic organization. Proper brain functioning is highly reliable on a constant nutritional support through its microvasculature lined by endothelial cells. These unique cells form a selective and protective barrier, known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the entrance of blood-borne molecules into the brain. In pathological conditions, the BBB is disrupted, resulting in neuronal damage. Understanding the fine changes underlying BBB disruption requires advanced imaging tools such as ET, to detect the finest changes in endothelial ultrastructure. This manuscript briefly explains how TEM and ET function, and then provides a detailed, didactic method for sample preparation, tomogram generation and 3D segmentation of brain endothelial cells using ET.

">Wakefulness induced by TAAR1 partial agonism is mediated through dopaminergic neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a negative regulator of dopamine (DA) release. The partial TAAR1 agonist RO5263397 promotes wakefulness and suppresses NREM and REM sleep in rodents and non-human primates. We tested the hypothesis that the TAAR1-mediated effects on sleep/wake were due, in part, to DA release. Male C57BL6/J mice (n=8) were intraper-itoneally administered the D1R antagonist SCH23390, the D2R antagonist eticlopride, a combi-nation of D1R+D2R antagonists or saline at ZT5.5, followed 30 min later by RO5263397 or vehi-cle per os. EEG, EMG, subcutaneous temperature, and activity were recorded across the 8 treat-ments and sleep architecture was analyzed for 6 hours post-dosing. As described previously, RO5263397 increased wakefulness and delayed NREM and REM sleep onset. D1, D2, and D1+D2 pretreatment reduced RO5263397-induced wakefulness for 1-2 hours after dosing but only the D1 antagonist significantly reduced the TAAR1-mediated increase in NREM latency. Neither the D1 nor the D2 antagonist affected TAAR1-mediated suppression of REM sleep. These results suggest that, whereas TAAR1 effects on wakefulness are mediated in part through the D2R, D1R activation plays a role in reversing the TAAR1-mediated increase in NREM sleep latency. By contrast, TAAR1-mediated suppression of REM sleep appears not to involve D1R or D2R mechanisms.

">Sex-dependent effects of a high-fat diet on the hypothalamic response in mouse</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in rodent models of diet-induced obesity are still poorly documented, particularly regarding how central mechanisms vary between sexes in response to an obesogenic diet. Here, we wanted to determine whether obesity phenotype and hypothalamic response differed between male and female C57Bl/6J mice when exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD). Mice were exposed either a free 60% HFD or standard diet first for both a long- (14 weeks) and shorter-periods of time (3, 7, 14 and 28 days). Analysis of the expression profile of key neuronal, glial and inflammatory hypothalamic markers was performed using RT-qPCR. In addition, astrocytic and microglial morphology was examined in the arcuate nucleus. Monitoring of body weight and composition revealed that body weight and fat mass gain appeared earlier and was more pronounced in male mice. After 14 weeks of HFD exposure, normalized increase of body weight reached similar levels between male and female mice. Overall, both sexes under HFD displayed a decrease of orexigenic neuropeptides expression and an increase in POMC gene expression was observed only in female mice. In addition, changes in the expression of hypothalamic inflammatory markers were relatively modest. We also reported that the glial cell markers expression and morphology were affected by HFD in a sex- and time dependent manner, suggesting a more pronounced glial cell activation in female mice. Taken together, these data show that male and female mice responded differently to HFD exposure, both on short- and long-term and suggest that a strong inflammatory hypothalamic profile is not systematically present in DIO models. Nevertheless, in addition to these present data, the underlying mechanisms should be deciphered in further investigations.

">A double hit affecting the IKZF1-IKZF2 tandem in immune cells of schizophrenic patients regulate specific symptoms</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a complex multifactorial disorder and increasing evidence suggests the involvement of immune dysregulations in its pathogenesis. We observed that IKZF1 and IKZF2, classic immune-related transcription factors (TFs), were both downregulated in patients peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but not in their brain. We generated a new mutant mouse model with a reduction in Ikzf1 and Ikzf2 to study the impact of those changes. Such mice developed deficits in the three dimensions (positive-negative-cognitive) of schizophrenic-like phenotypes associated with alterations in structural synaptic plasticity. We then studied the secretomes of cultured PBMCs obtained from human patients and identified potentially secreted molecules, which depended on IKZF1 and IKZF2 levels, and that in turn have an impact on neural synchrony, structural synaptic plasticity and schizophrenic-like symptoms in in vivo and in vitro models. Our results point out that IKZF1-IKZF2-dependent immune signals negatively impact on essential neural circuits involved in schizophrenia.

">Human microRNA-153-3p targets specific neuronal genes and is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by a significant loss of neurons and synapses in cognitive brain regions and is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. AD pathology comprises extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. However, the triggers of this pathology are still poorly understood. Repressor element 1-silencing transcription/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF), a transcription repressor of neuronal genes, is dysregulated during AD pathogenesis. How REST is dysregulated is still poorly understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of short non-coding RNAs, typically regulate protein expression by interacting with target mRNA transcript 3-untranslated region (UTR) and play essential roles in AD pathogenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-153-3p reduces REST 3-UTR activities, mRNA, and protein levels in human cell lines, along with downregulating amyloid {beta} precursor protein (APP) and -synuclein (SNCA). We determine by mutational analyses that miR-153-3p interacts with specific targets via the seed sequence present within the respective mRNA 3-UTR. We show that miR-153-3p treatment alters the expression of these specific proteins in human neuronally differentiated cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells and that miR-153-3p is itself dysregulated in AD. We further find that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 5kb of the MIR153-1 and MIR153-2 genes are associated with AD-related endophenotypes. Elevation of miR-153-3p is associated with reduced AD probability, while elevated REST may associate with a greater AD probability. Our work suggests that a supplement of miR-153-3p would reduce levels of toxic protein aggregates by reducing APP, SNCA, and REST expression, all pointing towards a therapeutic and biomarker potential of miR-153-3p in AD and related dementias.

	<p>Study Objectives: The Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Informatics System contains individual-patient-level traumatic brain injury (TBI) data, which when combined, allows for the examination of rates and outcomes for key subpopulations at risk for developing sleep disturbance. Methods: This proof-of-concept study creates a model system for harmonizing data (i.e., combining and standardizing data) across FITBIR studies for participants with and without a history of TBI to estimate rates of sleep disturbance and identify risk factors. Results: Three studies were eligible for harmonization (N = 1753). Sleep disturbance was common among those with a history of mild TBI (63%). Individuals with mild TBI were two to four times more likely to have sleep disturbance compared to those with no history of TBI. Conclusions: This study established methods, harmonization code, and meta-databases that are publicly available on the FITBIR website. We demonstrated how the harmonization of FITBIR studies can answer TBI research questions, showing that associations between TBI and sleep disturbance may be influenced by demographic factors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

                <p>Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks. However, a major technical challenge for investigating astrocyte function and disease-related pathophysiology has been the limited ability to obtain functional human astrocytes. Despite recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) techniques, primary rodent astrocytes remain the gold standard in coculture with human neurons. We demonstrate that a combination of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) directs hPSC-derived neural precursor cells to a highly pure population of astroglia in 28&nbsp;d. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we confirm the astroglial identity of these cells and highlight profound transcriptional adaptations in cocultured hPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons, consistent with their further maturation. In coculture with human neurons, multielectrode array recordings revealed robust network activity of human neurons in a coculture with hPSC-derived or rat astrocytes [3.63 &plusmn; 0.44&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (hPSC-derived), 2.86 &plusmn; 0.64&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>= 0.19]. In comparison, we found increased spike frequency within network bursts of human neurons cocultured with hPSC-derived astrocytes [56.31 &plusmn; 8.56&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 24.77 &plusmn; 4.04&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.01], and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increase of postsynaptic currents [2.76 &plusmn; 0.39&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 1.07 &plusmn; 0.14&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001], consistent with a corresponding increase in synapse density [14.90 &plusmn; 1.27/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (hPSC-derived), 8.39 &plusmn; 0.63/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001]. Taken together, we show that hPSC-derived astrocytes compare favorably with rat astrocytes in supporting human neural network activity and maturation, providing a fully human platform for investigating astrocyte function and neuronal-glial interactions.</p>

                <p>Much of what has been discovered concerning neurophysiological mechanisms can be credited to ex vivo biomedical experiments. Beyond these discoveries, ex vivo research techniques have enhanced the global understanding of human physiology and pathology in almost every biomedical specialty. Naturally, ex vivo experiments are among the most desired methods of research, particularly in the field of neuroscience. Ex vivo experiment platforms may be purchased commercially. However, their substantial cost and sometimes limited availability can render them inaccessible to many research labs. Moreover, these manufactured systems are often rigid in function with no possibility of customization, severely narrowing their capabilities. However, developing essential components for ex vivo laboratory systems with a fused deposition modeling printer provides a practical solution to each of these obstacles. Here, we provide the designs and construction process for an easily accessible, highly adaptable recording stage with modifiable submersion chambers using a 3D printer for a total cost under $15.00. With the versatility afforded by the exchangeable custom chambers, the system may be used to conduct research on a variety of ex vivo tissue preparations, paving the way for novel research.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                Background The current report describes a unimodular thyroid goiter (TGo), identified unilaterally in a female cadaver, causing displacement or compression effects in the adjacent neck structures (common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV),). Methods Routine dissection of the neck of an 86-year-old female donated a Greek cadaver. Results A thyroid gland variant was identified coexisting with a TGo originating from the left thyroid lobe. The variant is a pyramidal lobe located on the left side of the isthmus. Owing to the presence of the TGo, the left CCA, along with the left IJV, deviated 50.6 mm ipsilaterally from the midline of the neck. The right CCA had a minor deviation of 30.8 mm, from the midline to the right side due to the proximity of the shifted trachea and esophagus with the CCA origin. The trachea and esophagus deviated contralaterally to the TGo, 24.4 mm from the midline. Conclusions CCA compression, stenosis, and angulation may cause dizziness, weakness, and hypomnesia. The potential outcomes were worse with IJV compression. Atherosclerosis tends to occur more often in arteries with inclined (angulated) parts.

                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent condition caused by weakened pelvic floor support structures. Extracellular matrix alterations, including changes in collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Human platelet-rich fibrin lysate (hPRF-L) is a novel regenerative treatment that has shown beneficial results in treating structural weaknesses related to various pelvic floor diseases, including POP. Methods This study protocol aims to investigate the effects of hPRF-L injection on collagen I, III, and MMP-1 in the vaginal mucosa of a rat POP model. POP will be induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, which will be randomly assigned to control, sham, and hPRF-L treatment groups. The hPRF-L group will receive weekly injections of hPRF-L (25, 50, or 75 μL) into the vaginal mucosa for 4 weeks. Vaginal tissue samples will be collected, and collagen type I, collagen type III, and MMP-1 expression will be evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Data analysis will be performed with ANOVA and post-hoc tests. Discussion The findings from this study protocol are expected to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which hPRF-L impacts the structural integrity of the pelvic floor. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study aims to inform future POP treatment strategies. The anticipated results are an increase in collagen type I and III expression and a reduction in MMP-1 levels in the hPRF-L treatment group compared to the control and sham groups. These outcomes could support the use of hPRF-L as a regenerative therapy for managing POP, offering a potential alternative to more invasive surgical interventions. Conclusion The expected results will contribute to the development of less invasive treatments for POP, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

                CSNK1A1 is a key regulator of various signalling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Playing a central role in cellular function and disease pathology, CSNK1A1 has emerged as an attractive protein target for therapeutic development. In this study we characterize ten CSNK1A1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Monitoring and strict control of anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. The objective of this research was to explore the association of the quality of anticoagulation control with the occurrence of stroke, thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, or death during follow-up in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) on vitamin K antagonists. Methods A retrospective and observational study was carried out in clinical practice (real world data). Data were collected on age, sex, income level, occupational status, ischemic stroke, thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, death, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) was measured using TAONet software and TTR ≥60% was considered indicative of good anticoagulation control. Survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models to compare time-to-event by quality of anticoagulation control. Determinants of anticoagulation quality were identified using logistic regression. Results Of 856 patients recruited, only 286 (33%) had a TTR ≥60%. Cox models including sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that the risk of all four events was much higher in the subsample with TTR <60% and the differences were statistically significant. Specifically, the hazard ratios (HRs) for this group were 1.94 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.30) for stroke, 1.60 (CI: 1.10-2.33) for thrombotic events, 1.61 (CI: 1.08-2.42) for hemorrhagic events and 2.97 (CIs: 1.86-4.75) for death. Conclusions The positive conclusion of the study was the markedly lower rate of events associated with TTR ≥60% and the negative conclusion was the low percentage of patients achieving good anticoagulation control. This implies that despite being “protected”, they continue to have a high risk of stroke, embolism, hemorrhagic complications and death. We believe it is necessary to develop and implement strategies to tackle this problem.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

                <p>by Brian C. O’Meara, Jeremy M. Beaulieu</p>

Across a variety of biological datasets, from genomes to conservation to the fossil record, evolutionary rates appear to increase toward the present or over short time scales. This has long been seen as an indication of processes operating differently at different time scales, even potentially as an indicator of a need for new theory connecting macroevolution and microevolution. Here we introduce a set of models that assess the relationship between rate and time and demonstrate that these patterns are statistical artifacts of time-independent errors present across ecological and evolutionary datasets, which produce hyperbolic patterns of rates through time. We show that plotting a noisy numerator divided by time versus time leads to the observed hyperbolic pattern; in fact, randomizing the amount of change over time generates patterns functionally identical to observed patterns. Ignoring errors can not only obscure true patterns but create novel patterns that have long misled scientists.

                <p>by Israel Luis, Maarten Afschrift, Friedl De Groote, Elena M. Gutierrez-Farewik</p>

The metabolic energy rate of individual muscles is impossible to measure without invasive procedures. Prior studies have produced models to predict metabolic rates based on experimental observations of isolated muscle contraction from various species. Such models can provide reliable predictions of metabolic rates in humans if muscle properties and control are accurately modeled. This study aimed to examine how muscle-tendon model individualization and metabolic energy models influenced estimation of muscle-tendon states and time-series metabolic rates, to evaluate the agreement with empirical data, and to provide predictions of the metabolic rate of muscle groups and gait phases across walking speeds. Three-dimensional musculoskeletal simulations with prescribed kinematics and dynamics were performed. An optimal control formulation was used to compute muscle-tendon states with four levels of individualization, ranging from a scaled generic model and muscle controls based on minimal activations, inclusion of calibrated muscle passive forces, personalization of Achilles and quadriceps tendon stiffnesses, to finally informing muscle controls with electromyography. We computed metabolic rates based on existing models. Simulations with calibrated passive forces and personalized tendon stiffness most accurately estimate muscle excitations and fiber lengths. Interestingly, the inclusion of electromyography did not improve our estimates. The whole-body average metabolic cost was better estimated with a subset of metabolic energy models. We estimated metabolic rate peaks near early stance, pre-swing, and initial swing at all walking speeds. Plantarflexors accounted for the highest cost among muscle groups at the preferred speed and were similar to the cost of hip adductors and abductors combined. Also, the swing phase accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total cost in a gait cycle, and its relative cost decreased with walking speed. Our prediction might inform the design of assistive devices and rehabilitation treatment. The code and experimental data are available online.

                <p>by Monica Golumbeanu, Olivier Briët, Clara Champagne, Jeanne Lemant, Munir Winkel, Barnabas Zogo, Maximilian Gerhards, Marianne Sinka, Nakul Chitnis, Melissa Penny, Emilie Pothin, Tom Smith</p>

In recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access R package that quantifies the impact of vector control interventions depending on mosquito species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 <i>Anopheles</i> species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.

An understanding of human brain individuality requires the integration of data on brain organization across people and brain regions, molecular and systems scales, as well as healthy and clinical states. Here, we help advance this understanding by leveraging methods from computational genomics to integrate large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, neuroimaging, and electronic-health record data sets. We estimated genetically regulated gene expression (gr-expression) of 18,647 genes, across 10 cortical and subcortical regions of 45,549 people from the UK Biobank. First, we showed that patterns of estimated gr-expression reflect known genetic–ancestry relationships, regional identities, as well as inter-regional correlation structure of directly assayed gene expression. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to discover 1,065 associations between individual variation in gr-expression and gray-matter volumes across people and brain regions. We benchmarked these associations against results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same sample and found hundreds of novel associations relative to these GWAS. Third, we integrated our results with clinical associations of gr-expression from the Vanderbilt Biobank. This integration allowed us to link genes, via gr-expression, to neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes. Fourth, we identified associations of polygenic gr-expression with structural and functional MRI phenotypes in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a small neuroimaging-genomic data set with high-quality functional imaging data. Finally, we showed that estimates of gr-expression and magnitudes of TWAS were generally replicable and that the <i>p</i>-values of TWAS were replicable in large samples. Collectively, our results provide a powerful new resource for integrating gr-expression with population genetics of brain organization and disease.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

     alt="Covariation of Skull and Brain Morphology in Domestic Dogs"/>
<p>Using T2-weighted MRI studies of 79 dogs, we find that skull shape covaries with brain morphology. Dogs with extreme skull shapes – brachycephaly and dolichocephaly – show regional reductions in relative gray matter volume.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite their distinct embryonic origins, the skull and brain are highly integrated. Understanding the covariation between the skull and brain can shed light on anatomical, cognitive, and behavioral traits in extant and extinct species. Domestic dogs offer a unique opportunity to investigate skull–brain covariation due to their diverse skull morphologies and neural anatomy. To assess this question, we examined <i>T</i>2-weighted MRI studies of 62 dogs from 33 breeds, plus an additional 17 dogs of mixed or unknown breeds. Scans were opportunistically collected from a veterinary teaching hospital of dogs that were referred for neurological examination but did not have grossly observable structural brain abnormalities. As the neurocrania of dogs become broader and shorter, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the right olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, marginal gyrus, and cerebellum. On the other hand, as the neurocrania of dogs become narrower and longer, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum, and brainstem. Selective breeding for specific skull shapes may impact canine brain anatomy and function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1394/v7?src=rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 7; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to acid-catalysed cyclization of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 413 hemp-based products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 48 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Zhang et al. discovered that bookmarking factor FOXA1 undergoes dynamic phosphorylation at Serine 221 by Aurora B during mitosis, orchestrating its different DNA binding patterns and the periodic FOXA1 condensate formation during the cell cycle. Moreover, this phosphorylation regulates the target gene reactivation post-mitosis and cancer cell proliferation.

                Orn is a diribonuclease that is essential in some γ-proteobacteria but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using genetic screens in P. aeruginosa, Kim et al. identified that yciV, which encodes RNase AM, has dinuclease activity that is sufficient to prevent lethality. The results indicate that the removal of diribonucleotides is an essential function in γ-proteobacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91636">Language experience shapes predictive coding of rhythmic sound sequences</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual systems heavily rely on prior knowledge and predictions to make sense of the environment. Predictions can originate from multiple sources of information, including contextual short-term priors, based on isolated temporal situations, and context-independent long-term priors, arising from extended exposure to statistical regularities. While the effects of short-term predictions on auditory perception have been well-documented, how long-term predictions shape early auditory processing is poorly understood. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography data from native speakers of two languages with different word orders (Spanish: functor-initial vs Basque: functor-final) listening to simple sequences of binary sounds alternating in duration with occasional omissions. We hypothesized that, together with contextual transition probabilities, the auditory system uses the characteristic prosodic cues (duration) associated with the native language’s word order as an internal model to generate long-term predictions about incoming non-linguistic sounds. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the amplitude of the mismatch negativity elicited by sound omissions varied orthogonally depending on the speaker’s linguistic background and was most pronounced in the left auditory cortex. Importantly, listening to binary sounds alternating in pitch instead of duration did not yield group differences, confirming that the above results were driven by the hypothesized long-term ‘duration’ prior. These findings show that experience with a given language can shape a fundamental aspect of human perception – the neural processing of rhythmic sounds – and provides direct evidence for a long-term predictive coding system in the auditory cortex that uses auditory schemes learned over a lifetime to process incoming sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87935">Vangl2 suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates sepsis by targeting p65 for NDP52-mediated autophagic degradation</a></h4>

              
                Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core planar cell polarity component, plays an important role in polarized cellular and tissue morphology induction, growth development, and cancer. However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (<i>Vangl2</i><sup>ΔM</sup>) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2-deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-κB signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-κB-mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95888">TMC7 deficiency causes acrosome biogenesis defects and male infertility in mice</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are a highly conserved ion channel family consisting of eight members (TMC1–TMC8) in mammals. TMC1/2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells, and mutations of TMC1/2 cause deafness in humans and mice. However, the physiological roles of other TMC proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we show that <i>Tmc7</i> is specifically expressed in the testis and that it is required for acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. <i>Tmc7</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids, similar to human oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. We further demonstrate that TMC7 is colocalized with GM130 at the <i>cis</i>-Golgi region in round spermatids. TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the developing acrosome. Moreover, upon loss of TMC7 intracellular ion homeostasis is impaired and ROS levels are increased, which in turn causes Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these results suggest that TMC7 is required to maintain pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for acrosome biogenesis. Our findings unveil a novel role for TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94088">Ethnic and region-specific genetic risk variants of stroke and its comorbid conditions can define the variations in the burden of stroke and its phenotypic traits</a></h4>

              
                Burden of stroke differs by region, which could be attributed to differences in comorbid conditions and ethnicity. Genomewide variation acts as a proxy marker for ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We present an integrated approach to understand this variation by considering prevalence and mortality rates of stroke and its comorbid risk for 204 countries from 2009 to 2019, and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk variant for all these conditions. Global and regional trend analysis of rates using linear regression, correlation, and proportion analysis, signifies ethnogeographic differences. Interestingly, the comorbid conditions that act as risk drivers for stroke differed by regions, with more of metabolic risk in America and Europe, in contrast to high systolic blood pressure in Asian and African regions. GWAS risk loci of stroke and its comorbid conditions indicate distinct population stratification for each of these conditions, signifying for population-specific risk. Unique and shared genetic risk variants for stroke, and its comorbid and followed up with ethnic-specific variation can help in determining regional risk drivers for stroke. Unique ethnic-specific risk variants and their distinct patterns of linkage disequilibrium further uncover the drivers for phenotypic variation. Therefore, identifying population- and comorbidity-specific risk variants might help in defining the threshold for risk, and aid in developing population-specific prevention strategies for stroke.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97568">The bacterial quorum sensing signal 2’-aminoacetophenone rewires immune cell bioenergetics through the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis to mediate tolerance to infection</a></h4>

              
                How bacterial pathogens exploit host metabolism to promote immune tolerance and persist in infected hosts remains elusive. To achieve this, we show that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>PA</i>)<i>,</i> a recalcitrant pathogen, utilizes the quorum sensing (QS) signal 2’-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). Here, we unveil how 2-AA-driven immune tolerization causes distinct metabolic perturbations in murine macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. We present evidence indicating that these effects stem from decreased pyruvate transport into mitochondria. This reduction is attributed to decreased expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<i>Mpc1</i>), which is mediated by diminished expression and nuclear presence of its transcriptional regulator, estrogen-related nuclear receptor alpha (Esrra). Consequently, Esrra exhibits weakened binding to the <i>Mpc1</i> promoter. This outcome arises from the impaired interaction between Esrra and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a). Ultimately, this cascade results in diminished pyruvate influx into mitochondria and, consequently reduced ATP production in tolerized murine and human macrophages. Exogenously added ATP in infected macrophages restores the transcript levels of <i>Mpc1</i> and <i>Esrra and</i> enhances cytokine production and intracellular bacterial clearance. Consistent with the in vitro findings, murine infection studies corroborate the 2-AA-mediated long-lasting decrease in ATP and acetyl-CoA and its association with <i>PA</i> persistence, further supporting this QS signaling molecule as the culprit of the host bioenergetic alterations and <i>PA</i> persistence. These findings unveil 2-AA as a modulator of cellular immunometabolism and reveal an unprecedented mechanism of host tolerance to infection involving the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis in its influence on Mpc1/OXPHOS-dependent energy production and <i>PA</i> clearance. These paradigmatic findings pave the way for developing treatments to bolster host resilience to pathogen-induced damage. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is likely that 2-AA-like molecules with similar functions may be present in other pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91619">Conserved regulatory motifs in the juxtamembrane domain and kinase N-lobe revealed through deep mutational scanning of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase domain</a></h4>

              
                MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (METΔEx14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of the MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild-type and METΔEx14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase ⍺C-helix, pointing to potential differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a β5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for the kinase domain in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98579">Engineering PEG10assembled endogenous virus-like particles with genetically encoded neoantigen peptides for cancer vaccination</a></h4>

              
                Tumor neoantigen peptide vaccines hold potential for boosting cancer immunotherapy, yet efficiently co-delivering peptides and adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells in vivo remains challenging. Virus-like particle (VLP), which is a kind of multiprotein structure organized as virus, can deliver therapeutic substances into cells and stimulate immune response. However, the weak targeted delivery of VLP in vivo and its susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies hinder their clinical applications. Here, we first designed a novel protein carrier using the mammalian-derived capsid protein PEG10, which can self-assemble into endogenous VLP (eVLP) with high protein loading and transfection efficiency. Then, an engineered tumor vaccine, named ePAC, was developed by packaging genetically encoded neoantigen into eVLP with further modification of CpG-ODN on its surface to serve as an adjuvant and targeting unit to dendritic cells (DCs). Significantly, ePAC can efficiently target and transport neoantigens to DCs, and promote DCs maturation to induce neoantigen-specific T cells. Moreover, in mouse orthotopic liver cancer and humanized mouse tumor models, ePAC combined with anti-TIM-3 exhibited remarkable antitumor efficacy. Overall, these results support that ePAC could be safely utilized as cancer vaccines for antitumor therapy, showing significant potential for clinical translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95289">Limited column formation in the embryonic growth plate implies divergent growth mechanisms during pre- and postnatal bone development</a></h4>

              
                Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96394">Lymphoid origin of intrinsically activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells in mice</a></h4>

              
                We identified a novel mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) lineage derived from the common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) that is dependent on expression of <i>Bcl11a</i>. These CLP-derived pDCs, which we refer to as ‘B-pDCs’, have a unique gene expression profile that includes hallmark B cell genes, normally not expressed in conventional pDCs. Despite expressing most classical pDC markers such as SIGLEC-H and PDCA1, B-pDCs lack IFN-α secretion, exhibiting a distinct inflammatory profile. Functionally, B-pDCs induce T cell proliferation more robustly than canonical pDCs following Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. B-pDCs, along with another homogeneous subpopulation of myeloid-derived pDCs, display elevated levels of the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, mirroring human AXL<sup>+</sup> transitional DCs in function and transcriptional profile. Murine B-pDCs therefore represent a phenotypically and functionally distinct CLP-derived DC lineage specialized in T cell activation and previously not described in mice.

	<p>Social withdrawal in rodents is a measure of asociality, an important negative symptom of schizophrenia. The Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) rat strains have been reported to exhibit differential profiles in schizophrenia-relevant behavioral phenotypes. This investigation was focused on the study of social and non-social behavior of these two rat strains following acute administration of dizocilpine (MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist), a pharmacological model of schizophrenia-like features used to produce asociality and hyperactivity. Also, since oxytocin (OXT) has been proposed as a natural antipsychotic and a potential adjunctive therapy for social deficits in schizophrenia, we have evaluated the effects of OXT administration and its ability to reverse the MK801-impairing effects on social and non-social behavior and MK801-induced hyperactivity. MK801 administration produced hyperlocomotion and a decrease in social and non-social behavior in both rat strains, but these drug effects were clearly more marked in RHA rats. OXT (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) attenuated MK801-induced hyperlocomotion in both rat strains, although this effect was more marked in RHA rats. The MK801-decreasing effect on exploration of the &amp;amp;ldquo;social hole&amp;amp;rdquo; was moderately but significantly attenuated only in RLA rats. This study is the first to demonstrate the differential effects of OXT on MK801-induced impairments in the two Roman rat strains, providing some support for the potential therapeutic effects of OXT against schizophrenia-like symptoms, including both a positive-like symptom (i.e., MK801-induced hyperlocomotion) and a negative-like symptom (i.e., MK801 decrease in social behavior), while highlighting the importance of the genetic background (i.e., the rat strain) in influencing the effects of both MK801 and oxytocin.</p>

	<p>Background: Developing and testing methods for reliably measuring the state of consciousness of individuals is important for both basic research and clinical purposes. In recent years, several promising measures of consciousness, grounded in theoretical developments, have been proposed. However, the degrees to which these measures are affected by changes in brain activity that are not related to changes in the degree of consciousness has not been well tested. In this study, we examined whether several of these measures are modulated by the loading of cognitive resources. Methods: We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 12 participants in two conditions: (1) while passively attending to sensory stimuli related to the measures and (2) during increased cognitive load consisting of a demanding working memory task. We investigated whether a set of proposed objective EEG-based measures of consciousness differed between the passive and the cognitively demanding conditions. Results: The P300b event-related potential (sensitive to conscious awareness of deviance from an expected pattern in auditory stimuli) was significantly affected by concurrent performance on a working memory task, whereas various measures based on signal diversity of spontaneous and perturbed EEG were not. Conclusion: Because signal diversity-based measures of spontaneous or perturbed EEG are not sensitive to the degree of cognitive load, we suggest that these measures may be used in clinical situations where attention, sensory processing, or command following might be impaired.</p>

	<p>This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) method on chronic subjective tinnitus. The research was planned as an observational study. The study group comprises individuals who applied to the training and research hospital in Ankara between 2019 and 2020 and were aged between 15 and 60 years old. They were identified as having tinnitus. The study samples were determined as 36 participants selected through purposeful sampling. The samples of the 36 participants included in the study. 12 were assigned to the 1st Group EMDR and Masking Group, 12 to the 2nd Group Masking and EMDR Group, and 12 to the 3rd Control Group. The study&amp;amp;rsquo;s dependent variable was the tinnitus levels of the participants, and the independent variable was EMDR and the Masking method. The dependent variable data of the study was collected with the Visual Analog Scale and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). EMDR and Masking methods used as independent variables in the study were conducted in eight sessions for two months. As a result of the Wilcoxon Sign test used to determine whether the EMDR Method is effective on tinnitus severity level, the difference between tinnitus severity level pretest and post-test median scores of tinnitus patients was found to be statistically significant. Our research findings show that the EMDR method reduces and improves chronic subjective tinnitus, and further studies with a larger sample size could confirm our results.</p>

	<p>Background: As one of the leading causes of disability in the world, stroke can determine a reduction of balance performance with a negative impact on daily activity and social life. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sensor-based balance training with exergaming feedback on balance skills in chronic stroke patients. Methods: 21 individuals (11F, 57.14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.82 years) with a single event of ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to the sensor-based balance training group (SB-group) or the usual care balance training group (UC-group). Both groups received 10 add-on sessions with exergaming feedback (SB-group) or conventional training (UC-group). Clinical and instrumental evaluation was performed before (t0), after (t1), and after one month (t2) from intervention. Participation level was assessed using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale at the end of each session. Results: The SB-group showed an improvement in postural stability (p = 0.02) when compared to the UC-group. In the evaluation of motivational level, the score was statistically higher in the SB-group with respect to the UC-group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Except for the improvement in postural stability, no difference was recorded in clinical score, suggesting a comparable gain in both groups. However, patients undergoing sensor-based training exhibited a higher participation score, ultimately indicating the use of this training to improve the adherence to rehabilitation settings, especially in patients with lower compliance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0243-24.2024?rss=1">Presaccadic Attention Enhances and Reshapes the Contrast Sensitivity Function Differentially around the Visual Field</a></h4>

              
                <p>Contrast sensitivity (CS), which constrains human vision, decreases from fovea to periphery, from the horizontal to the vertical meridian, and from the lower vertical to the upper vertical meridian. It also depends on spatial frequency (SF), and the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) depicts this relation. To compensate for these visual constraints, we constantly make saccades and foveate on relevant objects in the scene. Already before saccade onset, presaccadic attention shifts to the saccade target and enhances perception. However, it is unknown whether and how it modulates the interplay between CS and SF, and if this effect varies around polar angle meridians. CS enhancement may result from a horizontal or vertical shift of the CSF, increase in bandwidth, or any combination. In addition, presaccadic attention could enhance CS similarly around the visual field, or it could benefit perception more at locations with poorer performance (i.e., vertical meridian). Here, we investigated these possibilities by extracting key attributes of the CSF of human observers. The results reveal that presaccadic attention (1) increases CS across SF, (2) increases the most preferred and the highest discernable SF, and (3) narrows the bandwidth. Therefore, presaccadic attention helps bridge the gap between presaccadic and postsaccadic input by increasing visibility at the saccade target. Counterintuitively, this CS enhancement was more pronounced where perception is better&mdash;along the horizontal than the vertical meridian&mdash;exacerbating polar angle asymmetries. Our results call for an investigation of the differential neural modulations underlying presaccadic perceptual changes for different saccade directions.</p>

                <p>When presented shortly after another, discrete pictures are naturally perceived as continuous. The neuronal mechanism underlying such continuous or discrete perception is not well understood. While continuous alpha oscillations are a candidate for orchestrating such neuronal mechanisms, recent evidence is mixed. In this study, we investigated the influence of prestimulus alpha oscillation on visual temporal perception. Specifically, we were interested in whether prestimulus alpha phase modulates neuronal and perceptual processes underlying discrete or continuous perception. Participants had to report the location of a missing object in a visual temporal integration task, while simultaneously MEG data were recorded. Using source reconstruction, we evaluated local phase effects by contrasting phase angle values between correctly and incorrectly integrated trials. Our results show a phase opposition cluster between &ndash;0.8 and &ndash;0.5&nbsp;s (relative to stimulus presentation) and between 6 and 20&nbsp;Hz. These momentary phase angle values were correlated with behavioral performance and event-related potential amplitude. There was no evidence that frequency defined a window of temporal integration.</p>

                Background Case detection for Tuberculosis remains low in high-burden communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the first point of contact for many rural Nigerians and have been useful in active case finding. This study assessed the effectiveness of cash incentives and training on tuberculosis case detection by CHWs in six Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Materials and Methods A cluster randomized control trial with three arms was conducted. Arm A received cash incentives and training, Arm B received only training, and the control arm (C) received neither. CHWs already working in the communities participated. TB case notification and number of community outreaches held were used to assess intervention effects. Data were analyzed using STATA (v.13) and GraphPad Prism (v.8). Effect sizes were calculated using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Associations were tested using Chi-square (χ²) tests, with significance set at P=0.05. Results Arm A had a 14.4% increase in case notification, Arm B showed a 7.4% increase, and the control arm showed a 39.7% increase from the previous year. Arms A and B had lower odds of TB case notification post-intervention, compared to the control (OR = 0.819 and 0.769, respectively), with no significant difference between them. Arm A also saw a 144.8% increase in community outreaches, compared to 46.7% in Arm B and 22.7% in Control Arm C. Arms A and B had higher odds of carrying out community outreaches post-intervention compared to the control (OR = 1.995 and 1.195, respectively), but no significant differences were found between the groups regarding community outreach. Conclusion While the interventions resulted in an increased number of community outreaches compared to the control, case notification improved more in the control arm than in the intervention arms. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the potential of combining cash incentives with training to improve TB control efforts at the community level. Further exploration of the implementation process may shed light on the observed outcomes and guide future intervention strategies.

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1052/v1?src=rss">Retrospective study on pain management pathway for patients with suspected renal/ ureteric colic in a U.K. accidents and emergency department: A quality improvement project [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In acute settings around the globe, renal/ureteric colic remains one of the most common diagnoses for patients presenting with loin-to-groin pain. Even though management spans from medical expulsive therapies to surgical options, pain as a significant component of a patient’s presentation must be dealt with quickly, decisively, and safely, as it can be excruciating and its effects on overall health are dire. This study aimed to explore compliance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for pain management in patients with suspected renal/ureteric colic. It includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous paracetamol, and opioids as first-, second-, and third-line analgesics, respectively, and does not offer antispasmodics. In the event of deviations from the standard, the aim was to put in corrective measures, followed by re-exploration of compliance with patient care. Methods This study involved a single healthcare facility with the study type being retrospective before interventions and prospective after interventions. In the first cycle, we retrieved and analysed 78 patients records whom had been suspected to have renal/ureteric colic between July and September 2022. The inclusion criteria were documented complaints of “flank/loin-to-groin pain” and diagnosis prior to performing diagnostic tests. We surveyed the first-, second-, and third-line painkillers issued, and whether an antispasmodic was given. We collected and entered data into a Microsoft Excel file and correlated it with NICE standards. Having found deviations from the standard, we conducted interventions, allowed time for clinicians to adapt, and re-explored compliance using patient case records [n=58] between February and May 2023. Results In the 1st cycle, 78 patients were suspected of having renal/ureteric colic. M: F = 1.2:1. Non-contrast computerized tomography of the kidney ureters and bladder (NC-CTKUB) confirmed 87% of patients with stones and 3% had no stones. NC-CTKUB was not performed in 9% of patients because they were young, and urinalysis showed no microscopic hematuria. One patient had discharged against medical advise before the NC-CTKUB was performed. Compliance with the NICE pain management guidelines for suspected renal/ureteric colic was full in 23% of cases but unsatisfactory in 78% of cases. In the 2nd cycle, M: F = 1.5:1, NC-CTKUB was not re-audited, as the first cycle study yielded excellent results, and our action plan resulted in an NICE pain management compliance rate of 56%. Although our interventions resulted in improvements of more than twice the initial results, work still needs to be performed. Conclusion Clinicians’ ability to correctly diagnose renal/ureteric colic is remarkable. However, the pain management compliance rate indicates room for improvement. This may be due to the limited awareness of the NICE guideline or the fact that the clinical team has an affinity for certain analgesics compared to others. We propose the need to consider select variables to existing standard guidelines to enhance compliance for improved patient care.

                Background: With the tremendous increase in the usage of smart meters for industrial/ household purposes, their implementation is considered a crucial challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) world, leading to a demand for emerging 5G technology. In addition, a large amount of data has to be communicated by smart meters efficiently, which needs a significant enhancement in bandwidth. The power amplifier (PA) plays a major role in deciding the efficiency and bandwidth of the entire communication system. Among the various modes of PAs, a newly developed Class-J mode PA has been proven to achieve high efficiency over a wide bandwidth by maintaining linearity. Methods: This paper proposes a Class-J mode PA design methodology using a CGH40010F-GaN device that operates at a 3.5 GHz frequency to meet the requirements of 5G wireless communication technology for the replacement of existing 4G/LTE technology used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids. This research's main objective is to design the proper matching networks (M.Ns) to achieve Class-J mode operation that satisfies the bandwidth requirements of 5G smart grid applications. With the target impedances obtained using the load-pull simulation, lumped element matching networks are analyzed and designed in 3 ways using the ADS EDA tool. Results: The simulation results reveal that the proposed Class-J PA provides a maximum drain efficiency (D.E) of 82%, power added efficiency (PAE) of 67% with 13 dB small-signal gain at 3.5 GHz, and output power of 40 dBm (41.4 dBm peak) with a power gain of approximately 7 dB over a bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz with a 28 V power supply into a 50 Ω load. Conclusion: The efficiency and bandwidth of the proposed Class-J PA can be enhanced further by fine-tuning the matching network design to make it more suitable for 5G smart meter/grid applications.

                Background Sudden and unexpected deaths are increasing drastically. The main cause of sudden death is cardiovascular disease, out of which coronary artery disease predominates forming 80% of the cases. Most of the time, detecting early changes in myocardial infarction during the autopsy is challenging since gross infarct changes do not appear until after 24 to 48 hours of myocardial ischemia injury. So, the aim of this study was to compare two test to detect early changes of Myocardial Infarction one by using Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining of the myocardial tissue, during autopsy and other by histopathological examination. Methods The sample size of 60 hearts taken from all the sudden deaths cases brought to Mortuary with suspected cause of death due to cardiac origin. The heart was obtained from the deceased by standard post-mortem technique. Serial full-thickness transverse sections of the heart were taken at 2 cm intervals from the apex to the atrioventricular groove. All the serial slices of heart are taken for histochemical staining and TTC staining. Results In histopathological examination 34 hearts were diagnosed with myocardial infarction and 26 hearts reported non myocardial infarction. With TTC 40 hearts remained unstained suggestive of myocardial infarction and 20 hearts were stained suggestive of non-infarcted hearts. TTC staining in our study shows an accuracy of 88.33%. Conclusion The result of this study shows that the Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride test, a histochemical staining technique of heart, is reliable approach for forensic pathologists to diagnose early myocardial infarction during the post-mortem examination.

The involvement of non-coding RNAs in biological processes and diseases has made the exploration of their functions crucial. Most non-coding RNAs have yet to be studied, creating the need for methods that can rapidly classify large sets of non-coding RNAs into functional groups, or classes. In recent years, the success of deep learning in various domains led to its application to non-coding RNA classification. Multiple novel architectures have been developed, but these advancements are not covered by current literature reviews. We present an exhaustive comparison of the different methods proposed in the state-of-the-art and describe their associated datasets. Moreover, the literature lacks objective benchmarks. We perform experiments to fairly evaluate the performance of various tools for non-coding RNA classification on popular datasets. The robustness of methods to non-functional sequences and sequence boundary noise is explored. We also measure computation time and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. With regard to these results, we assess the relevance of the different architectural choices and provide recommendations to consider in future methods.

Cyanobacteria hold great potential to revolutionize conventional industries and farming practices with their light-driven chemical production. To fully exploit their photosynthetic capacity and enhance product yield, it is crucial to investigate their intricate interplay with the environment including the light intensity and spectrum. Mathematical models provide valuable insights for optimizing strategies in this pursuit. In this study, we present an ordinary differential equation-based model for the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 to assess its performance under various light sources, including monochromatic light. Our model can reproduce a variety of physiologically measured quantities, e.g. experimentally reported partitioning of electrons through four main pathways, O<sub>2</sub> evolution, and the rate of carbon fixation for ambient and saturated CO<sub>2</sub>. By capturing the interactions between different components of a photosynthetic system, our model helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving system behavior. Our model qualitatively reproduces fluorescence emitted under various light regimes, replicating Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry experiments with saturating pulses. Using our model, we test four hypothesized mechanisms of cyanobacterial state transitions for ensemble of parameter sets and found no physiological benefit of a model assuming phycobilisome detachment. Moreover, we evaluate metabolic control for biotechnological production under diverse light colors and irradiances. We suggest gene targets for overexpression under different illuminations to increase the yield. By offering a comprehensive computational model of cyanobacterial photosynthesis, our work enhances the basic understanding of light-dependent cyanobacterial behavior and sets the first wavelength-dependent framework to systematically test their producing capacity for biocatalysis.

                <p>by Justin Lin, Julia Fukuyama</p>

The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reduction—overfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.

                <p>by Daniel Steiert, Corey Wittig, Priyanka Banerjee, Robert Preissner, Robert Szulcek</p>
Background <p>In the modern era, the growth of scientific literature presents a daunting challenge for researchers to keep informed of advancements across multiple disciplines.</p> Objective <p>We apply natural language processing (NLP) and embedding learning concepts to design PubDigest, a tool that combs PubMed literature, aiming to pinpoint potential drugs that could be repurposed.</p> Methods <p>Using NLP, especially term associations through word embeddings, we explored unrecognized relationships between drugs and diseases. To illustrate the utility of PubDigest, we focused on chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare disease with an overall limited number of scientific publications.</p> Results <p>Our literature analysis identified key clinical features linked to CTEPH by applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring, a technique measuring a term’s significance in a text corpus. This allowed us to map related diseases. One standout was venous thrombosis (VT), which showed strong semantic links with CTEPH. Looking deeper, we discovered potential repurposing candidates for CTEPH through large-scale neural network-based contextualization of literature and predictive modeling on both the CTEPH and the VT literature corpora to find novel, yet unrecognized associations between the two diseases. Alongside the anti-thrombotic agent caplacizumab, benzofuran derivatives were an intriguing find. In particular, the benzofuran derivative amiodarone displayed potential anti-thrombotic properties in the literature. Our <i>in vitro</i> tests confirmed amiodarone’s ability to reduce platelet aggregation significantly by 68% (p = 0.02). However, real-world clinical data indicated that CTEPH patients receiving amiodarone treatment faced a significant 15.9% higher mortality risk (p<0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>While NLP offers an innovative approach to interpreting scientific literature, especially for drug repurposing, it is crucial to combine it with complementary methods like <i>in vitro</i> testing and real-world evidence. Our exploration with benzofuran derivatives and CTEPH underscores this point. Thus, blending NLP with hands-on experiments and real-world clinical data can pave the way for faster and safer drug repurposing approaches, especially for rare diseases like CTEPH.</p>

                <p>by Seema B. Plaisier, Danielle O. Alarid, Joelle A. Denning, Sara E. Brownell, Kenneth H. Buetow, Katelyn M. Cooper, Melissa A. Wilson</p>

As genomics technologies advance, there is a growing demand for computational biologists trained for genomics analysis but instructors face significant hurdles in providing formal training in computer programming, statistics, and genomics to biology students. Fully online learners represent a significant and growing community that can contribute to meet this need, but they are frequently excluded from valuable research opportunities which mostly do not offer the flexibility they need. To address these opportunity gaps, we developed an asynchronous course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for computational genomics specifically for fully online biology students. We generated custom learning materials and leveraged remotely accessible computational tools to address 2 novel research questions over 2 iterations of the genomics CURE, one testing bioinformatics approaches and one mining cancer genomics data. Here, we present how the instructional team distributed analysis needed to address these questions between students over a 7.5-week CURE and provided concurrent training in biology and statistics, computer programming, and professional development. Scores from identical learning assessments administered before and after completion of each CURE showed significant learning gains across biology and coding course objectives. Open-response progress reports were submitted weekly and identified self-reported adaptive coping strategies for challenges encountered throughout the course. Progress reports identified problems that could be resolved through collaboration with instructors and peers via messaging platforms and virtual meetings. We implemented asynchronous communication using the Slack messaging platform and an asynchronous journal club where students discussed relevant publications using the Perusall social annotation platform. The online genomics CURE resulted in unanticipated positive outcomes, including students voluntarily discussing plans to continue research after the course. These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of this genomics CURE for scientific training, recruitment and student-mentor relationships, and student successes. Asynchronous genomics CUREs can contribute to a more skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce for the advancement of biomedical science.

                <p>by Peter S. Back, Vignesh Senthilkumar, Charles P. Choi, Justin J. Quan, Qing Lou, Anne K. Snyder, Andrew M. Ly, Justin G. Lau, Z. Hong Zhou, Gary E. Ward, Peter J. Bradley</p>

Apicomplexan parasites possess several specialized structures to invade their host cells and replicate successfully. One of these is the inner membrane complex (IMC), a peripheral membrane-cytoskeletal system underneath the plasma membrane. It is composed of a series of flattened, membrane-bound vesicles and a cytoskeletal subpellicular network (SPN) comprised of intermediate filament-like proteins called alveolins. While the alveolin proteins are conserved throughout the Apicomplexa and the broader Alveolata, their precise functions and interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the function of one of these alveolin proteins in <i>Toxoplasma</i>, IMC6. Disruption of IMC6 resulted in striking morphological defects that led to aberrant invasion and replication but surprisingly minor effects on motility. Deletion analyses revealed that the alveolin domain alone is largely sufficient to restore localization and partially sufficient for function. As this highlights the importance of the IMC6 alveolin domain, we implemented unnatural amino acid photoreactive crosslinking to the alveolin domain and identified multiple binding interfaces between IMC6 and 2 other cytoskeletal IMC proteins—IMC3 and ILP1. This provides direct evidence of protein–protein interactions in the alveolin domain and supports the long-held hypothesis that the alveolin domain is responsible for filament formation. Collectively, our study features the conserved alveolin proteins as critical components that maintain the parasite’s structural integrity and highlights the alveolin domain as a key mediator of SPN architecture.

Transitions between the fed and fasted state are common in mammals. The liver orchestrates adaptive responses to feeding/fasting by transcriptionally regulating metabolic pathways of energy usage and storage. Transcriptional and enhancer dynamics following cessation of fasting (refeeding) have not been explored. We examined the transcriptional and chromatin events occurring upon refeeding in mice, including kinetic behavior and molecular drivers. We found that the refeeding response is temporally organized with the early response focused on ramping up protein translation while the later stages of refeeding drive a bifurcated lipid synthesis program. While both the cholesterol biosynthesis and lipogenesis pathways were inhibited during fasting, most cholesterol biosynthesis genes returned to their basal levels upon refeeding while most lipogenesis genes markedly overshoot above pre-fasting levels. Gene knockout, enhancer dynamics, and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that lipogenic gene overshoot is dictated by LXRα. These findings from unbiased analyses unravel the mechanism behind the long-known phenomenon of refeeding fat overshoot.

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that has a significant impact on quality of life. The immune response and allergy symptoms in AD are triggered by the recognition of specific allergens by IgE antibodies. Cross-reactivity can lead to auto-IgE responses, potentially worsening AD symptoms. Our research aimed to enhance our understanding of allergenic sources, including A. fumigatus, and their role in AD. We focused on molecular mimicry between human AQP3 and A. fumigatus aquaporin. Methods In our in-silico analysis, we compared the amino acid sequences of human aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and A. fumigatus aquaporin with 25 aquaporins from various allergenic sources, sourced from the UniProt and NCBI databases. Phylogenetic relationship analysis and homology-based modeling were conducted. We identified conserved antigenic regions located within the 3D structures. Results The global identity levels among the studied aquaporins averaged 32.6%. One antigenic site exhibited a remarkable local region, with a conserved identity of 71.4%. We categorized the aquaporins into five monophyletic clades (A–E), with group B showing the highest identity (95%), including six mammalian aquaporins, including AQP3. When comparing A. fumigatus aquaporins, the highest identity was observed with Malassezia sympodialis at 35%. Both human and A. fumigatus aquaporins have three linear and three discontinuous epitopes. Conclusions We identified potential linear and conformational epitopes of AQP3, indicating a possible molecular mimicry between humans and A. fumigatus aquaporins. This suggests autoreactivity and potential cross-reactivity, although further validation using in vitro and in vivo experiments is required.

                We present the results of the human genomic small variant calling benchmarking initiative of the German Research Foundation (DFG) funded Next Generation Sequencing Competence Network (NGS-CN) and the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA). In this effort, we developed NCBench, a continuous benchmarking platform for the evaluation of small genomic variant callsets in terms of recall, precision, and false positive/negative error patterns. NCBench is implemented as a continuously re-evaluated open-source repository. We show that it is possible to entirely rely on public free infrastructure (Github, Github Actions, Zenodo) in combination with established open-source tools. NCBench is agnostic of the used dataset and can evaluate an arbitrary number of given callsets, while reporting the results in a visual and interactive way. We used NCBench to evaluate over 40 callsets generated by various variant calling pipelines available in the participating groups that were run on three exome datasets from different enrichment kits and at different coverages. While all pipelines achieve high overall quality, subtle systematic differences between callers and datasets exist and are made apparent by NCBench.These insights are useful to improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows. NCBench is meant to be open for the contribution of any given callset. Most importantly, for authors, it will enable the omission of repeated re-implementation of paper-specific variant calling benchmarks for the publication of new tools or pipelines, while readers will benefit from being able to (continuously) observe the performance of tools and pipelines at the time of reading instead of at the time of writing.

                Project planning and scheduling are essential parts of project management. While project planning and scheduling tools are already available to support traditional project management approaches, flexible project management approaches, such as agile, extreme, and hybrid project planning, are less well supported by software tools, especially freely available software packages. To our knowledge, no existing R package for project planning and scheduling can support flexible projects. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing and describing the R package mfpp for matrix-based flexible project planning/scheduling. This package includes a comprehensive set of tools for project managers to schedule both traditional and flexible project plans. The use of the package is illustrated through examples.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B due to GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (<i>FGF14</i>) gene has recently been recognized as a common cause of late-onset hereditary cerebellar ataxia. Here we present the first report of this disease in the US population, characterizing its clinical manifestations, disease progression, pathological abnormalities, and response to 4-aminopyridine in a cohort of 102 patients bearing GAA repeat expansions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compiled a series of patients with SCA27B, recruited from 5 academic centers across the United States. Clinical manifestations and patient demographics were collected retrospectively from clinical records in an unblinded approach using a standardized form. Post-mortem analysis was done on 4 brains of patients with genetically confirmed SCA27B.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In our cohort of 102 patients with SCA27B, we found that SCA27B was a late-onset (57 ± 12.5 years) slowly progressive ataxia with an episodic component in 51% of patients. Balance and gait impairment were almost always present at disease onset. The principal finding on post-mortem examination of 4 brain specimens was loss of Purkinje neurons that was most severe in the vermis most particularly in the anterior vermis. Similar to European populations, a high percent of patients 21/28 (75%) reported a positive treatment response with 4-aminopyridine.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further estimates prevalence and further expands the clinical, imaging and pathological features of SCA27B, while looking at treatment response, disease progression, and survival in patients with this disease. Testing for SCA27B should be considered in all undiagnosed ataxia patients, especially those with episodic onset. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                STING1 is an immune adaptor protein which promotes innate immune defense mechanisms against pathogens. Its role in modulating inflammation links STING1 to various pathologic conditions, positioning it as a key target for therapeutic interventions aimed at regulating immune responses. To advance our understanding of STING1-associated diseases, it is essential to make high-performing antibodies readily accessible to the scientific community. This study aims to improve reliability of STING1 research as we have characterized sixteen STING1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Migraine is highly prevalent and debilitating. The persistent headaches in this condition are thought to arise from the activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular pathway. Both clinical and animal model studies have suggested that neuroimmune interactions contribute to the pathophysiology of migraine headache. In this review, we first summarize the findings from human studies implicating the dysregulation of the immune system in migraine, including genetic analyses, measurement of circulatory factors, and neuroimaging data. We next discuss recent advances from rodent studies aimed at elucidating the neuroimmune interactions that manifest at various levels of the trigeminovascular pathway and lead to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells as well as immunocompetent glial cells. These cells reciprocally modulate neuronal activity via multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby regulating peripheral and central sensitization. Throughout the discussions, we highlight the potential clinical and translational implications of the findings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95412">Altered firing output of VIP interneurons and early dysfunctions in CA1 hippocampal circuits in the 3xTg mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer’s disease (AD) leads to progressive memory decline, and alterations in hippocampal function are among the earliest pathological features observed in human and animal studies. GABAergic interneurons (INs) within the hippocampus coordinate network activity, among which type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calretinin play a crucial role. These cells provide primarily disinhibition to principal excitatory cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA1 region, regulating incoming inputs and memory formation. However, it remains unclear whether AD pathology induces changes in the activity of I-S3 cells, impacting the hippocampal network motifs. Here, using young adult 3xTg-AD mice, we found that while the density and morphology of I-S3 cells remain unaffected, there were significant changes in their firing output. Specifically, I-S3 cells displayed elongated action potentials and decreased firing rates, which was associated with a reduced inhibition of CA1 INs and their higher recruitment during spatial decision-making and object exploration tasks. Furthermore, the activation of CA1 PCs was also impacted, signifying early disruptions in CA1 network functionality. These findings suggest that altered firing patterns of I-S3 cells might initiate early-stage dysfunction in hippocampal CA1 circuits, potentially influencing the progression of AD pathology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95549">Fine-scale tracking reveals visual field use for predator detection and escape in collective foraging of pigeon flocks</a></h4>

              
                During collective vigilance, it is commonly assumed that individual animals compromise their feeding time to be vigilant against predators, benefiting the entire group. One notable issue with this assumption concerns the unclear nature of predator ‘detection’, particularly in terms of vision. It remains uncertain how a vigilant individual utilizes its high-acuity vision (such as the fovea) to detect a predator cue and subsequently guide individual and collective escape responses. Using fine-scale motion-capture technologies, we tracked the head and body orientations of pigeons (hence reconstructed their visual fields and foveal projections) foraging in a flock during simulated predator attacks. Pigeons used their fovea to inspect predator cues. Earlier foveation on a predator cue was linked to preceding behaviors related to vigilance and feeding, such as head-up or down positions, head-scanning, and food-pecking. Moreover, earlier foveation predicted earlier evasion flights at both the individual and collective levels. However, we also found that relatively long delay between their foveation and escape responses in individuals obscured the relationship between these two responses. While our results largely support the existing assumptions about vigilance, they also underscore the importance of considering vision and addressing the disparity between detection and escape responses in future research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89470">Improved inference of population histories by integrating genomic and epigenomic data</a></h4>

              
                With the availability of high-quality full genome polymorphism (SNPs) data, it becomes feasible to study the past demographic and selective history of populations in exquisite detail. However, such inferences still suffer from a lack of statistical resolution for recent, for example bottlenecks, events, and/or for populations with small nucleotide diversity. Additional heritable (epi)genetic markers, such as indels, transposable elements, microsatellites, or cytosine methylation, may provide further, yet untapped, information on the recent past population history. We extend the Sequential Markovian Coalescent (SMC) framework to jointly use SNPs and other hyper-mutable markers. We are able to (1) improve the accuracy of demographic inference in recent times, (2) uncover past demographic events hidden to SNP-based inference methods, and (3) infer the hyper-mutable marker mutation rates under a finite site model. As a proof of principle, we focus on demographic inference in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using DNA methylation diversity data from 10 European natural accessions. We demonstrate that segregating single methylated polymorphisms (SMPs) satisfy the modeling assumptions of the SMC framework, while differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are not suitable as their length exceeds that of the genomic distance between two recombination events. Combining SNPs and SMPs while accounting for site- and region-level epimutation processes, we provide new estimates of the glacial age bottleneck and post-glacial population expansion of the European <i>A. thaliana</i> population. Our SMC framework readily accounts for a wide range of heritable genomic markers, thus paving the way for next-generation inference of evolutionary history by combining information from several genetic and epigenetic markers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94302">S-acylation of NLRP3 provides a nigericin sensitive gating mechanism that controls access to the Golgi</a></h4>

              
                NLRP3 is an inflammasome seeding pattern recognition receptor activated in response to multiple danger signals which perturb intracellular homeostasis. Electrostatic interactions between the NLRP3 polybasic (PB) region and negatively charged lipids on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) have been proposed to recruit NLRP3 to the TGN. In this study, we demonstrate that membrane association of NLRP3 is critically dependant on S-acylation of a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-130), which traps NLRP3 in a dynamic S-acylation cycle at the Golgi, and a series of hydrophobic residues preceding Cys-130 which act in conjunction with the PB region to facilitate Cys-130 dependent Golgi enrichment. Due to segregation from Golgi localised thioesterase enzymes caused by a nigericin induced breakdown in Golgi organisation and function, NLRP3 becomes immobilised on the Golgi through reduced de-acylation of its Cys-130 lipid anchor, suggesting that disruptions in Golgi homeostasis are conveyed to NLRP3 through its acylation state. Thus, our work defines a nigericin sensitive S-acylation cycle that gates access of NLRP3 to the Golgi.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98181">Upregulated expression of ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 promotes PKM2 nuclear translocation and astrocyte activation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrocytes play critical roles in the occurrence of various neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. However, the role and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in activation of astrocytes have not been clarified. Here, we found that PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear import by DASA-58 significantly reduced the activation of mice primary astrocytes, which was observed by decreased proliferation, glycolysis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. TRIM21 interacted with PKM2, promoted its nuclear translocation and stimulated its nuclear activity to phosphorylate STAT3, NF-κB and interact with c-myc. Further single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was upregulated in astrocytes of EAE. TRIM21 overexpressing in mice primary astrocytes enhanced PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation, which could be reversed by DASA-58. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector to knockdown TRIM21 in astrocytes or intraperitoneal injection of TEPP-46, which inhibit the nuclear translocation of PKM2, effectively decreased disease severity, CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the pathological function of nuclear glycolytic enzyme PKM2 and ubiquitination-mediated regulatory mechanism that are involved in astrocyte activation. Targeting this axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of astrocyte-involved neurological disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96907">Dysfunction of Calcyphosine-Like gene impairs retinal angiogenesis through the MYC axis and is associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy</a></h4>

              
                Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina and associated symptoms that can lead to vision loss. However, the underlying genetic causes of approximately 50% of FEVR cases remain unknown. Here, we report two heterozygous variants in calcyphosine-like gene (<i>CAPSL</i>) that is associated with FEVR. Both variants exhibited compromised CAPSL protein expression. Vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific inactivation of <i>Capsl</i> resulted in delayed radial/vertical vascular progression, compromised endothelial proliferation/migration, recapitulating the human FEVR phenotypes. <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) exhibited impaired tube formation, decreased cell proliferation, disrupted cell polarity establishment, and filopodia/lamellipodia formation, as well as disrupted collective cell migration. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that <i>CAPSL</i> abolition inhibited the MYC signaling axis, in which the expression of core MYC targeted genes were profoundly decreased. Furthermore, a combined analysis of <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted HRECs and <i>c-MYC</i>-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells uncovered similar transcription patterns. Collectively, this study reports a novel FEVR-associated candidate gene, <i>CAPSL</i>, which provides valuable information for genetic counseling of FEVR. This study also reveals that compromised CAPSL function may cause FEVR through MYC axis, shedding light on the potential involvement of MYC signaling in the pathogenesis of FEVR.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology, resulting in various impairments that necessitate continuous rehabilitation to enhance functionality, quality of life, and motor function, including through Virtual Reality (VR) therapy. Comparing tasks in virtual environments and their potential skill transfer to real-world settings could aid in optimizing treatment programs to improve motor performance in individuals with MS. This study aimed to determine whether practicing acquisition and retention phases using two distinct interfaces (concrete&amp;amp;mdash;Touch Screen or abstract&amp;amp;mdash;Kinect system) affects performance in a subsequent task using a different interface (transfer phase). A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 56 volunteers with MS and 41 controls. Participants engaged in a computer game where they burst as many bubbles as possible within 10 s per attempt. After the acquisition and retention phases, all participants switched interfaces (e.g., those using Kinect switched to Touchscreen and vice versa). Significant performance improvements were observed in both groups during the acquisition phase, which were maintained in the retention phase. Although the abstract interface was more challenging for both groups, only the MS group that practiced with the abstract interface successfully transferred their improvements to the concrete interface. Thus, despite the increased difficulty of the abstract task during practice, it led to better performance transfer when required to complete a subsequent concrete task, suggesting that abstract devices may be beneficial in clinical practice for improving motor function in people with MS.</p>

                <p>The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Preparatory activity in the frontal cortex predicts upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks have made it challenging to determine whether the spatial information is in a self-centered direction reference frame or a world-centered position reference frame. Here, we trained male rats to make delayed visually guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle direction versus position tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in the secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. Population analyses revealed that the FOF encodes two separate 2D maps of space. First, a 2D map of the planned and ongoing movement in a self-centered direction reference frame. Second, a 2D map of the animal&rsquo;s current position on the port wall in a world-centered reference frame. Thus, preparatory activity in the FOF represents self-centered upcoming movement directions, but FOF neurons multiplex both self- and world-reference frame variables at the level of single neurons. Neural network model comparison supports the view that despite the presence of world-centered representations, the FOF receives the target information as self-centered input and generates self-centered planning signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/37/e0189242024?rss=1">Medial Prefrontal Cortex Stimulation Reduces Retrieval-Induced Forgetting via Fronto-parietal Beta Desynchronization</a></h4>

              
                <p>The act of recalling memories can paradoxically lead to the forgetting of other associated memories, a phenomenon known as retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). Inhibitory control mechanisms, primarily mediated by the prefrontal cortex, are thought to contribute to RIF. In this study, we examined whether stimulating the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with transcranial direct current stimulation modulates RIF and investigated the associated electrophysiological correlates. In a randomized study, 50 participants (27 males and 23 females) received either real or sham stimulation before performing retrieval practice on target memories. After retrieval practice, a final memory test to assess RIF was administered. We found that stimulation selectively increased the retrieval accuracy of competing memories, thereby decreasing RIF, while the retrieval accuracy of target memories remained unchanged. The reduction in RIF was associated with a more pronounced beta desynchronization within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC), in an early time window (&lt;500&nbsp;ms) after cue onset during retrieval practice. This led to a stronger beta desynchronization within the parietal cortex in a later time window, an established marker for successful memory retrieval. Together, our results establish the causal involvement of the mPFC in actively suppressing competing memories and demonstrate that while forgetting arises as a consequence of retrieving specific memories, these two processes are functionally independent. Our findings suggest that stimulation potentially disrupted inhibitory control processes, as evidenced by reduced RIF and stronger beta desynchronization in fronto-parietal brain regions during memory retrieval, although further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this effect.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum plays an important role in diverse brain functions, ranging from motor learning to cognition. Recent studies have suggested that molecular and cellular heterogeneity within cerebellar lobules contributes to functional differences across the cerebellum. However, the specific relationship between molecular and cellular heterogeneity and diverse functional outputs of different regions of the cerebellum remains unclear. Here, we describe a previously unappreciated form of synaptic heterogeneity at parallel fiber synapses to Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum (both sexes). In contrast to uniform fast synaptic transmission, we found that the properties of slow synaptic transmission varied by up to threefold across different lobules of the mouse cerebellum, resulting in surprising heterogeneity. Depending on the location of a Purkinje cell, the time of peak of slow synaptic currents varied by hundreds of milliseconds. The duration and decay time of these currents also spanned hundreds of milliseconds, based on lobule. We found that, as a consequence of the heterogeneous synaptic dynamics, the same brief input stimulus was transformed into prolonged firing patterns over a range of timescales that depended on Purkinje cell location.</p>

                <p>To test a Chinese character version of the phonemic verbal fluency task in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and assess the verbal fluency deficiency pattern in TLE with and without hippocampal sclerosis, a cross-sectional study was conducted including 30 patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), 28 patients with TLE and without hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-NHS), and 29 demographically matched healthy controls (HC). Both sexes were enrolled. Participants finished a Chinese character verbal fluency (VFC) task during functional MRI. The activation/deactivation maps, functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of the left frontal and temporal regions were compared. A neural network classification model was applied to differentiate TLE-HS and TLE-NHS using functional statistics. The VFC scores were correlated with semantic fluency in HC while correlated with phonemic fluency in TLE-NHS. Activation and deactivation deficiency was observed in TLE-HS and TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.001, <I>k</I> &ge; 10). Functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of anterior inferior temporal gyri were impaired in TLE-HS and retained or even enhanced in TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The functional connectivity was correlated with phonemic fluency (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The neural network classification reached an area under the curve of 0.90 in diagnosing hippocampal sclerosis. The VFC task is a Chinese phonemic verbal fluency task suitable for clinical application in TLE. During the VFC task, functional connectivity of phonemic circuits was impaired in TLE-HS and was enhanced in TLE-NHS, representing a compensative phonemic searching strategy applied by patients with TLE-NHS.</p>

                <p>Our repertoire of motor skills is filled with sequential movements that need to be performed in a specific order. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether the human hippocampus, a region known to support temporal order in non-motor memory, represents information about the order of sequential motor actions in human participants (both sexes). We also examined such representations in other regions of the motor network (i.e., the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior superior parietal lobule, and striatum) already known for their critical role in motor sequence learning. Results showed that the hippocampus represents information about movements in their learned temporal position in the sequence, but not about movements or temporal positions in random movement patterns. Other regions of the motor network coded for movements in their learned temporal position, as well as movements and positions in random movement patterns. Importantly, movement coding contributed to sequence learning patterns in primary, supplementary, and premotor cortices but not in striatal and parietal regions. Our findings deepen our understanding of how striatal and cortical regions contribute to motor sequence learning and point to the capacity of the hippocampus to represent movements in their temporal context, an ability possibly explaining its contribution to motor learning.</p>

                <p>Neuronal excitatory synapses are primarily located on small dendritic protrusions called spines. During synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through postsynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) initiates signaling pathways that coordinate changes in dendritic spine structure and synaptic function. During long-term potentiation (LTP), high levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote increases in both synaptic strength and dendritic spine size through activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases. In contrast, during long-term depression (LTD), low levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote decreased synaptic strength and spine shrinkage and elimination through activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), which is anchored at synapses via the scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)150. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathological agent amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) may impair learning and memory through biasing NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways toward LTD and spine elimination. By employing AKAP150 knock-in mice of both sexes with a mutation that disrupts CaN anchoring to AKAP150, we revealed that local, postsynaptic AKAP&ndash;CaN&ndash;LTD signaling was required for A&beta;-mediated impairment of NMDAR synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, inhibition of LTP, and dendritic spine loss. Additionally, we found that A&beta; acutely engages AKAP&ndash;CaN signaling through activation of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) leading to dephosphorylation of NMDAR GluN2B subunits, which decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to favor LTD over LTP, and cofilin, which promotes F-actin severing to destabilize dendritic spines. These findings reveal a novel interplay between NMDAR and mGluR1 signaling that converges on AKAP-anchored CaN to coordinate dephosphorylation of postsynaptic substrates linked to multiple aspects of A&beta;-mediated synaptic dysfunction.</p>

                <p>Although the locus ceruleus (LC) is recognized as a crucial modulator for attention and perception by releasing norepinephrine into various cortical regions, the impact of LC&ndash;noradrenergic (LC&ndash;NE) modulation on auditory discrimination behavior remains elusive. In this study, we firstly recorded local field potential and single-unit activity in multiple cortical regions associated with auditory&ndash;motor processing, including the auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, secondary motor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in response to optogenetic activation (40&nbsp;Hz and 0.5&nbsp;s) of the LC&ndash;NE neurons in awake mice (male). We found that phasic LC stimulation induced a persistent high gamma oscillation (50&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in the OFC. Phasic activation of LC&ndash;NE neurons also resulted in a corresponding increase in norepinephrine levels in the OFC, accompanied by a pupillary dilation response. Furthermore, when mice were performing a go/no-go auditory discrimination task, we optogeneticaly activated the neural projections from LC to OFC and revealed a shortened latency in behavioral responses to sound stimuli and an increased false alarm rate. These impulsive behavioral responses may be associated with the gamma neural activity in the OFC. These findings have broadened our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in the role of LC in auditory&ndash;motor processing.</p>

                <p>For better decisions in social interactions, humans often must understand the thinking of others and predict their actions. Since such predictions are uncertain, multiple predictions may be necessary for better decision-making. However, the neural processes and computations underlying such social decision-making remain unclear. We investigated this issue by developing a behavioral paradigm and performing functional magnetic resonance imaging and computational modeling. In our task, female and male participants were required to predict others&rsquo; choices in order to make their own value-based decisions, as the outcome depended on others&rsquo; choices. Results showed, to make choices, the participants mostly relied on a value difference (primary) generated from the case where others would make a likely choice, but sometimes they additionally used another value difference (secondary) from the opposite case where others make an unlikely choice. We found that the activations in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) correlated with the primary difference while the activations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC) correlated with the secondary difference. Analysis of neural coupling and temporal dynamics suggested a three-step processing network, beginning with the left amygdala signals for predictions of others&rsquo; choices. Modulated by these signals, the PCC and rdlPFC reflect the respective value differences for self-decisions. Finally, the medial prefrontal cortex integrated these decision signals for a final decision. Our findings elucidate the neural process of constructing value-based decisions by predicting others and illuminate their key variables with social modulations, providing insight into the differential functional roles of these brain regions in this process.</p>

                <p>Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare sensory and autonomic neuropathy that results from a mutation in the <I>ELP1</I> gene. Virtually all patients report gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and we have recently shown that FD patients have a dysbiotic gut microbiome and altered metabolome. These findings were recapitulated in an FD mouse model and moreover, the FD mice had reduced intestinal motility, as did patients. To understand the cellular basis for impaired GI function in FD, the enteric nervous system (ENS; both female and male mice) from FD mouse models was analyzed during embryonic development and adulthood. We show here that not only is <I>Elp1</I> required for the normal formation of the ENS, but it is also required in adulthood for the regulation of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and for target innervation in both the mucosa and in intestinal smooth muscle. In particular, CGRP innervation was significantly reduced as was the number of dopaminergic neurons. Examination of an FD patient's gastric biopsy also revealed reduced and disoriented axons in the mucosa. Finally, using an FD mouse model in which <I>Elp1</I> was deleted exclusively from neurons, we found significant changes to the colon epithelium including reduced E-cadherin expression, perturbed mucus layer organization, and infiltration of bacteria into the mucosa. The fact that deletion of <I>Elp1</I> exclusively in neurons is sufficient to alter the intestinal epithelium and perturb the intestinal epithelial barrier highlights a critical role for neurons in regulating GI epithelium homeostasis.</p>

                <p>During infancy and adolescence, language develops from a predominantly interhemispheric control&mdash;through the corpus callosum (CC)&mdash;to a predominantly intrahemispheric control, mainly subserved by the left arcuate fasciculus (AF). Using multimodal neuroimaging, we demonstrate that human left-handers (both male and female) with an atypical language lateralization show a rightward participation of language areas from the auditory cortex to the inferior frontal cortex when contrasting speech to tone perception and an enhanced interhemispheric anatomical and functional connectivity. Crucially, musicianship determines two different structural pathways to this outcome. Nonmusicians present a relation between atypical lateralization and intrahemispheric underdevelopment across the anterior AF, hinting at a dysregulation of the ontogenetic shift from an interhemispheric to an intrahemispheric brain. Musicians reveal an alternative pathway related to interhemispheric overdevelopment across the posterior CC and the auditory cortex. We discuss the heterogeneity in reaching atypical language lateralization and the relevance of early musical training in altering the normal development of language cognitive functions.</p>

                Chemoprophylactic prevention of veterinary heartworm disease in companion animals, caused by the vector-borne nematode parasite Dirofilaria immitis, is a multi-billion-dollar global market. Experimental use of cats and dogs in preclinical heartworm drug testing is increasing due to evolving drug-resistance to frontline macrocyclic lactones and renewed investment in alternative preventative drug research. We and others recently published data demonstrating proof-of-concept of utilising lymphopenic severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) or Recombination Activating Gene (RAG)2 deficient mice with additional knockout of the IL-2/7 receptor gamma chain (γc) as alternative preventative drug screening research models of dirofilariasis. Here we summarise the current knowledge of candidate immunodeficient mouse models tested, including a comparison of susceptibility using different background strains of mice, different D. immitis isolates, following use of anti-inflammatory treatments to further suppress residual innate immunity, and efficacies achieved against different reference anthelmintics. We supplement this precis with new data on treatment response to the veterinary anthelmintic, oxfendazole, and initial evaluation of D. immitis susceptibility in CB.17 SCID and C57BL/6 RAG2-/-γc-/- mice. We conclude that in addition to NSG and NXG mice, RAG2-/-γc-/- mice on either a BALB/c or C57BL/6 background offer an alternative screening model option, widening access to academic and commercial laboratories wishing to pursue initial rapid in vivo drug screening whilst avoiding potentially unnecessary cat or dog testing.

                <p>by Mario Grassi, Barbara Tarantino</p>

Large-scale studies of gene expression are commonly influenced by biological and technical sources of expression variation, including batch effects, sample characteristics, and environmental impacts. Learning the causal relationships between observable variables may be challenging in the presence of unobserved confounders. Furthermore, many high-dimensional regression techniques may perform worse. In fact, controlling for unobserved confounding variables is essential, and many deconfounding methods have been suggested for application in a variety of situations. The main contribution of this article is the development of a two-stage deconfounding procedure based on Bow-free Acyclic Paths (BAP) search developed into the framework of Structural Equation Models (SEM), called SEMbap(). In the first stage, an exhaustive search of missing edges with significant covariance is performed via Shipley d-separation tests; then, in the second stage, a Constrained Gaussian Graphical Model (CGGM) is fitted or a low dimensional representation of bow-free edges structure is obtained via Graph Laplacian Principal Component Analysis (gLPCA). We compare four popular deconfounding methods to BAP search approach with applications on simulated and observed expression data. In the former, different structures of the hidden covariance matrix have been replicated. Compared to existing methods, BAP search algorithm is able to correctly identify hidden confounding whilst controlling false positive rate and achieving good fitting and perturbation metrics.

                <p>by Katharina Duecker, Marco Idiart, Marcel van Gerven, Ole Jensen</p>

The field of computer vision has long drawn inspiration from neuroscientific studies of the human and non-human primate visual system. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for example, was informed by the properties of simple and complex cells in early visual cortex. However, the computational relevance of oscillatory dynamics experimentally observed in the visual system are typically not considered in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Computational models of neocortical dynamics, on the other hand, rarely take inspiration from computer vision. Here, we combine methods from computational neuroscience and machine learning to implement multiplexing in a simple ANN using oscillatory dynamics. We first trained the network to classify individually presented letters. Post-training, we added temporal dynamics to the hidden layer, introducing refraction in the hidden units as well as pulsed inhibition mimicking neuronal alpha oscillations. Without these dynamics, the trained network correctly classified individual letters but produced a mixed output when presented with two letters simultaneously, indicating a bottleneck problem. When introducing refraction and oscillatory inhibition, the output nodes corresponding to the two stimuli activate sequentially, ordered along the phase of the inhibitory oscillations. Our model implements the idea that inhibitory oscillations segregate competing inputs in time. The results of our simulations pave the way for applications in deeper network architectures and more complicated machine learning problems.

                <p>by Janice Yang, Neil J. Daily, Taylor K. Pullinger, Tetsuro Wakatsuki, Eric A. Sobie</p>

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help to predict cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters. We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created <i>in silico</i> datasets by simulating various protocols applied to a population of models with known conductance variations, and then fitted parameters to those datasets. We found that calibrating to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation also held when the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses.

                <p>by Wen Wen, Shrey Grover, Douglas Hazel, Peyton Berning, Frederik Baumgardt, Vighnesh Viswanathan, Olivia Tween, Robert M. G. Reinhart</p>

Maintaining and removing information in mind are 2 fundamental cognitive processes that decline sharply with age. Using a combination of beta-band neural oscillations, which have been implicated in the regulation of working memory contents, and cross-trial neural variability, an undervalued property of brain dynamics theorized to govern adaptive cognitive processes, we demonstrate an age-related dissociation between distinct working memory functions—information maintenance and post-response deletion. Load-dependent decreases in beta variability during maintenance predicted memory performance of younger, but not older adults. Surprisingly, the post-response phase emerged as the predictive locus of working memory performance for older adults, with post-response beta variability correlated with memory performance of older, but not younger adults. Single-trial analysis identified post-response beta power elevation as a frequency-specific signature indexing memory deletion. Our findings demonstrate the nuanced interplay between age, beta dynamics, and working memory, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of cognitive decline in agreement with the inhibition deficit theory of aging.

                Background Entomopathogenic fungi exists naturally in plants as an asymptote and have the potential to reduce the population of insect pests through indirect interactions. This study was conducted to detect and characterize the endophytic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii from the rhizosphere soil of tomato plants and their virulence effect on Galleria melonella. Methods From the rhizosphere soil of 40 tomato fields, three Beauveria bassiana and seven Metarhizium robertsii isolates were isolated using the galleria bait method. All fungi isolate were morphologically characterized by their colony color, shape, and surface texture. Isolates with the highest percentages of germination, conidial yield, and radial growth were selected, and their virulence was evaluated on second instar larvae of Galleria melonella under laboratory conditions. Results In this study, Beauveria bassiana showed white colony color and aseptate hyphae, whereas Metarhizium robertsii showed dark green to light green colony color and septate hyphal structures. Maximum spore production and conidial length were obtained by Beauveria bassiana isolate APPRC-27 with 2.67x107 spores ml-1 and 3.24 µm, respectively. Colony radial growth rates ranged from 1.73 to 3.24 mm day-1. The results revealed that the highest mortality rate of Galleria melonella (100%) was obtained by Metarhizium robertsii isolates K-61 and K-102 at a concentration of 1x108 conidial ml-1 at 7 days post-inoculation. The lowest mortality rate was registered by Metarhizium robertsii isolate RST-11. Conclusions In the present study, isolates that produced the most spores and had the highest germination rates were the most virulent to Galleria mellonella second instar larvae. Therefore, virulent entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii, are promising bioagents for the control of insect pests.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1468/v2?src=rss">Relationship Between Xylene, Rq Xylene Concentration and Enzyme Activity as Indicators of Heart and Liver Function Among Shoe Industry Workers In Surabaya [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Xylene, a common solvent in painting, printing, and shoemaking, enters the body through inhalation of vapors. Methods This observational analytic study aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.
