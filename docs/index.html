              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rat sensitivity to multipoint statistics is predicted by efficient coding of natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                Efficient processing of sensory data requires adapting the neuronal encoding strategy to the statistics of natural stimuli. Previously, in Hermundstad et al., 2014, we showed that local multipoint correlation patterns that are most variable in natural images are also the most perceptually salient for human observers, in a way that is compatible with the efficient coding principle. Understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying such adaptation to image statistics will require performing invasive experiments that are impossible in humans. Therefore, it is important to understand whether a similar phenomenon can be detected in animal species that allow for powerful experimental manipulations, such as rodents. Here we selected four image statistics (from single- to four-point correlations) and trained four groups of rats to discriminate between white noise patterns and binary textures containing variable intensity levels of one of such statistics. We interpreted the resulting psychometric data with an ideal observer model, finding a sharp decrease in sensitivity from two- to four-point correlations and a further decrease from four- to three-point. This ranking fully reproduces the trend we previously observed in humans, thus extending a direct demonstration of efficient coding to a species where neuronal and developmental processes can be interrogated and causally manipulated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogen invasion-dependent tissue reservoirs and plasmid-encoded antibiotic degradation boost plasmid spread in the gut</a></h4>

              
                Many plasmids encode antibiotic resistance genes. Through conjugation, plasmids can be rapidly disseminated. Previous work identified gut luminal donor/recipient blooms and tissue-lodged plasmid-bearing persister cells of the enteric pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) that survive antibiotic therapy in host tissues, as factors promoting plasmid dissemination among Enterobacteriaceae. However, the buildup of tissue reservoirs and their contribution to plasmid spread await experimental demonstration. Here, we asked if re-seeding-plasmid acquisition-invasion cycles by <i>S</i>.Tm could serve to diversify tissue-lodged plasmid reservoirs, and thereby promote plasmid spread. Starting with intraperitoneal mouse infections, we demonstrate that <i>S</i>.Tm cells re-seeding the gut lumen initiate clonal expansion. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) plasmid-encoded gut luminal antibiotic degradation by donors can foster recipient survival under beta-lactam antibiotic treatment, enhancing transconjugant formation upon re-seeding. <i>S</i>.Tm transconjugants can subsequently re-enter host tissues introducing the new plasmid into the tissue-lodged reservoir. Population dynamics analyses pinpoint recipient migration into the gut lumen as rate-limiting for plasmid transfer dynamics in our model. Priority effects may be a limiting factor for reservoir formation in host tissues. Overall, our proof-of-principle data indicates that luminal antibiotic degradation and shuttling between the gut lumen and tissue-resident reservoirs can promote the accumulation and spread of plasmids within a host over time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanisms underlying microglial colonization of developing neural retina in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that function as the first line of defense in brain. Embryonic microglial precursors originate in peripheral mesoderm and migrate into the brain during development. However, the mechanism by which they colonize the brain is incompletely understood. The retina is one of the first brain regions to accommodate microglia. In zebrafish, embryonic microglial precursors use intraocular hyaloid blood vessels as a pathway to migrate into the optic cup via the choroid fissure. Once retinal progenitor cells exit the cell cycle, microglial precursors associated with hyaloid blood vessels start to infiltrate the retina preferentially through neurogenic regions, suggesting that colonization of retinal tissue depends upon the neurogenic state. Along with blood vessels and retinal neurogenesis, IL34 also participates in microglial precursor colonization of the retina. Altogether, CSF receptor signaling, blood vessels, and neuronal differentiation function as cues to create an essential path for microglial migration into developing retina.

	<p>The interaction between the endocrine system and inflammation is crucial pathogenesis of depression. Our study aimed at exploring the possible relationship between sex hormones and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a common indicator of inflammation in male patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: GDF-15 levels of 121 male MDD patients were compared with 105 healthy subjects with the help of a Cobas 8000 automatic chemiluminescence immunoanalyzer. Results: (1) MDD patients showed higher GDF-15 levels, a lower testosterone (T) level and testosterone/estradiol ratio (T/E2 ratio) than healthy subjects (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). (2) Serum T levels and the T/E2 ratio were inversely associated with GDF-15 serum levels (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). (3) HAMD-24 scores were positively correlated with the levels of GDF-15 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), but not with T levels, estradiol (E2) levels, and the T/E2 ratio (all p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The high level of GDF-15 was correlated with a low T/E2 ratio and T deficiency in male MDD patients. The above results demonstrate that up-regulation of serum GDF-15 and down-regulation of T and T/E2 ratio may be correlated with the occurrence and severity of depression. So, changing the level of GDF-15 by regulating the proportion of sex hormones may play a key role in the prognosis and treatment of depression.</p>

                Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still a global health problem. COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia have a higher risk for critical illness, mostly complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The inflammatory response is critical, and the cytokine storm increases severity of COVID-19. Many factors could be associated with a cytokine storm but these are incompletely understood. The aim of this study is to present characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and explore the clinical and inflammatory parameters of severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted in all severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Peripheral blood was taken for laboratory examination within 24 hours of admission. Hematologic parameters, serum electrolyte, renal function, liver function, pancreas enzyme, D-dimer, inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in this study. Comparison analyses were done between sex, comorbidity existed, body mass index (BMI), and vaccination status. Results: A total of 80 subjects were included in the study. The most frequent comorbidities found among the subjects were obesity (36.35%) and diabetes (22.5%). Only 13.75% of subjects were vaccinated. Laboratory results indicated leukocytosis and neutrophilia, with neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) of 7. The mean inflammatory findings (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1), D-dimer, CRP, and lipase increased. Lipase levels were higher in men (p=0.003) and in comorbidity groups. No significant differences found with different BMI groups. Lipase, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels were significantly higher (p=0.019, <0.0001, and 0.03, respectively) in the non-vaccinated group. Conclusions: Most patients with severe COVID-19 have comorbidities and increased inflammatory markers.

                Background: Land use/land cover (LULC), change is one of the major contributors to global environmental and climate variations. The ability to predict future LULC is crucial for environmental engineers, civil engineers, urban designers, and natural resource managers for planning activities. Methods: TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modelling System in conjunction with ArcGIS Pro 2.8 were used to process LULC data for the region of the Lepelle River Basin (LRB) of South Africa. Driver variables such as population density, slope, elevation as well as the Euclidean distances of cities, roads, highways, railroads, parks and restricted areas, towns to the LRB in combination with LULC data were analysed using the Land Change Modeller (LCM) and Cellular-Automata Markov (CAM) model. Results: The results reveal an array of losses (-) and gains (+) for certain LULC classes in the LRB by the year 2040: natural vegetation (+8.5%), plantations (+3.5%), water bodies (-31.6%), bare ground (-8.8%), cultivated land (-29.3%), built-up areas (+10.6%) and mines (+14.4%). Conclusions: The results point to the conversion of land uses from natural to anthropogenic by 2040. These changes also highlight how the potential losses associated with resources such as water will negatively impact society and ecosystem functioning in the LRB by exacerbating water scarcity driven by climate change. This modelling study seeks to provides a decision support system for predicting future land resource utilization in the LRB and perhaps assist for planning purposes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Population variation in Y-chromosome microdeletion and its role in the evaluation of male infertility management: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Infertility has been a significantly growing problem worldwide, affecting approximately 10-15% of couples within reproductive age. Among the many causes of male infertility, Y-chromosome microdeletion is considered one of the most frequent genetic causes. Thus, this systematic review was constructed to determine the prevalence of Y-chromosome microdeletion and the population variations in the different types of Y-chromosome microdeletions. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Scielo, and Science Direct databases to obtain articles that addressed the frequency of Y-chromosome microdeletion and male infertility. We identified 14 articles that originated from China, India, Iran, Brazil, Indonesia, North America, South Korea, and Slovakia, and the vital information collected included the year of publication, authors, number of patients with different types of Y-chromosome microdeletions, and the proportion of microdeletion in the major affected sub-regions of the Y-chromosome. Results: In this review, we attempted to highlight the variation in the frequency of Y-chromosome microdeletion in different geographical populations. The highest and lowest frequencies of Y-chromosome microdeletion were found in Indonesian (23.94%) and Slovakian (3.5%) populations, respectively. Conclusion: In conclusion, Y-chromosome microdeletion was undeniably found to be one of the leading genetic causes of male infertility. Azoospermic factor c (AZFc) microdeletion was the most frequent type of Y-chromosome microdeletion, typically presenting in patients with various clinical manifestations that ranged from oligozoospermia to azoospermia and exhibiting the highest chance for sperm retrieval. This review will undoubtedly help clinicians in providing a more accurate consultation to their patients and determining the success rates of assisted reproductive technology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Paradoxical relationship between speed and accuracy in olfactory figure-background segregation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lior Lebovich, Michael Yunerman, Viviana Scaiewicz, Yonatan Loewenstein, Dan Rokni</p>

In natural settings, many stimuli impinge on our sensory organs simultaneously. Parsing these sensory stimuli into perceptual objects is a fundamental task faced by all sensory systems. Similar to other sensory modalities, increased odor backgrounds decrease the detectability of target odors by the olfactory system. The mechanisms by which background odors interfere with the detection and identification of target odors are unknown. Here we utilized the framework of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to consider possible interference mechanisms in an odor detection task. We first considered pure effects of background odors on either signal or noise in the decision-making dynamics and showed that these produce different predictions about decision accuracy and speed. To test these predictions, we trained mice to detect target odors that are embedded in random background mixtures in a two-alternative choice task. In this task, the inter-trial interval was independent of behavioral reaction times to avoid motivating rapid responses. We found that increased backgrounds reduce mouse performance but paradoxically also decrease reaction times, suggesting that noise in the decision making process is increased by backgrounds. We further assessed the contributions of background effects on both noise and signal by fitting the DDM to the behavioral data. The models showed that background odors affect both the signal and the noise, but that the paradoxical relationship between trial difficulty and reaction time is caused by the added noise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Extracting multi-way chromatin contacts from Hi-C data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Liu, Bokai Zhang, Changbong Hyeon</p>

There is a growing realization that multi-way chromatin contacts formed in chromosome structures are fundamental units of gene regulation. However, due to the paucity and complexity of such contacts, it is challenging to detect and identify them using experiments. Based on an assumption that chromosome structures can be mapped onto a network of Gaussian polymer, here we derive analytic expressions for <i>n</i>-body contact probabilities (<i>n</i> > 2) among chromatin loci based on pairwise genomic contact frequencies available in Hi-C, and show that multi-way contact probability maps can in principle be extracted from Hi-C. The three-body (triplet) contact probabilities, calculated from our theory, are in good correlation with those from measurements including Tri-C, MC-4C and SPRITE. Maps of multi-way chromatin contacts calculated from our analytic expressions can not only complement experimental measurements, but also can offer better understanding of the related issues, such as cell-line dependent assemblies of multiple genes and enhancers to chromatin hubs, competition between long-range and short-range multi-way contacts, and condensates of multiple CTCF anchors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In silico identification of potential calcium dynamics and sarcomere targets for recovering left ventricular function in rat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefano Longobardi, Anna Sher, Steven A. Niederer</p>

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex disease associated with multiple co-morbidities, where impaired cardiac mechanics are often the end effect. At the cellular level, cardiac mechanics can be pharmacologically manipulated by altering calcium signalling and the sarcomere. However, the link between cellular level modulations and whole organ pump function is incompletely understood. Our goal is to develop and use a multi-scale computational cardiac mechanics model of the obese ZSF1 HFpEF rat to identify important biomechanical mechanisms that underpin impaired cardiac function and to predict how whole-heart mechanical function can be recovered through altering cellular calcium dynamics and/or cellular contraction. The rat heart was modelled using a 3D biventricular biomechanics model. Biomechanics were described by 16 parameters, corresponding to intracellular calcium transient, sarcomere dynamics, cardiac tissue and hemodynamics properties. The model simulated left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loops that were described by 14 scalar features. We trained a Gaussian process emulator to map the 16 input parameters to each of the 14 outputs. A global sensitivity analysis was performed, and identified calcium dynamics and thin and thick filament kinetics as key determinants of the organ scale pump function. We employed Bayesian history matching to build a model of the ZSF1 rat heart. Next, we recovered the LV function, described by ejection fraction, peak pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise and isovolumetric relaxation time constant. We found that by manipulating calcium, thin and thick filament properties we can recover 34%, 28% and 24% of the LV function in the ZSF1 rat heart, respectively, and 39% if we manipulate all of them together. We demonstrated how a combination of biophysically based models and their derived emulators can be used to identify potential pharmacological targets. We predicted that cardiac function can be best recovered in ZSF1 rats by desensitising the myofilament and reducing the affinity to intracellular calcium concentration and overall prolonging the sarcomere staying in the active force generating state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Engaging biological oscillators through second messenger pathways permits emergence of a robust gastric slow-wave during peristalsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Md Ashfaq Ahmed, Sharmila Venugopal, Ranu Jung</p>

Peristalsis, the coordinated contraction—relaxation of the muscles of the stomach is important for normal gastric motility and is impaired in motility disorders. Coordinated electrical depolarizations that originate and propagate within a network of interconnected layers of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and smooth muscle (SM) cells of the stomach wall as a slow-wave, underly peristalsis. Normally, the gastric slow-wave oscillates with a single period and uniform rostrocaudal lag, exhibiting network entrainment. Understanding of the integrative role of neurotransmission and intercellular coupling in the propagation of an entrained gastric slow-wave, important for understanding motility disorders, however, remains incomplete. Using a computational framework constituted of a novel gastric motility network (GMN) model we address the hypothesis that engaging biological oscillators (i.e., ICCs) by constitutive gap junction coupling mechanisms and enteric neural innervation activated signals can confer a robust entrained gastric slow-wave. We demonstrate that while a decreasing enteric neural innervation gradient that modulates the intracellular IP<sub>3</sub> concentration in the ICCs can guide the aboral slow-wave propagation essential for peristalsis, engaging ICCs by recruiting the exchange of second messengers (inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ensures a robust entrained longitudinal slow-wave, even in the presence of biological variability in electrical coupling strengths. Our GMN with the distinct intercellular coupling in conjunction with the intracellular feedback pathways and a rostrocaudal enteric neural innervation gradient allows gastric slow waves to oscillate with a moderate range of frequencies and to propagate with a broad range of velocities, thus preventing decoupling observed in motility disorders. Overall, the findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of decoupled slow waves associated with motility impairments of the stomach, offer directions for future experiments and theoretical work, and can potentially aid in the design of new interventional pharmacological and neuromodulation device treatments for addressing gastric motility disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergence and fragmentation of the alpha-band driven by neuronal network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lou Zonca, David Holcman</p>

Rhythmic neuronal network activity underlies brain oscillations. To investigate how connected neuronal networks contribute to the emergence of the <i>α</i>-band and to the regulation of Up and Down states, we study a model based on synaptic short-term depression-facilitation with afterhyperpolarization (AHP). We found that the <i>α</i>-band is generated by the network behavior near the attractor of the Up-state. Coupling inhibitory and excitatory networks by reciprocal connections leads to the emergence of a stable <i>α</i>-band during the Up states, as reflected in the spectrogram. To better characterize the emergence and stability of thalamocortical oscillations containing <i>α</i> and <i>δ</i> rhythms during anesthesia, we model the interaction of two excitatory networks with one inhibitory network, showing that this minimal topology underlies the generation of a persistent <i>α</i>-band in the neuronal voltage characterized by dominant Up over Down states. Finally, we show that the emergence of the <i>α</i>-band appears when external inputs are suppressed, while fragmentation occurs at small synaptic noise or with increasing inhibitory inputs. To conclude, <i>α</i>-oscillations could result from the synaptic dynamics of interacting excitatory neuronal networks with and without AHP, a principle that could apply to other rhythms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of whole genome duplications on the human gene regulatory networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Francesco Mottes, Chiara Villa, Matteo Osella, Michele Caselle</p>

This work studies the effects of the two rounds of Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) at the origin of the vertebrate lineage on the architecture of the human gene regulatory networks. We integrate information on transcriptional regulation, miRNA regulation, and protein-protein interactions to comparatively analyse the role of WGD and Small Scale Duplications (SSD) in the structural properties of the resulting multilayer network. We show that complex network motifs, such as combinations of feed-forward loops and bifan arrays, deriving from WGD events are specifically enriched in the network. Pairs of WGD-derived proteins display a strong tendency to interact both with each other and with common partners and WGD-derived transcription factors play a prominent role in the retention of a strong regulatory redundancy. Combinatorial regulation and synergy between different regulatory layers are in general enhanced by duplication events, but the two types of duplications contribute in different ways. Overall, our findings suggest that the two WGD events played a substantial role in increasing the multi-layer complexity of the vertebrate regulatory network by enhancing its combinatorial organization, with potential consequences on its overall robustness and ability to perform high-level functions like signal integration and noise control. Lastly, we discuss in detail the RAR/RXR pathway as an illustrative example of the evolutionary impact of WGD duplications in human.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Autonomous epithelial folding induced by an intracellular mechano–polarity feedback loop</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fu-Lai Wen, Chun Wai Kwan, Yu-Chiun Wang, Tatsuo Shibata</p>

Epithelial tissues form folded structures during embryonic development and organogenesis. Whereas substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying mechanical and biochemical mechanisms that induce folding, whether and how their interplay synergistically shapes epithelial folds remains poorly understood. Here we propose a mechano–biochemical model for dorsal fold formation in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, an epithelial folding event induced by shifts of cell polarity. Based on experimentally observed apical domain homeostasis, we couple cell mechanics to polarity and find that mechanical changes following the initial polarity shifts alter cell geometry, which in turn influences the reaction-diffusion of polarity proteins, thus forming a feedback loop between cell mechanics and polarity. This model can induce spontaneous fold formation <i>in silico</i>, recapitulate polarity and shape changes observed <i>in vivo</i>, and confer robustness to tissue shape change against small fluctuations in mechanics and polarity. These findings reveal emergent properties of a developing epithelium under control of intracellular mechano–polarity coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulations of dynamically cross-linked actin networks: Morphology, rheology, and hydrodynamic interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ondrej Maxian, Raúl P. Peláez, Alex Mogilner, Aleksandar Donev</p>

Cross-linked actin networks are the primary component of the cell cytoskeleton and have been the subject of numerous experimental and modeling studies. While these studies have demonstrated that the networks are viscoelastic materials, evolving from elastic solids on short timescales to viscous fluids on long ones, questions remain about the duration of each asymptotic regime, the role of the surrounding fluid, and the behavior of the networks on intermediate timescales. Here we perform detailed simulations of passively cross-linked non-Brownian actin networks to quantify the principal timescales involved in the elastoviscous behavior, study the role of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions, and parameterize continuum models from discrete stochastic simulations. To do this, we extend our recent computational framework for semiflexible filament suspensions, which is based on nonlocal slender body theory, to actin networks with dynamic cross linkers and finite filament lifetime. We introduce a model where the cross linkers are elastic springs with sticky ends stochastically binding to and unbinding from the elastic filaments, which randomly turn over at a characteristic rate. We show that, depending on the parameters, the network evolves to a steady state morphology that is either an isotropic actin mesh or a mesh with embedded actin bundles. For different degrees of bundling, we numerically apply small-amplitude oscillatory shear deformation to extract three timescales from networks of hundreds of filaments and cross linkers. We analyze the dependence of these timescales, which range from the order of hundredths of a second to the actin turnover time of several seconds, on the dynamic nature of the links, solvent viscosity, and filament bending stiffness. We show that the network is mostly elastic on the short time scale, with the elasticity coming mainly from the cross links, and viscous on the long time scale, with the effective viscosity originating primarily from stretching and breaking of the cross links. We show that the influence of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions depends on the network morphology: for homogeneous meshworks, nonlocal hydrodynamics gives only a small correction to the viscous behavior, but for bundled networks it both hinders the formation of bundles and significantly lowers the resistance to shear once bundles are formed. We use our results to construct three-timescale generalized Maxwell models of the networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine scale prediction of ecological community composition using a two-step sequential Machine Learning ensemble</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Icíar Civantos-Gómez, Javier García-Algarra, David García-Callejas, Javier Galeano, Oscar Godoy, Ignasi Bartomeus</p>

Prediction is one of the last frontiers in ecology. Indeed, predicting fine-scale species composition in natural systems is a complex challenge as multiple abiotic and biotic processes operate simultaneously to determine local species abundances. On the one hand, species intrinsic performance and their tolerance limits to different abiotic pressures modulate species abundances. On the other hand there is growing recognition that species interactions play an equally important role in limiting or promoting such abundances within ecological communities. Here, we present a joint effort between ecologists and data scientists to use data-driven models to predict species abundances using reasonably easy to obtain data. We propose a sequential data-driven modeling approach that in a first step predicts the potential species abundances based on abiotic variables, and in a second step uses these predictions to model the realized abundances once accounting for species competition. Using a curated data set over five years we predict fine-scale species abundances in a highly diverse annual plant community. Our models show a remarkable spatial predictive accuracy using only easy-to-measure variables in the field, yet such predictive power is lost when temporal dynamics are taken into account. This result suggests that predicting future abundances requires longer time series analysis to capture enough variability. In addition, we show that these data-driven models can also suggest how to improve mechanistic models by adding missing variables that affect species performance such as particular soil conditions (e.g. carbonate availability in our case). Robust models for predicting fine-scale species composition informed by the mechanistic understanding of the underlying abiotic and biotic processes can be a pivotal tool for conservation, especially given the human-induced rapid environmental changes we are experiencing. This objective can be achieved by promoting the knowledge gained with classic modelling approaches in ecology and recently developed data-driven models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Riddled with holes: Understanding air space formation in plant leaves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher D. Whitewoods</p>

Plants use energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide from the air into complex organic molecules, ultimately producing much of the food we eat. To make this complex chemistry more efficient, plant leaves are intricately constructed in 3 dimensions: They are flat to maximise light capture and contain extensive internal air spaces to increase gas exchange for photosynthesis. Many years of work has built up an understanding of how leaves form flat blades, but the molecular mechanisms that control air space formation are poorly understood. Here, I review our current understanding of air space formation and outline how recent advances can be harnessed to answer key questions and take the field forward. Increasing our understanding of plant air spaces will not only allow us to understand a fundamental aspect of plant development, but also unlock the potential to engineer the internal structure of crops to make them more efficient at photosynthesis with lower water requirements and more resilient in the face of a changing environment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Heterophilic and homophilic cadherin interactions in intestinal intermicrovillar links are species dependent</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle E. Gray, Zachary R. Johnson, Debadrita Modak, Elakkiya Tamilselvan, Matthew J. Tyska, Marcos Sotomayor</p>

Enterocytes are specialized epithelial cells lining the luminal surface of the small intestine that build densely packed arrays of microvilli known as brush borders. These microvilli drive nutrient absorption and are arranged in a hexagonal pattern maintained by intermicrovillar links formed by 2 nonclassical members of the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell adhesion proteins: protocadherin-24 (PCDH24, also known as CDHR2) and the mucin-like protocadherin (CDHR5). The extracellular domains of these proteins are involved in heterophilic and homophilic interactions important for intermicrovillar function, yet the structural determinants of these interactions remain unresolved. Here, we present X-ray crystal structures of the PCDH24 and CDHR5 extracellular tips and analyze their species-specific features relevant for adhesive interactions. In parallel, we use binding assays to identify the PCDH24 and CDHR5 domains involved in both heterophilic and homophilic adhesion for human and mouse proteins. Our results suggest that homophilic and heterophilic interactions involving PCDH24 and CDHR5 are species dependent with unique and distinct minimal adhesive units.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reducing the Complexity of Casual Representation in Bayesian Belief Network [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) is a well-established causal framework that is widely adopted in various domains and has a proven track record of success in research and application areas. However, BBN has weaknesses in causal knowledge elicitation and representation. The representation of the joint probability distribution in the Conditional Probability Table (CPT) has increased the complexity and difficulty for the user either in comprehending the causal knowledge or using it as a front-end modelling tool.   Methods: This study aims to propose a simplified version of the BBN ─ Bayesian causal model, which can represent the BBN intuitively and proposes an inference method based on the simplified version of BBN. The CPT in the BBN is replaced with the causal weight in the range of[-1,+1] to indicate the causal influence between the nodes. In addition, an inferential algorithm is proposed to compute and propagate the influence in the causal model.  Results: A case study is used to validate the proposed inferential algorithm. The results show that a Bayesian causal model is able to predict and diagnose the increment and decrement as in BBN.   Conclusions: The Bayesian causal model that serves as a simplified version of BBN has shown its advantages in modelling and representation, especially from the knowledge engineering perspective.

                Background: Exposure to 2.5-micron diameter air pollutants (PM2.5) has been associated with an increased risk of illness and death worldwide; however, in Latin American health impacts assessment of this risk factor is scarce. Medellín is one of the most polluted cities in the region, with a population growth rate that is twice as high as that of other Colombian cities, which implies a growing population at risk. Methods: A descriptive study of the disease burden was carried out using the city as the unit of observation. Health events were selected based on epidemiologic evidence and the availability of the population attributable fraction associated with PM2.5. The mortality records were taken from the module of deceased of the Single Registry of Affiliates of the Health System; the morbidity records were taken from the Individual Health Services Registries. For the estimation of the burden of disease, the current Global Burden of Disease guidelines were followed. Results: Attributable disability-adjusted life years to exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution (DALYsPM2.5) constituted 13.8% of total burden of the city. Males showed the greatest loss of DALYsPM2.5 due to acute events, while in women the greatest loss was due to chronic events. Ischemic heart disease, chronic diseases of the lower respiratory tract, and influenza and pneumonia were the events that contributed the most to DALYsPM2.5. 71.4% of the DALYsPM2.5 corresponded to mortality, mainly in the population over 65 years of age. Regarding attributable morbidity, acute events were more prevalent in both sexes, especially due to respiratory diseases Conclusion: Premature death among the elderly population has the greatest weight on burden of disease attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution, mainly due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, without significant differences according to gender.

                We will study the influence of low intensity and frequency surface peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) on nerve regeneration of digital nerve injuries of the hand after its surgical repair in humans. Participants will be patients with acute traumatic peripheral nerve injury referred to the Hand Surgery Service of the General Hospital of the State of Bahia, a reference service in the state. These patients will undergo surgery followed by PES in the immediate postoperative period. After hospital discharge, they will be followed up on an outpatient basis by researchers, who will remotely supervise a physiotherapy program. Our hypothesis is that PES will positively influence the recovery of sensory function in patients undergoing neurorrhaphy of digital nerves of the hand.

                Background: Shawarma, a popular meat-based fast food could be a source of foodborne outbreak due to non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). A clustering of acute gastrointestinal (GI) illness following intake of chicken shawarma occurred primarily among the staff and students of a tertiary care hospital in southern India. Methods: A case-control study was conducted among 348 undergraduate medical students (33 cases, 315 controls).  Data was collected using direct interviews and a simple online questionnaire. Epidemiological associations of GI illness were evaluated at three levels of exposure namely-eating food from any restaurant, eating food from the implicated food outlet, eating chicken shawarma from the implicated outlet. Results: Of 33 cases, 26 had consumed food from a particular food outlet, 4 from other outlets, and 3 did not report eating out. Consumption of food from the suspected food outlet was significantly associated with GI illness (odds ratio 121.8 [95% CI 28.41 to 522.66]; P<0.001); all the 26 cases who had eaten from the particular outlet had eaten chicken shawarma. By comparison, only one of the 315 controls had eaten this dish. Of the 27 persons (cases as well as controls) who had consumed chicken shawarma from the outlet, 26 were ill. Culture of stool samples from 10 affected individuals and implicated food item yielded Salmonella Enteritidis. Conclusions: Meat-based shawarma is a potential source of NTS infection. Food safety authorities should enforce guidelines for safe preparation and sale of shawarmas and similar products.

                Background: Bone marrow involvement is an important aspect of determining staging of disease and treatment for childhood neuroblastoma. Current standard of care relies on microscopic examination of bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates respectively, to define involvement. Flow cytometric analysis of disaggregated tumour cells, when using a panel of neuroblastoma specific markers, allows for potentially less subjective determination of the presence of tumour cells. Methods: A retrospective review of sequential bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates, performed at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between the years 2015 and 2018, was performed to assess whether the addition of flow cytometric analysis to these standard of care methods provided concordant or additional information. Results: There was good concurrence between all three methods for negative results 216/302 (72%). Positive results had a concordance of 52/86 (61%), comparing samples positive by flow cytometry and positive by either or both cytology and histology.  Of the remaining samples, 20/86 (23%) were positive by either or both cytology and histology, but negative by flow cytometry. Whereas 14/86 (16%) of samples were positive only by flow cytometry. Conclusions: Our review highlights the ongoing importance of expert cytological and histological assessment of bone marrow results. Flow cytometry is an objective, quantitative method to assess the level of bone marrow disease in aspirates.  In this study, flow cytometry identified low-level residual disease that was not detected by cytology or histology. The clinical significance of this low-level disease warrants further investigation.

                Background and objective: Stroke is the second leading cause of death in Jordan and over the world. Knowledge and awareness towards stroke play a crucial role in the management and prevention of its complications. This study aims to assess the knowledge and awareness about stroke among the Jordanian population and determine factors associated with stroke awareness. Methods: This cross-sectional study through a web-based anonymous questionnaire that needed 10 minutes to be completed. It examined sociodemographic characteristics and recognition of the risk factors, warning signs, stroke consequences, and early response to stroke symptoms. Logistic regression analysis identified the factors associated with poor knowledge of stroke.  Results: A total of 573 Jordanian adults participated in this study. The participant's ability to identify at least one early symptom of stroke and the proper response to the symptoms were significantly correlated with the educational level (OR of 3.4 and 2.5, respectively). At least one consequence of stroke was significantly associated with different demographic factors such as gender, socioeconomic income, females versus males and those with medium income versus low income had significantly higher odds (OR of 6.6 and 4.1, respectively). Conclusion: This study revealed a good knowledge and awareness level about stroke among Jordanians correlated mainly with their educational level. Therefore, new strategies should be considered to decrease the prevalence of stroke in Jordan, including the need for engagement in enhanced awareness campaigns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endogenous protein tagging in medaka using a simplified CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approach</a></h4>

              
                The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used to generate fluorescently labelled fusion proteins by homology directed repair in a variety of species. Despite its revolutionary success, there remains an urgent need for increased simplicity and efficiency of genome editing in research organisms. Here, we establish a simplified, highly efficient and precise strategy for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated endogenous protein tagging in medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>). We use a cloning-free approach that relies on PCR amplified donor fragments containing the fluorescent reporter sequences flanked by short homology arms (30-40bp), a synthetic sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA. We generate eight novel knock-in lines with high efficiency of F0 targeting and germline transmission. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) results reveal single-copy integration events only at the targeted <i>loci</i>. We provide an initial characterization of these fusion-protein lines, significantly expanding the repertoire of genetic tools available in medaka. In particular, we show that the <i>mScarlet-pcna</i> line has the potential to serve as an organismal-wide label for proliferative zones and an endogenous cell cycle reporter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allosteric ligands control the activation of a class C GPCR heterodimer by acting at the transmembrane interface</a></h4>

              
                G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the most promising drug targets. They often form homo- and heterodimers with allosteric cross-talk between receptor entities, which contributes to fine tuning of transmembrane signaling. Specifically controlling the activity of GPCR dimers with ligands is a good approach to clarify their physiological roles and to validate them as drug targets. Here, we examined the mode of action of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that bind at the interface of the transmembrane domains of the heterodimeric GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. Our site-directed mutagenesis results show that mutations of this interface impact the function of the three PAM tested. The data support the inference that they act at the active interface between both transmembrane domains, the binding site involving residues of the TM6s of the GABA<sub>B1</sub> and the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit. Importantly, the agonist activity of these PAMs involves a key region in the central core of the GABA<sub>B2</sub> transmembrane domain, which also controls the constitutive activity of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. This region corresponds to the sodium ion binding site in class A GPCRs that controls the basal state of the receptors. Overall, these data reveal the possibility of developing allosteric compounds able to specifically modulate the activity of GPCR homo- and heterodimers by acting at their transmembrane interface.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neurotoxin-mediated ­­potent activation of the axon degeneration regulator SARM1</a></h4>

              
                Axon loss underlies symptom onset and progression in many neurodegenerative disorders. Axon degeneration in injury and disease is promoted by activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-consuming enzyme SARM1. Here, we report a novel activator of SARM1, a metabolite of the pesticide and neurotoxin vacor. Removal of SARM1 completely rescues mouse neurons from vacor-induced neuron and axon death <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We present the crystal structure the <i>Drosophila</i> SARM1 regulatory domain complexed with this activator, the vacor metabolite VMN, which as the most potent activator yet know is likely to support drug development for human SARM1 and NMNAT2 disorders. This study indicates the mechanism of neurotoxicity and pesticide action by vacor, raises important questions about other pyridines in wider use today, provides important new tools for drug discovery, and demonstrates that removing SARM1 can robustly block programmed axon death induced by toxicity as well as genetic mutation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces inflammation via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-kB pathway</a></h4>

              
                The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response; however, the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly understood. Here we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1b, TNFa, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human and mouse lung epithelial cells also produced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly were non-inflammatory, but elicited an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-kB pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-kB pathway was abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein induced IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Notably, upon recognition of S protein, TLR2 dimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to activate the NF-kB pathway. Together these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular pathology of the R117H cystic fibrosis mutation is explained by loss of a hydrogen bond</a></h4>

              
                The phosphorylation-activated anion channel CFTR is gated by an ATP hydrolysis cycle at its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains, and is essential for epithelial salt-water transport. A large number of CFTR mutations cause cystic fibrosis. Since recent breakthrough in targeted pharmacotherapy, CFTR mutants with impaired gating are candidates for stimulation by potentiator drugs. Thus, understanding the molecular pathology of individual mutations has become important. The relatively common R117H mutation affects an extracellular loop, but nevertheless causes a strong gating defect. Here we identify a hydrogen bond between the side chain of arginine 117 and the backbone carbonyl group of glutamate 1124 in the cryo-electronmicroscopic structure of phosphorylated, ATP-bound CFTR. We address the functional relevance of that interaction for CFTR gating using macroscopic and microscopic inside-out patch-clamp recordings. Employing thermodynamic double-mutant cycles, we systematically track gating-state dependent changes in the strength of the R117-E1124 interaction. We find that the H-bond is formed only in the open state, but neither in the short-lived "flickery" nor in the long-lived 'interburst' closed state. Loss of this H-bond explains the strong gating phenotype of the R117H mutant, including robustly shortened burst durations and strongly reduced intraburst open probability. The findings may help targeted potentiator design.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Over-expression screen of interferon-stimulated genes identifies RARRES3 as a restrictor of Toxoplasma gondii infection</a></h4>

              
                <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is an important human pathogen infecting an estimated 1 in 3 people worldwide. The cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) is induced during infection and is critical for restricting <i>T. gondii</i> growth in human cells. Growth restriction is presumed to be due to the induction interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that are upregulated to protect the host from infection. Although there are hundreds of ISGs induced by IFNγ, their individual roles in restricting parasite growth in human cells remain somewhat elusive. To address this deficiency, we screened a library of 414 IFNγ induced ISGs to identify factors that impact <i>T. gondii</i> infection in human cells. In addition to IRF1, which likely acts through induction of numerous downstream genes, we identified RARRES3 as a single factor that restricts <i>T. gondii</i> infection by inducing premature egress of the parasite in multiple human cell lines. Overall, while we successfully identified a novel IFNγ induced factor restricting <i>T. gondii</i> infection, the limited number of ISGs capable of restricting <i>T. gondii</i> infection when individually expressed suggests that IFNγ mediated immunity to <i>T. gondii</i> infection is a complex, multifactorial process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reversal of the adipostat control of torpor during migration in hummingbirds</a></h4>

              
                Many small endotherms use torpor to reduce metabolic rate and manage daily energy balance. However, the physiological 'rules' that govern torpor use are unclear. We tracked torpor use and body composition in ruby-throated hummingbirds (<i>Archilochus colubris</i>), a long-distance migrant, throughout the summer using respirometry and quantitative magnetic resonance. During the mid-summer, birds entered torpor at consistently low fat stores (~5% of body mass), and torpor duration was negatively related to evening fat load. Remarkably, this energy-emergency strategy was abandoned in the late summer when birds accumulated fat for migration. During the migration period, birds were more likely to enter torpor on nights when they had higher fat stores, and fat gain was positively correlated with the amount of torpor used. These findings demonstrate the versatility of torpor throughout the annual cycle and suggest a fundamental change in physiological feedback between adiposity and torpor during migration. Moreover, this study highlights the underappreciated importance of facultative heterothermy in migratory ecology.

                Antagonistic interactions are widespread in the microbial world and affect microbial evolutionary dynamics. Natural microbial communities often display spatial structure, which affects biological interactions, but much of what we know about microbial warfare comes from laboratory studies of well-mixed communities. To overcome this limitation, we manipulated two killer strains of the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, expressing different toxins, to independently control the rate at which they released their toxins. We developed mathematical models that predict the experimental dynamics of competition between toxin-producing strains in both well-mixed and spatially structured populations. In both situations, we experimentally verified theory's prediction that a stronger antagonist can invade a weaker one only if the initial invading population exceeds a critical frequency or size. Finally, we found that toxin-resistant cells and weaker killers arose in spatially structured competitions between toxin-producing strains, suggesting that adaptive evolution can affect the outcome of microbial antagonism in spatial settings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Src activates retrograde membrane traffic through phosphorylation of GBF1</a></h4>

              
                The Src tyrosine kinase controls cancer-critical protein glycosylation through Golgi to ER relocation of GALNTs enzymes. How Src induces this trafficking event is unknown. Golgi to ER transport depends on the GTP Exchange factor (GEF) GBF1 and small GTPase Arf1. Here we show that Src induces the formation of tubular transport carriers containing GALNTs. The kinase phosphorylates GBF1 on 10 tyrosine residues; two of them, Y876 and Y898 are located near the C-terminus of the Sec7 GEF domain. Their phosphorylation promotes GBF1 binding to the GTPase; molecular modeling suggests partial melting of the Sec7 domain and intramolecular rearrangement. GBF1 mutants defective for these rearrangements prevent binding, carrier formation and GALNTs relocation, while phosphomimetic GBF1 mutants induce tubules. In sum, Src promotes GALNTs relocation by promoting GBF1 binding to Arf1. Based on residue conservation, similar regulation of GEF-Arf complexes by tyrosine phosphorylation could be a conserved and wide-spread mechanism.

                The parasite<i> Cryptosporidium</i> is responsible for diarrheal disease in young children causing death, malnutrition, and growth delay. <i>Cryptosporidium</i> invades enterocytes where it develops in a unique intracellular niche. Infected cells exhibit profound changes in morphology, physiology and transcriptional activity. How the parasite effects these changes is poorly understood. We explored the localization of highly polymorphic proteins and found members of the <i>C. parvum </i>MEDLE protein family to be translocated into the cytosol of infected cells. All intracellular life stages engage in this export, which occurs after completion of invasion. Mutational studies defined an N-terminal host-targeting motif and demonstrated proteolytic processing at a specific leucine residue. Direct expression of MEDLE2 in mammalian cells triggered an ER stress response, which was also observed during infection. Taken together, our studies reveal the presence of a <i>Cryptosporidium</i> secretion system capable of delivering parasite proteins into the infected enterocyte.

                The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs; Batten disease) are fatal, mainly childhood, inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases. Sheep affected with a CLN6 form display progressive regionally defined glial activation and subsequent neurodegeneration, indicating that neuroinflammation may be causative of pathogenesis. In this study, aggregation chimeras were generated from homozygous unaffected normal and CLN6 affected sheep embryos, resulting in seven chimeric animals with varied proportions of normal to affected cells. These sheep were classified as affected-like, recovering-like or normal-like, based on their cell-genotype ratios and their clinical and neuropathological profiles. Neuropathological examination of the affected-like animals revealed intense glial activation, prominent storage body accumulation and severe neurodegeneration within all cortical brain regions, along with vision loss and decreasing intracranial volumes and cortical thicknesses consistent with ovine CLN6 disease. In contrast, intercellular communication affecting pathology was evident at both the gross and histological level in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras, resulting in a lack of glial activation and rare storage body accumulation in only a few cells. Initial intracranial volumes of the recovering-like chimeras were below normal but progressively recovered to about normal by two years of age. All had normal cortical thicknesses, and none went blind. Extended neurogenesis was evident in the brains of all the chimeras. This study indicates that although CLN6 is a membrane bound protein, the consequent defect is not cell intrinsic. The lack of glial activation and inflammatory responses in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras indicate that newly generated cells are borne into a microenvironment conducive to maturation and survival.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of stimulus pulse rate on somatosensory adaptation in the human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the somatosensory cortex can restore sensation to people with neurological diseases. However, many aspects of ICMS are poorly understood, including the effect of continuous stimulation on percept intensity over time. Objective: Here, we evaluate how tactile percepts, evoked by ICMS in the somatosensory cortex of a human participant adapt over time. Methods: We delivered continuous and intermittent ICMS to the somatosensory cortex and assessed the reported intensity of tactile percepts over time in a human participant. Experiments were conducted across approximately one year and linear mixed effects models were used to assess significance. Results: Continuous stimulation at high frequencies led to rapid decreases in intensity, while low frequency stimulation maintained percept intensity for longer periods. Burst-modulated stimulation extended the time before the intensity began to decrease, but all protocols ultimately resulted in complete sensation loss within one minute. Intermittent stimulation paradigms with several seconds between stimulus trains also led to decreases in intensity on many electrodes, but never resulted in extinction of sensation after over three minutes of stimulation. Additionally, longer breaks between each pulse train resulted in some recovery of the stimulus-evoked percepts. For several electrodes, intermittent stimulation had almost no effect on the perceived intensity. Conclusions: Intermittent ICMS paradigms were more effective at maintaining percepts, and given that transient activity in the somatosensory cortex dominates the response to object contact, this stimulation method may mimic natural cortical activity and improve the perception of stimulation over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why do hippocampal mossy cells matter? It depends on the frequency and context.</a></h4>

              
                The discrimination of similar episodes and places, and their representation as distinct memories, depend on a process called pattern separation that relies on the circuitry of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Mossy cells (MCs) are key neurons in the circuitry, but how they influence DG network dynamics, function, and seizure risk has not been fully elucidated. We found the net impact of MCs was inhibitory at physiological frequencies connected with learning and behaviour, and their absence associated with deficits in pattern separation and spatial memory; at higher frequencies, their net impact was excitatory, and their absence protected against seizures. Thus, MCs influence DG outputs in a highly dynamic manner that varies with frequency and context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Finger stability in precision grips</a></h4>

              
                Stable precision grips using the fingertips are a cornerstone of human hand dexterity. Occasionally, however, our fingers become unstable and snap into a hyper-extended posture. This is because multi-link mechanisms, like our fingers, can buckle under tip forces. Suppressing this instability is crucial for hand dexterity, but how the neuromuscular system does so is unknown. Here we show that finger stability is due to the stiffness from muscle contraction and likely not feedback control. We recorded maximal force application with the index finger and found that most buckling events lasted less than 50 ms, too fast for sensorimotor feedback to act. However, a biomechanical model of the finger predicted that muscle-induced stiffness is also insufficient for stability at maximal force unless we add springs to stiffen the joints. We tested this prediction in 39 volunteers. Upon adding stiffness, maximal force increased by 34{+/-}3%, and muscle electromyography readings were 21{+/-}3% higher for the finger flexors (mean{+/-}standard error). Hence, people refrain from applying truly maximal force unless an external stabilizing stiffness allows their muscles to apply higher force without losing stability. Muscle recordings and mathematical modeling show that the splint offloads the demand for muscle co-contraction and this reduced co-contraction with the splint underlies the increase in force. But more stiffness is not always better. Stiff fingers would interfere the ability to passively adapt to complex object geometries and precisely regulate force. Thus, our results show how hand function arises from neurally tuned muscle stiffness that balances finger stability with compliance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulating effects of FGF12 variants on NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 associated with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy and Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) may represent an important modulator of neuronal network activity and has been associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). We sought to identify the underlying pathomechanism of FGF12-related disorders. Methods: Patients with pathogenic variants in FGF12 were identified through published case reports, GeneMatcher and whole exome sequencing of own case collections. The functional consequences of two missense variants and two copy number variants (CNVs) were studied by co-expression of wild-type and mutant FGF12 in neuronal-like cells (ND7/23) with the sodium channels NaV1.2 or NaV1.6, including their functional active beta-1 and beta-2 sodium channel subunits (SCN1B and SCN2B). Results: Four variants in FGF12 were identified for functional analysis: one novel FGF12 variant in a patient with autism spectrum disorder and three variants from previously published patients affected by developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). We demonstrate the differential regulating effects of wildtype and mutant FGF12 on NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 channels. Here, FGF12 variants lead to a complex kinetic influence on NaV1.2 and NaV 1.6, including loss- as well as gain-of function changes in fast inactivation as well as loss-of function changes in slow inactivation. Interpretation: For the first time, we could demonstrate the detailed regulating effect of FGF12 on NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 and confirmed the complex effect of FGF12 on neuronal network activity. Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum related to FGF12 variants and elucidate the underlying pathomechanism. Specific variants in FGF12-associated disorders may be amenable to precision treatment with sodium channel blockers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide neural co-activations in resting human</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous neural activity in human as assessed with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) exhibits brain-wide coordinated patterns in the frequency of <0.1Hz. However, fast brain-wide networks at the timescales of neuronal events (milliseconds to sub-seconds) and their spatial, spectral, and propagational characteristics remain unclear due to the temporal constraints of hemodynamic signals. With milli-second resolution and whole-head coverage, scalp-based electroencephalography (EEG) provides a unique window into brain-wide networks with neuronal-timescale dynamics, shedding light on the organizing principles of brain function. Using state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, we reconstructed cortical neural tomography from resting-state EEG and extracted component-based co-activation patterns (cCAPs). These cCAPs revealed brain-wide intrinsic networks and their dynamics, indicating the configuration/reconfiguration of resting human brains into recurring and propagating functional states, which are featured with the prominent spatial phenomena of global patterns and anti-state pairs of co-(de)activations. Rich oscillational structures across a wide frequency band (i.e., 0.6Hz, 5Hz, and 10Hz) were embedded in the dynamics of these functional states. We further identified a superstructure that regulated between-state propagations and governed a significant aspect of brain-wide network dynamics. These findings demonstrated how resting-state EEG data can be functionally decomposed using cCAPs to reveal rich structures of brain-wide human neural activations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Harmonizing Functional Connectivity Reduces Scanner Effects in Community Detection</a></h4>

              
                Community detection on graphs constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has led to important insights into brain functional organization. Large studies of brain community structure often include images acquired on multiple scanners across different studies. Differences in scanner can introduce variability into the downstream results, and these differences are often referred to as scanner effects. Such effects have been previously shown to significantly impact common network metrics. In this study, we identify scanner effects in data-driven community detection results and related network metrics. We assess a commonly employed harmonization method and propose new methodology for harmonizing functional connectivity that leverage existing knowledge about network structure as well as patterns of covariance in the data. Finally, we demonstrate that our new methods reduce scanner effects in community structure and network metrics. Our results highlight scanner effects in studies of brain functional organization and provide additional tools to address these unwanted effects. These findings and methods can be incorporated into future functional connectivity studies, potentially preventing spurious findings and improving reliability of results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical tracking of voice pitch in the presence of multiple speakers depends on selective attention</a></h4>

              
                Voice pitch carries linguistic as well as non-linguistic information. Previous studies have described cortical tracking of voice pitch in clean speech, with responses reflecting both pitch strength and pitch value. However, pitch is also a powerful cue for auditory stream segregation, especially when competing streams have pitch differing in fundamental frequency, as is the case when multiple speakers talk simultaneously. We therefore investigated how cortical speech pitch tracking is affected in the presence of a second, task-irrelevant speaker. We analyzed human magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to continuous narrative speech, presented either as a single talker in a quiet background, or as a two-talker mixture of a male and a female speaker. In clean speech, voice pitch was associated with a right-dominant response, peaking at a latency of around 100 ms, consistent with previous EEG and ECoG results. The response tracked both the presence of pitch as well as the relative value of the speaker's fundamental frequency. In the two-talker mixture, pitch of the attended speaker was tracked bilaterally, regardless of whether or not there was simultaneously present pitch in the speech of the irrelevant speaker. Pitch tracking for the irrelevant speaker was reduced: only the right hemisphere still significantly tracked pitch of the unattended speaker, and only during intervals in which no pitch was present in the attended talker's speech. Taken together, these results suggest that pitch-based segregation of multiple speakers, at least as measured by macroscopic cortical tracking, is not entirely automatic but strongly dependent on selective attention.

                We present the Direct Subjective Refraction (DSR), a new subjective refraction method, and validate it vs the Traditional Subjective Refraction (TSR) and an unsupervised version of it (UTSR). We project an optotunable lens onto the eye to create Temporal Defocus Waves produces flicker and chromatic distortions, minimum when the mean optical power of the wave matches the spherical equivalent of the eye. 25 subjects performed the DSR visual and UTSR tasks without supervision. DSR is more repeatable than TSR and UTSR (standard deviations 0.17D, 0.28, and 0.47D). The time per repetition of DSR is only 39s (almost 6 min for TSR). Cyclopegia severely affects UTSR, but not DSR, confirming that the DSR task de-activates the accommodative system. DSR is a new method to obtain the spherical equivalent that does not requires supervision and overpasses existing subjective methods in terms of accuracy, precision, and measurement time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trial-by-trial fluctuations in amygdala activity track motivational enhancement of desirable sensory evidence during perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                People are biased towards seeing outcomes that they are motivated to see. For example, sports fans of opposing teams often perceive the same ambiguous foul in favor of the team they support. Here, we test the hypothesis that amygdala-dependent allocation of visual attention facilitates motivational biases in perceptual decision-making. Human participants were rewarded for correctly categorizing an ambiguous image into one of two categories while undergoing fMRI. On each trial, we used a financial bonus to motivate participants to see one category over another. The reward maximizing strategy was to perform the categorization task accurately, but participants were biased towards categorizing the images as the category we motivated them to see. Heightened amygdala activity preceded motivation consistent categorizations, and participants with higher amygdala activation exhibited stronger motivational biases in their perceptual reports. Trial-by-trial amygdala activity was associated with stronger enhancement of neural activity encoding desirable percepts in sensory cortices, suggesting that amygdala-dependent effects on perceptual decisions arose from biased sensory processing. Analyses using a drift diffusion model provide converging evidence that trial-by-trial amygdala activity was associated with stronger motivational biases in the accumulation of sensory evidence. Prior work examining biases in perceptual decision-making have focused on the role of frontoparietal regions. Our work highlights an important contribution of the amygdala. When people are motivated to see one outcome over another, the amygdala biases perceptual decisions towards those outcomes.

	<p>Recent evidence suggests that the aberrant signaling of salience is associated with psychotic illness. Salience, however, can take many forms in task environments. For example, salience may refer to any of the following: (1) the valence of an outcome, (2) outcomes that are unexpected, called reward prediction errors (PEs), or (3) cues associated with uncertain outcomes. Here, we measure brain responses to different forms of salience in the context of a passive PE-signaling task, testing whether patients with schizophrenia (SZ) showed aberrant signaling of particular types of salience. We acquired event-related MRI data from 29 SZ patients and 23 controls during the performance of a passive outcome prediction task. Across groups, we found that the anterior insula and posterior parietal cortices were activated to multiple different types of salience, including PE magnitude and heightened levels of uncertainty. However, BOLD activation to salient events was not significantly different between patients and controls in many regions, including the insula, posterior parietal cortices, and default mode network nodes. Such results suggest that deficiencies in salience processing in SZ may not result from an impaired ability to signal salience per se, but instead the ability to use such signals to guide future actions. Notably, no between-group differences were observed in BOLD signal changes associated with PE-signaling in the striatum. However, positive symptom severity was found to significantly correlate with the magnitudes of salience contrasts in default mode network nodes. Our results suggest that, in an observational environment, SZ patients may show an intact ability to activate striatal and cortical regions to rewarding and non-rewarding salient events. Furthermore, reduced deactivation of a hypothesized default mode network node for SZ participants with high levels of positive symptoms, following salient events, point to abnormalities in interactions of the salience network with other brain networks, and their potential importance to positive symptoms.</p>

	<p>Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with muscle and nerve injuries as a consequence of prolonged critical illness or the infection itself. In this study, we evaluated neuromuscular involvement in patients who underwent post-acute intensive rehabilitation after COVID-19. Methods: Clinical and neurophysiological evaluations, including nerve conduction studies and electromyography, were performed on 21 consecutive patients admitted for rehabilitation after COVID-19. Results: Clinical signs suggesting muscle or nerve involvement (weakness, reduced deep tendon reflexes, impaired sensitivity, abnormal gait) were found in 19 patients. Neurophysiological examinations confirmed neuromuscular involvement in 17 patients: a likely association of critical illness myopathy (CIM) and critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) was found in 5 patients; CIM alone was found in 4 patients; axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy was found in 4 patients (CIP in 2 patients, metabolic polyneuropathy in 2 patients); Guillain-Barr&amp;amp;eacute; syndrome was found in 2 patients (classical demyelinating sensory-motor polyneuropathy and acute motor axonal neuropathy, respectively); peroneal nerve injury was found in 1 patient; and pre-existing L4 radiculopathy was found in 1 patient. Conclusions: Neuromuscular involvement is a very common finding among patients admitted for rehabilitation after COVID-19, and proper investigation should be conducted when muscle or nerve injury is suspected for adequate rehabilitative strategy planning.</p>

                Visual neurons can have their tuning properties contextually modulated by the presence of visual stimuli in the area surrounding their receptive field, especially when that stimuli contains natural features. However, stimuli presented in specific egocentric locations may have greater behavioural relevance, raising the possibility that the extent of contextual modulation may vary with position in visual space. To explore this possibility we utilised the small size and optical transparency of the larval zebrafish to describe the form and spatial arrangement of contextually modulated cells throughout an entire tectal hemisphere. We found that the spatial tuning of tectal neurons to a prey-like stimulus sharpens when the stimulus is presented in the context of a naturalistic visual scene. These neurons are confined to a spatially restricted region of the tectum and have receptive fields centred within a region of visual space in which the presence of prey preferentially triggers hunting behaviour. Our results demonstrate that circuits that support behaviourally relevant modulation of tectal neurons are not uniformly distributed. These findings add to the growing body of evidence that the tectum shows regional adaptations for behaviour.

                The archicortical hippocampus differs, like the neocortex, in its folding patterns between individuals. Here, we present an automated and robust BIDS-App, HippUnfold, for defining and indexing subject-specific hippocampal folding in MRI, analogous to popular tools used in neocortical reconstruction. This is critical for inter-individual alignment, with topology as the basis for homology. This topological framework enables qualitatively new analyses of morphological and laminar structure in the hippocampus or hippocampal subfields, and is critical for the advancement of neuroimaging analyses at a meso- or micro-scale. HippUnfold uses state-of-the-art deep learning combined with previously developed topological constraints on hippocampal tissue. It is designed to work with commonly employed sub-millimetric MRI acquisitions, with extensibility to microscopic resolutions as well. In this paper we illustrate the power of HippUnfold in feature extraction, and its construct validity compared to several extant hippocampal subfield analysis methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Computational Model of Stereoscopic Prey Capture inPraying Mantises</a></h4>

              
                We present a simple model which can account for the stereoscopic sensitivity of praying mantis predatory strikes. The model consists of a single disparity sensor: a binocular neuron sensitive to stereoscopic disparity and thus to distance from the animal. The model is based closely on the known behavioural and neurophysiological properties of mantis stereopsis. The monocular inputs to the neuron reflect temporal change and are insensitive to contrast sign, making the sensor insensitive to interocular correlation. The monocular receptive fields have a excitatory centre and inhibitory surround, making them tuned to size. The disparity sensor combines inputs from the two eyes linearly, applies a threshold and then an exponent output nonlinearity. The activity of the sensor represents the model mantis instantaneous probability of striking. We integrate this over the stimulus duration to obtain the expected number of strikes in response to moving targets with different stereoscopic distance, size and vertical disparity. We optimised the parameters of the model so as to bring its predictions into agreement with our empirical data on mean strike rate as a function of stimulus size and distance. The model proves capable of reproducing the relatively broad tuning to size and narrow tuning to stereoscopic distance seen in mantis striking behaviour. The model also displays realistic responses to vertical disparity. Most surprisingly, although the model has only a single centre surround receptive field in each eye, it displays qualitatively the same interaction between size and distance as we observed in real mantids: the preferred size increases as prey distance increases beyond the preferred distance. We show that this occurs because of a stereoscopic false match between the leading edge of the stimulus in one eye and its trailing edge in the other; further work will be required to find whether such false matches occur in real mantises. This is the first image-computable model of insect stereopsis, and reproduces key features of both neurophysiology and striking behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron particles capture network topology and behavior from single units</a></h4>

              
                While networks of neurons, glia and vascular systems enable and support brain functions, to date, mathematical tools to decode network dynamics and structure from very scarce and partially observed neuronal spiking behavior remain underdeveloped. Large neuronal networks contribute to the intrinsic neuron transfer function and observed neuronal spike trains encoding complex causal information processing, yet how this emerging causal fractal memory in the spike trains relates to the network topology is not fully understood. Towards this end, we propose a novel statistical physics inspired neuron particle model that captures the causal information flow and processing features of neuronal spiking activity. Relying on synthetic comprehensive simulations and real-world neuronal spiking activity analysis, the proposed fractional order operators governing the neuronal spiking dynamics provide insights into the memory and scale of the spike trains as well as information about the topological properties of the underlying neuronal networks. Lastly, the proposed model exhibits superior predictions of animal behavior during multiple cognitive tasks.

                A classic approach to estimate the individual theta-to-alpha transition frequency requires two electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, one acquired in resting-state condition and one showing an alpha de-synchronisation due e.g. to task execution. This translates into longer recording sessions that my be cumbersome in studies involving patients. Moreover, incomplete de-synchronisation of the alpha rhythm may compromise the final estimation of the transition frequency. Here we present transfreq, a Python library that allows the computation of the transition frequency from restingstate data by clustering the spectral profiles at different EEG channels based on their content in the alpha and theta bands. We first provide an overview of the transfreq core algorithm and of the software architecture. Then we demonstrate its feasibility and robustness across different experimental setups on a publicly available EEG data set and on in-house recordings. A detailed documentation of transfreq and the codes for reproducing the analysis of the paper with the open-source data set are available online at https://elisabettavallarino.github.io/transfreq/

                The contribution of structural connectivity to functional connectivity dynamics is still far from being fully elucidated. Herein, we applied track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity (tw-dFC), a model integrating structural, functional, and dynamic connectivity, on high quality diffusion weighted imaging and resting-state fMRI data from two independent repositories. The tw-dFC maps were analyzed using independent component analysis, aiming at identifying spatially independent white matter components which support dynamic changes in functional connectivity. Each component consisted of a spatial map of white matter bundles that show consistent fluctuations in functional connectivity at their endpoints, and a time course representative of such functional activity. These components show high intra-subject, inter-subject, and inter-cohort reproducibility. We provided also converging evidence that functional information about white matter activity derived by this method can capture biologically meaningful features of brain connectivity organization, as well as predict higher-order cognitive performance.

                Faces are a rich source of social information. How does the infant brain develop the ability to recognize faces and identify potential social partners? We collected functional magnetic neuroimaging (fMRI) data from 49 awake human infants (aged 2.5-9.7 months) while they watched movies of faces, bodies, objects, and scenes. Face-selective responses were observed not only in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) but also in superior temporal sulcus (STS), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Face responses were also observed (but not fully selective) in the amygdala and thalamus. We find no evidence that face-selective responses develop in visual perception regions (VTC) prior to higher order social perception (STS) or social evaluation (MPFC) regions. We suggest that face-selective responses may develop in parallel across multiple cortical regions. Infants' brains could thus simultaneously process faces both as a privileged category of visual images, and as potential social partners.

	<p>Current evidence suggests emotion regulation is an important factor in both math anxiety and math performance, but the interplay between these constructs is unexamined. Given the multicomponent structure of math anxiety, emotion regulation, and math performance, here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive model of the underlying nature of the links between these latent variables. Using the innovative network analysis approach, the study visualized the underlying links between directly observable and measurable variables that might be masked by traditional statistical approaches. One hundred and seventeen adults completed a battery of tests and questionnaires on math anxiety, emotion regulation, and math performance. The results revealed: (1) state math anxiety (the emotional experience in math-related situations), rather than trait math anxiety, was linked to anxiety predisposition, subjective valence of math information, and difficulties in emotion regulation; (2) the link between state math anxiety and math performance partialed out the link between trait math anxiety and performance. The study innovatively demonstrates the need to differentiate between traits and tendencies to the actual emotional experience and emotion regulation used in math anxiety. The results have important implications for the theoretical understanding of math anxiety and future discussions and work in the field.</p>

	<p>Corpus callosotomy (CC) is one of the options in epilepsy surgeries to palliate patient seizures, and is typically applied for drop attacks. The mechanisms of seizure palliation involve disrupting the propagation of epileptic activity to the contralateral side of the brain. This review article focuses on the surgical aspects of CC. As a variations of CC, anterior two-thirds, posterior one-third, and total callosotomy are described with intraoperative photographs. As less-invasive surgical variations, recent progress in endoscopic CC, and CC without craniotomy, is described. CC remains acceptable under the low prevalence of complications, and surgeons should make the maximum effort to minimize the complication rate.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The iPSC perspective on schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Over a decade of schizophrenia research using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural models has provided substantial data describing neurobiological characteristics of the disorder in vitro. Simultaneously, translation of the results into general mechanistic concepts underlying schizophrenia pathophysiology has been trailing behind. Given that modeling brain function using cell cultures is challenging, the gap between the in vitro models and schizophrenia as a clinical disorder has remained wide.

                Peripheral neuropathy is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), of which the pathogenesis is not fully understood. We investigated whether human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), which forms pathogenic aggregates that damage islet {beta}-cells in T2DM, is involved in T2DM-associated peripheral neuropathy. In vitro, hIAPP incubation with sensory neurons reduced neurite outgrowth. Transgenic hIAPP Ob/Ob mice, an established animal model for T2DM, as well as hIAPP mice, which have elevated plasma hIAPP levels but no hyperglycaemia. Both transgenic mice developed peripheral neuropathy as evidenced by pain-associated behavior and reduced intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF), suggesting hIAPP is a mediator of diabetic neuropathy. Intraplantar and intravenous hIAPP injection in WT mice induced long-lasting mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced IENF, whereas non-aggregating murine IAPP or mutated hIAPP (Pramlintide) did not have these effects, and were not toxic for cultured sensory neurons. In T2DM patients, significantly more hIAPP oligomers were found in the skin compared to non-T2DM controls. Thus, we provide evidence that hIAPP is toxic to sensory neurons, and mediates peripheral neuropathy in mice. The presence of hIAPP aggregates in skin of humans with T2DM supports the notion that human IAPP is a potential driver of T2DM neuropathy in man.

                The highly specific and complex connectivity between neurons is the hallmark of nervous systems, but techniques for identifying, imaging, and manipulating synaptically-connected networks of neurons are limited. Monosynaptic tracing, or the gated replication and spread of a deletion-mutant rabies virus to label neurons directly connected to a targeted population of starting neurons1, is the most widely-used technique for mapping neural circuitry, but the rapid cytotoxicity of first-generation rabies viral vectors has restricted its use almost entirely to anatomical applications. We recently introduced double-deletion-mutant second-generation rabies viral vectors, showing that they have little or no detectable toxicity and are efficient means of retrogradely targeting neurons projecting to an injection site2, but they have not previously been shown to be capable of gated replication in vivo, the basis of monosynaptic tracing. Here we present a complete second-generation system for labeling direct inputs to genetically-targeted neuronal populations with minimal toxicity, using double-deletion-mutant rabies viruses. Spread of the viruses requires complementation of both of the deleted viral genes in trans in the starting postsynaptic cells; suppressing the expression of these viral genes following an initial period of viral replication, using the Tet-Off system, reduces toxicity to the starting cells without decreasing the efficiency of viral spread. Using longitudinal two-photon imaging of live monosynaptic tracing in visual cortex, we found that 94.4% of all labeled cells, and an estimated 92.3% of starting cells, survived for the full twelve-week course of imaging. Two-photon imaging of calcium responses in labeled networks of neurons in vivo over ten weeks showed that labeled neurons' visual response properties remained stable for as long as we followed them. This nontoxic labeling of inputs to genetically-targeted neurons in vivo is a long-held goal in neuroscience, with transformative applications including nonperturbative transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling, long-term functional imaging and behavioral studies, and optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation of synaptically-connected neuronal networks over the lifetimes of experimental animals.

                Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating monogenic neurodegenerative disease characterized by early, selective pathology in the basal ganglia despite the ubiquitous expression of mutant huntingtin. The molecular mechanisms underlying this region-specific neuronal degeneration and how these relate to the development of early cognitive phenotypes are poorly understood. Here, we show that there is selective loss of synaptic connections between the cortex and striatum in postmortem tissue from HD patients that is associated with the increased activation and localization of complement proteins, innate immune molecules, to markers of these synaptic elements. We also find that levels of these secreted innate immune molecules are elevated in the CSF of premanifest HD patients and correlate with established measures of disease burden. In preclinical genetic models of HD we show that complement proteins mediate the selective elimination of corticostriatal synapses at an early stage in disease pathogenesis marking them for removal by microglia, the brain's resident macrophage population. This process requires mutant huntingtin to be expressed in both cortical and striatal neurons and inhibition of this complement-dependent elimination mechanism through administration of a therapeutically relevant C1q function blocking antibody or genetic ablation of a complement receptor on microglia, prevented synapse loss, increased excitatory input to the striatum and rescued the early development of visual discrimination learning and cognitive flexibility deficits in these models. Together, our findings implicate microglia and the complement cascade in the selective, early degeneration of corticostriatal synapses and the development of cognitive deficits in presymptomatic HD, and also provide new preclinical data to support complement as a therapeutic target for early intervention.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disturbances of the early stages of neurogenesis lead to irreversible changes in the structure of the mature brain and its functional impairment, including increased excitability, which may be the basis for drug-resistant epilepsy. The range of possible clinical symptoms is as wide as the different stages of disturbed neurogenesis may be. In this study, we used a quadruple model of brain dysplasia by comparing structural and functional disorders in animals whose neurogenesis was disturbed with a single dose of 1 Gy of gamma rays at one of the four stages of neurogenesis, i.e. on days 13, 15, 17 or 19 of prenatal development.</p>
<p>When reached adulthood, the prenatally irradiated rats received EEG teletransmitter implantation. Thereafter, pilocarpine was administered and significant differences in susceptibility to seizure behavioral symptoms were detected depending on the degree of brain dysplasia. Before, during and after the seizures significant correlations were found between the density of parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons located in the cerebral cortex and the intensity of behavioral seizure symptoms or increases in the power of particular EEG bands. Neurons expressing calretinin or NPY showed also dysplasia-related increases without, however, correlations with parameters of seizure intensity. The results point to significant roles of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, and also to expression of NPY - an endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant reducing susceptibility to seizures and supporting neuronal survival.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The lateral septum (LS) is implicated as a hub that regulates a variety of affects, such as reward, feeding, anxiety, fear, sociability, and memory. However, it remains unclear how the LS, previously treated as a structure of homogeneity, exhibits such multifaceted functions. Emerging evidence suggests that different functions of the LS are mediated largely by its diverse input and output connections. It has also become clear that the LS is a heterogeneous region, where its dorsal and ventral poles play dissociable and often opposing roles. This functional heterogeneity can often be explained by distinct dorsal and ventral hippocampal inputs along the LS dorsoventral axis, as well as antagonizing connections between LS subregions. Similarly, outputs from LS subregions to respective downstream targets, such as hypothalamic, preoptic, and tegmental areas, also account for this functional heterogeneity. In this review, we provide an updated perspective on LS subregion classification, connectivity, and functions. We also identify key questions that have yet to be addressed in the field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recommendations for connecting molecular sequence and biodiversity research infrastructures through ELIXIR [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Threats to global biodiversity are increasingly recognised by scientists and the public as a critical challenge. Molecular sequencing technologies offer means to catalogue, explore, and monitor the richness and biogeography of life on Earth. However, exploiting their full potential requires tools that connect biodiversity infrastructures and resources. As a research infrastructure developing services and technical solutions that help integrate and coordinate life science resources across Europe, ELIXIR is a key player. To identify opportunities, highlight priorities, and aid strategic thinking, here we survey approaches by which molecular technologies help inform understanding of biodiversity. We detail example use cases to highlight how DNA sequencing is: resolving taxonomic issues; Increasing knowledge of marine biodiversity; helping understand how agriculture and biodiversity are critically linked; and playing an essential role in ecological studies. Together with examples of national biodiversity programmes, the use cases show where progress is being made but also highlight common challenges and opportunities for future enhancement of underlying technologies and services that connect molecular and wider biodiversity domains. Based on emerging themes, we propose key recommendations to guide future funding for biodiversity research: biodiversity and bioinformatic infrastructures need to collaborate closely and strategically; taxonomic efforts need to be aligned and harmonised across domains; metadata needs to be standardised and common data management approaches widely adopted; current approaches need to be scaled up dramatically to address the anticipated explosion of molecular data; bioinformatics support for biodiversity research needs to be enabled and sustained; training for end users of biodiversity research infrastructures needs to be prioritised; and community initiatives need to be proactive and focused on enabling solutions. For sequencing data to deliver their full potential they must be connected to knowledge: together, molecular sequence data collection initiatives and biodiversity research infrastructures can advance global efforts to prevent further decline of Earth’s biodiversity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The jury is out: a new approach to awarding science prizes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Research evaluation is often understood as something similar to a competition, where an evaluation panel’s task is to award the most excellent researchers. This interpretation is challenging, in as far as excellence it is at best a multi-dimensional concept and at worst an ill-defined term because it assumes that there exists some ground truth as to who the very best researchers are and all that an evaluation panel needs to do is uncover this ground truth. Therefore, instead of focusing on competition, the Swiss National Science Foundation focused on active decision-making and sought inspiration in the deliberation proceedings of a jury trial for the design of a new evaluation procedure of an academic award. The new evaluation procedure is based upon fully anonymised documents consisting of three independent parts (achievements, impact and prominence). Before the actual evaluation meeting, the panel, which includes non-academic experts, pre-evaluates all nominations through a pseudo-randomly structured network, such that every nomination is reviewed by six members of the panel only. Evaluation decisions are based upon anonymous votes, structured discussions in the panel, ranking as opposed to rating of nominees and data-rich figures providing an overview of the positioning of the nominee along various dimensions and the ranking provided by the individual panel members. The proceedings are overseen by an academic chair, focusing on content, and a procedural chair, focusing on the process and compliance. Combined, these elements form a highly-structure deliberation procedure, consisting of individual steps, through which nominations proceed and which each either feed into the next step or into the final verdict. The proposed evaluation process has been successfully applied in the real world in the evaluation of the Swiss Science Prize Marcel Benoist, Switzerland’s most prestigious academic award.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PDBrt: A free database of complexes with measured drug-target residence time [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Difficulties in translating the in vitro potency determined by cellular assays into in vivo efficacy in living organisms complicates the design and development of drugs. However,  the residence time of a drug in its molecular target is becoming a key parameter in the design and optimization of new drugs, as recent studies show that residence time can reliably predict drug efficacy in vivo. Experimental approaches to binding kinetics and target ligand complex solutions are currently available, but known bioinformatics databases do not usually report information about the ligand residence time in its molecular target. Methods: To extend existing databases we developed the Protein Data Bank (PDB) residence time database (PDBrt) which reports drug residence time. The database is implemented as an open access web-based tool. The front end uses Bootstrap with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), jQuery for the interface and 3Dmol.js to visualize the complexes. The server-side code uses Python web application framework, Django Rest Framework and backend database PostgreSQL. Results: The PDBrt database is a free, non-commercial repository for 3D protein-ligand complex data, including the measured ligand residence time inside the binding pocket of the specific biological macromolecules as deposited in The Protein Data Bank. The PDBrt database contains information about both the protein and the ligand separately, as well as the protein-ligand complex, binding kinetics, and time of the ligand residence inside the protein binding site.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thermodynamic constraints on the assembly and diversity of microbial ecosystems are different near to and far from equilibrium</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jacob Cook, Samraat Pawar, Robert G. Endres</p>

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has long been an area of substantial interest to ecologists because most fundamental biological processes, such as protein synthesis and respiration, are inherently energy-consuming. However, most of this interest has focused on developing coarse ecosystem-level maximisation principles, providing little insight into underlying mechanisms that lead to such emergent constraints. Microbial communities are a natural system to decipher this mechanistic basis because their interactions in the form of substrate consumption, metabolite production, and cross-feeding can be described explicitly in thermodynamic terms. Previous work has considered how thermodynamic constraints impact competition between pairs of species, but restrained from analysing how this manifests in complex dynamical systems. To address this gap, we develop a thermodynamic microbial community model with fully reversible reaction kinetics, which allows direct consideration of free-energy dissipation. This also allows species to interact via products rather than just substrates, increasing the dynamical complexity, and allowing a more nuanced classification of interaction types to emerge. Using this model, we find that community diversity increases with substrate lability, because greater free-energy availability allows for faster generation of niches. Thus, more niches are generated in the time frame of community establishment, leading to higher final species diversity. We also find that allowing species to make use of near-to-equilibrium reactions increases diversity in a low free-energy regime. In such a regime, two new thermodynamic interaction types that we identify here reach comparable strengths to the conventional (competition and facilitation) types, emphasising the key role that thermodynamics plays in community dynamics. Our results suggest that accounting for realistic thermodynamic constraints is vital for understanding the dynamics of real-world microbial communities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic analysis of noise reduction properties of coupled and isolated feed-forward loops</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suchana Chakravarty, Attila Csikász-Nagy</p>

Cells can maintain their homeostasis in a noisy environment since their signaling pathways can filter out noise somehow. Several network motifs have been proposed for biological noise filtering and, among these, feed-forward loops have received special attention. Specific feed-forward loops show noise reducing capabilities, but we notice that this feature comes together with a reduced signal transducing performance. In posttranslational signaling pathways feed-forward loops do not function in isolation, rather they are coupled with other motifs to serve a more complex function. Feed-forward loops are often coupled to other feed-forward loops, which could affect their noise-reducing capabilities. Here we systematically study all feed-forward loop motifs and all their pairwise coupled systems with activation-inactivation kinetics to identify which networks are capable of good noise reduction, while keeping their signal transducing performance. Our analysis shows that coupled feed-forward loops can provide better noise reduction and, at the same time, can increase the signal transduction of the system. The coupling of two coherent 1 or one coherent 1 and one incoherent 4 feed-forward loops can give the best performance in both of these measures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A machine learning pipeline for classification of cetacean echolocation clicks in large underwater acoustic datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kaitlin E. Frasier</p>

Machine learning algorithms, including recent advances in deep learning, are promising for tools for detection and classification of broadband high frequency signals in passive acoustic recordings. However, these methods are generally data-hungry and progress has been limited by challenges related to the lack of labeled datasets adequate for training and testing. Large quantities of known and as yet unidentified broadband signal types mingle in marine recordings, with variability introduced by acoustic propagation, source depths and orientations, and interacting signals. Manual classification of these datasets is unmanageable without an in-depth knowledge of the acoustic context of each recording location. A signal classification pipeline is presented which combines unsupervised and supervised learning phases with opportunities for expert oversight to label signals of interest. The method is illustrated with a case study using unsupervised clustering to identify five toothed whale echolocation click types and two anthropogenic signal categories. These categories are used to train a deep network to classify detected signals in either averaged time bins or as individual detections, in two independent datasets. Bin-level classification achieved higher overall precision (>99%) than click-level classification. However, click-level classification had the advantage of providing a label for every signal, and achieved higher overall recall, with overall precision from 92 to 94%. The results suggest that unsupervised learning is a viable solution for efficiently generating the large, representative training sets needed for applications of deep learning in passive acoustics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal transport analysis reveals trajectories in steady-state systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephen Zhang, Anton Afanassiev, Laura Greenstreet, Tetsuya Matsumoto, Geoffrey Schiebinger</p>

Understanding how cells change their identity and behaviour in living systems is an important question in many fields of biology. The problem of inferring cell trajectories from single-cell measurements has been a major topic in the single-cell analysis community, with different methods developed for equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems (e.g. haematopoeisis vs. embryonic development). We show that optimal transport analysis, a technique originally designed for analysing time-courses, may also be applied to infer cellular trajectories from a single snapshot of a population in equilibrium. Therefore, optimal transport provides a unified approach to inferring trajectories that is applicable to both stationary and non-stationary systems. Our method, StationaryOT, is mathematically motivated in a natural way from the hypothesis of a Waddington’s epigenetic landscape. We implement StationaryOT as a software package and demonstrate its efficacy in applications to simulated data as well as single-cell data from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> root development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cysteine and iron accelerate the formation of ribose-5-phosphate, providing insights into the evolutionary origins of the metabolic network structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel Piedrafita, Sreejith J. Varma, Cecilia Castro, Christoph Messner, Lukasz Szyrwiel, Julian L. Griffin, Markus Ralser</p>

The structure of the metabolic network is highly conserved, but we know little about its evolutionary origins. Key for explaining the early evolution of metabolism is solving a chicken–egg dilemma, which describes that enzymes are made from the very same molecules they produce. The recent discovery of several nonenzymatic reaction sequences that topologically resemble central metabolism has provided experimental support for a “metabolism first” theory, in which at least part of the extant metabolic network emerged on the basis of nonenzymatic reactions. But how could evolution kick-start on the basis of a metal catalyzed reaction sequence, and how could the structure of nonenzymatic reaction sequences be imprinted on the metabolic network to remain conserved for billions of years? We performed an in vitro screening where we add the simplest components of metabolic enzymes, proteinogenic amino acids, to a nonenzymatic, iron-driven reaction network that resembles glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). We observe that the presence of the amino acids enhanced several of the nonenzymatic reactions. Particular attention was triggered by a reaction that resembles a rate-limiting step in the oxidative PPP. A prebiotically available, proteinogenic amino acid cysteine accelerated the formation of RNA nucleoside precursor ribose-5-phosphate from 6-phosphogluconate. We report that iron and cysteine interact and have additive effects on the reaction rate so that ribose-5-phosphate forms at high specificity under mild, metabolism typical temperature and environmental conditions. We speculate that accelerating effects of amino acids on rate-limiting nonenzymatic reactions could have facilitated a stepwise enzymatization of nonenzymatic reaction sequences, imprinting their structure on the evolving metabolic network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Consolidation and maintenance of long-term memory involve dual functions of the developmental regulator Apterous in clock neurons and mushroom bodies in the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Show Inami, Tomohito Sato, Yuto Kurata, Yuki Suzuki, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Takaomi Sakai</p>

Memory is initially labile but can be consolidated into stable long-term memory (LTM) that is stored in the brain for extended periods. Despite recent progress, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the intriguing neurobiological processes of LTM remain incompletely understood. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> courtship conditioning assay as a memory paradigm, here, we show that the LIM homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factor Apterous (Ap), which is known to regulate various developmental events, is required for both the consolidation and maintenance of LTM. Interestingly, Ap is involved in these 2 memory processes through distinct mechanisms in different neuronal subsets in the adult brain. Ap and its cofactor Chip (Chi) are indispensable for LTM maintenance in the <i>Drosophila</i> memory center, the mushroom bodies (MBs). On the other hand, Ap plays a crucial role in memory consolidation in a Chi-independent manner in pigment dispersing factor (Pdf)-containing large ventral–lateral clock neurons (l-LNvs) that modulate behavioral arousal and sleep. Since disrupted neurotransmission and electrical silencing in clock neurons impair memory consolidation, Ap is suggested to contribute to the stabilization of memory by ensuring the excitability of l-LNvs. Indeed, ex vivo imaging revealed that a reduced function of Ap, but not Chi, results in exaggerated Cl<sup>−</sup> responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in l-LNvs, indicating that wild-type (WT) Ap maintains high l-LNv excitability by suppressing the GABA response. Consistently, enhancing the excitability of l-LNvs by knocking down GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors compensates for the impaired memory consolidation in <i>ap</i> null mutants. Overall, our results revealed unique dual functions of the developmental regulator Ap for LTM consolidation in clock neurons and LTM maintenance in MBs.

                In late 2019, the world was introduced to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that shook the global medical community. By early 2020, the new coronavirus strain led to the rapid spread of a disease that earned its classification as a pandemic, prompting authorities to enforce new health regulations that significantly limited access to in-person medical evaluations, and resulted in a significant reduction in skin cancer diagnosis volume over the course of the pandemic. Skin cancer is amongst the most common and frequently diagnosed cancers, with incidence rates steadily increasing for the past few decades, until recently when world-wide changes to the health system drastically reduced opportunities for screening, diagnosis and management. In order to optimize patient treatment in the midst of the pandemic, practicing providers relied heavily on remote alternatives, sparking a huge spike in teledermatology practices globally. The successful adoption of widescale teledermatology allowed improved triage of concerning skin lesions requiring urgent face-to-face assessment, which helped mitigate the repercussions of delayed diagnosis and management. The detrimental consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have permanently changed the way we view and practice medicine, and it is imperative that the medical community continues to improve modern healthcare, through continued technological innovations that will advance this new technologically-reliant age of medicine.

                Background: Cigarette smoke can trigger oxidative stress. An alternative to overcome the harmful effects of cigarette smoke is through antioxidants. White oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus Ostreatus) are a source of exogenous antioxidants because many contain active compounds for potential antioxidants such as phenol and flavonoid compounds. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus on 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and glutathione (GSH), as well as to analyze their correlation in the lung of Wistar male rats exposed to cigarette smoke. Methods: The study was a preclinical experiment conducted on 24 rats divided into four groups. The treatment was carried out for 42 days and antioxidant effects were assessed through levels of HNE and GSH in rat lungs. Groups were divided as follows: I- normal control, II- negative control, III and IV exposed to cigarette smoke for 60 minutes/day. Group III (treatment group) was treated with ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus at 250 mg/kg BW rat/day, and group IV (comparison group) was treated with N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg /day. Data analysis used was one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test, and Spearmen rank correlation coefficient test. Results: The results showed that the group receiving ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus had HNE levels of (44,18 ± 2,09 pg/mL) and GSH (0,04 ± 0,00 pg/mL) protein. This extract significantly increased GSH levels and inhibited the increase of HNE levels. Results of GSH (p≤0.01) showed significant results using one-way ANOVA. Conclusions: The ethanolic extract of P. ostreatus can prevent lipid peroxidation and decrease endogenous antioxidant levels in lung cells exposed to cigarette smoke. Ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus has good antioxidant potential.

                Background: The use of herbs as traditional medicine in Indonesia is increasing, with more than 40% of Indonesia's population utilizing them. White oyster mushroom (Pleurotus Ostreatus) is a fungus that has various therapeutic effects including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-cholesterol, and anti-cancer properties. This mushroom contains many active substances in its secondary metabolites which have pharmacological effects. The purpose of this study was to identify the active compounds in the ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom that will form the extract profile and become the basis for drug development. Methods: The active compound test used High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS). Ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom was processed by 70% alcohol maceration, evaporation, and thickening. Results: The results of the HPLC test showed that the ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom contained cinnamic acid and rutin, while the LC-MS test showed the presence of p-coumaric acid, Ascorbic acid, Linoleic acid, 9-Eicosene (E), Niacinamide, Veritric acid, Syringic acid, Ergosterol. Conclusions: The active compounds that were detected in the ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom showed that the extract had the potential for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Perfusion Imaging Predicts Favorable Outcomes after Basilar Artery Thrombectomy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging identifies anterior circulation stroke patients who respond favorably to endovascular thrombectomy (ET), but its role in basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is unknown. We hypothesized that BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion (time to reach maximum concentration in seconds [Tmax] &gt; 10) would have a favorable response to ET compared to patients with more extensive regions involved.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of BAO patients with perfusion imaging prior to ET. We prespecified a Critical Area Perfusion Score (CAPS; 0–6 points), which quantified severe hypoperfusion (Tmax &gt; 10) in cerebellum (1 point/hemisphere), pons (2 points), and midbrain and/or thalamus (2 points). Patients were dichotomized into favorable (CAPS ≤ 3) and unfavorable (CAPS &gt; 3) groups. The primary outcome was a favorable functional outcome 90 days after ET (modified Rankin Scale = 0–3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred three patients were included. CAPS ≤ 3 patients (87%) had a lower median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS; 12.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 7–22) compared to CAPS &gt; 3 patients (13%; 23, IQR = 19–36; <i>p</i> = 0.01). Reperfusion was achieved in 84% of all patients, with no difference between CAPS groups (<i>p</i> = 0.42). Sixty-four percent of reperfused CAPS ≤ 3 patients had a favorable outcome compared to 8% of nonreperfused CAPS ≤ 3 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 21.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6–170; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No CAPS &gt; 3 patients had a favorable outcome, regardless of reperfusion. In a multivariate regression analysis, CAPS ≤ 3 was a robust independent predictor of favorable outcome after adjustment for reperfusion, age, and pre-ET NIHSS (OR = 39.25, 95% CI = 1.34–&gt;999, <i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion had a favorable response to reperfusion following ET. However, patients with more extensive regions of hypoperfusion in critical brain regions did not benefit from endovascular reperfusion. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Recent single-cell technologies have enabled researchers to simultaneously assess the transcriptomes and other modalities of thousands of cells within their spatial context. Here, we have summarized available single-cell methods for dissociated tissues and tissue slides with respect to the specifics of microglial biology. We have focused on next-generation-based technologies. We review the potential of these single-cell sequencing methods and newer multiomics approaches to extend the understanding of microglia function beyond the status quo.

                Chevée, Finkel et al. show that the activity of neurons in the anterior claustrum recorded during a cross-modal sensory selection task reflects movement rather than sensory input. Premotor activity in individual claustrum neurons was biased for ipsilateral or contralateral movements and encoded upcoming lick direction during intertrial intervals.

                The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) variants of concern (VoCs) include a key mutation (N501Y) found in the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant that enhances affinity of the spike protein for its receptor, ACE2. Additional mutations are found in these variants at residues 417 and 484 that appear to promote antibody evasion. In contrast, the Epsilon variants (B.1.427/429) lack the N501Y mutation, yet exhibit antibody evasion. We have engineered spike proteins to express these RBD VoC mutations either in isolation, or in different combinations, and analyze the effects using biochemical assays and cryo-EM structural analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Simultaneous recording of multiple cellular signaling events by frequency- and spectrally-tuned multiplexing of fluorescent probes</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent probes that change their spectral properties upon binding to small biomolecules, ions, or changes in the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) are invaluable tools to study cellular signaling pathways. Here, we introduce a novel technique for simultaneous recording of multiple probes at millisecond time resolution: <i>frequency- and spectrally-tuned multiplexing</i> (FAST<sup>M</sup>). Different from present multiplexing approaches, FAST<sup>M</sup> uses phase-sensitive signal detection, which renders various combinations of common probes for V<sub>m</sub> and ions accessible for multiplexing. Using kinetic stopped-flow fluorimetry, we show that FAST<sup>M</sup> allows simultaneous recording of rapid changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, pH, Na<sup>+</sup>, and V<sub>m</sub> with high sensitivity and minimal crosstalk. FAST<sup>M</sup> is also suited for multiplexing using single-cell microscopy and genetically-encoded FRET biosensors. Moreover, FAST<sup>M</sup> is compatible with opto-chemical tools to study signaling using light. Finally, we show that the exceptional time resolution of FAST<sup>M</sup> also allows resolving rapid chemical reactions. Altogether, FAST<sup>M</sup> opens new opportunities for interrogating cellular signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CRMP4-mediated fornix development involves semaphorin-3E signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental axonal pathfinding plays a central role in correct brain wiring and subsequent cognitive abilities. Within the growth cone, various intracellular effectors transduce axonal guidance signals by remodeling the cytoskeleton. Semaphorin-3E (Sema3E) is a guidance cue implicated in development of the fornix, a neuronal tract connecting the hippocampus to the hypothalamus. Microtubule-Associated Protein 6 (MAP6) has been shown to be involved in the Sema3E growth-promoting signaling pathway. In this study, we identified the Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 4 (CRMP4) as a MAP6 partner and a crucial effector in Sema3E growth-promoting activity. CRMP4-KO mice displayed abnormal fornix development reminiscent of that observed in Sema3E-KO mice. CRMP4 was shown to interact with the Sema3E tripartite receptor complex within Detergent-<i>Resistant</i> Membrane (DRM) domains, and DRM domain integrity was required to transduce Sema3E signaling through the Akt/GSK3 pathway. Finally, we showed that the cytoskeleton-binding domain of CRMP4 is required for Sema3E's growth-promoting activity, suggesting that CRMP4 plays a role at the interface between Sema3E receptors, located in DRM domains, and the cytoskeleton network. As the fornix is affected in many psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, our results provide new insights to better understand the neurodevelopmental components of these diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Toxoplasma bradyzoites exhibit physiological plasticity of calcium and energy stores controlling motility and egress</a></h4>

              
                <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> has evolved different developmental stages for disseminating during acute infection (i.e. tachyzoites) and for establishing chronic infection (i.e. bradyzoites). Calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling tightly regulates the lytic cycle of tachyzoites by controlling microneme secretion and motility to drive egress and cell invasion. However, the roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in bradyzoites remain largely unexplored. Here we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are highly restricted in bradyzoites and that they fail to egress in response to agonists. Development of dual-reporter parasites revealed dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and minimal microneme secretion by bradyzoites induced in vitro or harvested from infected mice and tested ex vivo. Ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging demonstrated lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> basal levels, reduced magnitude, and slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics in bradyzoites compared with tachyzoites stimulated with agonists. Diminished responses in bradyzoites were associated with down-regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases involved in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acidocalcisomes. Once liberated from cysts by trypsin digestion, bradyzoites incubated in glucose plus Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly restored their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP stores leading to enhanced gliding. Collectively, our findings indicate that intracellular bradyzoites exhibit dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling<sup> </sup>and lower energy levels that restrict egress, and yet upon release they rapidly respond to changes in the environment to regain motility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Working memory capacity of crows and monkeys arises from similar neuronal computations</a></h4>

              
                Complex cognition relies on flexible working memory, which is severely limited in its capacity. The neuronal computations underlying these capacity limits have been extensively studied in humans and in monkeys, resulting in competing theoretical models. We probed the working memory capacity of crows (<i>Corvus corone</i>) in a change detection task, developed for monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), while we performed extracellular recordings of the prefrontal-like area nidopallium caudolaterale. We found that neuronal encoding and maintenance of information were affected by item load, in a way that is virtually identical to results obtained from monkey prefrontal cortex. Contemporary neurophysiological models of working memory employ divisive normalization as an important mechanism that may result in the capacity limitation. As these models are usually conceptualized and tested in an exclusively mammalian context, it remains unclear if they fully capture a general concept of working memory or if they are restricted to the mammalian neocortex. Here we report that carrion crows and macaque monkeys share divisive normalization as a neuronal computation that is in line with mammalian models. This indicates that computational models of working memory developed in the mammalian cortex can also apply to non-cortical associative brain regions of birds.

                The transcription factor activating protein two gamma (AP2γ) is an important regulator of neurogenesis both during embryonic development as well as in the postnatal brain, but its role for neurophysiology and behavior at distinct postnatal periods is still unclear. In this work, we explored the neurogenic, behavioral, and functional impact of a constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deletion in mice from early postnatal development until adulthood. AP2γ deficiency promotes downregulation of hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenesis, altering the ontogeny of emotional and memory behaviors associated with hippocampus formation. The impairments induced by AP2γ constitutive deletion since early development leads to an anxious-like phenotype and memory impairments as early as the juvenile phase. These behavioral impairments either persist from the juvenile phase to adulthood or emerge in adult mice with deficits in behavioral flexibility and object location recognition. Collectively, we observed a progressive and cumulative impact of constitutive AP2γ deficiency on the hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenic process, as well as alterations on limbic-cortical connectivity, together with functional behavioral impairments. The results herein presented demonstrate the modulatory role exerted by the AP2γ transcription factor and the relevance of hippocampal neurogenesis in the development of emotional states and memory processes.

                Despite the small number of gustatory sense neurons, <i>Drosophila</i> larvae are able to sense a wide range of chemicals. Although evidence for taste multimodality has been provided in single neurons, an overview of gustatory responses at the periphery is missing and hereby we explore whole-organ calcium imaging of the external taste center. We find that neurons can be activated by different combinations of taste modalities including of opposite hedonic valence and identify distinct temporal dynamics of response. Although sweet sensing has not been fully characterized so far in the external larval gustatory organ, we recorded responses elicited by sugar. Previous findings established that larval sugar sensing relies on the Gr43a pharyngeal receptor, but the question remains if external neurons contribute to this taste. Here we postulate that external and internal gustation use distinct and complementary mechanisms in sugar sensing and we identify external sucrose sensing neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Striatum-projecting prefrontal cortex neurons support working memory maintenance</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the dorsomedial striatum (dmStr) are linked to working memory (WM) but how striatum-projecting mPFC neurons contribute to WM encoding, maintenance, or retrieval remains unclear. Here, we probed mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr pathway function in freely-moving mice during a T-maze alternation test of spatial WM. Fiber photometry of GCaMP6m-labeled mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr projection neurons revealed strongest activity during the delay period that requires WM maintenance. Demonstrating causality, optogenetic inhibition of mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr neurons only during the delay period impaired performance. Conversely, enhancing mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr pathway activity - via pharmacological suppression of HCN1 or by optogenetic activation during the delay -alleviated WM impairment induced by NMDA receptor blockade. Consistently, cellular-resolution miniscope imaging resolved preferred activation of >50% mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr neurons during WM maintenance. This subpopulation was distinct from neurons showing preference for encoding and retrieval. In all periods, including the delay, neuronal sequences were evident. Striatum-projecting mPFC neurons thus critically contribute to spatial WM maintenance.

                Purpose Simple psychophysical paradigm is available as a digital application in iOS devices such as iPad to measure the function of ON and OFF visual pathways. However, an age-matched normative database is not readily available. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the response of ON and OFF visual pathways as a function of age. Methods 158 normal healthy adults (84 males and 74 females) whose age ranged 18-80 years participated in the study. None of them had any ocular disease (except cataract of grade II or less) and visual acuity of [&le;] 20/25. Monocular testing (only one eye) was performed on the  EyeSpeed application on an iPad at 40cm distance. The targets ranged between 1 to 3 light or dark squares presented randomly in a noise background and participants responded by indicating the number of squares by touching the screen as fast as possible. The main outcome variables are reaction time, accuracy and performance index (1 / speed * accuracy). Results The median reaction time was shorter (Median (IQR): 1.53s (0.49) [dark] Vs 1.76s (0.58) [light], p < 0.001) and accuracy was higher (97.21% (3.30) [dark] Vs 95.15% (5.10) [light], p < 0.001) for dark targets than the light targets. Performance index and reaction time for both target types significantly correlated with age ({rho} = -0.41 to -0.43; p < 0.001). Conclusions This normative database will be useful to quantify disease-specific defects. More importantly, the ON pathway function can potentially serve as a surrogate for rod photoreceptor function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Volumetric assessment and longitudinal changes of brain structures in formalinized Beagle brains</a></h4>

              
                High field MRI represents an advanced technique both for diagnostic and research purposes on animal models such as the Beagle dog. The increasing interest in non-invasive neuroscience, aging, and neuropathological research led to a need of reference values (in terms of volumetric assessment) for the typical brain structures involved and, nowadays, several canine brain MRI atlases have been provided. Since no reports are available regarding the measurements reproducibility and few information are available about formalin fixation effect on brain structures when applied to MRI segmentation, we assessed the segmentation variability of selected structures as a function of the operator (two operators segmented the same data) and their intrinsic variability within a sample of 11 Beagle dogs (9 females and 2 males, 1.6 {+/-} 0.2 years). Then, we analyzed for one further Beagle dog (2 years old) the longitudinal changes in the brain segmentations of these structures corresponding four conditions: in vivo, post mortem (after euthanasia) , ex vivo (brain extracted and studied after 1 month in formalin and after 11 months); all the MRI images were collected with a 3 T MRI scanner. Our findings suggest that the segmentation procedure can be considered overall reproducible since only slight statistical differences were detected, apart from the ventricles. Furthermore, in the post mortem/ ex vivo comparison, the majority of the structures showed a higher contrast leading to more reproducible segmentations across operators and a net increase of volume of the studied structures; this could be justified by the intrinsic relaxation time changes observed as a consequence of formalin fixation, that led to an improvement of brain structures visualization and then segmentation. To conclude, MRI based segmentation seems to be a useful and accurate tool that allows longitudinal studies, especially when applied to formalin fixed brains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LINE-1 activation in the cerebellum drives ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have revealed that dysregulation of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1), a dominant class of transposable elements in the human genome, correlates with neurodegeneration. Yet whether LINE-1 dysregulation is causal to disease pathogenesis has not been proven directly. Here, we demonstrate that expression of evolutionarily younger LINE-1 families is elevated in the cerebella of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients, which was correlated with extensive downregulation of epigenetic silencers. To examine whether LINE-1 activation causes neurologic disease, we established an approach to directly target and activate the promoter of a young family of LINE-1 in mice. LINE-1 activation in the cerebellum was sufficient to lead to robust progressive ataxia. Purkinje cells in the diseased mice exhibited marked electrophysiological dysfunctions and degeneration with a significant accumulation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein LINE-1Orf1p aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and DNA damage. Treatment with lamivudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, blunted the disease progression by reducing DNA damage, attenuating gliosis and interferon gene signature, and recovering the loss of key functional molecules for calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells. This study provides direct evidence that young LINE-1 activation drives ataxia phenotype, and points to its pleiotropic effects leading to DNA damage, inflammation, and dysfunction and degeneration of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anti-inflammatory therapy protects spiral ganglion neurons after aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hair cell loss</a></h4>

              
                Destruction of cochlear hair cells by aminoglycoside antibiotics leads to gradual death of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that relay auditory information to the brain, resulting in progressive deafness. The reason for SGN degeneration, however, is not known. Consequently, there are no neuroprotective strategies for patients. To investigate this problem, we assessed SGN transcriptomic changes following aminoglycoside antibiotic (kanamycin)-induced destruction of hair cells in rats. We observed selectively increased expression of inflammatory response genes and increased abundance of activated macrophages in spiral ganglia by postnatal day 23 in kanamycin-deafened rats, which preceded widespread SGN degeneration. Treatment with the anti-inflammatory medications dexamethasone and ibuprofen diminished long-term SGN degeneration. Ibuprofen and dexamethasone also diminished macrophage activation. Efficacy of ibuprofen treatment was augmented by co-administration of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-stabilizing agent P7C3-A20. Thus, our results support a critical role of neuroinflammation in SGN degeneration after aminoglycoside antibiotic-mediated cochlear hair cell loss, as well as a neuroprotective strategy that could help protect from deafness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneous Super-Resolution and Distortion Correction for Single-shot EPI DWI using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Single-shot echo planer imaging (SS-EPI) is widely used for clinical Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) acquisitions. However, due to the limited bandwidth along the phase encoding direction, the obtained images suffer from distortion and blurring, which limits its clinical value for diagnosis. Here we proposed a deep learning-based image-quality-transfer method with a novel loss function with improved network structure to simultaneously increase the resolution and correct distortions for SS-EPI. We proposed a modified network structure based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). A dense net with gradient map guidance and a multi-level fusion block was employed as the generator to suppress the over-smoothing effect. We also proposed a fractional anisotropy (FA) loss to exploit the intrinsic signal relations in DWI. In-vivo brain DWI data were used to test the proposed method. The results showed that the distortion-corrected high-resolution DWI images with restored anatomical details can be obtained from low-resolution SS-EPI images by taking the advantage of high-resolution anatomical images. Additionally, the proposed FA loss can improve the image quality and quantitative accuracy of diffusion metrics by utilizing the intrinsic relations among different diffusion directions.

                Immune system molecules are expressed by neurons, often for unknown functions. We have identified IL-13 and its receptor IL-13Ra1 as neuronal, synaptic proteins in mouse, rat, and human brains, whose engagement upregulates the phosphorylation of NMDAR and AMPAR subunits and, in turn, increases synaptic activity and CREB-mediated transcription. We demonstrate that increased IL-13 is a hallmark of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice as well as in two distinct cohorts of human patients. We also provide evidence that IL-13 upregulation protects neurons from excitotoxic death. We show IL-13 upregulation occurring in several cohorts of human brain samples and in CSF. Thus, IL-13 is a previously unrecognized physiological modulator of synaptic physiology of neuronal origin, with implications for the establishment of synaptic plasticity and the survival of neurons under injury conditions. Furthermore, we suggest that the neuroprotection afforded through the upregulation of IL-13 represents a new entry point for interventions in the pathophysiology of TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Steroid hormone signaling activates thermal nociception during Drosophila peripheral nervous system development</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons enable animals to detect environmental changes and avoid harm. An intriguing open question concerns how the various attributes of sensory neurons arise in development. Drosophila melanogaster larvae undergo a behavioral transition by robustly activating a thermal nociceptive escape behavior during the second half of larval development (3rd instar). The Class 4 dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons are multimodal sensors which tile the body wall of Drosophila larvae and detect nociceptive temperature, light, and mechanical force. In contrast to the increase in nociceptive behavior in the 3rd instar, we find that ultraviolet light-induced Ca2+ activity in C4da neurons decreases during same period of larval development. Loss of ecdysone receptor has previously been shown to reduce nociception in 3rd instar larvae. We find that ligand dependent activation of ecdysone signaling is sufficient to promote nociceptive responses in 2nd instar larvae and suppress expression of subdued (encoding a TMEM16 channel). Reduction of subdued expression in 2nd instar C4da neurons not only increases thermal nociception but also decreases the response to ultraviolet light. Thus, steroid hormone signaling suppresses subdued expression to facilitate the sensory switch of C4da neurons. This regulation of a developmental sensory switch through steroid hormone regulation of channel expression raises the possibility that ion channel homeostasis is a key target for tuning the development of sensory modalities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Looking from the top: enhanced top-down sensorimotor processing in somatic anxiety</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundFunctional neuroimaging research on anxiety has traditionally focused on brain networks associated with the complex psychological aspects of anxiety. In this study, instead, we target the somatic aspects of anxiety. Motivated by the growing recognition that top-down cortical processing plays crucial roles in perception and action, we investigate effective connectivity among hierarchically organized sensorimotor regions and its association with (trait) anxiety.

MethodsWe selected 164 participants from the Human Connectome Project based on psychometric measures. We used their resting-state functional MRI data and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to assess effective connectivity within and between key regions in the exteroceptive, interoceptive, and motor hierarchy. Using hierarchical modeling of between-subject effects in DCM with Parametric Empirical Bayes we first established the architecture of effective connectivity in sensorimotor networks and investigated its association with fear somatic arousal (FSA) and fear affect (FA) scores. To probe the robustness of our results, we implemented a leave-one-out cross validation analysis.

ResultsAt the group level, the top-down connections in exteroceptive cortices were inhibitory in nature whereas in interoceptive and motor cortices they were excitatory. With increasing FSA scores, the pattern of top-down effective connectivity was enhanced in all three networks: an observation that corroborates well with anxiety phenomenology. Anxiety associated changes in effective connectivity were of effect size sufficiently large to predict whether somebody has mild or severe somatic anxiety. Interestingly, the enhancement in top-down processing in sensorimotor cortices were associated with FSA but not FA scores, thus establishing the (relative) dissociation between somatic and cognitive dimensions of anxiety.

ConclusionsOverall, enhanced top-down effective connectivity in sensorimotor cortices emerges as a promising and quantifiable candidate marker of trait somatic anxiety. These results pave the way for a novel approach into investigating the neural underpinnings of anxiety based on the recognition of anxiety as an embodied phenomenon and the emerging interest in top-down cortical processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spectral distribution dynamics across different attentional priority states</a></h4>

              
                Anticipatory covert spatial attention improves performance on tests of visual detection and discrimination, and shifts are accompanied by decreases and increases of alpha-band power at EEG electrodes corresponding to the attended and unattended location, respectively. Although the increase at the unattended location is often interpreted as an active mechanism (e.g., inhibiting processing at the unattended location), most experiments cannot rule out the alternative possibility that it is a secondary consequence of selection elsewhere. To adjudicate between these accounts, we designed a Posner-style cuing task in which male and female human participants made orientation judgments of targets appearing at one of four locations: up, down, right, or left. Critically, trials were blocked such that within a block the locations along one meridian alternated in status between attended and unattended, and targets never appeared at the other two, making them irrelevant. Analyses of the concurrently measured EEG signal were carried out on traditional narrowband alpha (8-14 Hz), as well as on two components resulting from the decomposition of this signal: periodic alpha; and the slope of the aperiodic 1/f-like component. Although data from right-left blocks replicated the familiar pattern of lateralized asymmetry in narrowband alpha power, with neither alpha signal could we find evidence for any difference in the time course at unattended versus irrelevant locations, an outcome consistent with the secondary-consequence interpretation of attention-related dynamics in the alpha band. Additionally, 1/f slope was lower at attended and unattended locations, relative to irrelevant, suggesting a tonic adjustment of physiological state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory-thresholded switch of neural firing states in a computational model of the ventromedial hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                The mouse ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is both necessary and sufficient for defensive responses to predator and social threats. Defensive behaviors typically involve cautious approach toward potentially threatening stimuli aimed at obtaining information about the risk involved, followed by sudden avoidance and flight behavior to escape harm. In vivo neural recording studies in mice have identified two major populations of VMH neurons that either increase their firing activity as the animal approaches the threat (called Assessment+ cells) or increase their activity as the animal flees the threat (called Flight+ cells). Interestingly, Assessment+ and Flight+ cells abruptly decrease and increase their firing activity, respectively, at the decision point for flight, creating an escape-related 'switch' in functional state. This suggests that the activity of the two cell types in VMH is coordinated and could result from local circuit interactions. Here, we used computational modelling to test if a local inhibitory feedback circuit could give rise to key features of the neural activity seen in VMH during the approach-to-flight transition. Starting from a simple dual-population inhibitory feedback circuit receiving repeated trains of monotonically increasing sensory input to mimic approach to threat, we tested the requirement for balanced sensory input, balanced feedback, short-term synaptic plasticity, rebound excitation, and inhibitory feedback exclusivity to reproduce an abrupt, sensory-thresholded reciprocal firing change that resembles Assessment+ and Flight+ cell activity seen in vivo. Our work demonstrates that a relatively simple local circuit architecture is sufficient for the emergence of firing patterns similar to those seen in vivo and suggests that a reiterative process of experimental and computational work may be a fruitful avenue for better understanding the functional organization of mammalian instinctive behaviors at the circuit level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupillary dynamics of optimal effort</a></h4>

              
                While a substantial body of work has shown that cognitive effort is aversive and costly, a separate line of research on intrinsic motivation suggests that people spontaneously seek challenging tasks. According to one prominent account of intrinsic motivation, the Learning Progress Motivation theory, the preference for difficult tasks reflects the dynamic range that these tasks yield for minimization of performance accuracy prediction errors (Oudeyer, Kaplan & Hafner, 2007). Here we test this hypothesis, by asking whether greater engagement with intermediately difficult tasks, indexed by subjective ratings and objective pupil measurements, is a function of trial-wise changes in performance prediction error. In a novel paradigm, we determined each individuals capacity for task performance and used difficulty levels that are too low, intermediately challenging or high for that individual. We demonstrated that intermediately challenging tasks resulted in greater liking and engagement scores compared with easy tasks. Task-evoked and baseline pupil size tracked objective task difficulty, where challenging tasks were associated with smaller baseline and greater phasic pupil responses than easy tasks. Most importantly, pupil responses were predicted by trial-to-trial changes in expected accuracy, performance prediction error magnitude and changes in prediction errors (learning progress), whereas smaller baseline pupil responses also predicted greater subjective engagement scores. Together, these results suggest that what is underlying the link between task engagement and intermediate tasks might be the dynamic range that these tasks yield for minimization of performance accuracy prediction errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related differences in the neural network dynamics underlying the predictability gain</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension is often challenged by increased background noise, but can be facilitated via the semantic context of a sentence. This predictability gain relies on an interplay of language-specific semantic and domain-general brain regions. However, age-related differences in the interactions within and between semantic and domain-general networks remain poorly understood. Here we investigated commonalities and differences in degraded speech processing in healthy young and old participants. Participants performed a sentence repetition task while listening to sentences with high and low predictable endings and varying intelligibility. Stimulus intelligibility was adjusted to individual hearing abilities. Older adults showed an undiminished behavioural predictability gain. Likewise, both groups recruited a similar set of semantic and cingulo-opercular brain regions. However, we observed age-related differences in effective connectivity for high predictable speech of increasing intelligibility. Young adults exhibited stronger coupling within the cingulo-opercular network and between a cingulo-opercular and a posterior temporal semantic node. Moreover, these interactions were excitatory in young adults but inhibitory in old adults. Finally, the degree of the inhibitory influence between cingulo-opercular regions was predictive of the behavioural sensitivity towards changes in intelligibility for high predictable sentences in older adults only. Our results demonstrate that the predictability gain is relatively preserved in older adults when stimulus intelligibility is individually adjusted. While young and old participants recruit similar brain regions, differences manifest in network dynamics. Together, these results suggest that ageing affects the network configuration rather than regional activity during successful speech comprehension under challenging listening conditions.

                We explore the stability and dynamic properties of a hierarchical, linearized, and analytic spectral graph model for neural oscillations that integrates the structuring wiring of the brain. Previously we have shown that this model can accurately capture the frequency spectra and the spatial patterns of the alpha and beta frequency bands obtained from magnetoencephalography recordings without regionally varying parameters. Here, we show that this macroscopic model based on long-range excitatory connections exhibits dynamic oscillations with a frequency in the alpha band even without any oscillations implemented at the mesoscopic level. We show that depending on the parameters, the model can exhibit combinations of damped oscillations, limit cycles, or unstable oscillations. We determined bounds on model parameters that ensure stability of the oscillations simulated by the model. Finally, we estimated time-varying model parameters to capture the temporal fluctuations in magnetoencephalography activity. We show that a dynamic spectral graph modeling framework with a parsimonious set of biophysically interpretable model parameters can thereby be employed to capture oscillatory fluctuations observed in electrophysiological data in various brain states and diseases.

                Despite numerous studies examining the mechanisms of operant conditioning (OC), the diversity of plasticity loci and their synergism have not been examined sufficiently. In the well-characterized feeding neural circuit of Aplysia, appetitive OC increases neuronal excitability and electrical coupling among several neurons. Here we found OC decreased the intrinsic excitability of B4 and the strength of its inhibitory connection to a key decision-making neuron, B51. The OC-induced changes were specific without affecting the B4-to-B8 inhibitory connection or excitability of another neuron critical for feeding behavior, B8. A conductance-based circuit model indicated certain sites of plasticity mediated the OC phenotype more effectively and that plasticity loci acted synergistically. This synergy was specific in that only certain combinations of loci synergistically enhanced feeding. Taken together, these results suggest modifications of diverse loci work synergistically to mediate OC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contextual control of conditioned pain tolerance and endogenous analgesic systems: Evidence for sex-based differences in endogenous opioid engagement</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain are unclear but may involve the persistence or strengthening of pain memories acquired in part through associative learning. Contextual cues, which comprise the surrounding environment where events occur, were recently described as a critical regulator of pain memory; both rodents and humans exhibit increased pain sensitivity in environments recently associated with a single painful experience. It is unknown, however, how repeated exposure to an acute painful unconditioned stimulus in a distinct context modifies pain sensitivity or the expectation of pain in that environment. To answer this question, we conditioned mice to associate distinct contexts with either repeated administration of a mild visceral pain stimulus (intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid) or vehicle injection over the course of three days. On the final day of experiments animals received either an acid injection or vehicle injection prior to being placed into both contexts. In this way, contextual control of pain sensitivity and pain expectation could be tested respectively. Both male and female mice developed context-dependent conditional pain tolerance, a phenomenon mediated by endogenous opioid signaling. However, when expecting the presentation of a painful stimulus in a given context, males exhibited conditional hypersensitivity whereas females exhibited endogenous opioid-mediated conditional analgesia. Successful determination of the brain circuits involved in this sexually dimorphic anticipatory response may allow for the manipulation of pain memories, which may contribute to the development of chronic pain states.

                The sex of the experimenter may cause stress in animal models and be a major confounding factor in preclinical research. We studied the effects of the sex of the experimenter on female and male rat anxiety behaviours using thigmotaxis in the open field test, anxiety-induced changes in brain and back temperature using infra-red thermography, and alterations in plasma concentrations of stress hormones, corticosterone and oxytocin. Female rats displayed consistently exacerbated anxiety-related behaviours along with increased infrared cutaneous temperature during repeated exposure to male experimenters. Experimental stress further intensified thermal responses to a male experimenter, especially in female rats. These behavioural responses to a male experimenter in females were associated with higher circulating corticosterone and lower oxytocin levels. Similar responses were induced by a T-shirt worn by a human male. These findings suggest that emotional and physiological responses of female rats to a male experimenter are influenced by visual and olfactory cues. These results emphasize the need to standardize and report experimenter sex throughout a study to avoid ambiguity in interpretation of the results.

                When fields lack consensus standards and ground truths for their analytic methods, reproducibility tends to be more of an ideal than a reality. Such has been the case for functional neuroimaging, where there exists a sprawling space of tools from which scientists can construct processing pipelines and draw interpretations. We provide a critical evaluation of the impact of differences observed in results across five independently developed functional MRI minimal preprocessing pipelines. We show that even when handling the same exact data, inter-pipeline agreement was only moderate, with the specific steps that contribute to the lack of agreement varying across pipeline comparisons. Using a densely sampled test-retest dataset, we show that the limitations imposed by inter-pipeline agreement mainly become appreciable when the reliability of the underlying data is high. We highlight the importance of comparison among analytic tools and parameters, as both widely debated (e.g., global signal regression) and commonly overlooked (e.g., MNI template version) decisions were each found to lead to marked variation. We provide recommendations for incorporating tool-based variability in functional neuroimaging analyses and a supporting infrastructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimating muscle activation from EMG using deep learning-based dynamical systems models</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To study the neural control of movement, it is often necessary to estimate how muscles are activated across a variety of behavioral conditions. However, estimating the latent command signal that underlies muscle activation is challenging due to its complex relation with recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals. Common approaches estimate muscle activation independently for each channel or require manual tuning of model hyperparameters to optimally preserve behaviorally-relevant features. Approach: Here, we adapted AutoLFADS, a large-scale, unsupervised deep learning approach originally designed to de-noise cortical spiking data, to estimate muscle activation from multi-muscle EMG signals. AutoLFADS uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the spatial and temporal regularities that underlie multi-muscle activation. Main Results: We first tested AutoLFADS on muscle activity from the rat hindlimb during locomotion, and found that it dynamically adjusts its frequency response characteristics across different phases of behavior. The model produced single-trial estimates of muscle activation that improved prediction of joint kinematics as compared to low-pass or Bayesian filtering. We also tested the generality of the approach by applying AutoLFADS to monkey forearm muscle activity from an isometric task. AutoLFADS uncovered previously uncharacterized high-frequency oscillations in the EMG that enhanced the correlation with measured force compared to low-pass or Bayesian filtering. The AutoLFADS-inferred estimates of muscle activation were also more closely correlated with simultaneously-recorded motor cortical activity than other tested approaches. Significance: Ultimately, this method leverages both dynamical systems modeling and artificial neural networks to provide estimates of muscle activation for multiple muscles that can be used for further studies of multi-muscle coordination and its control by upstream brain areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relationship between high-frequency activity in the sensory and the motor hand areas, and regional myelin content</a></h4>

              
                Background: The human primary sensory (S1) and primary motor (M1) hand areas feature high-frequency neuronal responses. Electrical nerve stimulation evokes high-frequency oscillations (HFO) at around 650 Hz in the contralateral S1. Likewise, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 produces short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) of motor evoked potentials in contralateral hand muscles. SICF features several peaks of facilitation which are separated by inter-peak intervals resembling HFO rhythmicity. Hypothesis: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the individual expressions of HFO and SICF are tightly related to each other and to the regional myelin content in the sensorimotor cortex. Methods: In 24 healthy volunteers, we recorded HFO and SICF, and, in a subgroup of 20 participants, we mapped the cortical myelin content using the ratio between the T1- and T2-weighted MRI signal as read-out. Results: The individual frequencies and magnitudes of HFO and SICF were tightly correlated: the intervals between the first and second peak of cortical HFO and SICF showed a positive linear relationship (r= 0.703, p< 0.001), while their amplitudes were inversely related (r= -0.613, p= 0.001). The rhythmicity, but not the magnitude of the high-frequency responses, was related to the cortical myelin content: the higher the cortical myelin content, the shorter the inter-peak intervals of HFO and SICF. Conclusion: The results confirm a tight functional relationship between high-frequency responses in S1 (i.e., HFO) and M1 (i.e., SICF). They also establish a link between the degree of regional cortical myelination and the expression of high-frequency responses in the human cortex, giving further the opportunity to infer their possible generators.

                Bilateral sensory information is indispensable for navigating the world. In most mammals, signals sensed by either side of the midline will ultimately reach the cortex where they will be integrated for perception and appropriate action selection. Even though information transferred across the hemispheres is routed through the corpus callosum, how and which microcircuits are key in integrating it is not well understood. Here we identify an essential role for layer 1 NDNF+ inhibitory cells of mice in integrating bilateral whisker-evoked information in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner. Direct connections from the contralateral cortex and the ipsilateral side activate NDNF+ neurons, which subsequently inhibit the late spiking activity of underlying layer 2/3 neurons, but not layer 5. Our results identify a feed-forward regulatory pathway for bilateral cortical sensory processing of upper layer cortical neurons actuated via layer 1 NDNF+ interneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex Differences in Affective States and Association with Voluntary Ethanol Intake in Sprague Dawley Rats</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a major problem across the United States. While AUD remains a complex human condition, it is difficult to isolate the directionality of anxiety and ethanol (EtOH) drinking from outside influences. The present study sought to investigate the relationship between affective states and EtOH intake using male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Using complementary tests of anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, we found sex- and test-specific differences in basal affective behavior such that females displayed enhanced anxiety-like behavior in the Splash Test and males displayed enhanced anxiety-like behavior in the Novelty Suppressed Feeding Test. Although there were no sex differences in EtOH intake and no correlation between anxiety-like behavior and subsequent EtOH intake, we did find that depressive-like behavior predicted future EtOH intake in females rats only. In addition, we observed an increase in depressive-like behavior is male rats in both the water and EtOH drinking groups. Furthermore, anxiety-like behavior, but not depressive-like behavior predicted subsequent EtOH intake in female rats. Lastly, we found a history of EtOH intake decreased pain thresholds in male and female rats. Together, these experiments provide important information on the complex interaction between negative affect and alcohol intake and how these two contexts reciprocally do, or do not, influence each other in a sex-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial control of microglial phagocytosis in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Microglial phagocytosis is an energetically demanding process that plays a critical role in the removal of toxic aggregates of beta amyloid (A{beta}) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates that metabolic programming may breakdown in microglia in AD, thereby disrupting this important protective function. The mechanisms coordinating mitochondrial metabolism to fuel phagocytosis in microglia remain poorly understood, however. Here we demonstrate that mitochondrial displacement of the glucose metabolizing enzyme, hexokinase-II (HK) regulates microglial metabolism and phagocytosis, and that deletion of the the translocator protein (TSPO) inhibits this. TSPO is a PET-visible inflammatory biomarker and therapeutic target in AD, previously shown to regulate microglial metabolism via an unknown mechanism. Using RNAseq and proteomic analyses, we found TSPO function in the brain to be linked with the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, lipid metabolism and phagocytosis. In cultured microglia, TSPO deletion induced mitochondrial recruitment of HK, which was associated with a switch to non-oxidative glucose metabolism, reduced mitochondrial energy production, lipid storage and impaired phagocytosis. Impaired phagocytosis was underpinned by reduced actin polymerization, which is highly energetically demanding and critical for initiation of phagocytosis. Consistent with in vitro findings, TSPO expression was also associated with phagocytic microglia in both AD brain and AD mice. Conversely, TSPO deletion in AD mice reduced phagocytic microglia and exacerbated amyloid accumulation. Based on these findings we propose that microglial TSPO functions as an immunometabolic brake via regulation of mitochondrial HK recruitment, preventing hyperglycolysis and promoting phagocytosis in AD. Further, we demonstrate that targeting mitochondrial HK may offer a novel immunotherapeutic approach to promote microglial phagocytosis in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence that LSD microdosing affects recall or the balance between distracter resistance and updating</a></h4>

              
                The effect of low doses (<=20 g) of LSD on working memory, in the absence of altered states of consciousness, remain largely unexplored. Given its possible effects on serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and dopaminergic signalling, it could be hypothesised that LSD microdoses modulate working memory recall. Moreover, in line with computational models, LSD microdoses could exert antagonistic effects on distracter resistance and updating. Here, we tested this hypothesis in a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing three different LSD microdoses (5 g, 10g and 20g) with placebo. After capsule administration, participants performed a modified delay-match-to-sample (DMTS) dopamine-sensitive task. The standard DMTS task was modified to include novel items in the delay period between encoding and probe. These novel items either had to be ignored or updated into working memory. There was no evidence that LSD microdoses affected the accuracy or efficiency of working memory recall and there was no evidence for differential effects on ignoring or updating. Due to the small sample of participants, these results are preliminary and larger studies are required to establish whether LSD microdoses affect short-term recall.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopaminergic challenge dissociates learning from primary versus secondary sources of information</a></h4>

              
                Some theories of human cultural evolution posit that humans have social-specific learning mechanisms that are adaptive specialisations moulded by natural selection to cope with the pressures of group living. However, the existence of neurochemical pathways that are specialised for learning from social information and from individual experience is widely debated. Cognitive neuroscientific studies present mixed evidence for social-specific learning mechanisms: some studies find dissociable neural correlates for social and individual learning whereas others find the same brain areas and, dopamine-mediated, computations involved in both. Here we demonstrate that, like individual learning, social learning is modulated by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol when social information is the primary learning source, but not when it comprises a secondary, additional element. Two groups (total N = 43) completed a decision-making task which required primary learning, from own experience, and secondary learning from an additional source. For one group the primary source was social, and secondary was individual; for the other group this was reversed. Haloperidol affected primary learning irrespective of social/individual nature, with no effect on learning from the secondary source. Thus, we illustrate that neurochemical mechanisms underpinning learning can be dissociated along a primary-secondary but not a social-individual axis. These results resolve conflict in the literature and support an expanding field showing that, rather than being specialised for particular inputs, neurochemical pathways in the human brain can process both social and non-social cues and arbitrate between the two depending upon which cue is primarily relevant for the task at hand.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent in adults. TBI-related functional brain alterations have been linked with common post-TBI neurobehavioral sequelae, with unknown neural substrates. This study examined the systems-level functional brain alterations in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) for visual sustained attention processing, their interactions, and contribution to post-TBI attention deficits. Task-based functional MRI data were collected from 42 adults with TBI and 43 group-matched normal controls (NCs), and analyzed using the graph theoretic technique. Global and nodal topological properties were calculated and compared be-tween the two groups. Correlation analyses were conducted between the neuroimaging measures that showed significant between-group differences and the behavioral symptom measures in attention domain in the groups of TBI and NCs, respectively. Significantly altered nodal efficiency and/or degree in several WM and GM nodes were reported in the TBI group, including the posterior corona radiata (PCR), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), postcentral gyrus (PoG), and superior temporal sulcus (STS). Subjects with TBI also demonstrated abnormal systems-level functional synchronization between the PTR and STS in the right hemisphere, hypo-interaction be-tween PCR and PoG in the left hemisphere; as well as the involvement of systems-level functional aberrances in PCR in TBI-related behavioral impairments in the attention domain. Findings of the current study suggest that TBI-related systems-level functional alterations associated with these two major association WM tracts and their anatomically connected GM regions may play critical role in TBI-related behavioral deficits in attention domain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-dependent changes in murine striatal dopamine release, sleep, and behavior during spontaneous Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol abstinence</a></h4>

              
                Withdrawal symptoms are observed upon cessation of cannabis use in humans. Although animal studies have examined withdrawal symptoms following exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), difficulties in obtaining objective measures of spontaneous withdrawal using paradigms that mimic cessation of use in humans have slowed research. The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) is known to be affected by chronic THC treatment and plays a role in many behaviors related to human THC withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include sleep disturbances that often drive relapse, and emotional behaviors, e.g., irritability and anhedonia. We examined THC withdrawal-induced changes in striatal DA release and the extent to which sleep disruption and behavioral maladaptation manifest during withdrawal in a mouse chronic cannabis exposure model. Using a THC treatment regimen known to produce tolerance we measured electrically elicited DA release in acute brain slices from different striatal subregions during early and late THC abstinence. Long-term polysomnographic recordings from mice were used to assess vigilance state and sleep architecture before, during, and after THC treatment. We additionally assessed how behaviors that model human withdrawal symptoms are altered by chronic THC treatment in early and late abstinence. We detected altered striatal DA release, sleep disturbances that mimic clinical observations, and behavioral maladaptation in mice following tolerance inducing THC treatment. Sex differences were observed in nearly all metrics. Altered striatal DA release, sleep and affect-related behaviors associated with spontaneous THC abstinence were more consistently observed in male mice. To our knowledge these findings provide the first model of directly translatable non-precipitated cannabis withdrawal symptoms, in particular, sleep disruption.

                Oscillations and evoked responses are two types of neuronal activity recorded non-invasively with EEG/MEG. Although typically studied separately, they might in fact represent the same process. One possibility to unite them is to demonstrate that neuronal oscillations have non-zero mean which would indicate that stimulus-relating amplitude modulation of neuronal oscillations should lead to the generation of evoked responses. We validated this mechanism using computational modelling and analysis of a large EEG data set. With a biophysical model generating alpha rhythm, we indeed demonstrated that the oscillatory mean is non-zero for a large range of model-parameter values. In EEG data we detected non-zero mean alpha oscillations in about 96% of the participants. Furthermore, using neuronal-ensemble modelling, we provided an explanation for the often observed discrepancies between amplitude modulation and baseline shifts. Overall, our results provide strong support for the unification of neuronal oscillations and evoked responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging Three-Dimensional Brain Organoid Architecture from Meso- to Nanoscale across Development</a></h4>

              
                Organoids are human stem cell-derived three-dimensional cultures offering a new avenue to model human development and disease. Brain organoids allow studying various aspects of human brain development in the finest details in vitro in a tissue-like context. However, spatial relationships of subcellular structures such as synaptic contacts between distant neurons are hardly accessible by conventional light microscopy. This limitation can be overcome by systems that quickly image the entire organoid in three dimensions and in super-resolution. To that end we have developed a setup combining tissue expansion and light sheet fluorescence microscopy for imaging and quantifying diverse spatial parameters during organoid development. This technique enables zooming from a mesoscopic perspective into super-resolution within a single imaging session, thus revealing cellular and subcellular structural details in three spatial dimensions, including unequivocal delineation of mitotic cleavage planes as well as the alignment of pre- and postsynaptic proteins. We expect light sheet fluorescence expansion microscopy (LSFEM) to facilitate qualitative and quantitative assessment of organoids in developmental and disease-related studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multivariate autoregressive model estimation for high dimensional intracranial electrophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                Fundamental to elucidating the functional organization of the brain is the assessment of causal interactions between different brain regions. Multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) modeling techniques applied to multisite electrophysiological recordings are a promising avenue for identifying such causal links. They estimate the degree to which past activity in one or more brain regions is predictive of another region's present activity, while simultaneously accounting for the mediating effects of other regions. Including in the model as many mediating variables as possible has the benefit of drastically reducing the odds of detecting spurious causal connectivity. However, effective bounds on the number of MVAR model coefficients that can be estimated reliably from limited data make exploiting the potential of MVAR models challenging. Here, we utilize well-established dimensionality-reduction techniques to fit MVAR models to human intracranial data from ~100-200 recording sites spanning dozens of anatomically and functionally distinct cortical regions. First, we show that high dimensional MVAR models can be successfully estimated from long segments of data and yield plausible connectivity profiles. Next, we use these models to generate synthetic data with known ground-truth connectivity to explore the utility of applying principal component analysis and group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to reduce the number of parameters (connections) during model fitting to shorter data segments. We show that group LASSO is highly effective for recovering ground truth connectivity in the limited data regime, capturing important features of connectivity for high-dimensional models with as little as 10 s of data. The methods presented here have broad applicability to the analysis of high-dimensional time series data in neuroscience, facilitating the elucidation of the neural basis of sensation, cognition, and arousal.

	<p>High Intellectual Potential (HIP) and High Functioning Autism (HFA) are two different conditions sharing some clinical and neurobiological features. The aim of the present study was to characterize a sample of HIP children (n: 16; M/F: 14/2; median age: 10 years) in comparison to those with HFA (n: 17; M/F: 16/1; median age: 13 years) and to neurotypically developed (NTD) children (n: 10; M/F: 4/6; median age: 11 years) from a clinical and neurophysiological perspective. Specifically, a standardized clinical assessment of cognitive and adaptive skills, autistic symptoms, executive functions and behavioral features was performed. Moreover, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded, referring specifically to the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 paradigm. Our data highlighted the presence of similarities between the intellectually gifted individuals and the ones with autism (i.e., a nonhomogeneous intellective profile, an adaptive skills impairment, subthreshold autistic symptoms and increased perfectionism). Interestingly, a distinct neurophysiological characterization between groups came out, with evidence of a reduced MMN amplitude only in the HFA group. Furthermore, no differences within groups in the P300 component emerged. Therefore, our results start to provide a more informative characterization of the HIP phenotype in comparison to those of HFA and NTD, highlighting the potential role of the MMN amplitude index in helping clinicians and researchers to distinguish between HIP and HFA. Nevertheless, further research on the topic is strongly needed.</p>
