<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the <em class="a-plus-plus">NOTCH3</em> gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by unstable expanded CAG repeats (expCAGs) in <em class="a-plus-plus">ATXN3</em>. Factors associated with intergenerational instability (delta-expCAG) and genetic anticipation in SCA3 have never been reported in Chinese mainland. Here, we demonstrated that unstable transmissions occurred more often in sons than in daughters (91% vs 72%, Fisher’s exact test, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.012). The extended delta-expCAG of father-son transmissions was greater than that of mother-son transmissions (3.8 ± 2.3 repeats vs 1.6 ± 1.0 repeats, Mann-Whitney <em class="a-plus-plus">U</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001). Genetic anticipation was frequently observed between generations but not affected by the delta-expCAG.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (<em class="a-plus-plus">V</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">m</sub>). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T<sub class="a-plus-plus">1</sub>-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm<sup class="a-plus-plus">3</sup>). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10<sup class="a-plus-plus">−3</sup> was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .63, right: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .76, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .43, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .040) and right SCP (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .37, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a multifactorial disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors. Studies have shown that various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the binding sites of microRNAs contribute to the risk of developing SCZ. We aimed to investigate whether the variants located in the 3′-UTR region of <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> (rs929271T&gt;G) and <em class="a-plus-plus">ATF6B</em> (rs8283G&gt;A) were associated with increased susceptibility to SCZ in a population from the south-east of Iran. In this case-control study, a total of 396 subjects were recruited. SNPs were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotyping results showed that the G allele of rs929271 significantly increased the risk of SCZ (OR = 1.58 95%CI = 1.19–2.10, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001). As for rs929271, the GG genotype of co-dominant (OR = 2.54 95%CI = 1.39–4.64, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.002) and recessive (OR = 2.91 95%CI = 1.77–4.80, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) models were strongly linked to SCZ. No significant differences were observed between rs8283 polymorphism and predisposition to SCZ. In silico analyses predicted that rs929271 might alter the binding sites of microRNAs, which was believed to have an unclear role in the development of SCZ. Moreover, rs929271 polymorphism changed the <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em>-mRNA folding structure. These findings provide fine pieces of evidence regarding the possible effects of <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> polymorphism in the development of SCZ and regulation of the <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> gene targeted by microRNAs.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing gene family. Mutations of <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Although the phenotypes of some patients have been described in single studies, few studies have reviewed the genotype and phenotype relationships using a relatively large cohort of patients with <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations. Herein, we report a new de novo frameshift mutation in <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> (NM_024665.4, c.388_389delAC, p.T130Sfs*14) in a patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To explore the correlations between genotypes and phenotypes for <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> in NDDs, we manually curated and analyzed 38 variants and the associated phenotypes from 50 individuals with NDDs. <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations lead to a wide range of phenotypic defects. We conclude that the most common phenotypes associated with <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations were language and motor developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, facial deformity, hypotonia, and microcephaly. Our study provides a comprehensive spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes caused by <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations, which is important for genetic diagnosis and precision clinical management.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disease that causes acute or chronic hemolytic anemia and potentially leads to severe jaundice in response to oxidative agents. Capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC) is an important gene associated with mental retardation, autosomal dominant 45. Affiliated tissues including skin, brain, bone, and related phenotypes are intellectual disability and seizures. Clinical, biochemical, and whole exome analysis are carried out in a Turkish family. Mutation analysis of G6PD and CIC genes by Sanger sequencing in the whole family was carried out to reveal the effect of these mutations on the patient’s clinical outcome. Here, we present the case of epilepsy in an 8-year-old child with a hemizygous variation in G6PD gene and heterozygous mutation in CIC gene, resulting in focal epileptiform activity and hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalography (EEG), seizures, psychomotor retardation, speech impairment, intellectual disability, developmental regression, and learning difficulties. Whole exome sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of X-linked increased susceptibility for hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency and mental retardation type 45 due to CIC variant, which explained the development of epileptic seizures. Considering CIC variant and relevant relation with the severity and course of the disease, G6PD mutations sustained through the family are defined as hereditary. Our findings could represent the importance of variants found in G6PD as well as CIC genes linked to the severity of epilepsy, which was presumed based on the significant changes in protein configuration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Ketamine is a recreational drug that causes emotional and cognitive impairments, but its specific mechanisms of action are still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that Tau protein phosphorylation and targeted delivery to the postsynaptic area are closely related to its neurotoxicity, and our recent studies have shown that long-term ketamine administration causes excessive Tau protein phosphorylation. However, the regulatory mechanism of Tau protein phosphorylation induced by ketamine has not been clarified. In the present study, we administered a single ketamine injection and long-term (6 months) ketamine injections in C57BL/6 mice, to investigate the effects of different doses of ketamine on the expression levels of Tau protein and its phosphorylation, the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphokinases GSK-3β and CDK5, and the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2B in the mouse hippocampus. Our results showed that both single-dose and long-term ketamine administration induced excessive phosphorylation of the Tau protein at ser202/thr205 and ser396. A single ketamine administration caused an increase in the activity of GSK-3β (at high doses) and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. On the other hand, long-term ketamine administration resulted in an increase in the activities of GSK-3β (at high doses) and CDK5, and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. Our results indicate that GSK-3β, CDK5, and PP2A may be involved in ketamine-induced Tau protein phosphorylation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To understand the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1)-PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) signaling pathway on the cognitive function of sevoflurane-anesthetized aged rats. Aged rats were divided into Normal group, Sevo group (Sevoflurane anesthesia), Sevo + AICAR (the AMPK activator) group, Sevo + EX527 group (the AMPK inhibitor), and Sevo + AICAR + EX527 group. The cognitive function of rats was determined by the Morris water maze. Hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry. ROS, SOD, and MDA levels and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP in the hippocampus were assayed. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial mass, ATP level, and the expression of AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α were determined by the corresponding methods. Rats in the Sevo group manifested significant extension in the escape latency, with fewer platform crossings; and meanwhile, the apoptotic rate, the number of FJC-positive cells, and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP of neurons were elevated, with up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the level of MDA and ROS was increased evidently, with significant down-regulation of SOD activity, ATP, mitochondrial mass and MMP levels, and AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α protein expressions. However, sevoflurane-induced changes above were improved after the administration of AICAR, and EX527 could reverse AICAR-induced improvements in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats. Activating AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α pathway can improve the cognitive function and mitigate the neuronal injury in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats by antagonizing the oxidative stress and maintaining the mitochondrial function.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Sepsis can induce acute and chronic changes in the central nervous system termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Not only cognitive deficits but also anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are common in severe sepsis survivors. In this study, we demonstrated that amitriptyline, a classic tricyclic antidepressant, reduced sepsis-induced brain damage through the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) signaling pathway. Amitriptyline ameliorated neuronal loss assessed by Nissl staining in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)–induced sepsis model. Furthermore, amitriptyline reduced early gliosis assessed by immunofluorescence and late cognitive deficits assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Moreover, amitriptyline treatment attenuated oxidative stress indicated by less superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity consumption and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. Interestingly, those protective effects of amitriptyline could be abolished by GW441756, a TrkA signaling pathway inhibitor. Immunoblot directly showed that TrkA signaling pathway–associated proteins, such as Akt and GSK3β, were involved in the neuroprotective effects of amitriptyline. Thus, amitriptyline appears to be an encouraging candidate to treat cognitive deficits and depression after severe sepsis.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Endothelial dysfunction greatly contributes to microcirculation disorder. The role of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in cerebral microcirculation was explored in vitro. LPS (0.5 or 1 μg/ml) was added to induce injury in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3). CCK-8 was applied to check viabilities of HCMEC/D3 before and after LPS treatment. Western blot witnessed the changes in protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α. Caspase-3/7 activity was analyzed and so were the protein expressions of pro-apoptotic gene BAX and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. mRNA expressions of eNOS and GTPCH1 were evaluated by RT-qPCR. After overexpressing eNOS or GTPCH1 in LPS-induced HCMEC/D3 cells, viabilities, inflammatory cytokines, caspase-3/7 activity, and apoptosis-related genes were detected. The modulation of PGE1 in eNOS and GTPCH1 production, viability, inflammation, and apoptosis was investigated. The inhibitor of eNOS or GTPCH1 was introduced to examine impacts of eNOS or GTPCH1 could have on the PGE1 function. LPS decreased cell viabilities, eNOS and GTPCH1 expression, and promoted inflammation and apoptosis in HCMEC/D3 cells. Overexpressed eNOS or GTPCH1 promoted cell viabilities and suppressed inflammation and apoptosis. PGE1 enhanced viability and decreased inflammation and apoptosis in cells treated by LPS. PGE1 activated eNOS and GTPCH1 and inhibition of eNOS or GTPCH1 led to the attenuation of the protective functions of PGE1 in LPS-induced cells. PGE1 protected HCMEC/D3 cells from injuries induced by LPS by activation of eNOS and GTPCH1, suggesting that PGE1 might be used to help maintain cerebral microcirculation in future.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Oxidative stress is the core problem in improving secondary spinal cord injury (SCI). To investigate the effect of electro-acupuncture with different frequencies on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress injury, as well as related signaling pathways, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were induced using operation for model SCI and then treated with electrical stimulation at low frequency (2 mA, 0.2 Hz), medium frequency (2 mA, 50 Hz), and high frequency (2 mA, 100 Hz), respectively. Here, we first demonstrated that the JNK/p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup> signal pathway promoted ROS generation and inhibited the anti-oxidation effect of FoxO3a to induce oxidative stress damage after SCI and the mechanism of electro-acupuncture in anti-oxidative stress. Electro-acupuncture facilitated functional recovery after SCI and improved the apoptosis of neurons. Furthermore, p38MAPK-mediated microglia activation and inflammatory reaction and JNK/p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup>-mediated ROS generation and oxidative stress damage were both attenuated by electro-acupuncture. However, the inhibitory effect of electro-acupuncture on p38MAPK was enslaved to the acupuncture frequency, but the ROS generation and phosphorylation of p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup> were effectively inhibited by electro-acupuncture. Therefore, the activation of JNK/p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup> promoted the ROS-induced oxidative stress damage after SCI, and inhibiting the phosphorylation of p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup>-mediated oxidative stress was the key target of electro-acupuncture to facilitate functional recovery SCI, but not p38MAPK.</p>

<p>by Sofija V. Canavan, Daniel Margoliash</p>

Birds and mammals share specialized forms of sleep including slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM), raising the question of why and how specialized sleep evolved. Extensive prior studies concluded that avian sleep lacked many features characteristic of mammalian sleep, and therefore that specialized sleep must have evolved independently in birds and mammals. This has been challenged by evidence of more complex sleep in multiple songbird species. To extend this analysis beyond songbirds, we examined a species of parrot, the sister taxon to songbirds. We implanted adult budgerigars (<i>Melopsittacus undulatus)</i> with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes to evaluate sleep architecture, and video monitored birds during sleep. Sleep was scored with manual and automated techniques, including automated detection of slow waves and eye movements. This can help define a new standard for how to score sleep in birds. Budgerigars exhibited consolidated sleep, a pattern also observed in songbirds, and many mammalian species, including humans. We found that REM constituted 26.5% of total sleep, comparable to humans and an order of magnitude greater than previously reported. Although we observed no spindles, we found a clear state of intermediate sleep (IS) similar to non-REM (NREM) stage 2. Across the night, SWS decreased and REM increased, as observed in mammals and songbirds. Slow wave activity (SWA) fluctuated with a 29-min ultradian rhythm, indicating a tendency to move systematically through sleep states as observed in other species with consolidated sleep. These results are at variance with numerous older sleep studies, including for budgerigars. Here, we demonstrated that lighting conditions used in the prior budgerigar study—and commonly used in older bird studies—dramatically disrupted budgerigar sleep structure, explaining the prior results. Thus, it is likely that more complex sleep has been overlooked in a broad range of bird species. The similarities in sleep architecture observed in mammals, songbirds, and now budgerigars, alongside recent work in reptiles and basal birds, provide support for the hypothesis that a common amniote ancestor possessed the precursors that gave rise to REM and SWS at one or more loci in the parallel evolution of sleep in higher vertebrates. We discuss this hypothesis in terms of the common plan of forebrain organization shared by reptiles, birds, and mammals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dCm13lPlwHI" width="1" />

Coordinated development of muscles, tendons, and their attachment sites ensures emergence of functional musculoskeletal units that are adapted to diverse anatomical demands among different species. How these different tissues are patterned and functionally assembled during embryogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the morphogenesis of extraocular muscles (EOMs), an evolutionary conserved cranial muscle group that is crucial for the coordinated movement of the eyeballs and for visual acuity. By means of lineage analysis, we redefined the cellular origins of periocular connective tissues interacting with the EOMs, which do not arise exclusively from neural crest mesenchyme as previously thought. Using 3D imaging approaches, we established an integrative blueprint for the EOM functional unit. By doing so, we identified a developmental time window in which individual EOMs emerge from a unique muscle anlage and establish insertions in the sclera, which sets these muscles apart from classical muscle-to-bone type of insertions. Further, we demonstrate that the eyeballs are a source of diffusible all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) that allow their targeting by the EOMs in a temporal and dose-dependent manner. Using genetically modified mice and inhibitor treatments, we find that endogenous local variations in the concentration of retinoids contribute to the establishment of tendon condensations and attachment sites that precede the initiation of muscle patterning. Collectively, our results highlight how global and site-specific programs are deployed for the assembly of muscle functional units with precise definition of muscle shapes and topographical wiring of their tendon attachments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LuqOh5xOdjk" width="1" />

<p>If spikes are the medium, what is the message? Answering that question is
driving the development of large-scale, single neuron resolution recordings
from behaving animals, on the scale of thousands of neurons. But these data are
inherently high-dimensional, with as many dimensions as neurons - so how do we
make sense of them? For many the answer is to reduce the number of dimensions.
Here I argue we can distinguish weak and strong principles of neural dimension
reduction. The weak principle is that dimension reduction is a convenient tool
for making sense of complex neural data. The strong principle is that dimension
reduction shows us how neural circuits actually operate and compute.
Elucidating these principles is crucial, for which we subscribe to provides
radically different interpretations of the same neural activity data. I show
how we could make either the weak or strong principles appear to be true based
on innocuous looking decisions about how we use dimension reduction on our
data. To counteract these confounds, I outline the experimental evidence for
the strong principle that do not come from dimension reduction; but also show
there are a number of neural phenomena that the strong principle fails to
address. To reconcile these conflicting data, I suggest that the brain has both
principles at play.

<p>Local anaxonic neurons with graded potential release are important
ingredients of nervous systems, present in the olfactory bulb system of
mammalians, in the human visual system, as well as in arthropods and nematodes.
We develop a neuronal network model including both axonic and anaxonic neurons
and monitor the activity tuned by the following parameters: The decay length of
the graded potential in local neurons, the fraction of local neurons, the
largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the range of connections of the
local neurons. Tuning the fraction of local neurons, we derive the phase
diagram including two transition lines: A critical line separating subcritical
and supercritical regions, characterized by power law distributions of
avalanche sizes and durations, and a bifurcation line. We find that the overall
behavior of the system is controlled by a parameter tuning the relevance of
local neuron transmission with respect to the axonal one. The statistical
properties of spontaneous activity are affected by local neurons at large
fractions and in the condition that the graded potential transmission dominates
the axonal one. In this case the scaling properties of spontaneous activity
exhibit continuously varying exponents, rather than the mean field branching
model universality class.

<p>Extracellular electrical potentials (EEP) recorded from the brain are an
active manifestation of all cellular processes that propagate within a volume
of brain tissue. A standard approach for their quantification are power
spectral analyses methods that reflect the global distribution of signal power
over frequency. However, these methods incorporate analysis windows to achieve
locality and therefore, are limited by the inherent trade - off between time
and frequency resolutions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
estimate local power more precisely at a resolution as high as the sampling
frequency. Our methods are well grounded on established neurophysiology of the
bio-signals where we model EEPs as comprising of two components:
neuromodulations and background activity. A local measure of power, we call
Marked Point Process (MPP) spectrogram, is then derived as a power - weighted
intensity function of the point process for neuromodulations. We demonstrate
our results on two datasets: 1) local field potentials recorded from the
prefrontal cortex of 3 rats performing a working memory task and 2) EEPs
recorded via electroencephalography from the visual cortex of human subjects
performing a conditioned stimulus task. A detailed analysis of the power -
specific marked features of neuromodulations confirm high correlation between
power spectral density and power in neuromodulations establishing the aptness
of MPP spectrogram as a finer measure of power where it is able to track local
variations in power while preserving the global structure of signal power
distribution.

<p>Traditional linear subspace reduced order models (LS-ROMs) are able to
accelerate physical simulations, in which the intrinsic solution space falls
into a subspace with a small dimension, i.e., the solution space has a small
Kolmogorov n-width. However, for physical phenomena not of this type, such as
advection-dominated flow phenomena, a low-dimensional linear subspace poorly
approximates the solution. To address cases such as these, we have developed an
efficient nonlinear manifold ROM (NM-ROM), which can better approximate
high-fidelity model solutions with a smaller latent space dimension than the
LS-ROMs. Our method takes advantage of the existing numerical methods that are
used to solve the corresponding full order models (FOMs). The efficiency is
achieved by developing a hyper-reduction technique in the context of the
NM-ROM. Numerical results show that neural networks can learn a more efficient
latent space representation on advection-dominated data from 2D Burgers'
equations with a high Reynolds number. A speed-up of up to 11.7 for 2D Burgers'
equations is achieved with an appropriate treatment of the nonlinear terms
through a hyper-reduction technique.

<p>This paper presents the 'hyper-sinh', a variation of the m-arcsinh activation
function suitable for Deep Learning (DL)-based algorithms for supervised
learning, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). hyper-sinh, developed in
the open source Python libraries TensorFlow and Keras, is thus described and
validated as an accurate and reliable activation function for both shallow and
deep neural networks. Improvements in accuracy and reliability in image and
text classification tasks on five (N = 5) benchmark data sets available from
Keras are discussed. Experimental results demonstrate the overall competitive
classification performance of both shallow and deep neural networks, obtained
via this novel function. This function is evaluated with respect to gold
standard activation functions, demonstrating its overall competitive accuracy
and reliability for both image and text classification.

<p>This paper identifies connections between predictive coding, from theoretical
neuroscience, and variational autoencoders, from machine learning. These
connections imply striking correspondences for biological neural circuits,
suggesting that pyramidal dendrites are functionally analogous to non-linear
deep networks and lateral inhibition is functionally analogous to normalizing
flows. Connecting these areas provides new directions for further

method, GENNI, allows us to efficiently identify parameters that are
functionally equivalent and then visualise the subspace of the resulting
equivalence class. By doing so, we are now able to better explore questions
surrounding identifiability, with applications to optimisation and
generalizability, for commonly used or newly developed neural network
architectures.

<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), inspired by biological visual cortex
systems, are a powerful category of artificial neural networks that can extract
the hierarchical features of raw data to greatly reduce the network parametric
complexity and enhance the predicting accuracy. They are of significant
interest for machine learning tasks such as computer vision, speech
recognition, playing board games and medical diagnosis. Optical neural networks
offer the promise of dramatically accelerating computing speed to overcome the
inherent bandwidth bottleneck of electronics. Here, we demonstrate a universal
optical vector convolutional accelerator operating beyond 10 TeraFLOPS
(floating point operations per second), generating convolutions of images of
250,000 pixels with 8 bit resolution for 10 kernels simultaneously, enough for
facial image recognition. We then use the same hardware to sequentially form a
deep optical CNN with ten output neurons, achieving successful recognition of
full 10 digits with 900 pixel handwritten digit images with 88% accuracy. Our
results are based on simultaneously interleaving temporal, wavelength and
spatial dimensions enabled by an integrated microcomb source. This approach is
scalable and trainable to much more complex networks for demanding applications
such as unmanned vehicle and real-time video recognition.

<p>Ionic models, the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing
the time evolution of the state of excitable cells, are the cornerstone of
modeling in neuro- and cardiac electrophysiology. Modern ionic models can have
tens of state variables and hundreds of tunable parameters. Fitting ionic
models to experimental data, which usually covers only a limited subset of
state variables, remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we describe a
recurrent neural network architecture designed specifically to encode ionic
models. The core of the model is a Gating Neural Network (GNN) layer, capturing
the dynamics of classic (Hodgkin-Huxley) gating variables. The network is
trained in two steps: first, it learns the theoretical model coded in a set of
ODEs, and second, it is retrained on experimental data. The retrained network
is interpretable, such that its results can be incorporated back into the model
ODEs. We tested the GNN networks using simulated ventricular action potential
signals and showed that it could deduce physiologically-feasible alterations of
ionic currents. Such domain-specific neural networks can be employed in the
exploratory phase of data assimilation before further fine-tuning using
standard optimization techniques.

<p>We propose a hierarchical Bayesian recurrent state space model for modeling

to uncover shared network patterns across disease conditions. We evaluate our
method on the ADNI2 dataset by inferring latent state patterns corresponding to
altered neural circuits in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In
addition to states shared across healthy and individuals with MCI, we discover
latent states that are predominantly observed in individuals with MCI. Our

<p>Many networks in the brain are sparsely connected, and the brain eliminates
synapses during development and learning. How could the brain decide which
synapses to prune? In a recurrent network, determining the importance of a
synapse between two neurons is a difficult computational problem, depending on
the role that both neurons play and on all possible pathways of information
flow between them. Noise is ubiquitous in neural systems, and often considered
an irritant to be overcome. Here we suggest that noise could play a functional
role in synaptic pruning, allowing the brain to probe network structure and
determine which synapses are redundant. We construct a simple, local,
unsupervised plasticity rule that either strengthens or prunes synapses using
only synaptic weight and the noise-driven covariance of the neighboring
neurons. For a subset of linear and rectified-linear networks, we prove that
this rule preserves the spectrum of the original matrix and hence preserves
network dynamics even when the fraction of pruned synapses asymptotically
approaches 1. The plasticity rule is biologically-plausible and may suggest a
new role for noise in neural computation.

<p>Efficient gradient computation of the Jacobian determinant term is a core
problem of the normalizing flow framework. Thus, most proposed flow models
either restrict to a function class with easy evaluation of the Jacobian
determinant, or an efficient estimator thereof. However, these restrictions
limit the performance of such density models, frequently requiring significant
depth to reach desired performance levels. In this work, we propose Self
Normalizing Flows, a flexible framework for training normalizing flows by
replacing expensive terms in the gradient by learned approximate inverses at
each layer. This reduces the computational complexity of each layer's exact
update from $\mathcal{O}(D^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(D^2)$, allowing for the training
of flow architectures which were otherwise computationally infeasible, while
also providing efficient sampling. We show experimentally that such models are
remarkably stable and optimize to similar data likelihood values as their exact
gradient counterparts, while surpassing the performance of their functionally
constrained counterparts.

<p>We develop Neuron Shapley as a new framework to quantify the contribution of
individual neurons to the prediction and performance of a deep network. By
accounting for interactions across neurons, Neuron Shapley is more effective in
identifying important filters compared to common approaches based on activation
patterns. Interestingly, removing just 30 filters with the highest Shapley
scores effectively destroys the prediction accuracy of Inception-v3 on
ImageNet. Visualization of these few critical filters provides insights into
how the network functions. Neuron Shapley is a flexible framework and can be
applied to identify responsible neurons in many tasks. We illustrate additional
applications of identifying filters that are responsible for biased prediction
in facial recognition and filters that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
Removing these filters is a quick way to repair models. Enabling all these
applications is a new multi-arm bandit algorithm that we developed to
efficiently estimate Neuron Shapley values.

<p>The study of neuronal interactions is currently at the center of several big
collaborative neuroscience projects (including the Human Connectome Project,
the Blue Brain Project, the Brainome, etc.) which attempt to obtain a detailed
map of the entire brain. Under certain constraints, mathematical theory can
advance predictions of the expected neural dynamics based solely on the
statistical properties of the synaptic interaction matrix. This work explores
the application of free random variables to the study of large synaptic
interaction matrices. Besides recovering in a straightforward way known results
on eigenspectra in types of models of neural networks proposed by Rajan and
Abbott, we extend them to heavy-tailed distributions of interactions. More
importantly, we derive analytically the behavior of eigenvector overlaps, which
determine the stability of the spectra. We observe that upon imposing the
neuronal excitation/inhibition balance, despite the eigenvalues remaining
unchanged, their stability dramatically decreases due to the strong
non-orthogonality of associated eigenvectors. It leads us to the conclusion
that the understanding of the temporal evolution of asymmetric neural networks
requires considering the entangled dynamics of both eigenvectors and
eigenvalues, which might bear consequences for learning and memory processes in
these models. Considering the success of free random variables theory in a wide
variety of disciplines, we hope that the results presented here foster the
additional application of these ideas in the area of brain sciences.

<p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 17 November 2020; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-020-00392-x">doi:10.1038/s41583-020-00392-x</a></p>The cerebellum has an established role in procedural learning; however, the mechanisms through which it mediates learning are less well understood. De Zeeuw describes evidence for the existence of ‘upbound’ and ‘downbound’ microzones of cerebellar Purkinje cells and considers how they contribute to different forms of cerebellar learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/-P2ug5LUIyw" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.596200">Future Portrait of the Athletic Brain: Mechanistic Understanding of Human Sport Performance Via Animal Neurophysiology of Motor Behavior</a></h4>

<p>Sport performances are often showcases of skilled motor control. Efforts to understand the neural processes subserving such movements may teach us about general principles of behavior, similarly to how studies on neurological patients have guided early work in cognitive neuroscience. While investigations on non-human animal models offer valuable information on the neural dynamics of skilled motor control that is still difficult to obtain from humans, sport sciences have paid relatively little attention to these mechanisms. Similarly, knowledge emerging from the study of sport performance could inspire innovative experiments in animal neurophysiology, but the latter has been only partially applied. Here, we advocate that fostering interactions between these two seemingly distant fields, i.e., animal neurophysiology and sport sciences, may lead to mutual benefits. For instance, recording and manipulating the activity from neurons of behaving animals offer a unique viewpoint on the computations for motor control, with potentially untapped relevance for motor skills development in athletes. To stimulate such transdisciplinary dialog, in the present article, we also discuss steps for the reverse translation of sport sciences findings to animal models and the evaluation of comparability between animal models of a given sport and athletes. In the final section of the article, we envision that some approaches developed for animal neurophysiology could translate to sport sciences anytime soon (e.g., advanced tracking methods) or in the future (e.g., novel brain stimulation techniques) and could be used to monitor and manipulate motor skills, with implications for human performance extending well beyond sport.</p>

<p>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a blinding aberrancy of retinal vascular maturation in preterm infants. Despite delayed onset after preterm birth, representing a window for therapeutic intervention, we cannot prevent or cure ROP blindness. A natural form of ROP protection exists in the setting of early-onset maternal preeclampsia, though is not well characterized. As ischemia is a central feature in both ROP and preeclampsia, we hypothesized that angiogenesis mediators may underlie this protection. To test our hypothesis we analyzed peripheral blood expression of candidate proteins with suggested roles in preeclamptic and ROP pathophysiology and with a proposed angiogenesis function (HTRA-1, IGF-1, TGFβ-1, and VEGF-A). Analysis in a discovery cohort of 40 maternal-infant pairs found that elevated HTRA-1 (high-temperature requirement-A serine peptidase-1) was significantly associated with increased risk of ROP and the absence of preeclampsia, thus fitting a model of preeclampsia-mediated ROP protection. We validated these findings and further demonstrated a dose-response between systemic infant HTRA-1 expression and risk for ROP development in a larger and more diverse validation cohort consisting of preterm infants recruited from two institutions. Functional analysis in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) murine model of ROP supported our systemic human findings at the local tissue level, demonstrating that HtrA-1 expression is elevated in both the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium by RT-PCR in the ROP disease state. Finally, transgenic mice over-expressing HtrA-1 demonstrate greater ROP disease severity in this model. Thus, HTRA-1 may underlie ROP protection in preeclampsia and represent an avenue for disease prevention, which does not currently exist.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and a common form of dementia that affects cognition and memory mostly in aged people. AD pathology is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) senile plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau, resulting in cell damage and neurodegeneration. The extracellular deposition of Aβ is regarded as an important pathological marker and a principal-agent of neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanism of Aβ-mediated pathogenesis is not fully understood yet. Recently, a growing body of evidence provides novel insights on the major role of microglia and its non-cell-autonomous cycling of Aβ toxicity. Hence, this article provides a comprehensive overview of microglia as a significant player in uncovering the underlying disease mechanisms of AD.</p>

<p>Negative attentional bias has been well established in depression. However, there is very limited knowledge about whether this depression-relevant negative bias exits during initial attentional allocation, as compared with the converging evidence for the negative bias during sustained attention engagement. This study used both behavioral and electrophysiological measures to examine the initial attention engagement in depressed patients influenced by mood-congruent and mood-incongruent emotions. The dot-probe task was performed with a 100-ms exposure time of the emotional cues (emotional and neutral face pairs). The behavioral results showed that the patients responded faster following valid compared with invalid sad facial cues. Electrophysiological indexes in the frame of the two-stage model of attentional modulation by emotions provided cognitive mechanisms in distinct attention engagement stages: (1) the patients exhibited reduced P1 amplitudes following validly than invalidly happy cues than did the healthy controls, indicating a positive attenuation at an early stage of automatic attention orientation; and (2) the patients exhibited enhanced whereas the controls showed reduced P3 amplitudes following validly than invalidly sad cues, suggesting a mood-congruent negative potentiation in depression at the later stage of top-down voluntary control of attention. Depressed patients show a negative bias in early attentional allocation, reflected by preferred engagement with mood-congruent and diminished engagement with positive emotional cues/stimuli.</p>

<p>Purpose: To investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) differences in patients with left- and right-sided pulsatile tinnitus (LPT and RPT) and healthy controls (HCs) to further explore the lateralization effects of PT using arterial spin labeling (ASL).</p><p>Methods: ASL data from 21 RPT patients, 17 LPT patients and 21 HCs were reviewed. Voxel-wise analysis and region of interest analysis were performed to explore differences in CBF among the three groups. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score and tinnitus duration were obtained from each patient.</p><p>Results: Voxel-wise analysis showed that the CBF of the left inferior parietal gyrus was increased in both RPT and LPT patients compared with HCs (P &lt; 0.001). Region of interest analysis revealed that the CBF of the left primary auditory cortex (PAC) was higher than that of the right, while the CBF of the right secondary auditory cortex (SAC) and auditory association cortex was higher than that of the left. These lateralization effects were present in all three groups. Compared with HCs, RPT patients showed increased CBF in the left PAC and SAC (PAC: P = 0.036; SAC: P = 0.012). No significant correlations were found between PT duration or THI score and altered CBF in above regions.</p><p>Conclusion: Increased CBF in the left inferior parietal gyrus is a common feature in both RPT and LPT patients, regardless of the perceived side of PT. The lateralization effects of auditory cortices may be a physiological characteristic of the normal brain. These findings may provide a new perspective for understanding the neurological pathophysiology of PT.</p>

<p>Stress-related psychosomatic responses are viewed as important risks to our physical health. Growing evidence from structural imaging studies has implicated that stress and trauma exposures have negative effects on brain structural alterations. However, whether stress-related emotional distress and somatic symptoms are related to the structure of brain systems remains unclear. Also, stress-related somatic symptoms have adverse effects on emotional distress. In turn, emotional distress may influence somatic symptom reports via negative cognitive bias. However, whether this relationship is mediated by specific brain morphology remains poorly understood. First, we used voxel-based morphometric approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical basis underlying somatic symptoms and emotional distress in a large sample of healthy subjects (ages 18–27 years). We found that relatively high stress-related somatic symptoms were associated with reduced gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior insula, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Furthermore, a moderator analysis was performed to investigate the impact of recent stressful life events (moderators) on the association between specific GMVs (independent variables) and emotional distress (dependent variables). Interestingly, high levels of emotional distress were associated with small volumes of the vmPFC, anterior insula, hippocampus, and amygdala in participants with experience with more recent stressful life events. Finally, we performed mediation analyses to investigate the specific brain areas that mediate the association between emotional distress and somatic symptoms. The results showed that the effect of emotional distress on somatic symptoms is mediated by reductions in the volume of the hippocampus, the impact of somatic symptoms on emotional distress is mediated by the volume of the vmPFC. These results provided evidence that higher stress-related somatic symptoms are associated with smaller volume in prefrontal, insula, and limbic regions involved in emotion, interoception, and memory processing. The vmPFC and hippocampus play different roles in the relationship between emotional distress and somatic symptoms.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no current cure. ALS causes degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons leading to atrophy of the innervating muscles and progressive paralysis. The exact mechanism of the pathology of ALS is unknown. However, 147 genes have been identified that are causative, associated with, or modify disease progression. While the causative mechanism is unknown, a number of pathological processes have been associated with ALS. These include mitochondrial dysfunction, protein accumulation, and defects in RNA metabolism. RNA metabolism is a complicated process that is regulated by many different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). A small defect in RNA metabolism can produce results as dramatic as determining cell survival. Stress granules (SGs) control RNA translation during stressed conditions. This is a protective reaction, but in conditions of chronic stress can become pathogenic. SGs are even hypothesized to act as a seeding mechanism for the pathological aggregation of proteins seen in many neurodegenerative diseases, including TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in ALS. In this review, we will be summarizing the current findings of SG pathology in ALS. We also focus on the role of SG dysregulation in protein aggregate formation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, we outline therapeutic strategies that target SG components in ALS.</p>

<p>Rodents engage in active touch using their facial whiskers: they explore their environment by making rapid back-and-forth movements. The fast nature of whisker movements, during which whiskers often cross each other, makes it notoriously difficult to track individual whiskers of the intact whisker field. We present here a novel algorithm, WhiskEras, for tracking of whisker movements in high-speed videos of untrimmed mice, without requiring labeled data. WhiskEras consists of a pipeline of image-processing steps: first, the points that form the whisker centerlines are detected with sub-pixel accuracy. Then, these points are clustered in order to distinguish individual whiskers. Subsequently, the whiskers are parameterized so that a single whisker can be described by four parameters. The last step consists of tracking individual whiskers over time. We describe that WhiskEras performs better than other whisker-tracking algorithms on several metrics. On our four video segments, WhiskEras detected more whiskers per frame than the Biotact Whisker Tracking Tool. The signal-to-noise ratio of the output of WhiskEras was higher than that of Janelia Whisk. As a result, the correlation between reflexive whisker movements and cerebellar Purkinje cell activity appeared to be stronger than previously found using other tracking algorithms. We conclude that WhiskEras facilitates the study of sensorimotor integration by markedly improving the accuracy of whisker tracking in untrimmed mice.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.572434">Regenerative Effect of a ROCK Inhibitor, Y-27632, on Excitotoxic Trauma in an Organotypic Culture of the Cochlea</a></h4>

<p>In the past, most inner ear diseases were thought to start with the impairment of the sensory epithelium of the cochlea before subsequently progressing to secondary neural degeneration. However, recent studies show that loss of primary synapses accompanied by excitotoxic degeneration of peripheral axons is likely to be the underlying pathology in sensorineural hearing loss. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition has been reported to have neuroprotective and regenerative effects on synaptic pathways. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of ROCK inhibition using Y-27632 in a model of peripheral axonal damage in the spiral ganglion neurons created using the glutamate agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid, to induce excitotoxic trauma in the explanted cochlea. The number of axons projecting to hair cells in the cochlea treated with Y-27632 was significantly greater than those in the cochlea treated only with NMDA + kainic acid. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in synapses between the spiral ganglion and the inner hair cells in the cochlea treated with Y-27632. The findings of this study suggest that ROCK inhibition could be a potential strategy for the regeneration of peripheral axons in the spiral ganglion and synapse formation in the inner hair cells of a cochlea that has sustained excitotoxic injury, which is one of the primary etiologies of inner ear disease.</p>

<p>TLR3 provides immediate type I IFN response following entry of stimulatory PAMPs into the CNS, as it is in HSV infection. The receptor plays a vital role in astrocytes, contributing to rapid infection sensing and suppression of viral replication, precluding the spread of virus beyond neurons. The route of TLR3 mobilization culminating in the receptor activation remains unexplained. In this research, we investigated the involvement of various types of endosomes in the regulation of the TLR3 mobility in C8-D1A murine astrocyte cell line. TLR3 was transported rapidly to early EEA1-positive endosomes as well as LAMP1-lysosomes following stimulation with the poly(I:C). Later, TLR3 largely associated with late Rab7-positive endosomes. Twenty-four hours after stimulation, TLR3 co-localized with LAMP1 abundantly in lysosomes of astrocytes. TLR3 interacted with poly(I:C) intracellularly from 1 min to 8 h following cell stimulation. We detected TLR3 on the surface of astrocytes indicating constitutive expression, which increased after poly(I:C) stimulation. Our findings contribute to the understanding of cellular modulation of TLR3 trafficking. Detailed analysis of the TLR3 transportation pathway is an important component in disclosing the fate of the receptor in HSV-infected CNS and may help in the search for rationale therapeutics to control the replication of neuropathic viruses.</p>

<p>Research is increasingly focusing on gut inflammation as a contributor to Parkinson's disease (PD). Such gut inflammation is proposed to arise from a complex interaction between various genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, however these factors are under-characterized. This study investigated the association between PD and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes responsible for binding of bacterial metabolites and intestinal homeostasis, which have been implicated in intestinal infections or inflammatory bowel disease. A case-control analysis was performed utilizing the following cohorts: (i) patients from the Australian Parkinson's Disease Registry (APDR) (n = 212); (ii) a Caucasian subset of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort (n = 376); (iii) a combined control group (n = 404). The following SNPs were analyzed: PGLYRP2 rs892145, PGLYRP4 rs10888557, TLR1 rs4833095, TLR2 rs3804099, TLR4 rs7873784, CD14 rs2569190, MUC1 rs4072037, MUC2 rs11825977, CLDN2 rs12008279 and rs12014762, and CLDN4 rs8629. PD risk was significantly associated with PGLYRP4 rs10888557 genotype in both cohorts. PGLYRP2 rs892145 and TLR1 rs4833095 were also associated with disease risk in the APDR cohort, and TLR2 rs3804099 and MUC2 rs11825977 genotypes in the PPMI cohort. Interactive risk effects between PGLYRP2/PGLYRP4 and PGLYRP4/TLR2 were evident in the APDR and PPMI cohorts, respectively. In the APDR cohort, the PGLYRP4 GC genotype was significantly associated with age of symptom onset, independently of gender, toxin exposure or smoking status. This study demonstrates that genetic variation in the bacterial receptor PGLYRP4 may modulate risk and age-of-onset in idiopathic PD, while variants in PGLYRP2, TLR1/2, and MUC2 may also influence PD risk. Overall, this study provides evidence to support the role of dysregulated host-microbiome signaling and gut inflammation in PD, and further investigation of these SNPs and proteins may help identify people at risk of developing PD or increase understanding of early disease mechanisms.</p>

<p>Background: The demand for effective strategies for maintaining cognitive capableness and establishing early dementia diagnosis has been tremendous, especially in the context of population aging. However, studies on the elderly population and neurocognitive impairment had provided ambiguous results throughout, while potential blood biomarkers of cognitive decline are yet to be clearly understood.</p><p>Objectives: The present study is aimed at assessing the relationship between blood lipids—especially in the context of their usefulness as biomarkers of an early cognitive decline—and cognitive functioning of aging adults.</p><p>Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of 230 participants—(109 women, 121 men) aged 65+ years. Plasma 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol [24(S)-OHC], serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) were assessed. The analyses were conducted in three groups of cognitive performance: cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild dementia, of which the subjects were divided with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).</p><p>Results: No significant differences in 24(S)-OHC plasma concentrations for different levels of cognitive performance were found. Significant differences were found in serum TC (p = 0.026) and LDL (p = 0.007) concentrations for different levels of cognitive performance. Concentrations of both parameters were highest in the MCI group and lowest in mild dementia and cognitive norm, respectively. No significant differences between serum HDL concentrations and cognitive performance were found.</p><p>Conclusions: To fully assess the potential of research on blood lipids in regards to a cognitive decline, cross-sectional or epidemiological studies aimed at further exploring blood lipid roles in both the early and advanced MCI and dementia, are needed.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63170">Sexual dimorphism in trait variability and its eco-evolutionary and statistical implications</a></h4>

Biomedical and clinical sciences are experiencing a renewed interest in the fact that males and females differ in many anatomic, physiological, and behavioral traits. Sex differences in trait variability, however, are yet to receive similar recognition. In medical science, mammalian females are assumed to have higher trait variability due to estrous cycles (the 'estrus-mediated variability hypothesis'); historically in biomedical research, females have been excluded for this reason. Contrastingly, evolutionary theory and associated data support the 'greater male variability hypothesis'. Here, we test these competing hypotheses in 218 traits measured in &gt;26,900 mice, using meta-analysis methods. Neither hypothesis could universally explain patterns in trait variability. Sex-bias in variability was trait-dependent. While greater male variability was found in morphological traits, females were much more variable in immunological traits. Sex-specific variability has eco-evolutionary ramifications including sex-dependent responses to climate change, as well as statistical implications including power analysis considering sex difference in variance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61548">Demographic history mediates the effect of stratification on polygenic scores</a></h4>

Population stratification continues to bias the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). When these results are used to construct polygenic scores, even subtle biases can cumulatively lead to large errors. To study the effect of residual stratification, we simulated GWAS under realistic models of demographic history. We show that when population structure is recent, it cannot be corrected using principal components of common variants because they are uninformative about recent history. Consequently, polygenic scores are biased in that they recapitulate environmental structure. Principal components calculated from rare variants or identity-by-descent segments can correct this stratification for some types of environmental effects. While family-based studies are immune to stratification, the hybrid approach of ascertaining variants in GWAS but re-estimating effect sizes in siblings reduces but does not eliminate stratification. We show that the effect of population stratification depends not only on allele frequencies and environmental structure but also on demographic history.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61171">SMC5/6 is required for replication fork stability and faithful chromosome segregation during neurogenesis</a></h4>

Mutations of SMC5/6 components cause developmental defects, including primary microcephaly. To model neurodevelopmental defects, we engineered a mouse wherein <i>Smc5</i> is conditionally knocked out (cKO) in the developing neocortex. <i>Smc5</i> cKO mice exhibited neurodevelopmental defects due to neural progenitor cell (NPC) apoptosis, which led to reduction in cortical layer neurons. <i>Smc5</i> cKO NPCs formed DNA bridges during mitosis and underwent chromosome missegregation. SMC5/6 depletion triggers a CHEK2-p53 DNA damage response, as concomitant deletion of the <i>Trp53</i> tumor suppressor or <i>Chek2</i> DNA damage checkpoint kinase rescued <i>Smc5</i> cKO neurodevelopmental defects. Further assessment using <i>Smc5</i> cKO and auxin-inducible degron systems demonstrated that absence of SMC5/6 leads to DNA replication stress at late-replicating regions such as pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. In summary, SMC5/6 is important for completion of DNA replication prior to entering mitosis, which ensures accurate chromosome segregation. Thus, SMC5/6 functions are critical in highly proliferative stem cells during organism development.

Second-generation antipsychotics are widely used to medicate patients with schizophrenia, but may cause metabolic side effects such as diabetes, which has been considered to result from obesity-associated insulin resistance. Olanzapine is particularly well known for this effect. However, clinical studies have suggested that olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia in certain patients cannot be explained by such a generalized mechanism. Here, we focused on the effects of olanzapine on insulin biosynthesis and secretion by mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells. Olanzapine reduced maturation of proinsulin, and thereby inhibited secretion of insulin; and specifically shifted the primary localization of proinsulin from insulin granules to the endoplasmic reticulum. This was due to olanzapine’s impairment of proper disulfide bond formation in proinsulin, although direct targets of olanzapine remain undetermined. Olanzapine-induced proinsulin misfolding and subsequent decrease also occurred at the mouse level. This mechanism of olanzapine-induced β-cell dysfunction should be considered, together with weight gain, when patients are administered olanzapine.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60705">Visual attention modulates the integration of goal-relevant evidence and not value</a></h4>

When choosing between options, such as food items presented in plain view, people tend to choose the option they spend longer looking at. The prevailing interpretation is that visual attention increases value. However, in previous studies, 'value' was coupled to a behavioural goal, since subjects had to choose the item they preferred. This makes it impossible to discern if visual attention has an effect on value, or, instead, if attention modulates the information most relevant for the goal of the decision-maker. Here we present the results of two independent studies—a perceptual and a value-based task—that allow us to decouple value from goal-relevant information using specific task-framing. Combining psychophysics with computational modelling, we show that, contrary to the current interpretation, attention does not boost value, but instead it modulates goal-relevant information. This work provides a novel and more general mechanism by which attention interacts with choice.

Paired fins are a defining feature of the jawed vertebrate body plan, but their evolutionary origin remains unresolved. Gegenbaur proposed that paired fins evolved as gill arch serial homologues, but this hypothesis is now widely discounted, owing largely to the presumed distinct embryonic origins of these structures from mesoderm and neural crest, respectively. Here, we use cell lineage tracing to test the embryonic origin of the pharyngeal and paired fin skeleton in the skate (<i>Leucoraja erinacea</i>). We find that while the jaw and hyoid arch skeleton derive from neural crest, and the pectoral fin skeleton from mesoderm, the gill arches are of dual origin, receiving contributions from both germ layers. We propose that gill arches and paired fins are serially homologous as derivatives of a continuous, dual-origin mesenchyme with common skeletogenic competence, and that this serial homology accounts for their parallel anatomical organization and shared responses to axial patterning signals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59410">Forced choices reveal a trade-off between cognitive effort and physical pain</a></h4>

Cognitive effort is described as aversive, and people will generally avoid it when possible. This aversion to effort is believed to arise from a cost–benefit analysis of the actions available. The comparison of cognitive effort against other primary aversive experiences, however, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we offered participants choices between performing a cognitively demanding task or experiencing thermal pain. We found that cognitive effort can be traded off for physical pain and that people generally avoid exerting high levels of cognitive effort. We also used computational modelling to examine the aversive subjective value of effort and its effects on response behaviours. Applying this model to decision times revealed asymmetric effects of effort and pain, suggesting that cognitive effort may not share the same basic influences on avoidance behaviour as more primary aversive stimuli such as physical pain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58848">Neural population dynamics in motor cortex are different for reach and grasp</a></h4>

Low-dimensional linear dynamics are observed in neuronal population activity in primary motor cortex (M1) when monkeys make reaching movements. This population-level behavior is consistent with a role for M1 as an autonomous pattern generator that drives muscles to give rise to movement. In the present study, we examine whether similar dynamics are also observed during grasping movements, which involve fundamentally different patterns of kinematics and muscle activations. Using a variety of analytical approaches, we show that M1 does not exhibit such dynamics during grasping movements. Rather, the grasp-related neuronal dynamics in M1 are similar to their counterparts in somatosensory cortex, whose activity is driven primarily by afferent inputs rather than by intrinsic dynamics. The basic structure of the neuronal activity underlying hand control is thus fundamentally different from that underlying arm control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58376">Lymphangiogenic therapy prevents cardiac dysfunction by ameliorating inflammation and hypertension</a></h4>

The lymphatic vasculature is involved in the pathogenesis of acute cardiac injuries, but little is known about its role in chronic cardiac dysfunction. Here, we demonstrate that angiotensin II infusion induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis at 1 week and caused cardiac dysfunction and impaired lymphatic transport at 6 weeks in mice, while co-administration of VEGFCc156s improved these parameters. To identify novel mechanisms underlying this protection, RNA sequencing analysis in distinct cell populations revealed that VEGFCc156s specifically modulated angiotensin II-induced inflammatory responses in cardiac and peripheral lymphatic endothelial cells. Furthermore, telemetry studies showed that while angiotensin II increased blood pressure acutely in all animals, VEGFCc156s-treated animals displayed a delayed systemic reduction in blood pressure independent of alterations in angiotensin II-mediated aortic stiffness. Overall, these results demonstrate that VEGFCc156s had a multifaceted therapeutic effect to prevent angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction by improving cardiac lymphatic function, alleviating fibrosis and inflammation, and ameliorating hypertension.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57977">Momentary subjective well-being depends on learning and not reward</a></h4>

Subjective well-being or happiness is often associated with wealth. Recent studies suggest that momentary happiness is associated with reward prediction error, the difference between experienced and predicted reward, a key component of adaptive behaviour. We tested subjects in a reinforcement learning task in which reward size and probability were uncorrelated, allowing us to dissociate between the contributions of reward and learning to happiness. Using computational modelling, we found convergent evidence across stable and volatile learning tasks that happiness, like behaviour, is sensitive to learning-relevant variables (i.e., probability prediction error). Unlike behaviour, happiness is not sensitive to learning-irrelevant variables (i.e., reward prediction error). Increasing volatility reduces how many past trials influence behaviour but not happiness. Finally, depressive symptoms reduce happiness more in volatile than stable environments. Our results suggest that how we learn about our world may be more important for how we feel than the rewards we actually receive.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56914">Islet vascularization is regulated by primary endothelial cilia via VEGF-A dependent signaling</a></h4>

Islet vascularization is essential for intact islet function and glucose homeostasis. We have previously shown that primary cilia directly regulate insulin secretion. However, it remains unclear whether they are also implicated in islet vascularization. At eight weeks, murine <i>Bbs4<sup>‑/-</sup> </i>islets show significantly lower intra-islet capillary density with enlarged diameters. Transplanted <i>Bbs4</i><sup>-/-</sup> islets exhibit delayed re-vascularization and reduced vascular fenestration after engraftment, partially impairing vascular permeability and glucose delivery to b-cells. We identified primary cilia on endothelial cells as the underlying cause of this regula tion, via the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway. <i>In vitro</i> silencing of ciliary genes in endothelial cells disrupts VEGF-A/VEGFR2 internalization and downstream signaling. Consequently, key features of angiogenesis including proliferation and migration are attenuated in human <i>BBS4</i> silenced endothelial cells. We conclude that endothelial cell primary cilia regulate islet vascularization and vascular barrier function via the VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling pathway.

Ventral furrow formation, the first step in <i>Drosophila </i>gastrulation, is a well-studied example of tissue morphogenesis. Rho1 is highly active in a subset of ventral cells and is required for this morphogenetic event. However, it is unclear whether spatially patterned Rho1 activity alone is sufficient to recapitulate all aspects of this morphogenetic event, including anisotropic apical constriction and coordinated cell movements. Here, using an optogenetic probe that rapidly and robustly activates Rho1 in <i>Drosophila </i>tissues, we show that Rho1 activity induces ectopic deformations in the dorsal and ventral epithelia of <i>Drosophila </i>embryos. These perturbations reveal substantial differences in how ventral and dorsal cells, both within and outside the zone of Rho1 activation, respond to spatially and temporally identical patterns of Rho1 activation. Our results demonstrate that an asymmetric zone of Rho1 activity is not sufficient to recapitulate ventral furrow formation and reveal that additional, ventral-specific factors contribute to the cell- and tissue-level behaviors that emerge during ventral furrow formation.

Signaling networks are spatiotemporally organized to sense diverse inputs, process information, and carry out specific cellular tasks. In β cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and Protein Kinase A (PKA) exist in an oscillatory circuit characterized by a high degree of feedback. Here, we describe a mode of regulation within this circuit involving a spatial dependence of the relative phase between cAMP, PKA, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We show that in mouse MIN6 β cells, nanodomain clustering of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (ACs) drives oscillations of local cAMP levels to be precisely in-phase with Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive phosphodiesterases maintain out-of-phase oscillations outside of the nanodomain. Disruption of this precise phase relationship perturbs Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, suggesting the relative phase within an oscillatory circuit can encode specific functional information. This work unveils a novel mechanism of cAMP compartmentation utilized for localized tuning of an oscillatory circuit and has broad implications for the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling networks.

The flexible retrieval of knowledge is critical in everyday situations involving problem solving, reasoning and social interaction. Current theories have emphasised the importance of a left-lateralised semantic control network (SCN) in supporting flexible semantic behaviour. Apart from the SCN, a bilateral multiple-demand network (MDN) is implicated in executive functions across domains. No study, however, has examined whether semantic and non-semantic demands are reflected in a common neural code within regions specifically implicated in semantic control. Using functional MRI and univariate parametric modulation analysis as well as multivariate pattern analysis, we found that semantic and non-semantic demands gave rise to both similar and distinct neural responses across control-related networks. Though activity patterns in SCN and MDN could decode the difficulty of both semantic and verbal working memory decisions, there was no shared common neural coding of cognitive demands in SCN regions. In contrast, regions in MDN showed common patterns across manipulations of semantic and working memory control demands, with successful cross-classification of difficulty across tasks. Therefore, SCN and MDN can be dissociated according to the information they maintain about cognitive demands.

Neurons utilize plasticity of dendritic arbors as part of a larger suite of adaptive plasticity mechanisms. This explicitly manifests with motoneurons in the Drosophila embryo and larva, where dendritic arbors are exclusively postsynaptic and are used as homeostatic devices, compensating for changes in synaptic input through adapting their growth and connectivity. We recently identified reactive oxygen species (ROS) as novel plasticity signals instrumental in this form of dendritic adjustment. ROS correlate with levels of neuronal activity and negatively regulate dendritic arbor size. Here, we investigated NADPH oxidases as potential sources of such activity-regulated ROS and implicate Dual Oxidase (but not Nox), which generates hydrogen peroxide extracellularly. We further show that the aquaporins Bib and Drip, but not Prip, are required for activity-regulated ROS-mediated adjustments of dendritic arbor size in motoneurons. These results suggest a model whereby neuronal activity leads to activation of the NADPH oxidase Dual Oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide at the extracellular face; aquaporins might then act as conduits that are necessary for these extracellular ROS to be channeled back into the cell where they negatively regulate dendritic arbor size.

Understanding how brain activity translates into behavior is a grand challenge in neuroscientific research. Simultaneous computational modeling of both measures offers to address this question. The extension of the dynamic causal modeling (DCM) framework for BOLD responses to behavior (bDCM) constitutes such a modeling approach. However, only very few studies have employed and evaluated bDCM, and its application has been restricted to binary behavioral responses, limiting more general statements about its validity. This study used bDCM to model reaction times in a spatial attention task, which involved two separate runs with either horizontal or vertical stimulus configurations. We recorded fMRI data and reaction times (n=29) and compared bDCM to classical DCM and a behavioral Rescorla-Wagner model using goodness of fit-statistics and machine learning methods. Data showed that bDCM performed equally well as classical DCM when modeling BOLD responses and better than the Rescorla Wagner model when modeling reaction times. Notably, only using bDCM's parameters enabled classification of the horizontal and vertical runs suggesting that bDCM seems to be more sensitive than the other models. Although our data also revealed practical limitations of the current bDCM approach that warrant further investigation, we conclude that bDCM constitutes a promising method for investigating the link between brain activity and behavior.

Visual motion discrimination involves reciprocal interactions in the alpha band between the primary visual cortex (V1) and the mediotemporal area (V5/MT). We investigated whether modulating alpha phase synchronization using individualized multisite transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over V5 and V1 regions would improve motion discrimination. We tested 3 groups of healthy subjects: 1) an individualized In-Phase V1alpha-V5alpha tACS (0{degrees} lag) group, 2) an individualized Anti-Phase V1alpha-V5alpha tACS (180{degrees} lag) group and 3) a sham tACS group. Motion discrimination and EEG activity were compared before, during and after tACS. Performance significantly improved in the Anti-Phase group compared to that in the In-Phase group at 10 and 30 minutes after stimulation. This result could be explained by changes in bottom-up alpha-V1 gamma-V5 phase-amplitude coupling. Thus, Anti-Phase V1alpha-V5alpha tACS might impose an optimal phase lag between stimulation sites due to the inherent speed of wave propagation, hereby supporting optimized neuronal communication.

Stress is an everyday experience and maladaptive responses play a crucial role in the etiology of affective disorders. Despite its ubiquity, the neural underpinnings of subjective stress experiences have not yet been elucidated, particularly at an individual level. In an important advance, Goldfarb et al. showed recently that subjective stress and arousal levels in response to threatening stimuli were successfully predicted based on changes in hippocampal connectivity during the task using a machine learning approach. Crucially, stress responses were predicted by interpretable hippocampal connectivity networks, shedding new light on the role of the hippocampus in regulating stress reactivity. However, the authors induced stress by displaying aversive pictures, while stress research often relies on the extensively validated Trier social stress task (TSST). The TSST incorporates crucial factors such as unpredictability of success and the social-evaluative threat of the stressor thereby eliciting cortisol responses more robustly compared to threatening images. Towards generalization, cross validation within a sample as conducted by Goldfarb et al. or independent replications are important steps, but the generalizability to different stressors allows to draw broader conclusions about the potential use of hippocampal connectivity to predict subjective stress. Arguably, translating these findings to clinical applications would require a broad generalization of the results or the prediction algorithm to psychosocial stress. Here, we assessed the predictive performance of Goldfarb et al.'s algorithm for subjective stress in an independent sample using an MR adaption of the TSST. In line with Goldfarb et al., we observed robust stress-induced changes in hippocampal connectivity. However, the spatial correlation of the changes in connectivity was low indicating little convergence across alleged stress paradigms. Critically, stress-induced changes of hippocampal connectivity were not robustly predictive of subjective stress across a multiverse of analyses based on connectivity changes. Collectively, this indicates that the generalizability of the reported stress connectivity fingerprint to other stressors is limited at best, suggesting that specific tasks might require tailored algorithms to robustly predict stress above chance levels.

Network analytic methods that are ubiquitous in other areas, such as systems neuroscience, have recently been used to test network theories in psychology, including intelligence research. The network or mutualism theory of intelligence proposes that the statistical associations among cognitive abilities (e.g. specific abilities such as vocabulary or memory) stem from causal relations among them throughout development. In this study, we used network models (specifically LASSO) of cognitive abilities and brain structural covariance (grey and white matter) to simultaneously model brain-behavior relationships essential for general intelligence in a large (behavioral, N=805; cortical volume, N=246; fractional anisotropy, N=165), developmental (ages 5-18) cohort of struggling learners (CALM). We found that mostly positive, small partial correlations pervade both our cognitive and neural networks. Moreover, calculating node centrality (absolute strength and bridge strength) and using two separate community detection algorithms (Walktrap and Clique Percolation), we found convergent evidence that subsets of both cognitive and neural nodes play an intermediary role between brain and behavior. We discuss implications and possible avenues for future studies.

Silent infarcts (SI) are subcortical cerebral infarcts that occur in the absence of typical symptoms associated with ischemia but are linked to cognitive decline and the development of dementia. There are no approved treatments for SI, but one potential treatment is tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. While SI can have long-term consequences, it is critical to establish whether treatments are able to selectively target its early consequences, to avoid progression to complete injury. We induced SI in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 of rats and assessed whether tamoxifen is protective 24 hours later against cognitive deficits and injury responses to SI including gliosis, apoptosis, inflammation and changes in estrogen receptors (ERs). Hippocampal SI led to subtle cognitive impairment on the object place recognition task, an effect ameliorated by tamoxifen administration. SI did not lead to detectable hippocampal cell loss but did increase apoptosis, astrogliosis, microgliosis and inflammation. Tamoxifen protected against the effects of SI on all measures except microgliosis. SI also increased ER and decreased ER{beta} in the hippocampus, which was again mitigated by tamoxifen. Exploratory data analyses using scatterplot matrices and principal component analysis indicated that the SI rats given tamoxifen were indistinguishable from sham controls. Further, SI rats were significantly different from all other groups, an effect produced by low levels of ER and increased apoptosis, gliosis, inflammation, ER{beta}, and time spent with the unmoved object. The results demonstrate that tamoxifen is protective against the early cellular and cognitive consequences of hippocampal SI as early as 24 hours after injury. This effect is driven by mitigation of apoptosis, gliosis, and inflammation and normalization of ER levels in the CA1, leading to improved cognitive outcomes after hippocampal SI.

The amplitude of prestimulus alpha oscillations over parieto-occipital cortex has been shown to predict visual detection of masked and threshold-level stimuli. Whether alpha activity similarly predicts target visibility in perceptual suppression paradigms, another type of illusion commonly used to investigate visual awareness, is presently unclear. Here, we examined prestimulus alpha activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy participants in the context of a generalized flash suppression (GFS) task during which salient target stimuli are rendered subjectively invisible in a subset of trials following the onset of a full-field motion stimulus. Unlike for masking or threshold paradigms, alpha (8-12 Hz) amplitude prior to motion onset was significantly higher when targets remained subjectively visible compared to trials during which the targets became perceptually suppressed. Furthermore, individual prestimulus alpha amplitudes strongly correlated with the individual trial-to-trial variability quenching following motion stimulus onset, indicating that variability quenching in visual cortex is closely linked to prestimulus alpha activity. We conclude that predictive correlates of conscious perception derived from perceptual suppression paradigms differ substantially from those of obtained with near threshold paradigms, possibly reflecting the effectiveness of the suppressor stimulus.

<p>by Roman V. Frolov, Irina I. Ignatova</p>

Phototransduction reactions in the rhabdomeric photoreceptor are profoundly stochastic due to the small number of participating molecules and small reaction space. The resulting quantum bumps (QBs) vary in their timing (latency), amplitudes and durations, and these variabilities within each cell are not correlated. Using modeling and electrophysiological recordings, we investigated how the QB properties depend on the cascade speed and how they influence signal transfer. Parametric analysis in the model supported by experimental data revealed that faster cascades elicit larger and narrower QBs with faster onsets and smaller variabilities than slower cascades. Latency dispersion was stronger affected by modification of upstream than downstream activation parameters. The variability caused by downstream modifications closely matched the experimental variability. Frequency response modeling showed that corner frequency is a reciprocal function of the characteristic duration of the multiphoton response, which, in turn, is a non-linear function of QB duration and latency dispersion. All QB variabilities contributed noise but only latency dispersion slowed and spread multiphoton responses, lowering the corner frequency. Using the discovered QB correlations, we evaluated transduction noise for dissimilar species and two extreme adaptation states, and compared it to photon noise. The noise emitted by the cascade was non-additive and depended non-linearly on the interaction between the QB duration and the three QB variabilities. Increased QB duration strongly suppressed both noise and corner frequency. This trade-off might be acceptable for nocturnal but not diurnal species because corner frequency is the principal determinant of information capacity. To offset the increase in noise accompanying the QB narrowing during light adaptation and the response-expanding effect of latency dispersion, the cascade accelerates. This explains the widespread evolutionary tendency of diurnal fliers to have fast phototransduction, especially after light adaptation, which thus appears to be a common adaptation to contain stochasticity, improve SNR and expand the bandwidth.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aOFGf29Abcw" width="1" />

<p>by Jingwei Ma, Myan Do, Mark. A. Le Gros, Charles S. Peskin, Carolyn A. Larabell, Yoichiro Mori, Samuel A. Isaacson</p>

For a chemical signal to propagate across a cell, it must navigate a tortuous environment involving a variety of organelle barriers. In this work we study mathematical models for a basic chemical signal, the arrival times at the nuclear membrane of proteins that are activated at the cell membrane and diffuse throughout the cytosol. Organelle surfaces within human B cells are reconstructed from soft X-ray tomographic images, and modeled as reflecting barriers to the molecules’ diffusion. We show that signal inactivation sharpens signals, reducing variability in the arrival time at the nuclear membrane. Inactivation can also compensate for an observed slowdown in signal propagation induced by the presence of organelle barriers, leading to arrival times at the nuclear membrane that are comparable to models in which the cytosol is treated as an open, empty region. In the limit of strong signal inactivation this is achieved by filtering out molecules that traverse non-geodesic paths.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Guj8VLZcf0" width="1" />

<p>by Amir Bitran, William M. Jacobs, Eugene Shakhnovich</p>

Atomistic simulations can provide valuable, experimentally-verifiable insights into protein folding mechanisms, but existing <i>ab initio</i> simulation methods are restricted to only the smallest proteins due to severe computational speed limits. The folding of larger proteins has been studied using native-centric potential functions, but such models omit the potentially crucial role of non-native interactions. Here, we present an algorithm, entitled DBFOLD, which can predict folding pathways for a wide range of proteins while accounting for the effects of non-native contacts. In addition, DBFOLD can predict the relative rates of different transitions within a protein’s folding pathway. To accomplish this, rather than directly simulating folding, our method combines equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulations, which deploy enhanced sampling, with <i>unfolding</i> simulations at high temperatures. We show that under certain conditions, trajectories from these two types of simulations can be jointly analyzed to compute unknown folding rates from detailed balance. This requires inferring free energies from the equilibrium simulations, and extrapolating transition rates from the unfolding simulations to lower, physiologically-reasonable temperatures at which the native state is marginally stable. As a proof of principle, we show that our method can accurately predict folding pathways and Monte-Carlo rates for the well-characterized Streptococcal protein G. We then show that our method significantly reduces the amount of computation time required to compute the folding pathways of large, misfolding-prone proteins that lie beyond the reach of existing direct simulation. Our algorithm, which is available online, can generate detailed atomistic models of protein folding mechanisms while shedding light on the role of non-native intermediates which may crucially affect organismal fitness and are frequently implicated in disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vWOJSg59ZyA" width="1" />

In several neurodegenerative disorders, axonal pathology may originate from impaired oligodendrocyte-to-axon support of energy substrates. We previously established transgenic mice that allow measuring axonal ATP levels in electrically active optic nerves. Here, we utilize this technique to explore axonal ATP dynamics in the <i>Plp</i><sup>null/y</sup> mouse model of spastic paraplegia. Optic nerves from <i>Plp</i><sup>null/y</sup> mice exhibited lower and more variable basal axonal ATP levels and reduced compound action potential (CAP) amplitudes, providing a missing link between axonal pathology and a role of oligodendrocytes in brain energy metabolism. Surprisingly, when <i>Plp</i><sup>null/y</sup> optic nerves are challenged with transient glucose deprivation, both ATP levels and CAP decline slower, but recover faster upon reperfusion of glucose. Structurally, myelin sheaths display an increased frequency of cytosolic channels comprising glucose and monocarboxylate transporters, possibly facilitating accessibility of energy substrates to the axon. These data imply that complex metabolic alterations of the axon–myelin unit contribute to the phenotype of <i>Plp</i><sup>null/y</sup> mice.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2T3lQGswVJ8" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to disentangle the comparative effects of lipids and apolipoproteins on ischemic stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A‐I and B (apoA‐I and apoB) at the level of genomewide significance (<i>p</i> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Summary‐level data for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium with 514,791 individuals (60,341 ischemic stroke cases, and 454,450 non‐cases).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Increased levels of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in the main and sensitivity univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in the same model, apoB retained a robust effect (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), whereas the estimate for LDL cholesterol was reversed, and that for triglycerides largely attenuated. Decreased levels of apoA‐I and HDL cholesterol were robustly associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in all univariable MR analyses, but the association for apoA‐I was attenuated to the null after mutual adjustment.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present MR study reveals that apoB is the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological basis of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in relation to ischemic stroke, in particular large artery and small vessel stroke. Whether HDL cholesterol exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke independent of apoA‐I needs further investigation. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1229–1236</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To demonstrate that calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features in patients with persistent post‐traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐way crossover study was conducted. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 1.5μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12‐hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: (1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features and (2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty patients (mean age = 37 years, 25 women [83%]) were randomized and completed the study. During the 12‐hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features after CGRP, compared with 6 patients (20%) after placebo (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.001). The baseline‐corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance. Furthermore, CGRP‐targeted therapies might provide a novel mechanism‐based treatment option for patients with persistent PTH. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1220–1228</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pain, temperature, and itch are conventionally thought to be exclusively transduced by the intraepidermal nerve endings. Although recent studies have shown that epidermal keratinocytes also participate in sensory transduction, the mechanism underlying keratinocyte communication with intraepidermal nerve endings remains poorly understood. We sought to demonstrate the synaptic character of the contacts between keratinocytes and sensory neurons and their involvement in sensory communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Contacts were explored by morphological, molecular, and functional approaches in cocultures of epidermal keratinocytes and sensory neurons. To interrogate whether structures observed <i>in vitro</i> were also present in the human epidermis, <i>in situ</i> correlative light electron microscopy was performed on human skin biopsies.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Epidermal keratinocytes dialogue with sensory neurons through en passant synaptic‐like contacts. These contacts have the ultrastructural features and molecular hallmarks of chemical synaptic‐like contacts: narrow intercellular cleft, keratinocyte synaptic vesicles expressing synaptophysin and synaptotagmin 1, and sensory information transmitted from keratinocytes to sensory neurons through SNARE‐mediated (syntaxin1) vesicle release.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>By providing selective communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons, synaptic‐like contacts are the hubs of a 2‐site receptor. The permanent epidermal turnover, implying a specific <i>en passant</i> structure and high plasticity, may have delayed their identification, thereby contributing to the long‐held concept of nerve endings passing freely between keratinocytes. The discovery of keratinocyte–sensory neuron synaptic‐like contacts may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in cutaneous sensory perception and sheds new light on the pathophysiology of pain and itch as well as the physiology of touch.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined the relationship between tau pathology and neuroinflammation using [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 PET in 17 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and tau protein aggregation colocalize macroscopically, and correlate with clinical severity.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nondisplaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). The [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 BP<sub>ND</sub> values were correlated across all regions. The spatial distributions of [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 binding were determined by principal component analyses (PCAs), and the loading of each spatial component compared against the patients’ clinical severity (using the PSP rating scale).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Regional [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 binding were positively correlated (R = 0.577, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The PCA identified 4 components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 components’ loadings were found in both subcortical (R = 0.769, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and cortical regions (R = 0.836, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). There were positive correlations between clinical severity and both subcortical tau pathology (R = 0.667, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and neuroinflammation (R = 0.788, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation colocalize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine causal associations between these molecular pathologies, we suggest that the combination of tau‐ and immune‐oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease‐modifying treatments in PSP.

<p>This study aimed to characterise both neuronal autoantibodies and levels of interferon α, two proposed causative agents in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 35 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 15 with NPSLE) showed no antibodies against natively expressed N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs), or the surface of live hippocampal neurons. By comparison to controls (n = 104), patients with SLE had antibodies that bound to a peptide representing the extracellular domain of NMDARs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), however, binding was retained against both rearranged peptides and no peptide (r = 0.85 and r = 0.79, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). In summary, neuronal‐surface reactive antibodies were not detected in NPSLE. Further, while interferon α levels were higher in SLE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), they lacked specificity for NPSLE. Our findings mandate a search for novel biomarkers in this condition. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1244–1250</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Current understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on large‐scale brain networks remains elusive, largely due to the lack of techniques that can reveal DBS‐induced activity at the whole‐brain level. Using a novel 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐compatible stimulator, we investigated whole‐brain effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in patients with Parkinson disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fourteen patients received STN‐DBS treatment and participated in a block‐design functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, wherein stimulations were delivered during “ON” blocks interleaved with “OFF” blocks. fMRI responses to low‐frequency (60Hz) and high‐frequency(130Hz) STN‐DBS were measured 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. To ensure reliability, multiple runs (48 minutes) of fMRI data were acquired at each postsurgical visit. Presurgical resting‐state fMRI (30 minutes) data were also acquired.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two neurocircuits showed highly replicable, but distinct responses to STN‐DBS. A circuit involving the globus pallidus internus (GPi), thalamus, and deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly activated, whereas another circuit involving the primary motor cortex (M1), putamen, and cerebellum showed DBS‐induced deactivation. These 2 circuits were dissociable in terms of their DBS‐induced responses and resting‐state functional connectivity. The GPi circuit was frequency‐dependent, selectively responding to high‐frequency stimulation, whereas the M1 circuit was responsive in a time‐dependent manner, showing enhanced deactivation over time. Finally, activation of the GPi circuit was associated with overall motor improvement, whereas M1 circuit deactivation was related to reduced bradykinesia.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Concurrent DBS‐fMRI using 3T revealed 2 distinct circuits that responded differentially to STN‐DBS and were related to divergent symptoms, a finding that may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying DBS. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1178–1193</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Adults with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology by their 5th decade. Compared with the general population, traditional vascular risks in adults with DS are rare, allowing examination of cerebrovascular disease in this population and insight into its role in AD without the confound of vascular risk factors. We examined in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in adults with DS, and determined their cross‐sectional relationship with age, beta‐amyloid pathology, and mild cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic status.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome study (n = 138, 50 ± 7 years, 39% women) with MRI data and a subset (n = 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included. We derived MRI‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET‐based biomarkers of amyloid burden. Participants were characterized as cognitively stable (CS), mild cognitive impairment–DS (MCI‐DS), possible AD dementia, or definite AD dementia based on in‐depth assessments of cognition, function, and health status.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were detectable WMH, enlarged PVS, infarcts, and microbleeds as early as the 5th decade of life. There was a monotonic increase in WMH volume, enlarged PVS, and presence of infarcts across diagnostic groups (CS &lt; MCI‐DS &lt; possible AD dementia &lt; definite AD dementia). Higher amyloid burden was associated with a higher likelihood of an infarct.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The findings highlight the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in adults with DS and add to a growing body of evidence that implicates cerebrovascular disease as a core feature of AD and not simply a comorbidity. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1165–1177</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Congenital structural brain malformations have been described in patients with pathogenic phosphatase and tensin homologue (<i>PTEN</i>) variants, but the frequency of cortical malformations in patients with <i>PTEN</i> variants and their impact on clinical phenotype are not well understood. Our goal was to systematically characterize brain malformations in patients with <i>PTEN</i> variants and assess the relevance of their brain malformations to clinical presentation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We systematically searched a local radiology database for patients with <i>PTEN</i> variants who had available brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI scans were reviewed systematically for cortical abnormalities. We reviewed electroencephalogram (EEG) data and evaluated the electronic medical record for evidence of epilepsy and developmental delay.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, we identified 22 patients with <i>PTEN</i> pathogenic variants for which brain MRIs were available (age range 0.4–17 years). Twelve among these 22 patients (54%) had polymicrogyria (PMG). Variants associated with PMG or atypical gyration encoded regions of the phosphatase or C2 domains of PTEN. Interestingly, epilepsy was present in only 2 of the 12 patients with PMG. We found a trend toward higher rates of global developmental delay (GDD), intellectual disability (ID), and motor delay in individuals with cortical abnormalities, although cohort size limited statistical significance.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Malformations of cortical development, PMG in particular, represent an under‐recognized phenotype associated with <i>PTEN</i> pathogenic variants and may have an association with cognitive and motor delays. Epilepsy was infrequent compared to the previously reported high risk of epilepsy in patients with PMG. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1153–1164</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>In acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset, magnetic resonance (MR)‐based diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) estimates lesion age to guide intravenous thrombolysis. Computed tomography (CT)‐based quantitative net water uptake (NWU) may be a potential alternative. The purpose of this study was to directly compare CT‐based NWU to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at identifying patients with lesion age &lt; 4.5 hours from symptom onset.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty patients with acute anterior circulation stroke were analyzed with both imaging modalities at admission between 0.5 and 8.0 hours after known symptom onset. DWI‐FLAIR lesion mismatch was rated and NWU was measured in admission CT. An established NWU threshold (11.5%) was used to classify patients within and beyond 4.5 hours. Multiparametric MRI signal was compared with NWU using logistic regression analyses. The empirical distribution of NWU was analyzed in a consecutive cohort of patients with wake‐up stroke.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median time between CT and MRI was 35 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 24–50). The accuracy of DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was 68.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 53.7–81.3%) with a sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 82%. The accuracy of NWU threshold was 86.0% (95% CI = 73.3–94.2%) with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 78%. The area under the curve (AUC) of multiparametric MRI signal to classify lesion age &lt;4.5 hours was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.64–0.97), and the AUC of quantitative NWU was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.78–0.98). Among 87 patients with wake‐up stroke, 46 patients (53%) showed low NWU (&lt; 11.5%).</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The predictive power of CT‐based lesion water imaging to identify patients within the time window of thrombolysis was comparable to multiparametric DWI‐FLAIR MRI. A significant proportion of patients with wake‐up stroke exhibit low NWU and may therefore be potentially suitable for thrombolysis. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1144–1152</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A recessive biallelic repeat expansion, (AAGGG)<sub>exp</sub>, in the <i>RFC1</i> gene has been reported to be a frequent cause of late‐onset ataxia. For cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), the recessive biallelic (AAGGG)<sub>exp</sub> genotype was present in ~92% of cases. This study aimed to examine whether the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) was related to multiple system atrophy (MSA), which shares a spectrum of symptoms with CANVAS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this study, we screened the pathogenic (AAGGG)<sub>exp</sub> repeat and 5 other PNRs in 104 Chinese sporadic adult‐onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) patients, 282 MSA patients, and 203 unaffected individuals. Multiple molecular genetic tests were used, including long‐range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat‐primed PCR (RP‐PCR), Sanger sequencing, and Southern blot. Comprehensive clinical assessments were conducted, including neurological examination, neuroimaging, nerve electrophysiology, and examination of vestibular function.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified biallelic (AAGGG)<sub>exp</sub> in 1 SAOA patient and 3 MSA patients. Additionally, 1 MSA patient had the (AAGGG)<sub>exp</sub>/(AAAGG)<sub>exp</sub> genotype with uncertain pathogenicity. We also described the carrier frequency for different PNRs in our cohorts. Furthermore, we summarized the distinct phenotypes of affected patients, suggesting that biallelic (AAGGG)<sub>exp</sub> in <i>RFC1</i> could be associated with MSA and should be screened routinely in the MSA diagnostic workflow.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results expanded the clinical phenotypic spectrum of <i>RFC1</i>‐related disorders and raised the possibility that MSA might share the same genetic background as CANVAS, which is crucial for re‐evaluating the current CANVAS and MSA diagnostic criteria. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1132–1143</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Perirolandic atrophy occurs in corticobasal syndrome (CBS) but is not specific versus progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). There is heterogeneity in the locations of atrophy outside the perirolandic cortex and it remains unknown why atrophy in different locations would cause the same CBS‐specific symptoms. In prior work, we used a wiring diagram of the brain called the human connectome to localize lesion‐induced disorders to symptom‐specific brain networks. Here, we use a similar technique termed “atrophy network mapping” to localize single‐subject atrophy maps to symptom‐specific brain networks.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Single‐subject atrophy maps were generated by comparing cortical thickness in patients with CBS versus controls. Next, we performed seed‐based functional connectivity using a large normative connectome to determine brain regions functionally connected to each patient's atrophied locations.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with CBS had perirolandic atrophy versus controls at the group level, but locations of atrophy in CBS were heterogeneous outside of the perirolandic cortex at the single‐subject level (mean spatial correlation = 0.04). In contrast, atrophy occurred in locations functionally connected to the perirolandic cortex in all patients with CBS (spatial correlation = 0.66). Compared with PSP, patients with CBS had atrophy connected to a network of higher‐order sensorimotor regions beyond perirolandic cortex, matching a CBS atrophy network from a recent meta‐analysis. Finally, atrophy network mapping identified a symptom‐specific network for alien limb, matching a lesion‐induced alien limb network and a network associated with agency in healthy subjects.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified a syndrome‐specific network for CBS and symptom‐specific network for alien limb using single‐subject atrophy maps and the human connectome. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1118–1131</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We report natural history data in a large cohort of 199 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). The aim of the study was to establish the annual rate and possible patterns of progression according to a number of variables, such as age of onset, age at assessment, <i>SMN2</i> copy number, and functional status.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>HFMSE longitudinal changes were assessed using piecewise linear mixed‐effects models. The dependency in the data due to repeated measures was accounted for by a random intercept per individual and an unstructured covariance R matrix was used as correlation structure. An additional descriptive analysis was performed for 123 patients, for a total of 375 12‐month assessments.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A break point at age 7 years was set for the whole cohort and for SMA IIIA and IIIB. Age, SMA type, and ambulatory status were significantly associated with changes in mean HFMSE score, whereas gender and <i>SMN2</i> copy number were not. The increase in response before the break point of age 7 years is significant only for SMA IIIA (β = 1.79, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). After the break point, the change in the rate of HFMSE score significantly decrease for both SMA IIIA (β = −1.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and IIIB (β = −0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the association between cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) size and location and preschool‐age neurodevelopment in very preterm neonates.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Preterm magnetic resonance images of 221 very preterm neonates (median gestational age = 27.9 weeks) were manually segmented for CBH quantification and location. Neurodevelopmental assessments at chronological age 4.5 years included motor (Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd Edition [MABC‐2]), visuomotor integration (Beery‐Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual‐Motor Integration, 6th Edition), cognitive (Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence, 3rd Edition), and behavioral (Child Behavior Checklist) outcomes. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between CBH size and 4.5‐year outcomes accounting for sex, gestational age, and supratentorial injury. Probabilistic maps assessed CBH location and likelihood of a lesion to predict adverse outcome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty‐six neonates had CBH: 14 (6%) with only punctate CBH and 22 (10%) with ≥1 larger CBH. CBH occurred mostly in the inferior aspect of the posterior lobes. CBH total volume was independently associated with MABC‐2 motor scores at 4.5 years (β = −0.095, 95% confidence interval = −0.184 to −0.005), with a standardized β coefficient (−0.16) that was similar to that of white matter injury volume (standardized β = −0.22). CBH size was similarly associated with visuomotor integration and externalizing behavior but not cognition. Voxelwise odds ratio and lesion‐symptom maps demonstrated that CBH extending more deeply into the cerebellum predicted adverse motor, visuomotor, and behavioral outcomes.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CBH size and location on preterm magnetic resonance imaging were associated with reduced preschool motor and visuomotor function and more externalizing behavior independent of supratentorial brain injury in a dose‐dependent fashion. The volumetric quantification and localization of CBH, even when punctate, may allow opportunity to improve motor and behavioral outcomes by providing targeted intervention.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase (PI3K) complex have been associated with a broad spectrum of brain and organ overgrowth syndromes. For example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase regulatory subunit 2 (<i>PIK3R2</i>) have been identified in human patients with megalencephaly polymicrogyria polydactyly hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which includes brain overgrowth. To better understand the pathogenesis of <i>PIK3R2</i>‐related mutations, we have developed and characterized a murine model.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated a knock‐in mouse model for the most common human <i>PIK3R2</i> mutation, p.G373R (p.G367R in mice) using CRISPR/Cas9. The mouse phenotypes, including brain size, seizure activity, cortical lamination, cell proliferation/size/density, interneuron migration, and PI3K pathway activation, were analyzed using standard methodologies. For human patients with <i>PIK3R2</i> mutations, clinical data (occipitofrontal circumference [OFC] and epilepsy) were retrospectively obtained from our clinical records (published / unpublished).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The PI3K‐AKT pathway was hyperactivated in these mice, confirming the p.G367R mutation is an activating mutation in vivo. Similar to human patients with <i>PIK3R2</i> mutations, these mice have enlarged brains. We found cell size to be increased but not cell numbers. The embryonic brain showed mild defects in cortical lamination, although not observed in the mature brain. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from mutant mice showed background slowing and rare seizures, again similar to our observations in human patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We have generated a <i>PIK3R2</i> mouse model that exhibits megalencephaly and EEG changes, both of which overlap with human patients. Our data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease caused by PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. We anticipate this model will be valuable in testing therapeutic options for human patients with MPPH. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1077–1094</p>

<p>A 10‐year‐old girl presented with ileus, urinary retention, dry mouth, lack of tears, fixed dilated pupils, and diffuse anhidrosis 7 days after a febrile illness. We hypothesized that her syndrome was due to autoimmunity against muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking their activation. Using an indirect enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay for all 5 muscarinic receptors (M<sub>1</sub>–M<sub>5</sub>), we identified in the patient's serum antibodies that selectively bound to M<sub>3</sub> receptors. In vitro functional studies confirmed that these autoantibodies selectively blocked M<sub>3</sub> receptor activation.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The longitudinal association of the blood biomarkers total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline is not established.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, had completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and had undergone 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD; especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8 to 16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years; baseline t‐tau &gt; 0.40pg/ml had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L &gt; 25.5pg/ml had 110% faster decline, and GFAP &gt; 232pg/ml had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP &gt; 232pg/ml showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those with values &lt; 160pg/ml. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in 3rd ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia.

<p>By using targeted metabolomics methods, the differential metabolites of hippocampal tissues of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and wild‐type mice at an early age and the pathogenesis associated with these metabolites were obtained.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease in people of age 65 or above. The detailed etiology and pathogenesis of AD have not been elucidated yet. In this study, the hippocampi of 2‐ and 6‐month‐old triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and age–sex‐matched wild‐type (WT) mice were analyzed by using targeted metabolomics approach. Compared with WT mice, 24 and 60 metabolites were found with significant differences in 2‐ and 6‐month‐old AD mice. Among these, 14 metabolites were found common while 10 metabolites showed consistent variable trends in both groups. These differential metabolites are found associated with amino acid, lipid, vitamin, nucleotide‐related base, neurotransmitter and energy metabolisms, and oxidative stress. The results suggest that these differential metabolites might play a critical role in AD pathophysiology, and may serve as potential biomarkers for AD. Moreover, the results highlight the involvement of abnormal purine, pyrimidine, arginine, and proline metabolism, along with glycerophospholipid metabolism in early pathology of AD. For the first time, several differential metabolites are found to be associated with AD in this study. Targeted metabolomics can be used for rapid and accurate quantitative analysis of specific target metabolites associated with AD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cornea is the most innervated tissue in the human body. Myelinated axons upon inserting into the peripheral corneal stroma lose their myelin sheaths and continue into the central cornea wrapped by only nonmyelinating corneal Schwann cells (nm‐cSCs). This anatomical organization is believed to be important for central vision. Here we employed single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), microscopy, and transgenics to characterize these nm‐cSCs of the central cornea. Using principal component analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection, and unsupervised hierarchal cell clustering of scRNA‐seq data derived from central corneal cells of male rabbits, we successfully identified several clusters representing different corneal cell types, including a unique cell cluster representing nm‐cSCs. To confirm protein expression of cSC genes, we performed cross‐species validation, employing corneal whole‐mount immunostaining with confocal microscopy in mouse corneas. The expression of several representative proteins of nm‐cSCs were validated. As the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene was also expressed in nm‐cSCs, we explored the <i>Plp1</i>‐eGFP transgenic reporter mouse line to visualize cSCs. Specific and efficient eGFP expression was observed in cSCs in adult mice of different ages. Of several putative cornea‐specific SC genes identified, Dickkopf‐related protein 1 was shown to be present in nm‐cSCs. Taken together, our findings, for the first time, identify important insights and tools toward the study nm‐cSCs in isolated tissue and adult animals. We expect that our results will advance the future study of nm‐cSCs in applications of nerve repair, and provide a resource for the study of corneal sensory function.</p>

<p>Diabetes affects more than 425 million people worldwide, a scale approaching
pandemic proportion. Diabetes represents a major risk factor for stroke, and
therefore is actively addressed for stroke prevention. However, how diabetes
affects stroke severity has not yet been extensively considered, which is
surprising given the evident but understudied common mechanistic features of
both pathologies. The increase in number of diabetic people, in the incidence
of stroke in presence of this specific risk factor, and the exacerbation of
ischemic brain damage in diabetic conditions (at least in animal models)
warrant the need to integrate this comorbidity in pre-clinical studies of brain
ischemia to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Therefore, a better
understanding of the commonalties involved in the course of both diseases would
offer the promise of discovering novel neuroprotective pathways that would be
more appropriated to clinical situations. In this article, we will review the
relevant mechanisms that have been identified as common traits of both
pathologies and that could be to our knowledge, potential targets for both
pathologies.

<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly successful at a
range of image-to-image tasks. CNNs can be computationally expensive, which can
limit their applicability in practice. Model pruning can improve computational
efficiency by sparsifying trained networks. Common methods for pruning CNNs
determine what convolutional filters to remove by ranking filters on an
individual basis. However, filters are not independent, as CNNs consist of
chains of convolutions, which can result in sub-optimal filter selection.
</p>
<p>We propose a novel pruning method, LongEst-chAiN (LEAN) pruning, which takes
the interdependency between the convolution operations into account. We propose
to prune CNNs by using graph-based algorithms to select relevant chains of
convolutions. A CNN is interpreted as a graph, with the operator norm of each
convolution as distance metric for the edges. LEAN pruning iteratively extracts
the highest value path from the graph to keep. In our experiments, we test LEAN
pruning for several image-to-image tasks, including the well-known CamVid
dataset. LEAN pruning enables us to keep just 0.5%-2% of the convolutions
without significant loss of accuracy. When pruning CNNs with LEAN, we achieve a
higher accuracy than pruning filters individually, and different pruned
substructures emerge.

<p>Recent evidence has revealed cross-frequency coupling and, particularly,
phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) as an important strategy for the brain to
accomplish a variety of high-level cognitive and sensory functions. However,
decoding PAC is still challenging. This contribution presents REPAC, a reliable
and robust algorithm for modeling and detecting PAC events in EEG signals.
First, we explain the synthesis of PAC-like EEG signals, with special attention
to the most critical parameters that characterize PAC, i.e., SNR, modulation
index, duration of coupling. Second, REPAC is introduced in detail. We use
computer simulations to generate a set of random PAC-like EEG signals and test
the performance of REPAC with regard to a baseline method. REPAC is shown to
outperform the baseline method even with realistic values of SNR, e.g., -10 dB.
They both reach accuracy levels around 99%, but REPAC leads to a significant
improvement of sensitivity, from 20.11% to 65.21%, with comparable specificity
(around 99%). REPAC is also applied to a real EEG signal showing preliminary
encouraging results.

<p>Recent work has shown promising results using Hebbian meta-learning to solve
hard reinforcement learning problems and adapt-to a limited degree-to changes
in the environment. In previous works each synapse has its own learning rule.
This allows each synapse to learn very specific learning rules and we
hypothesize this limits the ability to discover generally useful Hebbian
learning rules. We hypothesize that limiting the number of Hebbian learning
rules through a "genomic bottleneck" can act as a regularizer leading to better
generalization across changes to the environment. We test this hypothesis by
decoupling the number of Hebbian learning rules from the number of synapses and
systematically varying the number of Hebbian learning rules. We thoroughly
explore how well these Hebbian meta-learning networks adapt to changes in their
environment.

<p>Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main
challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning
methods from AlphaGo to Muzero have enjoyed huge success in discrete domains,
such as chess and Go. Unfortunately, in real-world applications like robot
control and inverted pendulum, whose action space is normally continuous, those
tree-based planning techniques will be struggling. To address those
limitations, in this paper, we present a novel model-based reinforcement
learning frameworks called Critic PI2, which combines the benefits from
trajectory optimization, deep actor-critic learning, and model-based
reinforcement learning. Our method is evaluated for inverted pendulum models
with applicability to many continuous control systems. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Critic PI2 achieved a new state of the art in a range of
challenging continuous domains. Furthermore, we show that planning with a
critic significantly increases the sample efficiency and real-time performance.
Our work opens a new direction toward learning the components of a model-based
planning system and how to use them.

<p>Many real-world networks, including nervous systems, exhibit meso-scale
structure. This means that their elements can be grouped into meaningful
sub-networks. In general, these sub-networks are unknown ahead of time and must
be "discovered" algorithmically using community detection methods. In this
article, we review evidence that nervous systems exhibit meso-scale structure
in the form of communities, clusters, and modules. We also provide a set of
guidelines to assist users in applying community detection methods to their own

but, in many cases, are general and applicable to other techniques.

<p>We describe a neural-based method for generating exact or approximate
solutions to differential equations in the form of mathematical expressions.
Unlike other neural methods, our system returns symbolic expressions that can
be interpreted directly. Our method uses a neural architecture for learning
mathematical expressions to optimize a customizable objective, and is scalable,
compact, and easily adaptable for a variety of tasks and configurations. The
system has been shown to effectively find exact or approximate symbolic
solutions to various differential equations with applications in natural
sciences. In this work, we highlight how our method applies to partial
differential equations over multiple variables and more complex boundary and
initial value conditions.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06662">Mathematical Model of Hippocampal Microdialysis: Validation of in vivo Methodology. (arXiv:2011.06662v1 [q-bio.QM])</a></h4>

<p>Microdialysis is a well-established method for in vivo neurochemical
measurements of small molecules, with implanted concentric-design probes
offering minimized tissue damage and good temporal and spatial resolution.
However, the large majority of measurements do not allow the perfusate to reach
equilibrium with the brain, so that inferential methods of sample concentration
correction such as zero-net-flux must be used to determine actual brain
extracellular fluid glucose concentrations. In order for such methods to be
valid, steady-state transfer of the analyte of interest within the brain is
required, but this situation has not previously been confirmed. A
first-principles mathematical model of fluid flow and analyte diffusion around
an implanted microdialysis probe was developed and implemented in COMSOL in
order to validate the zero-net-flux approach, using measurement of
extracellular brain glucose levels as a well-explored example system against
which to compare the model. Results from the model accurately reproduced and
predicted results from in vivo experiments. Importantly, the model predicts
that the time for an implanted probe to achieve steady-state equilibrium with
the surrounding extracellular fluid is on the order of one to two minutes,
supporting the validity of this technique for quantitative measurement of in
vivo neurochemistry.

After completing her PhD in structural chemistry and electron crystallography, she started at the beginning of her independent career to apply these techniques in solving structures of porous materials. She first worked on development of inorganic porous materials, such as zeolites and related open-frameworks. A joint project with Prof. Michael O’Keeffe drew her attention to metal organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and reticular synthesis. Since then, she is working on developing structure characterization techniques for porous materials.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/W6uS2hpfnqo" width="1" />

<p>In the vertebrate olfactory bulb (OB), axonless granule cells (GC) mediate self- and lateral inhibitory interactions between mitral/tufted cells via reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses. Locally triggered release of GABA from the large reciprocal GC spines occurs on both fast and slow time scales, possibly enabling parallel processing during olfactory perception. Here we investigate local mechanisms for asynchronous spine output. To reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of postsynaptic ion transients, we imaged spine and adjacent dendrite Ca<sup>2 +</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-signals with minimal exogenous buffering by the respective fluorescent indicator dyes upon two-photon uncaging of DNI-glutamate in OB slices from juvenile rats. Both postsynaptic fluorescence signals decayed slowly, with average half durations in the spine head of t<sub>1</sub><sub>/</sub><sub>2</sub>_Δ[Ca<sup>2 +</sup>]<sub>i</sub> ∼500 ms and t<sub>1</sub><sub>/</sub><sub>2</sub>_Δ[Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> ∼1,000 ms. We also analyzed the kinetics of already existing data of postsynaptic spine Ca<sup>2 +</sup>-signals in response to glomerular stimulation in OB slices from adult mice, either WT or animals with partial GC glutamate receptor deletions (NMDAR: GluN1 subunit; AMPAR: GluA2 subunit). In a large subset of spines the fluorescence signal had a protracted rise time (average time to peak ∼400 ms, range 20 to &gt;1,000 ms). This slow rise was independent of Ca<sup>2 +</sup> entry via NMDARs, since similarly slow signals occurred in ΔGluN1 GCs. Additional Ca<sup>2 +</sup> entry in ΔGluA2 GCs (with AMPARs rendered Ca<sup>2 +</sup>-permeable), however, resulted in larger ΔF/Fs that rose yet more slowly. Thus GC spines appear to dispose of several local mechanisms to promote asynchronous GABA release, which are reflected in the time course of mitral/tufted cell recurrent inhibition.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the buildup of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles. This leads to decreased synaptic efficacy, cell death, and, consequently, brain atrophy in patients. Behaviorally, this manifests as memory loss and confusion. Using a gene ontology analysis, we recently identified AD and other age-related dementias as candidate diseases associated with the loss of DEK expression. DEK is a nuclear phosphoprotein with roles in DNA repair, cellular proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis. Work from our laboratory determined that DEK is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions relevant to learning and memory, including the hippocampus. Moreover, we have also determined that DEK is highly expressed in neurons. Consistent with our gene ontology analysis, we recently reported that cortical DEK protein levels are inversely proportional to dementia severity scores in elderly female patients. However, the functional role of DEK in neurons is unknown. Thus, we knocked down DEK in an in vitro neuronal model, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, hypothesizing that DEK loss would result in cellular and molecular phenotypes consistent with AD. We found that DEK loss resulted in increased neuronal death by apoptosis (i.e., cleaved caspases 3 and 8), decreased β-catenin levels, disrupted neurite development, higher levels of total and phosphorylated Tau at Ser262, and protein aggregates. We have demonstrated that DEK loss in vitro recapitulates cellular and molecular phenotypes of AD pathology.</p>

<p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a chemical synapse formed between a presynaptic motor neuron and a postsynaptic muscle cell. NMJs in most vertebrate species share many essential features; however, some differences distinguish human NMJs from others. This review will describe the pre- and postsynaptic structures of human NMJs and compare them to NMJs of laboratory animals. We will focus on age-dependent declines in function and changes in the structure of human NMJs. Furthermore, we will describe insights into the aging process revealed from mouse models of accelerated aging. In addition, we will compare aging phenotypes to other human pathologies that cause impairments of pre- and postsynaptic structures at NMJs. Finally, we will discuss potential intervention approaches for attenuating age-related NMJ dysfunction and sarcopenia in humans.</p>

Objectives<p>To investigate the clinical value of non-invasive ultrasound imaging in the evaluation of brain death caused by traumatic brain injury.</p>Methods<p>Thirty-four patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury were admitted to hospital within 48 h after injury. All patients were monitored intracranial pressure, transcranial Doppler, echocardiography examination, collection intracranial pressure, MCA-Vs, MCA-Vd, MCA-Vm, EF, LVMPI, RVMPI and other indicators, and combined with clinical conditions and other related data for comparative study and statistical analysis.</p>Results<p>The blood flow spectrum was characterized by diastolic retrograde blood flow spectrum pattern and nail waveform spectrum shape when the patient had clinical brain death. For the parameters of transcranial Doppler, there were significant differences in MCA-Vm and PI between clinical brain death group and normal control group (P &lt; 0.05). For the parameters of echocardiography, there were statistically significant differences in EF, LVMPI, and RVMPI between clinical brain death group and normal control group (P &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>Non-invasive dynamic monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics and cardiac function parameters in patients with severe craniocerebral injury can provide a high accuracy and reliability for the preliminary diagnosis of brain death in patients with severe craniocerebral injury. It is helpful for early evaluation of prognosis and provides effective monitoring methods and guidance for clinical treatment.</p>

<p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been investigated as a treatment option for patients with refractory psychiatric illness. Over the past two decades, neuroimaging developments have helped to advance the field, particularly the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractographic reconstruction of white-matter pathways. In this article, we review translational considerations and how DTI and tractography have been used to improve targeting during DBS surgery for depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>

Background<p>Childhood obesity has become a global epidemic and the etiology of maladaptive ingestive behavior in children warrants further research. Mounting evidence suggests that the caudate is associated with body weight gain and obesity in adults. In adolescents, however, how caudate-related neural networks are associated with body weight gain is unclear because their central nervous systems are still developing.</p>Objectives<p>The current longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that caudate-related neural networks have a role in weight gain in adolescents.</p>Methods<p>The study included 20 healthy adolescents with a mean age of 17.5 ± 2.0 years and a mean body mass index of 20.6 ± 2.1 who underwent baseline rs-fMRI then follow-up rs-fMRI approximately 1 year later. Body mass index (BMI) was measured at both timepoints. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was utilized to analyze caudate-related functional connectivity (FC) using the caudate as a seed. Associations between caudate-related FC and BMI at baseline were assessed, as were associations between change in BMI and caudate-related FC between baseline and follow-up.</p>Results<p>At baseline, greater caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex FC was correlated with lower BMI (family wise error-corrected p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the baseline, increased FC in the caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex at follow up were negatively associated with increased BMI (p &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>Given that the lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate are associated with inhibitory control, the caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex FC may have a preventive effect on weight gain in adolescents. The results of the current study suggest that developing inhibitory control would lead to the prevention of childhood obesity.</p>

<p>Healthy aging is associated with deficits in focused and sustained attention and executive functions. However, cognitive training (CT) provides a promising method to counteract these deficits. In the present randomized controlled study, we examined to what extent CT regimes can improve attention, verbal skills, and inhibition capacities. Over a period of 16 weeks, healthy older adults (65 years and older, mean: 70 years) received a trainer-guided multidomain paper-and-pencil and computerized CT. Pre- and post-training, a battery of psychometric tests was applied that measured the critical functions. This study used two control groups: a passive control and an active control group performing a relaxation training. Compared to a passive control group, the CT led to enhanced performance in the attentional endurance test and the interference list of the Stroop test, whereas no benefits in verbal and crystalized tests were found. Similar effects were found on the attentional endurance compared to the active control group. Additionally, word fluency was enhanced after CT, but the improvement in the Stroop test did not reach significance compared to the active control. The contents of CT were dissimilar to the psychometric tests showing far transfer, whereas no transfer to attentional or memory functions in the daily life assessed by the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire was found. This demonstrates specific gains of multidomain CT on cognitive functions not explicitly trained and lack of transfer to daily activities.</p>

<p>Repeated practice is fundamental to the acquisition of skills, which is typically accompanied by increasing reliability of neural representations that manifested as more stable activation patterns for the trained stimuli. However, large-scale neural pattern induced by learning has been rarely studied. Here, we investigated whether global connectivity patterns became more reliable as a result of motor learning using a novel analysis of the multivariate pattern of functional connectivity (MVPC). Human participants were trained with a finger-tapping motor task for five consecutive days and went through Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning before and after training. We found that motor learning increased the whole-brain MVPC stability of the primary motor cortex (M1) when participants performed the trained sequence, while no similar effects were observed for the untrained sequence. Moreover, the increase of MVPC stability correlated with participants’ improvement in behavioral performance. These findings suggested that the acquisition of motor skills was supported by the increased connectivity pattern stability between the M1 and the rest of the brain. In summary, our study not only suggests global neural pattern stabilization as a neural signature for effective learning but also advocates applying the MVPC analysis to reveal mechanisms of distributed network reorganization supporting various types of learning.</p>

<p>In this paper we investigate the active inference framework as a means to enable autonomous behavior in artificial agents. Active inference is a theoretical framework underpinning the way organisms act and observe in the real world. In active inference, agents act in order to minimize their so called free energy, or prediction error. Besides being biologically plausible, active inference has been shown to solve hard exploration problems in various simulated environments. However, these simulations typically require handcrafting a generative model for the agent. Therefore we propose to use recent advances in deep artificial neural networks to learn generative state space models from scratch, using only observation-action sequences. This way we are able to scale active inference to new and challenging problem domains, whilst still building on the theoretical backing of the free energy principle. We validate our approach on the mountain car problem to illustrate that our learnt models can indeed trade-off instrumental value and ambiguity. Furthermore, we show that generative models can also be learnt using high-dimensional pixel observations, both in the OpenAI Gym car racing environment and a real-world robotic navigation task. Finally we show that active inference based policies are an order of magnitude more sample efficient than Deep Q Networks on RL tasks.</p>

<p>Acupuncturing the ST36 acupoint can evoke the response of the sensory nervous system, which is translated into output electrical signals in the spinal dorsal root. Neural response activities, especially synchronous spike events, evoked by different acupuncture manipulations have remarkable differences. In order to identify these network collaborative activities, we analyze the underlying spike correlation in the synchronous spike event. In this paper, we adopt a log-linear model to describe network response activities evoked by different acupuncture manipulations. Then the state-space model and Bayesian theory are used to estimate network spike correlations. Two sets of simulation data are used to test the effectiveness of the estimation algorithm and the model goodness-of-fit. In addition, simulation data are also used to analyze the relationship between spike correlations and synchronous spike events. Finally, we use this method to identify network spike correlations evoked by four different acupuncture manipulations. Results show that reinforcing manipulations (twirling reinforcing and lifting-thrusting reinforcing) can evoke the third-order spike correlation but reducing manipulations (twirling reducing and lifting-thrusting reducing) does not. This is the main reason why synchronous spikes evoked by reinforcing manipulations are more abundant than reducing manipulations.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a term that describes one form of regulated non-apoptotic cell death. It is triggered by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides. Emerging evidence suggests a link between ferroptosis and the pathophysiological processes of neurological disorders, including stroke, degenerative diseases, neurotrauma, and cancer. Hemorrhagic stroke, also known as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), belongs to a devastating illness for its high level in morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are few established treatments and limited knowledge about the mechanisms of post-ICH neuronal death. The secondary brain damage after ICH is mainly attributed to oxidative stress and hemoglobin lysate, including iron, which leads to irreversible damage to neurons. Therefore, ferroptosis is becoming a common trend in research of neuronal death after ICH. Accumulative data suggest that the inhibition of ferroptosis may effectively prevent neuronal ferroptosis, thereby reducing secondary brain damage after ICH in animal models. Ferroptosis has a close relationship with oxidative damage and iron metabolism. This review reveals the pathological pathways and regulation mechanism of ferroptosis following ICH and then offers potential intervention strategies to mitigate neuron death and dysfunction after ICH.</p>

<p>In the striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, necessary for various forms of behavioral plasticity, is triggered by the combined engagement of dopamine D1 and ionotropic glutamate receptors. In this study, we investigated the potential crosstalk between glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TrkB inputs to ERK cascade by using an ex vivo model of mouse striatal slices. Our results confirmed that the concomitant stimulation of D1 and glutamate receptors is necessary to activate ERK in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Moreover, we found that ERK activation is significantly enhanced when BDNF is co-applied either with glutamate or the D1 agonist SKF38393, supporting the idea of possible integration between BDNF, glutamate, and D1R-mediated signaling. Interestingly, ERK activation via BDNF-TrkB is upregulated upon blockade of either AMPAR/NMDAR or D1 receptors, suggesting a negative regulatory action of these two neurotransmitter systems on BDNF-mediated signaling. However, the observed enhancement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation does not result in corresponding downstream signaling changes at the nuclear level. Conversely, the TrkB antagonist cyclotraxin B partially prevents glutamate- and D1-mediated ERK activation. Altogether, these results suggest a complex and unexpected interaction among dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and BDNF receptor systems to modulate the ERK pathway in striatal neurons.</p>

<p>Backgrounds: Aging-related impairment of cerebral blood flow regulation leads to the disruption of neuronal micro-environmental homeostasis. Anesthetics should be carefully selected for aging patients since they have less cognition capacity. Effects and mechanisms of propofol or isoflurane have been widely investigated. However, how different combinations of propofol and isoflurane affect neurons and the mechanism still needs to be demonstrated.</p><p>Methods: We cultured rat hippocampal neurons and established a hypoxic injury model to imitate the micro-environment of aging brains. Three different combinations of propofol and isoflurane were applied to find out an optimum group via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, real-time qPCR, and immunofluorescence of key proteins. Then BiP was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to explore the mechanism of how isoflurane and propofol affect neurons. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence. To detect GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 subunit proteostasis and its function, real-time qPCR, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot were carried out.</p><p>Results: Hypoxic neurons showed no different changes on cell viability, LDH leakage, and ER stress after treatment with 1% isoflurane and 1.2 μg/ml of propofol. Hypoxic neurons showed a sharp increase of LDH leakage and ER stress and a decrease of cell viability after treatment with 1.4% isoflurane and 0.6 μg/ml of propofol or 0.5% isoflurane and 1.8 μg/ml of propofol. After knockdown of BiP, the application of 1% isoflurane and 1.2 μg/ml of propofol led to the decrease of GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 subunit protein content and viability of cell, as well as aggravation of ER stress.</p><p>Conclusion: A combination of 1% isoflurane and 1.2 μg/ml of propofol causes the least damage than do other dosages of both two drugs, and endogenous BiP plays an important role in this process.</p>

<p>Visual and auditory brain network connectivity decline with age, but less is known about age effects on vestibular functional connectivity and its association with behavior. We assessed age differences in the connectivity of the vestibular cortex with other sensory brain regions, both during rest and during vestibular stimulation. We then assessed the relationship between vestibular connectivity and postural stability. A sample of seventeen young and fifteen older adults participated in our study. We assessed the amount of body sway in performing the Romberg balance task, with degraded somatosensory and visual inputs. The results showed no significant difference in balance performance between age groups. However, functional connectivity analyses revealed a main effect of age and condition, suggesting that vestibular connectivity was higher in young adults than older adults, and vestibular connectivity increased from resting state to stimulation trials. Surprisingly, young adults who exhibited higher connectivity during stimulation also had greater body sway. This suggests that young adults who exhibit better balance are those who respond more selectively to vestibular inputs. This correlation is non-significant in older adults, suggesting that the relationship between vestibular functional connectivity and postural stability differs with age.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63274">Efficient chromatin accessibility mapping <i>in situ</i> by nucleosome-tethered tagmentation</a></h4>

Chromatin accessibility mapping is a powerful approach to identify potential regulatory elements. A popular example is ATAC-seq, whereby Tn5 transposase inserts sequencing adapters into accessible DNA ('tagmentation'). CUT&amp;Tag is a tagmentation-based epigenomic profiling method in which antibody tethering of Tn5 to a chromatin epitope of interest profiles specific chromatin features in small samples and single cells. Here we show that by simply modifying the tagmentation conditions for histone H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 CUT&amp;Tag, antibody-tethered tagmentation of accessible DNA sites is redirected to produce chromatin accessibility maps that are indistinguishable from the best ATAC-seq maps. Thus, chromatin accessibility maps can be produced in parallel with CUT&amp;Tag maps of other epitopes with all steps from nuclei to amplified sequencing-ready libraries performed in single PCR tubes in the laboratory or on a home workbench. As H3K4 methylation is produced by transcription at promoters and enhancers, our method identifies transcription-coupled accessible regulatory sites.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61503">Structure of the human core transcription-export complex reveals a hub for multivalent interactions</a></h4>

The export of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm requires the conserved and essential transcription and export (TREX) complex (THO–UAP56/DDX39B–ALYREF). TREX selectively binds mRNA maturation marks and licenses mRNA for nuclear export by loading the export factor NXF1–NXT1. How TREX integrates these marks and achieves high selectivity for mature mRNA is poorly understood. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human THO–UAP56/DDX39B complex at 3.3 Å resolution. The seven-subunit THO–UAP56/DDX39B complex multimerizes into a 28-subunit tetrameric assembly, suggesting that selective recognition of mature mRNA is facilitated by the simultaneous sensing of multiple, spatially distant mRNA regions and maturation marks. Two UAP56/DDX39B RNA helicases are juxtaposed at each end of the tetramer, which would allow one bivalent ALYREF protein to bridge adjacent helicases and regulate the TREX–mRNA interaction. Our structural and biochemical results suggest a conserved model for TREX complex function that depends on multivalent interactions between proteins and mRNA.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61467">Structural insights into the nucleic acid remodeling mechanisms of the yeast THO-Sub2 complex</a></h4>

The yeast THO complex is recruited to active genes and interacts with the RNA-dependent ATPase Sub2 to facilitate the formation of mature export-competent mRNPs and to prevent the co-transcriptional formation of RNA:DNA-hybrid-containing structures. How THO-containing complexes function at the mechanistic level is unclear. Here, we elucidated a 3.4Å resolution structure of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> THO-Sub2 by cryo-electron microscopy. THO subunits Tho2 and Hpr1 intertwine to form a platform that is bound by Mft1, Thp2, and Tex1. The resulting complex homodimerizes in an asymmetric fashion, with a Sub2 molecule attached to each protomer. The homodimerization interfaces serve as a fulcrum for a seesaw-like movement concomitant with conformational changes of the Sub2 ATPase. The overall structural architecture and topology suggest the molecular mechanisms of nucleic acid remodeling during mRNA biogenesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61265">Increased processing of SINE B2 ncRNAs unveils a novel type of transcriptome deregulation in amyloid beta neuropathology</a></h4>

The functional importance of many non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) generated by repetitive elements and their connection with pathologic processes remains elusive. B2 RNAs, a class of ncRNAs of the B2 family of SINE repeats, mediate through their processing the transcriptional activation of various genes in response to stress. Here we show that this response is dysfunctional during amyloid beta toxicity and pathology in the mouse hippocampus due to increased levels of B2 RNA processing, leading to constitutively elevated B2 RNA target gene expression and high <i>Trp53</i> levels. Evidence indicates that Hsf1, a master regulator of stress response, mediates B2 RNA processing in hippocampal cells, and is activated during amyloid toxicity, accelerating the processing of SINE RNAs and gene hyper-activation. Our study reveals that in mouse, SINE RNAs constitute a novel pathway deregulated in amyloid beta pathology, with potential implications for similar cases in the human brain, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

<i>Trans</i>-acting DNA variants may specifically affect mRNA or protein levels of genes located throughout the genome. However, prior work compared <i>trans</i>-acting loci mapped in separate studies, many of which had limited statistical power. Here, we developed a CRISPR-based system for simultaneous quantification of mRNA and protein of a given gene via dual fluorescent reporters in single, live cells of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. In large populations of recombinant cells from a cross between two genetically divergent strains, we mapped 86 <i>trans</i>-acting loci affecting the expression of ten genes. Less than 20% of these loci had concordant effects on mRNA and protein of the same gene. Most loci influenced protein but not mRNA of a given gene. One locus harbored a premature stop variant in the <i>YAK1</i> kinase gene that had specific effects on protein or mRNA of dozens of genes. These results demonstrate complex, post-transcriptional genetic effects on gene expression.

DNA viruses in the family <i>Poxviridae</i> encode poxin enzymes that degrade the immune second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP to inhibit cGAS-STING immunity in mammalian cells. The closest homologs of poxin exist in the genomes of insect viruses suggesting a key mechanism of cGAS-STING evasion may have evolved outside of mammalian biology. Here we use a biochemical and structural approach to discover a broad family of 369 poxins encoded in diverse viral and animal genomes and define a prominent role for 2′3′-cGAMP cleavage in metazoan host-pathogen conflict. Structures of insect poxins reveal unexpected homology to flavivirus proteases and enable identification of functional self-cleaving poxins in RNA virus polyproteins. Our data suggest widespread 2′3′-cGAMP signaling in insect antiviral immunity and explain how a family of cGAS-STING evasion enzymes evolved from viral proteases through gain of secondary nuclease activity. Poxin acquisition by poxviruses demonstrates the importance of environmental connections in shaping evolution of mammalian pathogens.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59157">Conservation of peripheral nervous system formation mechanisms in divergent ascidian embryos</a></h4>

Ascidians with very similar embryos but highly divergent genomes are thought to have undergone extensive developmental system drift. We compared, in four species (<i>Ciona</i> and <i>Phallusia</i> for Phlebobranchia, <i>Molgula</i> and <i>Halocynthia </i>for Stolidobranchia), gene expression and gene regulation for a network of six transcription factors regulating peripheral nervous system (PNS) formation in <i>Ciona</i>. All genes, but one in <i>Molgula</i>, were expressed in the PNS with some differences correlating with phylogenetic distance. Cross-species transgenesis indicated strong levels of conservation, except in <i>Molgula</i>, in gene regulation despite lack of sequence conservation of the enhancers. Developmental system drift in ascidians is thus higher for gene regulation than for gene expression; and is impacted not only by phylogenetic distance, but also in a clade-specific manner and unevenly within a network. Finally, considering that <i>Molgula</i> is divergent in our analyses, this suggests deep conservation of developmental mechanisms in ascidians after 390 My of separate evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55800">Sepsis impedes EAE disease development and diminishes autoantigen-specific naïve CD4 T cells</a></h4>

Evaluation of sepsis-induced immunoparalysis has highlighted how decreased lymphocyte number/function contribute to worsened infection/cancer. Yet an interesting contrast exists with autoimmune disease development, wherein diminishing pathogenic effectors may benefit the post-septic host. Within this framework the impact of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis on the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was explored. Notably, CLP mice have delayed onset and reduced disease severity, relative to sham mice. Reduction in disease severity was associated with reduced number, but not function, of autoantigen (MOG)-specific pathogenic CD4 T cells in the CNS during disease and draining lymph node during priming. Numerical deficits of CD4 T cell effectors are associated with the loss of MOG-specific naive precursors. Critically, transfer of MOG-TCR transgenic (2D2) CD4 T cells after, but not before, CLP led to EAE disease equivalent to sham mice. Thus, broad impairment of antigenic responses, including autoantigens, is a hallmark of sepsis-induced immunoparalysis.

The human brain is a uniquely vulnerable organ as interruption in fuel supply leads to acute cognitive impairment on rapid time scales. The reasons for this vulnerability are not well understood, but nerve terminals are likely loci of this vulnerability as they do not store sufficient ATP molecules and must synthesize them on-demand during activity or suffer acute degradation in performance. The requirements for on-demand ATP synthesis however depends in part on the magnitude of resting metabolic rates. We show here that, at rest, synaptic vesicle (SV) pools are a major source of presynaptic basal energy consumption. This basal metabolism arises from SV-resident V-ATPases compensating for a hidden resting H+ efflux from the SV lumen. We show that this steady-state H+ efflux is 1) mediated by vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, 2) independent of the SV cycle, 3) accounts for ~half of the resting synaptic energy consumption and 4) contributes to nerve terminal intolerance of fuel deprivation.

When neurons engage in intense periods of activity, the consequent increase in energy demand can be counteracted by the coordinated activation of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. However, the trigger for glycolytic activation is unknown and the role for Ca2+ in the mitochondrial responses has been debated. Using genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensors and NAD(P)H autofluorescence imaging in acute hippocampal slices, here we find that Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria is responsible for the buildup of mitochondrial NADH, probably through Ca2+ activation of dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle. In the cytosol, we do not observe a role for the Ca2+/calmodulin signaling pathway, or AMPK, in mediating the rise in glycolytic NADH in response to acute stimulation. Calcium, nevertheless, is a major contributor to glycolysis, although not strictly necessary. Aerobic glycolysis in neurons is triggered mainly by the energy demand resulting from either Na+ or Ca2+ extrusion.

Background: The brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) reveal increased cellular membrane levels of cholesterol. Correspondingly, we previously showed that elevating levels of membrane cholesterol in neuronal cultures recapitulates early AD phenotypes including excessive cleavage of amyloid beta peptides from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Here we aimed to evaluate how the presence of a cholesterol-binding site (CBS) in the transmembrane and juxtamembrane regions of APP regulates its processing. Methods: We generated seven single and two double APP mutants at amino acid positions 22, 26, 28, 29, 33, 39 of the Abeta sequence changing the charge and/or hydrophobicity of the targeted amino acids. HEK293T cells were transfected with APP constructs and secreted Abeta peptides were measured using ELISA and mass spectrometry (MS). APP processing in normal and high cholesterol condition, and endocytosis were assessed in stably expressing APPwt and APPK28A HEK293T clones. Finally, we measured the binding of synthetic peptides derived from the Abeta sequence to cholesterol-rich exosomes purified from control HEK293T cells. Results: Most mutations triggered a reduction in the production of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides, whereas only juxtamembrane mutants resulted in the generation of shorter Abeta peptides. We confirmed by mass spectrometry this specific change in the profile of secreted Abeta peptides for the most characteristic APPK28A mutant. A transient increase of plasma membrane cholesterol enhanced the production of Abeta40 by APPWT, an effect absent with APPK28A. The enzymatic activity of alpha, beta and gamma-secretases remained unchanged in cells expressing APPK28A. Similarly, APPK28A subcellular localization in early endosomes did not differ to APPWT. Finally, WT but not CBS mutant Abeta derived peptides bound to cholesterol-rich exosomes. Conclusions: Taken together, these data reveal a major role of the juxtamembrane region of APP in binding to cholesterol and accordingly in the regulation of APP processing. Binding of cholesterol to K28 could staple APP to the juxtamembrane region thereby permitting access to gamma-secretase cleavage at positions 40-42. The APPK28 mutant would lie deeper in the membrane, facilitating the production of shorter Abeta peptides and unveiling this specific region as a novel target for reducing the production of toxic Abeta species.

Opioid abuse has devastating effects on patients, their families, and society. Withdrawal symptoms are severely unpleasant, prolonged, and frequently hinder recovery or lead to relapse. The sharp increase in abuse and overdoses arising from the illicit use of potent and rapidly-acting synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, highlights the urgency of understanding the withdrawal mechanisms related to these drugs. Progress is impeded by inconsistent reports on opioid withdrawal in different preclinical models. Here, using rats and mice of both sexes, we quantified withdrawal behaviors during spontaneous and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, following two weeks of intermittent fentanyl exposure. We found that both mice and rats lost weight during exposure and showed increased signs of distress during spontaneous and naloxone precipitated withdrawal. However, these species differed in their expression of withdrawal associated pain, a key contributor to relapse in humans. Spontaneous or ongoing pain was preferentially expressed in rats in both withdrawal conditions, while no change was observed in mice. In contrast, withdrawal associated thermal hyperalgesia was found only in mice. These data suggest that rats and mice diverge in how they experience withdrawal and which aspects of the human condition they most accurately model. These differences highlight each species strengths as model systems and can inform experimental design in studies of opioid withdrawal.

Background Expressed emotion (EE) measures the emotion of the caregivers of persons with schizophrinia and is predictive of symptom levels in a range of medical and psychiatric conditions. It is worth to assess expressed emotion and associated factors among caregivers of patient with schizophrenia in Ethiopia since there is limited data on this issue in this part of the world. Objective To assess the status of expressed emotions and selecte patients clinical factors among care givers of patients with schizophrenia attending psychiatry oupatient unit of Jimma university medical center, South west, Ethiopia, 2019. Method A cross-sectional study design employed involving 422 caregivers of schizophrenic patients using consecutive sampling technique. Data was collected using structured interviewer administrated questionnaires (Family Questioners) which assess the level of expressed emotion, entered into Epidata 4.4 and analyzed by Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25. Descripitive statistics used to summerize data, bivariate logistic regression was done to identify candidate variables for multivariable logistic regressions and the association between expressed emotion and predictor variables was identified by using multiple logistic regression model. Results High expressed emotion was observed in 43.6% of respondents. Caring for schizophrenic patients for about 6-8 years, having 3-4 episodes of the illness was significantly associated with high expressed emotion. Conclusions This study revealed that there is high status of care givers expressed emotion compared to other studies. It also showed that number of episode of illnesses had significant association with high caregivers expressed emotion. Health care systems, which provide interventions for patients with schizophrenia, need to design proper strategy to address caregivers need as well.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex, progressive neuroinflammatory disease associated with autoimmunity. Currently, effective therapeutic strategy was poorly found in MS. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is widely used to study the pathogenesis of MS. Previous studies have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem Cells (BMSCs) transplantation could treat EAE animal models, but the mechanism was divergent. Here, we systematically evaluated whether BMSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to alleviate the symptoms of EAE mice. We used Immunofluorescence staining to detect MAP-2 neurons marker, GFAP astrocytes marker, and MBP oligodendrocytes marker expression to evaluate whether BMSCs can differentiate. The effect of BMSCs transplantation on inflammatory cell invasion and demyelination in EAE mice were detected by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&amp;E) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining. Inflammatory factors expression was detected by ELISA and RT-qPCR. Our results showed that BMSCs could be induced to differentiate into neuron cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte in vivo and in vitro. In addition, BMSCs transplant improved the survival rate and weight, and reduced neurological function scores and disease incidence of EAE mice. Moreover, BMSCs transplant alleviated the inflammation and demyelination of EAE mice. Finally, we found that BMSCs transplantation down-regulated the expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-, IL-1{beta} and IFN-{gamma}, and up-regulated the expression levels of anti-inflammatory factors IL-10 and TGF-{beta}. In conclusion, this study found that BMSCs could alleviate the inflammatory response and demyelination in EAE mice, which may be achieved by the differentiation of BMSCs into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in EAE mice.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease associated with various gene mutations. Recent genetic and clinical studies report that mutations of the epigenetic gene ASH1L are highly associated with human ASD and intellectual disability (ID). However, the causal link between ASH1L mutations and ASD/ID remains undetermined. Here we show loss of ASH1L in developing mouse brains is sufficient to cause multiple developmental defects, core autistic-like behaviors, and impaired cognitive memory. Gene expression analyses uncover critical roles of ASH1L in regulating gene expression during neural cell development. Thus, our study establishes a new ASD/ID mouse model revealing the critical function of ASH1L in normal brain development, a causality between Ash1L mutations and ASD/ID-like behaviors in mice, and potential molecular mechanisms linking Ash1L mutations to brain functional abnormalities.

Chronic social defeat (CSD) in mice has been increasingly employed in experimental resilience research. Particularly, the degree of CSD-induced social avoidance is used to classify animals into resilient (socially non-avoidant) versus susceptible (avoidant). Inspired by human data pointing to threat-safety discrimination and responsiveness to extinction training of aversive memories as characteristics of resilient individuals, we here describe a translationally informed stratification which identified three phenotypic subgroups of mice following CSD: the Discriminating-avoiders, characterised by successful social threat-safety discrimination and successful extinction of social avoidance; the Indiscriminate-avoiders, showing aversive response generalisation, and the Non-avoiders (absence of social avoidance) displaying impaired conditioned learning. Furthermore, and supporting the biological validity of our approach, we uncovered subgroup-specific transcriptional signatures in classical fear conditioning and anxiety-related brain regions. Our reconceptualisation of resilience in mice refines the currently used dichotomous classification and contributes to advancing future translational approaches.

Processing capabilities for many low-level visual features are experientially malleable, aiding sighted organisms in adapting to dynamic environments. Explicit instructions to attend a specific visual field location influence retinotopic visuocortical activity, amplifying responses to stimuli appearing at cued spatial positions. It remains undetermined, however, both how such prioritization affects surrounding non-prioritized locations, and if a given retinotopic spatial position can attain enhanced cortical representation through experience rather than instruction. This work examined visuocortical response changes as human observers learned, through differential classical conditioning, to associate specific on-screen locations with aversive outcomes. Using dense-array EEG and pupillometry, we tested the pre-registered hypotheses of either sharpening or generalization around an aversively associated location following a single conditioning session. Specifically, competing hypotheses tested if mean response changes would take the form of a gaussian (generalization) or difference-of-gaussian (sharpening) distribution over spatial positions, peaking at the viewing location paired with a noxious noise. Occipital 15 Hz steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) responses were selectively heightened when viewing aversively paired locations and displayed a non-linear, difference-of-gaussian profile across neighboring locations, consistent with suppressive surround modulation of non-prioritized positions. Measures of alpha band (8 - 12.8 Hz) activity and pupil diameter also exhibited selectively heightened responses to noise-paired locations but did not evince any difference across the non-paired locations. These results indicate that visuocortical spatial representations are sharpened in response to location-specific aversive conditioning, while top-down influences indexed by alpha power reduction exhibit all-or-none modulation.

Dendritic spines, small protrusions of the dendrites, enlarge upon LTP induction, linking morphological and functional properties. Although the role of actin in spine enlargement has been well studied, little is known about its relationship with mechanical membrane properties, such as membrane tension, which is involved in many cell processes, like exocytosis. Here, we use a 3D model of the dendritic spine to investigate how polymerization of actin filaments can effectively elevate the membrane tension to trigger exocytosis in a domain close to the tip of the spine. Moreover, we show that the same pool of actin promotes full membrane fusion after exocytosis and spine stabilization.

It has been showed recently that the human brain has dedicated networks for perception of human bodies in synchronous motion or in situation of interaction. However, below motion and interaction, how does the brain process a simple plurality of humans in close positioning? We used EEG frequency tagging technique to investigate integration of human dyad elements in a global percept. We presented to participants images of two silhouettes, a man and a woman flickering at different frequencies (5.88 vs. 7.14 Hz). Clear response at these stimulation frequencies reflected response to dyad parts, both when the dyad was presented upright and inverted. However, an emerging intermodulation component (7.14 + 5.88 = 13.02 Hz), a nonlinear response regarded as an objective signature of holistic representation, was significantly enhanced in upright relatively to inverted position. Inversion effect was significant only for the intermodulation component as opposed to stimulation frequencies revealing that dyad configuration perception overrides structural properties of dyad elements. Inversion effect was not significant for a pair of non-human objects. Our results show that merely facing two humans in close positioning leads to perceptually bind them and suggest that the perception of individuals is of different nature when they form a plurality.

The regulation of food intake, a sine qua non requirement for survival, thoroughly shapes feeding and energy balance by integrating both homeostatic and hedonic values of food. Unfortunately, the widespread access to palatable food has led to the development of feeding habits that are independent from metabolic needs. Among these, binge eating (BE) is characterized by uncontrolled voracious eating. While reward deficit seems to be a major contributor of BE, the physiological and molecular underpinnings of BE establishment remain elusive. Here, we combined a physiologically relevant BE mouse model with multi scale in vivo integrative approaches to explore the functional connection between the gut-brain axis and the reward and homeostatic brain structures. Our results show that BE elicits compensatory adaptations requiring the gut-to-brain axis which, through the vagus nerve, relies on the permissive actions of peripheral endocannabinoids (eCBs) signaling. Selective inhibition of peripheral CB1 receptors resulted in a vagus-dependent increased hypothalamic activity, modified metabolic efficiency, and dampened activity of mesolimbic dopamine circuit, altogether leading to the suppression of palatable eating. We provide compelling evidence for a yet unappreciated physiological integrative mechanism by which variations of peripheral eCBs control the activity of the vagus nerve, thereby in turn gating the additive responses of both homeostatic and hedonic brain circuits which govern homeostatic and reward-driven feeding. In conclusion, we reveal that vagus-mediated eCBs/CB1R functions represent an interesting and innovative target to modulate energy balance and food-reward disorders.

Sensory processing relies on the correct development of circuits connecting thalamus and cortex. Visual corticothalamic axons (CTAs) invade the thalamic dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus following an early postnatal time-regulated programme in mice. Retinal spontaneous activity influences the thalamic incursion of CTAs, however, the perinatal thalamus also generates intrinsic patterns of spontaneous activity whose role in modulating afferent connectivity remains unknown. Here, we found that patterned spontaneous activity in the dLGN is critical for the proper spatial and temporal innervation of CTAs. When the spontaneous dLGN activity is disrupted in vivo, CTA innervation is severely delayed until eye-opening. Indeed, visual input influenced the temporal development of CTAs by modulating thalamic activity, as embryonic enucleation enhanced thalamic calcium waves and accelerated the entrance of CTAs into the dLGN. Our results show that patterned spontaneous activity in the perinatal thalamus is a key element driving the wiring of visual circuits.

Degeneracy in biological systems refers to a many-to-one mapping between physical structures and their functional (including psychological) outcomes. Despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon, traditional analytical tools for modeling degeneracy in neuroscience are extremely limited. In this study, we generated synthetic datasets to describe three situations of degeneracy in fMRI data to demonstrate the limitations of the current univariate approach. We describe a novel computational approach for the analysis referred to as neural topographic factor analysis (NTFA). NTFA is designed to capture variations in neural activity across task conditions and participants. The advantage of this discovery-oriented approach is to reveal whether and how experimental trials and participants cluster into task conditions and participant groups. We applied NTFA on simulated data, revealing the appropriate degeneracy assumption in all three situations and demonstrating NTFA's utility in uncovering degeneracy. Lastly, we discussed the importance of testing degeneracy in fMRI and the implications of applying NTFA to do so.

Recent studies have established that one-trial-back decision policies (Win-Stay/Lose-Shift) and measures of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g. learning rate, can explain how animals perform two-armed bandit tasks. In many published studies, outcomes reverse after one option is selected repeatedly (e.g. 8 selections in a row), and the primary measure of performance is the number of reversals completed. Performance and Win-Stay likelihood are confounded by using recent performance to drive reversals. An alternative design reverses outcomes across options over fixed blocks of trials. We used this blocked design and tested rats in a spatial two-armed bandit task. We analyzed performance using Win-Stay/Lose-Shift (WSLS) metrics and a RL algorithm. We found that WSLS policies remain stable with increasing reward uncertainty, while choice accuracy decreases. Within test sessions, learning rates increased as rats adapted their strategies over the first few reversals but inverse temperature remains stable. We found that muscimol inactivation of medial orbital cortex (mOFC) mediates task performance and negative feedback sensitivity. Finally, we examined the role of the adrenergic system in bandit performance, and found yohimbine (2 mg/kg) dramatically decreased sensitivity to positive feedback, leading to decreases in accuracy and inverse temperature. These effects are partially dependent on a2 adrenergic receptors in OFC. Our findings demonstrate a correspondence between reward schedule, WSLS policies and RL metrics in a task design that is free of the confound between Wins and reversals, and that the noradrenergic influence of mOFC on WSLS policy is dissociable from the regions general role in cognitive flexibility.

Pain is a uniquely individual experience. Previous studies have highlighted changes in brain activation and morphology associated with inter- and intra-individual pain perception. In this study we sought to characterize brain mechanisms associated with individual differences in pain in a large sample of healthy participants (N = 101). Pain ratings varied widely across individuals. Moreover, individuals reported changes in pain evoked by small differences in stimulus intensity in a manner congruent with their pain sensitivity, further supporting the utility of subjective reporting as a measure of the true individual experience. However, brain activation related to inter-individual differences in pain was not detected, despite clear sensitivity of the BOLD signal to small differences in noxious stimulus intensities within individuals. These findings raise questions about the utility of fMRI as an objective measure to infer reported pain intensity.

Neurodegenerative disease pathologies have been reported in both grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) with different density distributions, an automated separation task of GM/WM would be extremely advantageous for aid in neuropathologic deep phenotyping. Standard segmentation methods typically involve manual annotations, where a trained researcher traces the delineation of GM/WM in ultra-high-resolution Whole Slide Images (WSIs). This method can be time-consuming and subjective, preventing the analysis of large amounts of WSIs in a scalable way. In this paper, we propose an automated segmentation pipeline combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module for segmenting GM/WM regions and a post-processing module to remove artifacts/residues of tissues as well as generate XML annotations that can be visualized via Aperio ImageScope. First, we investigate two baseline models for medical image segmentation: FCN, and U-Net. Then we propose a new patch-based approach, ResNet-Patch, to classify the GM/WM/background regions. In addition, we integrate a Neural Conditional Random Field (NCRF) module, ResNet-NCRF, to model and incorporate the spatial correlations among neighboring patches. Although their mechanisms are greatly different, both U-Net and ResNet-Patch/ResNet-NCRF achieve Intersection over Union (IoU) of more than 90% in GM and more than 80% in WM, while ResNet-Patch achieves 1% superior to U-Net with lower variance among various WSIs. ResNet-NCRF further improves the IoU by 3% for WM compared to ResNet-Patch before post-processing. We also apply gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to interpret the segmentation masks and provide clinical explanations and insights.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whether neuronal populations exhibit zero‐lag (in‐phase or in‐antiphase) functional connectivity is a fundamental question when conceptualizing communication between cell assemblies. It also has profound implications on how we assess such interactions. Given that the brain is a delayed network due to the finite conduction velocity of the electrical impulses traveling across its fibers, the existence of long‐distance zero‐lag functional connectivity may be considered improbable. However, in this study, using human intracranial recordings we demonstrate that most interhemispheric connectivity between homotopic cerebral regions is zero‐lagged and that this type of connectivity is ubiquitous. Volume conduction can be safely discarded as a confounding factor since it is known to drop almost completely within short interelectrode distances (&lt;20 mm) in intracranial recordings. This finding should guide future electrophysiological connectivity studies and highlight the importance of considering the role of zero‐lag connectivity in our understanding of communication between cell assemblies.</p>

<p>Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. This was achieved using an in vivo anterograde tracing technique from thoracolumbar (T13‐L3) dorsal root ganglia in female mice. Our key findings revealed that at least three distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve ending can be readily identified throughout multiple layers of the uterine wall; the vast majority of which are peptidergic (immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide; CGRP).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Major sensory innervation to the uterus is provided by spinal afferent nerves, whose cell bodies lie predominantly in thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Whilst the origin of the cell bodies of uterine spinal afferents is clear, the identity of their sensory endings has remained unknown. Hence, our major aim was to identify the location, morphology, and calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP)‐immunoreactivity of uterine spinal afferent endings supplied by thoracolumbar DRG. We also sought to determine the degree of uterine afferent innervation provided by the vagus nerve. Using an anterograde tracing technique, nulliparous female C57BL/6 mice were injected unilaterally with biotinylated dextran into thoracolumbar DRG (T13‐L3). After 7‐9 days, uterine horns were stained to visualize traced nerve axons and endings immunoreactive to CGRP. Whole uteri from a separate cohort of animals were injected with retrograde neuronal tracer (DiI) and dye uptake in nodose ganglia was examined. Anterogradely‐labelled axons innervated each uterine horn, these projected rostrally or caudally from their site of entry, branching to form varicose endings in the myometrium and/or vascular plexus. Most spinal afferent endings were CGRP‐immunoreactive and morphologically classified as “simple‐type”. Rarely, uterine nerve cell bodies were labelled in nodose ganglia. Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. Distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve endings were identified throughout multiple anatomical layers of the uterine wall. Compared to other visceral organs, uterine spinal afferent endings displayed noticeably less morphological diversity. Few neurons in nodose ganglia innervate the uterus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The present study investigated the morphological characteristics of subserosal afferent nerve endings with immunoreactivity for the P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3) in the rat stomach by immunohistochemistry of whole‐mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3 immunoreactivity was observed in subserosal nerve endings proximal and lateral to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into several lamellar processes to form net‐like complex structures that extended two‐dimensionally in every direction on the surface of the longitudinal smooth muscle layer. The axon terminals in the periphery of P2X3‐immunoreactive net‐like structures were flat and looped or leaf‐like in shape. Some net‐like lamellar structures and their axon terminals with P2X3 immunoreactivity were also immunoreactive for P2X2. P2X3‐immunoreactive nerve fibers forming net‐like terminal structures were closely surrounded by S100B‐immunoreactive terminal Schwann cells, whereas axon terminals twined around these cells and extended club‐, knob‐, or thread‐like protrusions in the surrounding tissues. Furthermore, a retrograde tracing method using fast blue dye indicated that most of these nerve endings originated from the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve. These results suggest that P2X3‐immunoreactive subserosal nerve endings have morphological characteristics of mechanoreceptors and contribute to sensation of a mechanical deformation of the distal antral wall associated with antral peristalsis.</p>

{beta}-arrestin-2 has been implicated in the mechanism of opioid-induced antinociceptive tolerance. G-protein-biased agonists with reduced {beta}-arrestin-2 activation are being investigated as safer alternatives to clinically-used opioids. Opioid-induced analgesic tolerance is classically considered as centrally-mediated, but recent reports implicate nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons as critical mediators in this process. Here, we investigated the role of {beta}-arrestin-2 in the mechanism of opioid tolerance in DRG nociceptive neurons using {beta}-arrestin-2 knockout mice and the G-protein-biased -opioid receptor agonist, TRV130. Whole-cell current-clamp electrophysiology experiments revealed that 15-18-hour overnight exposure to 10 {micro}M morphine in vitro induced acute tolerance in {beta}-arrestin-2 wild-type but not knockout DRG neurons. Furthermore, in wild-type DRG neurons circumventing {beta}-arrestin-2 activation by overnight treatment with 200 nM TRV130 attenuated tolerance. Similarly, in {beta}-arrestin-2 knockout male mice acute antinociceptive tolerance induced by 100 mg/kg morphine s.c. was prevented in the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay. Treatment with 30 mg/kg TRV130 s.c. also inhibited antinociceptive tolerance in wild-type mice. Alternately, in {beta}-arrestin-2 knockout DRG neurons tolerance induced by 7-day in vivo exposure to 50 mg morphine pellet was conserved. Likewise, {beta}-arrestin-2 deletion did not mitigate in vivo antinociceptive tolerance induced by 7-day exposure to 25 mg or 50 mg morphine pellet in both female or male mice, respectively. Consequently, these results indicated that {beta}-arrestin-2 mediates acute but not chronic opioid tolerance in DRG neurons and to antinociception. This suggests that opioid-induced antinociceptive tolerance may develop even in the absence of {beta}-arrestin-2 activation, and thus significantly affect the clinical utility of biased agonists.

Learned associations between stimuli in different sensory modalities can shape the way we perceive these stimuli (Mcgurk and Macdonald, 1976). During audio-visual associative learning, auditory cortex is thought to underlie multi-modal plasticity in visual cortex (McIntosh et al., 1998; Mishra et al., 2007; Zangenehpour and Zatorre, 2010). However, it is not well understood how processing in visual cortex is altered by an auditory stimulus that is predictive of a visual stimulus and what the mechanisms are that mediate such experience-dependent, audio-visual associations in sensory cortex. Here we describe a neural mechanism by which an auditory input can shape visual representations of behaviorally relevant stimuli through direct interactions between auditory and visual cortices. We show that the association of an auditory stimulus with a visual stimulus in a behaviorally relevant context leads to an experience-dependent suppression of visual responses in primary visual cortex (V1). Auditory cortex axons carry a mixture of auditory and retinotopically-matched visual input to V1, and optogenetic stimulation of these axons selectively suppresses V1 neurons responsive to the associated visual stimulus after, but not before, learning. Our results suggest that cross-modal associations can be stored in long-range cortical connections and that with learning these cross-modal connections function to suppress the responses to predictable input.

Neurexins (NRXNs) are among the key presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that regulate synapse function and formation via trans-synaptic interaction with postsynaptic ligands. Here, we generated cerebellar granule cell (CGC)-specific Nrxn triple-knockout (TKO) mice to allow the deletion of all NRXNs. Unexpectedly, most CGCs died in these mice. The requirement of NRNXs for cell survival was reproduced in cultured CGCs. We showed that the axons of cultured Nrxn TKO CGCs that were not in contact with the postsynaptic structure had defects in the formation of presynaptic protein cluster and action potential-induced Ca2+ influx. Additionally, these cells were impaired in the secretion from axons of depolarization-induced fluorescence-tagged brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the cell-survival defect was rescued by the application of BDNF. Our results suggest that CGC survival is maintained by autocrine neurotrophic factors, and that NRXNs organize the presynaptic protein clusters and the autocrine neurotrophic factor secretory machinery independent of contact with postsynaptic ligands.

Various types of sensory stimuli have been shown to induce calcium elevations in glia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the signalling pathways mediating sensory-evoked activity in glia in intact animals is still emerging. Here we demonstrate that during early development of the Xenopus laevis visual system, radial astrocytes in the optic tectum are highly responsive to sensory stimulation. Calcium transients occur spontaneously in radial astrocytes at rest and are abolished by silencing neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin. Visual stimulation drives temporally correlated increases in the activity patterns of neighbouring radial astrocytes. Following blockade of all glutamate receptors, visually-evoked calcium activity in radial astrocytes is enhanced, rather than suppressed, while the additional blockade of either glutamate transporters or sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX) fully prevents visually-evoked responses. Additionally, we demonstrate that blockade of NCX alone is sufficient to prevent visually-evoked responses in radial astrocytes, highlighting a pivotal role for NCX in glia during development.

Decoding the rich temporal dynamics of complex sounds such as speech is constrained by the underlying neuronal processing mechanisms. Oscillatory theories suggest the existence of one optimal perceptual performance regime at auditory stimulation rates in the delta to theta range (&lt;10 Hz), but reduced performance in the alpha range (10-14 Hz) is controversial. Additionally, the widely discussed motor system contribution to timing remains unclear. We measured rate discrimination thresholds between 4-15 Hz, and auditory-motor coupling strength was estimated through auditory-motor synchronization. In a Bayesian model comparison, high auditory-motor synchronizers showed a larger range of constant optimal temporal judgments than low synchronizers, with performance decreasing in the alpha range. This evidence for optimal auditory processing in the theta range is consistent with preferred oscillatory regimes in auditory cortex that compartmentalize stimulus encoding and processing. The findings suggest, remarkably, that increased auditory-motor interaction might extend such an optimal range towards faster rates.

<p>by Enrica Bianchi, Gavin J. Wright</p>

Sexual reproduction is such a successful way of creating progeny with subtle genetic variations that the vast majority of eukaryotic species use it. In mammals, it involves the formation of highly specialised cells: the sperm in males and the egg in females, each carrying the genetic inheritance of an individual. The interaction of sperm and egg culminates with the fusion of their cell membranes, triggering the molecular events that result in the formation of a new genetically distinct organism. Although we have a good cellular description of fertilisation in mammals, many of the molecules involved remain unknown, and especially the identity and role of cell surface proteins that are responsible for sperm–egg recognition, binding, and fusion. Here, we will highlight and discuss these gaps in our knowledge and how the role of some recently discovered sperm cell surface and secreted proteins contribute to our understanding of this fundamental process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EZvRCrmjJ6E" width="1" />

Metabolic reprogramming to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years. However, metabolic reprogramming for cancer metastasis has not been well elucidated. Here, we screened a subpopulation of breast cancer cells with highly metastatic capacity to the lung in mice and investigated the metabolic alternations by analyzing the metabolome and the transcriptome, which were confirmed in breast cancer cells, mouse models, and patients’ tissues. The effects and the mechanisms of nucleotide de novo synthesis in cancer metastasis were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In our study, we report an increased nucleotide de novo synthesis as a key metabolic hallmark in metastatic breast cancer cells and revealed that enforced nucleotide de novo synthesis was enough to drive the metastasis of breast cancer cells. An increased key metabolite of de novo synthesis, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), is able to generate more cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases PKG and downstream MAPK pathway, resulting in the increased tumor cell stemness and metastasis. Blocking de novo synthesis by silencing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) can effectively decrease the stemness of breast cancer cells and reduce the lung metastasis. More interestingly, in breast cancer patients, the level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine, is tightly correlated with patient’s survival. Our study uncovered that increased de novo synthesis is a metabolic hallmark of metastatic breast cancer cells and its metabolites can regulate the signaling pathway to promote the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qz0X2Ozyfyo" width="1" />

<p>by Jérémy Verneuil, Cécile Brocard, Virginie Trouplin, Laurent Villard, Julie Peyronnet-Roux, Frédéric Brocard</p>

The central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion is a set of pacemaker neurons endowed with inherent bursting driven by the persistent sodium current (<i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>). How they proceed to regulate the locomotor rhythm remained unknown. Here, in neonatal rodents, we identified a persistent potassium current critical in regulating pacemakers and locomotion speed. This current recapitulates features of the M-current (<i>I</i><sub>M</sub>): a subthreshold noninactivating outward current blocked by 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone dihydrochloride (XE991) and enhanced by <i>N</i>-(2-chloro-5-pyrimidinyl)-3,4-difluorobenzamide (ICA73). Immunostaining and mutant mice highlight an important role of Kv7.2-containing channels in mediating <i>I</i><sub>M</sub>. Pharmacological modulation of <i>I</i><sub>M</sub> regulates the emergence and the frequency regime of both pacemaker and CPG activities and controls the speed of locomotion. Computational models captured these results and showed how an interplay between <i>I</i><sub>M</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> endows the locomotor CPG with rhythmogenic properties. Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into how <i>I</i><sub>M</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> work in tandem to set the speed of locomotion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/9d4Muf1xKZ8" width="1" />

<p>Boolean satisfiability is a propositional logic problem of interest in
multiple fields, e.g., physics, mathematics, and computer science. Beyond a
field of research, instances of the SAT problem, as it is known, require
efficient solution methods in a variety of applications. It is the decision
problem of determining whether a Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,
believed to require exponentially growing time for an algorithm to solve for
the worst-case instances. Yet, the efficient solution of many classes of
Boolean formulae eludes even the most successful algorithms, not only for the
worst-case scenarios, but also for typical-case instances. Here, we introduce a
memory-assisted physical system (a digital memcomputing machine) that, when its
non-linear ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically, shows
evidence for polynomially-bounded scalability while solving "hard"
planted-solution instances of SAT, known to require exponential time to solve
in the typical case for both complete and incomplete algorithms. Furthermore,
we analytically demonstrate that the physical system can efficiently solve the
SAT problem in continuous time, without the need to introduce chaos or an
exponentially growing energy. The efficiency of the simulations is related to
the collective dynamical properties of the original physical system that
persist in the numerical integration to robustly guide the solution search even
in the presence of numerical errors. We anticipate our results to broaden
research directions in physics-inspired computing paradigms ranging from theory
to application, from simulation to hardware implementation.

improvement. The main struggle over the years was to find an optimal algorithm
to implement them. Most of the proposed algorithms are not practical enough to

Efficiency of stochastic neural networks as an SC decoder and Find the possible

<p>One of the most rising issues in recent machine learning research is
One-Class Classification which considers data set composed of only one class
and outliers. It is more reasonable than traditional Multi-Class Classification
in dealing with some problematic data set or special cases. Generally,
classification accuracy and interpretability for user are considered as
trade-off in OCC methods. Classifier based on Hyper-Rectangle (H-RTGL) is a
sort of classifier that can be a remedy for such trade-off and uses H-RTGL
formulated by conjunction of geometric rules called interval. This interval can
be basis of interpretability since it can be easily understood by user.
However, existing H-RTGL based OCC classifiers have limitations that (i) most
of them cannot reflect density of target class and (ii) that considering
density has primitive interval generation method, and (iii) there exists no
systematic procedure for hyperparameter of H-RTGL based OCC classifier, which
influences classification performance of classifier. Based on these remarks, we
suggest One-Class Hyper-Rectangle Descriptor based on density (1-HRD_d) with
more elaborate interval generation method including parametric and
nonparametric approaches. In addition, we designed Genetic Algorithm (GA) that
consists of chromosome structure and genetic operators for systematic
generation of 1-HRD_d by optimization of hyperparameter. Our work is validated
through a numerical experiment using actual data set with comparison of
existing OCC algorithms along with other H-RTGL based classifiers.

<p>Biological brains are inherently limited in their capacity to process and
store information, but are nevertheless capable of solving complex tasks with
apparent ease. Intelligent behavior is related to these limitations, since
resource constraints drive the need to generalize and assign importance
differentially to features in the environment or memories of past experiences.
Recently, there have been parallel efforts in reinforcement learning and
neuroscience to understand strategies adopted by artificial and biological
agents to circumvent limitations in information storage. However, the two
threads have been largely separate. In this article, we propose a dynamical
framework to maximize expected reward under constraints of limited resources,
which we implement with a cost function that penalizes precise representations
of action-values in memory, each of which may vary in its precision. We derive
from first principles an algorithm, Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA), which we
apply to two standard tasks in reinforcement learning and a model-based
planning task, and find that it allocates more resources to items in memory
that have a higher impact on cumulative rewards. Moreover, DRA learns faster
when starting with a higher resource budget than what it eventually allocates
for performing well on tasks, which may explain why frontal cortical areas in
biological brains appear more engaged in early stages of learning before
settling to lower asymptotic levels of activity. Our work provides a normative
solution to the problem of learning how to allocate costly resources to a
collection of uncertain memories in a manner that is capable of adapting to
changes in the environment.

<p>The vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup-delivery and time
windows (VRPSPDTW) has attracted much attention in the last decade, due to its
wide application in modern logistics involving bi-directional flow of goods. In
this paper, we propose a memetic algorithm with efficient local search and
extended neighborhood, dubbed MATE, for solving this problem. The novelty of
MATE lies in three aspects: 1) an initialization procedure which integrates an
existing heuristic into the population-based search framework, in an
intelligent way; 2) a new crossover involving route inheritance and
regret-based node reinsertion; 3) a highly-effective local search procedure
which could flexibly search in a large neighborhood by switching between move
operators with different step sizes, while keeping low computational
complexity. Experimental results on public benchmark show that MATE
consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms, and notably,
finds new best-known solutions on 44 instances (65 instances in total). A new
benchmark of large-scale instances, derived from a real-world application of
the JD logistics, is also introduced, which could serve as a new and more
practical test set for future research.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06188">Evaluating Curriculum Learning Strategies in Neural Combinatorial Optimization. (arXiv:2011.06188v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) aims at designing problem-independent
and efficient neural network-based strategies for solving combinatorial
problems. The field recently experienced growth by successfully adapting
architectures originally designed for machine translation. Even though the
results are promising, a large gap still exists between NCO models and classic
deterministic solvers, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. One of the
drawbacks of current approaches is the inefficiency of training on multiple
problem sizes. Curriculum learning strategies have been shown helpful in
increasing performance in the multi-task setting. In this work, we focus on
designing a curriculum learning-based training procedure that can help existing
architectures achieve competitive performance on a large range of problem sizes
simultaneously. We provide a systematic investigation of several training
procedures and use the insights gained to motivate application of a
psychologically-inspired approach to improve upon the classic curriculum
method.

<p>Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides can form protease-resistant aggregates within and outside of neurons. Accumulation of these aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology and contributes to devastating cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. The primary etiological factor for Aβ aggregation is either an increase in Aβ production or a decrease in its clearance. Aβ is produced by the sequential activity of β- and γ-secretase on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the clearance is mediated by chaperone-mediated mechanisms. The Aβ aggregates vary from soluble monomers and oligomers to insoluble senile plaques. While excess intraneuronal oligomers can transduce neurotoxic signals into neurons causing cellular defects like oxidative stress and neuroepigenetic mediated transcriptional dysregulation, extracellular senile plaques cause neurodegeneration by impairing neural membrane permeabilization and cell signaling pathways. Paradoxically, senile plaque formation is hypothesized to be an adaptive mechanism to sequester excess toxic soluble oligomers while leaving native functional Aβ levels intact. This hypothesis is strengthened by the absence of positive outcomes and side effects from immunotherapy clinical trials aimed at complete Aβ clearance, and support beneficial physiological roles for native Aβ in cellular function. Aβ has been shown to modulate synaptic transmission, consolidate memory, and protect against excitotoxicity. We discuss the current understanding of beneficial and detrimental roles for Aβ in synaptic function and epigenetic gene control and the future promising prospects of early therapeutic interventions aimed at mediating Aβ induced neuroepigenetic and synaptic dysfunctions to delay AD onset.</p>

<p>Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene. Progression of the clinical symptoms in EPM1 patients, including stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, tonic-clonic seizures, and ataxia, are well described. However, the cellular dysfunction during the presymptomatic phase that precedes the disease onset is not understood. CSTB deficiency leads to alterations in GABAergic signaling, and causes early neuroinflammation followed by progressive neurodegeneration in brains of a mouse model, manifesting as progressive myoclonus and ataxia. Here, we report the first proteome atlas from cerebellar synaptosomes of presymptomatic Cstb-deficient mice, and propose that early mitochondrial dysfunction is important to the pathogenesis of altered synaptic function in EPM1. A decreased sodium- and chloride dependent GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) abundance was noted in synaptosomes with CSTB deficiency, but no functional difference was seen between the two genotypes in electrophysiological experiments with pharmacological block of GAT-1. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the early onset and pathogenesis of CSTB deficiency, and reveal greater complexity to the molecular pathogenesis of EPM1.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a fatal cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality, for which no effective therapies are currently available. Brain tissue damage caused by ICH is mediated by a newly identified form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, called ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is characterized by the iron-induced accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to intracellular oxidative stress. Lipid ROS cause damage to nucleic acids, proteins, and cell membranes, eventually resulting in ferroptosis. Numerous biological processes are involved in ferroptosis, including iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione biosynthesis; therefore, iron chelators, lipophilic antioxidants, and other specific inhibitors can suppress ferroptosis, suggesting that these modulators are beneficial for treating brain injury due to ICH. Accumulating evidence indicates that ferroptosis differs from other types of programmed cell death, such as necroptosis, apoptosis, oxytosis, and pyroptosis, in terms of ultrastructural characteristics, signaling pathways, and outcomes. Although several studies have emphasized the importance of ferroptosis due to ICH, the detailed mechanism underlying ferroptosis remains unclear. This review summarizes the available evidence on the mechanism underlying ferroptosis and its relationship with other types of cell death, with the aim to identify therapeutic targets and potential interventions for ICH.</p>

<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was considered to be a disorder with high heterogeneity, as various abnormalities were found across widespread brain regions in recent neuroimaging studies. However, remarkable individual variability of cortical structure and function may have partially contributed to these discrepant findings. In this work, we applied the Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-Based Cortical Landmarks (DICCCOL) method to identify fine-granularity corresponding functional cortical regions across different subjects based on the shape of a white matter fiber bundle and measured functional connectivities between these cortical regions. Fiber bundle pattern and functional connectivity were compared between ADHD patients and normal controls in two independent samples. Interestingly, four neighboring DICCCOLs located close to the left parietooccipital area consistently exhibited discrepant fiber bundles in both datasets. The left precentral gyrus (DICCCOL 175, BA 6) and the right anterior cingulate gyrus (DICCCOL 321, BA 32) had the highest connection number among 78 pairs of abnormal functional connectivities with good cross-sample consistency. Furthermore, abnormal functional connectivities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. Our studies revealed novel fine-granularity structural and functional alterations in ADHD.</p>

Objective<p>The occurrence of death by suicide in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder is as much as 60 times greater than in the general population. Even during the state of euthymia patients are characterized by suicide risk. The aim of the study is to investigate the baseline brain activity in euthymic bipolar disorder patients in regard to suicide risk.

<p>Area prostriata in primates has recently been found to play important roles in rapid detection and processing of peripheral visual, especially fast-moving visual information. The prostriata in rodents was not discovered until recently and its connectivity is largely unknown. As a part of our efforts to reveal brain-wide connections of the prostriata in rat and mouse, this study focuses on its commissural projections in order to understand the mechanisms underlying interhemispheric integration of information, especially from peripheral visual field. Using anterograde, retrograde and Cre-dependent tracing techniques, we find a unique commissural connection pattern of the prostriata: its layers 2-3 in both hemispheres form strong homotopic commissural connections with few heterotopic projections to bilateral medial entorhinal cortex. This projection pattern is in sharp contrast to that of the presubiculum and parasubiculum, two neighbor regions of the prostriata. The latter two structures project very strongly to bilateral medial entorhinal cortex and to their contralateral counterparts. Our results also suggest the prostriata is a distinct anatomical structure from the presubiculum and parasubiculum and probably plays differential roles in interhemispheric integration and the balancing of spatial information between two hemispheres.</p>

<p>Heteromers between mu opioid receptor (MOPr) and delta opioid receptor (DOPr) (i.e., MOPr-DOPr heteromer) have been found to be expressed in different brain regions, in the spinal cord, and in dorsal root ganglia. Recent studies on this heteromer reveal its important pathophysiological function in pain regulation including neuropathic pain; this suggests a role as a novel therapeutic target in chronic pain management. In addition, receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4) has been shown to be involved in the intracellular maturation of the MOPr-DOPr heteromers. RTP4 appears to have unique distribution in vivo being highly expressed in sensory neurons and also macrophages; the latter are effector cells of the innate immune system that phagocytose foreign substances and secrete both pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators; this suggests a possible contribution of RTP4 to neuronal immune-related pathological conditions such as neuropathic pain. Although RTP4 could be considered as an important therapeutic target in the management of pain via MOPr-DOPr heteromer, a few reports have supported this. This review will summarize the possible role or functions of the MOPr-DOPr heteromer and its regulatory molecule RTP4 in pain modulation at sensory neurons.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.600018">Calcium Channels in Adult Brain Neural Stem Cells and in Glioblastoma Stem Cells</a></h4>

<p>The brain of adult mammals, including humans, contains neural stem cells (NSCs) located within specific niches of which the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is the largest one. Under physiological conditions, NSCs proliferate, self-renew and produce new neurons and glial cells. Several recent studies established that oncogenic mutations in adult NSCs of the V-SVZ are responsible for the emergence of malignant primary brain tumors called glioblastoma. These aggressive tumors contain a small subpopulation of cells, the glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), that are endowed with proliferative and self-renewal abilities like NSCs from which they may arise. GSCs are thus considered as the cells that initiate and sustain tumor growth and, because of their resistance to current treatments, provoke tumor relapse. A growing body of studies supports that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling controls a variety of processes in NSCs and GSCs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a ubiquitous second messenger whose fluctuations of its intracellular concentrations are handled by channels, pumps, exchangers, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins. The concerted action of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit components encodes specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals with defined spatio-temporal characteristics that determine the cellular responses. In this review, after a general overview of the adult brain NSCs and GSCs, we focus on the multiple roles of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit in NSCs and discuss how GSCs hijack these mechanisms to promote tumor growth. Extensive knowledge of the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit in the management of essential functions in healthy and pathological stem cells of the adult brain should help to identify promising targets for clinical applications.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that selectively affects motor neurons (MNs) of the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Several genes have been linked to both familial (fALS) and sporadic (sALS) cases of ALS. Among all the ALS-related genes, a group of genes known to directly affect cytoskeletal dynamics (ALS2, DCTN1, PFN1, KIF5A, NF-L, NF-H, PRPH, SPAST, and TUBA4A) is of high importance for MN health and survival, considering that MNs are large polarized cells with axons that can reach up to 1 m in length. In particular, cytoskeletal dynamics facilitate the transport of organelles and molecules across the long axonal distances within the cell, playing a key role in synapse maintenance. The majority of ALS-related genes affecting cytoskeletal dynamics were identified within the past two decades, making it a new area to explore for ALS. The purpose of this review is to provide insights into ALS-associated cytoskeletal genes and outline how recent studies have pointed towards novel pathways that might be impacted in ALS. Further studies making use of extensive analysis models to look for true hits, the newest technologies such as CRIPSR/Cas9, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and axon sequencing, as well as the development of more transgenic animal models could potentially help to: differentiate the variants that truly act as a primary cause of the disease from the ones that act as risk factors or disease modifiers, identify potential interactions between two or more ALS-related genes in disease onset and progression and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to cytoskeletal defects. Altogether, this information will give us a hint on the real contribution of the cytoskeletal ALS-related genes during this lethal disease.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common and severe neurological disorder that can effectively induce oxidative stress responses. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is a member of the NOX family of oxidases. It is expressed in the brain normally and involved in cell signal transduction and the removal of harmful substances. In some pathological conditions, it mediates inflammation and the aging of cells. However, few studies have focused on whether NOX4 is involved in brain injury caused by ICH. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the role of NOX4 in the pathological process that occurs after ICH and the potential mechanism underlying its role. A rat model of ICH was established by the injection of collagenase type IV, and the expression of NOX4 was then determined. Further, siRNA-mediated protein expression knockdown technology was used for NOX4 knockdown, and western immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and other molecular biological techniques were performed to assess the effects of NOX4 knockdown. Neurobiological scoring, brain water content determination, and other brain injury detection methods were also performed to assess the role of NOX4 following ICH. We found that the expression of NOX4 increased in the brains of rats after ICH, and that it was mainly expressed in neurons, astrocytes, vascular endothelial cells and microglia. Following NOX4 knockdown, the level of oxidative stress in the brain decreased considerably, the neurobehavioral scores improved, the levels of neuronal apoptosis reduced markedly, and the impairment of blood-brain barrier function was significantly ameliorated in rats with ICH. In conclusion, this study suggests that NOX4 expression is upregulated after ICH, which may cause an imbalance in the oxidative stress of relevant cells in the brain, leading to subsequent apoptosis of neurons and damage to the blood-brain barrier due to secondary brain injury following ICH.</p>

<p>Population averaged brain templates are an essential tool for imaging-based neuroscience research, providing investigators with information about the expected size and morphology of brain structures and the spatial relationships between them, within a demographic cross-section. This allows for a standardized comparison of neuroimaging data between subjects and provides neuroimaging software with a probabilistic framework upon which further processing and analysis can be based. Many different templates have been created to represent specific study populations and made publicly available for human and animal research. An increasingly studied animal model in the neurosciences that still lacks appropriate brain templates is the adult Yucatan micropig. In particular, T2-weighted templates are absent in this species as a whole. To address this need and provide a tool for neuroscientists wishing to pursue neuroimaging research in the adult micropig, we present the construction of population averaged (n = 16) T2-weighted MRI brain template for the adult Yucatan micropig. Additionally, we present initial analysis of T1-weighted (n = 3), and diffusion-weighted (n = 3) images through multimodal registration of these contrasts to our T2 template. The strategies used here may also be generalized to create similar templates for other study populations or species in need of template construction.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia (SCH) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share several common aetiological and symptomatic features suggesting they may be included in a common spectrum. For example, recent results suggest that excitatory/inhibitory imbalance is relevant in the etiology of SCH and ASD. Numerous studies have investigated this imbalance in regions like the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, relatively little is known about neuroanatomical changes that could reduce inhibition in subcortical structures, such as the caudate nucleus (CN), in neuropsychiatric disorders. We recently showed a significant decrease in calretinin-immunopositive (CR-ip) interneuronal density in the CN of patients with ASD without significant change in the density of neuropeptide Y-immunopositive (NPY-ip) neurons. These subtypes together constitute more than 50% of caudate interneurons and are likely necessary for maintaining excitatory/inhibitory balance. Consequently, and since SCH and ASD share characteristic features, here we tested the hypothesis, that the density of CR-ip neurons in the CN is decreased in patients with SCH. We used immunohistochemistry and qPCR for CR and NPY in six patients with schizophrenia and six control subjects. As expected, small, medium and large CR-ip interneurons were detected in the CN. We found a 38% decrease in the density of all CR-ip interneurons (P &lt; 0.01) that was driven by the loss of the small CR-ip interneurons (P &lt; 0.01) in patients with SCH. The densities of the large CR-ip and of the NPY-ip interneurons were not significantly altered. The lower density detected could have been due to inflammation-induced degeneration. However, the state of microglial activation assessed by quantification of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)- and transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119)-immunopositive cells showed no significant difference between patients with SCH and controls. Our results warrant further studies focussing on the role of CR-ip neurons and on the striatum being a possible hub for information selection and regulation of associative cortical fields whose function have been altered in SCH.</p>

<p>NMDA receptors are important players for neuronal differentiation. We previously reported that antagonizing NMDA receptors with APV blocked the growth-promoting effects evoked by the overexpression of specific calcium-permeable or flip-spliced AMPA receptor subunits and of type I transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins which both exclusively modify apical dendritic length and branching of cortical pyramidal neurons. These findings led us to characterize the role of GluN2B and GluN2A for dendritogenesis using organotypic cultures of rat visual cortex. Antagonizing GluN2B with ifenprodil and Ro25-6981 strongly impaired basal dendritic growth of supra- and infragranular pyramidal cells at DIV 5–10, but no longer at DIV 15–20. Growth recovered after washout, and protein blots revealed an increase of synaptic GluN2B-containing receptors as indicated by a enhanced phosphorylation of the tyrosine 1472 residue. Antagonizing GluN2A with TCN201 and NVP-AAM077 was ineffective at both ages. Dendrite growth of non-pyramidal interneurons was not altered. We attempted to overexpress GluN2A and GluN2B. However, although the constructs delivered currents in HEK cells, there were neither effects on dendrite morphology nor an enhanced sensitivity to NMDA. Further, co-expressing GluN1-1a and GluN2B did not alter dendritic growth. Visualization of overexpressed, tagged GluN2 proteins was successful after immunofluorescence for the tag which delivered rather weak staining in HEK cells as well as in neurons. This suggested that the level of overexpression is too weak to modify dendrite growth. In summary, endogenous GluN2B, but not GluN2A is important for pyramidal cell basal dendritic growth during an early postnatal time window.</p>

<p>Sleep complaints are the most prevalent syndromes in older adults, particularly in women. Moreover, they are frequently accompanied with a high level of depression and stress. Although several diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported associations between sleep quality and brain white matter (WM) microstructure, it is still unclear whether gender impacts the effect of sleep quality on structural alterations, and whether these alterations mediate the effects of sleep quality on emotional regulation. We included 389 older participants (176 females, age = 65.5 ± 5.5 years) from the 1000BRAINS project. Neuropsychological examinations covered the assessments of sleep quality, depressive symptomatology, current stress level, visual working memory, and selective attention ability. Based on the DTI dataset, the diffusion parameter maps, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), were calculated and normalized to a population-specific FA template. According to the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 119 poor sleepers (PSQI: 10∼17) and 120 good sleepers (PSQI: 3∼6) were identified. We conducted a two by two (good sleepers/poor sleepers) × (males/females) analysis of variance by using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and JHU-ICBM WM atlas-based comparisons. Moreover, we performed a voxel-wise correlation analysis of brain WM microstructure with the neuropsychological tests. Finally, we applied a mediation analysis to explore if the brain WM microstructure mediates the relationship between sleep quality and emotional regulation. No significant differences in brain WM microstructure were detected on the main effect of sleep quality. However, the MD, AD, and RD of pontine crossing tract and bilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle were significant lower in the males than females. Voxel-wise correlation analysis revealed that FA and RD values in the corpus callosum were positively related with depressive symptomatology and negatively related with current stress levels. Additionally, we found a significantly positive association between higher FA values in visual-related WM tracts and better outcomes in a visual pattern recognition test. Furthermore, a mediation analysis suggested that diffusion metrics within the corpus callosum partially mediated the associations between poor sleep quality/high stress and depressive symptomatology.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63603">Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies non-canonical NF-κB signaling as a regulator of density-dependent proliferation</a></h4>

Epithelial cells possess intrinsic mechanisms to maintain an appropriate cell density for normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Defects in such mechanisms likely contribute to hyperplasia and cancer initiation. To identify genes that regulate the density-dependent proliferation of murine mammary epithelial cells, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay based on FUCCI, which marks different stages of the cell cycle with distinct fluorophores. Using this powerful assay, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, selecting for cells that proliferate normally at low density but continue to divide at high density. Unexpectedly, one top hit was <i>Traf3</i>, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling that has never previously been linked to density-dependent proliferation. We demonstrate that loss of <i>Traf3</i> specifically activates non-canonical NF-κB signaling. This in turn triggers an innate immune response and drives cell division independently of known density-dependent proliferation mechanisms, including YAP/TAZ signaling and cyclin kinase inhibitors, by blocking entry into quiescence.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62731">GTPBP1 resolves paused ribosomes to maintain neuronal homeostasis</a></h4>

Ribosome-associated quality control pathways respond to defects in translational elongation to recycle arrested ribosomes and degrade aberrant polypeptides and mRNAs. Loss of a tRNA gene leads to ribosomal pausing that is resolved by the translational GTPase GTPBP2, and in its absence causes neuron death. Here, we show that loss of the homologous protein GTPBP1 during tRNA deficiency in the mouse brain also leads to codon-specific ribosome pausing and neurodegeneration, suggesting that these non-redundant GTPases function in the same pathway to mitigate ribosome pausing. As observed in <i>Gtpbp2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Ishimura et al., 2016), GCN2-mediated activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) was apparent in the <i>Gtpbp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> brain. We observed decreased mTORC1 signaling which increased neuronal death, whereas ISR activation was neuroprotective. Our data demonstrate that GTPBP1 functions as an important quality control mechanism during translation elongation and suggest that translational signaling pathways intricately interact to regulate neuronal homeostasis during defective elongation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62021">The structural basis for SARM1 inhibition and activation under energetic stress</a></h4>

SARM1 an executor of axonal degeneration, displays NADase activity that depletes the key cellular metabolite, NAD+, in response to nerve injury. The basis of SARM1 inhibition, and its activation under stress conditions are still unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM maps of SARM1 at 2.9 and 2.7 Å resolution. These indicate that SARM1 homo-octamer avoids premature activation by assuming a packed conformation, with ordered inner and peripheral rings, that prevents dimerization and activation of the catalytic domains. This inactive conformation is stabilized by binding of SARM1's own substrate NAD+ in an allosteric location, away from the catalytic sites. This model was validated by mutagenesis of the allosteric site, which led to constitutively active SARM1. We propose that the reduction of cellular NAD+ concentration contributes to the disassembly of SARM1's peripheral ring, which allows formation of active NADase domain dimers, thereby further depleting NAD+ to cause an energetic catastrophe and cell death.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59112">Rdh54/Tid1 inhibits Rad51-Rad54-mediated D-loop formation and limits D-loop length</a></h4>

Displacement loops (D-loops) are critical intermediates formed during homologous recombination. Rdh54 (a.k.a. Tid1), a Rad54 paralog in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</i> is well-known for its role with Dmc1 recombinase during meiotic recombination. Yet contrary to Dmc1, Rdh54/Tid1 is also present in somatic cells where its function is less understood. While Rdh54/Tid1 enhances the Rad51 DNA strand invasion activity <i>in vitro,</i> it is unclear how it interplays with Rad54. Here, we show that Rdh54/Tid1 inhibits D-loop formation by Rad51 and Rad54 in an ATPase-independent manner. Using a novel D-loop Mapping Assay, we further demonstrate that Rdh54/Tid1 uniquely restricts the lengths of Rad51-Rad54-mediated D-loops. The alterations in D-loop properties appear to be important for cell survival and mating-type switch in haploid yeast. We propose that Rdh54/Tid1 and Rad54 compete for potential binding sites within the Rad51 filament, where Rdh54/Tid1 acts as a physical roadblock to Rad54 translocation, limiting D-loop formation and D-loop length.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59111">Bisulfite treatment and single-molecule real-time sequencing reveals D-loop length, position and distribution</a></h4>

Displacement loops (D-loops) are signature intermediates formed during homologous recombination. Numerous factors regulate D-loop formation and disruption, thereby influencing crucial aspects of DNA repair, including donor choice and the possibility of crossover outcome. While D-loop detection methods exist, it is currently unfeasible to assess the relationship between D-loop editors and D-loop characteristics such as length and position. Here, we developed a novel <i>in vitro</i> assay to characterize the length and position of individual D-loops with near base-pair resolution and deep coverage, while also revealing their distribution in a population. Non-denaturing bisulfite treatment modifies the cytosines on the displaced strand of the D-loop to uracil, leaving a permanent signature for the displaced strand. Subsequent single-molecule real-time sequencing uncovers the cytosine conversion patch as a D-loop footprint. The D-loop Mapping Assay is widely applicable with different substrates and donor types and can be used to study factors that influence D-loop properties.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59081">Intracellular complexities of acquiring a new enzymatic function revealed by mass-randomisation of active site residues</a></h4>

Selection for a promiscuous enzyme activity provides substantial opportunity for competition between endogenous and newly-encountered substrates to influence the evolutionary trajectory, an aspect that is often overlooked in laboratory directed evolution studies. We selected the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitro/quinone reductase NfsA for chloramphenicol detoxification by simultaneously randomising eight active site residues and interrogating ~250,000,000 reconfigured variants. Analysis of every possible intermediate of the two best chloramphenicol reductases revealed complex epistatic interactions. In both cases, improved chloramphenicol detoxification was only observed after an R225 substitution that largely eliminated activity with endogenous quinones. Error-prone PCR mutagenesis reinforced the importance of R225 substitutions, found in 100% of selected variants. This strong activity trade-off demonstrates that endogenous cellular metabolites hold considerable potential to shape evolutionary outcomes. Unselected prodrug-converting activities were mostly unaffected, emphasising the importance of negative selection to effect enzyme specialisation, and offering an application for the evolved genes as dual-purpose selectable/counter-selectable markers.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58277">Bacterial OTU deubiquitinases regulate substrate ubiquitination upon <i>Legionella</i> infection</a></h4>

<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> causes a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. During the infection, <i>Legionella</i> injects more than 300 effector proteins into host cells. Among them are enzymes involved in altering the host-ubiquitination system. Here, we identified two <i><span class="underline">L</span></i><i>egionella</i> <span class="underline">OT</span>U-like deubiquitinases (LOT; LotB (Lpg1621/Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529)). The crystal structure of the LotC catalytic core (LotC<sub>14-310</sub>) was determined at 2.4 Å. Unlike the classical OTU-family, the <i>Legionella</i> OTU-family shows an extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which defines them as a unique class of OTU-deubiquitinases. LotB has an additional ubiquitin-binding site (S1'), which enables the specific cleavage of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of LotB and LotC identified different categories of host-interacting proteins and substrates. Together, our results provide new structural insights into bacterial OTU deubiquitinases and indicate distinct roles in host-pathogen interactions.

Papers describing software are an important part of computational fields of scientific research. These “software papers” are unique in a number of ways, and they require special consideration to improve their impact on the scientific community and their efficacy at conveying important information. Here, we discuss 10 specific rules for writing software papers, covering some of the different scenarios and publication types that might be encountered, and important questions from which all computational researchers would benefit by asking along the way.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/39EYQupRqIk" width="1" />

Systematic knockout studies in mice have shown that a large fraction of the gene replacements show no lethal or other overt phenotypes. This has led to the development of more refined analysis schemes, including physiological, behavioral, developmental and cytological tests. However, transcriptomic analyses have not yet been systematically evaluated for non-lethal knockouts. We conducted a power analysis to determine the experimental conditions under which even small changes in transcript levels can be reliably traced. We have applied this to two gene disruption lines of genes for which no function was known so far. Dedicated phenotyping tests informed by the tissues and stages of highest expression of the two genes show small effects on the tested phenotypes. For the transcriptome analysis of these stages and tissues, we used a prior power analysis to determine the number of biological replicates and the sequencing depth. We find that under these conditions, the knockouts have a significant impact on the transcriptional networks, with thousands of genes showing small transcriptional changes. GO analysis suggests that <i>A930004D18Rik</i> is involved in developmental processes through contributing to protein complexes, and <i>A830005F24Rik</i> in extracellular matrix functions. Subsampling analysis of the data reveals that the increase in the number of biological replicates was more important that increasing the sequencing depth to arrive at these results. Hence, our proof-of-principle experiment suggests that transcriptomic analysis is indeed an option to study gene functions of genes with weak or no traceable phenotypic effects and it provides the boundary conditions under which this is possible.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y4Esignvs20" width="1" />

Eukaryotic genome sequencing and de novo assembly, once the exclusive domain of well-funded international consortia, have become increasingly affordable, thus fitting the budgets of individual research groups. Third-generation long-read DNA sequencing technologies are increasingly used, providing extensive genomic toolkits that were once reserved for a few select model organisms. Generating high-quality genome assemblies and annotations for many aquatic species still presents significant challenges due to their large genome sizes, complexity, and high chromosome numbers. Indeed, selecting the most appropriate sequencing and software platforms and annotation pipelines for a new genome project can be daunting because tools often only work in limited contexts. In genomics, generating a high-quality genome assembly/annotation has become an indispensable tool for better understanding the biology of any species. Herein, we state 12 steps to help researchers get started in genome projects by presenting guidelines that are broadly applicable (to any species), sustainable over time, and cover all aspects of genome assembly and annotation projects from start to finish. We review some commonly used approaches, including practical methods to extract high-quality DNA and choices for the best sequencing platforms and library preparations. In addition, we discuss the range of potential bioinformatics pipelines, including structural and functional annotations (e.g., transposable elements and repetitive sequences). This paper also includes information on how to build a wide community for a genome project, the importance of data management, and how to make the data and results Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) by submitting them to a public repository and sharing them with the research community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SFRYvOAodxE" width="1" />

<p>by Rowan S. M. Howell, Cinzia Klemm, Peter H. Thorpe, Attila Csikász-Nagy</p>

The transition from mitosis into the first gap phase of the cell cycle in budding yeast is controlled by the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN). The network interprets spatiotemporal cues about the progression of mitosis and ensures that release of Cdc14 phosphatase occurs only after completion of key mitotic events. The MEN has been studied intensively; however, a unified understanding of how localisation and protein activity function together as a system is lacking. In this paper, we present a compartmental, logical model of the MEN that is capable of representing spatial aspects of regulation in parallel to control of enzymatic activity. We show that our model is capable of correctly predicting the phenotype of the majority of mutants we tested, including mutants that cause proteins to mislocalise. We use a continuous time implementation of the model to demonstrate that Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) ensures robust timing of anaphase, and we verify our findings in living cells. Furthermore, we show that our model can represent measured cell–cell variation in Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPoC) mutants. This work suggests a general approach to incorporate spatial effects into logical models. We anticipate that the model itself will be an important resource to experimental researchers, providing a rigorous platform to test hypotheses about regulation of mitotic exit.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7sXa2Hr7n4Y" width="1" />

<p>by Joana Leitão, Ben Meuleman, Dimitri Van De Ville, Patrik Vuilleumier</p>

Emotions are multifaceted phenomena affecting mind, body, and behavior. Previous studies sought to link particular emotion categories (e.g., fear) or dimensions (e.g., valence) to specific brain substrates but generally found distributed and overlapping activation patterns across various emotions. In contrast, distributed patterns accord with multi-componential theories whereby emotions emerge from appraisal processes triggered by current events, combined with motivational, expressive, and physiological mechanisms orchestrating behavioral responses. According to this framework, components are recruited in parallel and dynamically synchronized during emotion episodes. Here, we use functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate brain-wide systems engaged by theoretically defined components and measure their synchronization during an interactive emotion-eliciting video game. We show that each emotion component recruits large-scale cortico-subcortical networks, and that moments of dynamic synchronization between components selectively engage basal ganglia, sensory-motor structures, and midline brain areas. These neural results support theoretical accounts grounding emotions onto embodied and action-oriented functions triggered by synchronized component processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MAf_3GnUew8" width="1" />

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, has moved rapidly around the globe, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used—appropriately and less appropriately—to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, often dominated by a small number of individuals, and heavily influenced by superspreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., high stochasticity under low prevalence (as compared to other pathogens, such as influenza), and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics cannot be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings, stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, produce processing facilities, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties, and nightclubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity to effectively contain outbreaks with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the different types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, empirical evidence for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hPyMz8UJ2O4" width="1" />

<p>We prospectively enrolled 347 consecutive patients aged 18 to 49 years with a recent CIS and 347 age‐ and sex‐matched (±5 years) stroke‐free controls. Any migraine and migraine with (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) were identified by a screener, which we validated against a headache neurologist. We used conditional logistic regression adjusting for age, education, hypertension, diabetes, waist‐to‐hip ratio, physical inactivity, current smoking, heavy drinking, and oral estrogen use to assess independent association between migraine and CIS. The effect of PFO on the association between migraine and CIS was analyzed with logistic regression in a subgroup investigated with transcranial Doppler bubble screen.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The screener performance was excellent (Cohen kappa &gt; 0.75) in patients and controls. Compared with nonmigraineurs, any migraine (odds ratio [OR] = 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63–3.76) and MA (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 2.19–5.61) were associated with CIS, whereas MO was not. The association emerged in both women (OR = 2.97 for any migraine, 95% CI = 1.61–5.47; OR = 4.32 for MA, 95% CI = 2.16–8.65) and men (OR = 2.47 for any migraine, 95% CI = 1.32–4.61; OR = 3.61 for MA, 95% CI = 1.75–7.45). Specifically for MA, the association with CIS remained significant irrespective of PFO. MA prevalence increased with increasing magnitude of the right‐to‐left shunt in patients with PFO.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MA has a strong association with CIS in young patients, independent of vascular risk factors and presence of PFO. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25956?af=R">Prevention of epilepsy in infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex in the EPISTOP trial</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epilepsy develops in 70–90% of children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and is often resistant to medication. Recently, the concept of preventive antiepileptic treatment to modify the natural history of epilepsy has been proposed. EPISTOP was a clinical trial designed to compare preventive versus conventional antiepileptic treatment in TSC infants.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multi‐center study, 94 infants with TSC without seizure history were followed with monthly video electroencephalography (EEG), and received vigabatrin either as conventional antiepileptic treatment, started after the first electrographic or clinical seizure, or preventively when epileptiform EEG activity before seizures was detected. At six sites, subjects were randomly allocated to treatment in a 1:1 ratio in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). At four sites, treatment allocation was fixed, denoted an open‐label trial (OLT). Subjects were followed until 2 years of age. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical seizure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>In 54</b> subjects epileptiform EEG abnormalities were identified before seizures. Twenty‐seven were included in the RCT and 27 in the OLT. The time to the first clinical seizure was significantly longer with preventive than conventional treatment (RCT: 364 95% CI: 223, 535) vs. 124 days (95% CI: 33, 149); OLT: 426 (95% CI: 258, 628) vs. 106 days (95% CI: 11, 149). At 24 months, our pooled analysis showed preventive treatment reduced the risk of clinical seizures (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, p = 0.032), drug‐resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.23, p = 0.022), and infantile spasms (OR = 0, p &lt; 0.001). No adverse events related to preventive treatment were noted.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Preventive treatment with vigabatrin was safe and modified the natural history of seizures in TSC, reducing the risk and severity of epilepsy.</p>

<p>All HCN channel subtypes were located at subcellular level in human and compared with other mammals such as guinea pig, cat, and three mouse strains. Changes in HCN expression levels were quantified in aging mice and murine postnatal development. The widespread expression and distinct localization emphasized the importance of HCN channels for sound coding and electrical stimulation with cochlear implants</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuronal diversity in the cochlea is largely determined by ion channels. Among voltage‐gated channels, hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated (HCN) channels open with hyperpolarization and depolarize the cell until the resting membrane potential. The functions for hearing are not well elucidated and knowledge about localization is controversial. We created a detailed map of subcellular location and co‐expression of all four HCN subunits across different mammalian species including CBA/J, C57Bl/6N, Ly5.1 mice, guinea pigs, cats, and human subjects. We correlated age‐related hearing deterioration in CBA/J and C57Bl/6N with expression levels of HCN1, −2, and −4 in individual auditory neurons from the same cohort. Spatiotemporal expression during murine postnatal development exposed HCN2 and HCN4 involvement in a critical phase of hair cell innervation. The huge diversity of subunit composition, but lack of relevant heteromeric pairing along the perisomatic membrane and axon initial segments, highlighted an active role for auditory neurons. Neuron clusters were found to be the hot spots of HCN1, −2, and −4 immunostaining. HCN channels were also located in afferent and efferent fibers of the sensory epithelium. Age‐related changes on HCN subtype expression were not uniform among mice and could not be directly correlated with audiometric data. The oldest mice groups revealed HCN channel up‐ or downregulation, depending on the mouse strain. The unexpected involvement of HCN channels in outer hair cell function where HCN3 overlaps prestin location emphasized the importance for auditory function. A better understanding may open up new possibilities to tune neuronal responses evoked through electrical stimulation by cochlear implants.</p>

<p>Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are zinc finger transcription factors implicated in diverse biological processes, including differentiation of neural cells. The ability of mammalian neurons to elongate axons decreases during postnatal development in parallel with a decrease in cAMP, and increase in expression of several Klf genes. The paralogous KLFs 9 and 13 inhibit neurite outgrowth, and we hypothesized that their actions are mediated through repression of cAMP signaling. To test this we used the adult mouse hippocampus-derived cell line HT22 engineered to control expression of Klf9 or Klf13 with doxycycline, or made deficient for these Klfs by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We also used primary hippocampal cells isolated from wild type, Klf9<sup>–/–</sup> and Klf13<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13 in HT22 changed the mRNA levels of several genes involved with cAMP signaling; the predominant action was gene repression, and KLF13 influenced ∼4 times more genes than KLF9. KLF9 and KLF13 repressed promoter activity of the protein kinase a catalytic subunit alpha gene in transfection-reporter assays; KLF13, but not KLF9 repressed the calmodulin 3 promoter. Forskolin activation of a cAMP-dependent promoter was reduced after forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13, but was enhanced in Klf gene knockout cells. Forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13 blocked cAMP-dependent neurite outgrowth in HT22 cells, and axon growth in primary hippocampal neurons, while Klf gene knockout enhanced the effect of elevated cAMP. Taken together, our findings show that KLF9 and KLF13 inhibit neurite/axon growth in hippocampal neurons, in part, by inhibiting the cAMP signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate interactions of neurons with the extracellular environment by forming adhesive bonds with CAMs on adjacent membranes or via binding to proteins of the extracellular matrix. Binding of CAMs to their extracellular ligands results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, leading to changes in neuronal structure and the molecular composition and function of neuronal contacts. Ultimately, many of these changes depend on the synthesis of new proteins. In this review, we summarize the evidence showing that CAMs regulate protein synthesis by modulating the activity of transcription factors, gene expression, protein translation, and the structure and distribution of organelles involved in protein synthesis and transport.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage has been implicated to play a dominant role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nicotine, a principal additive compound for tobacco users, is thought as a candidate to attenuate amyloid-β-mediated neurotoxicity and NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Previous studies demonstrated that nicotine exerted this neuroprotective action on oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms underlying how nicotine contributes on oxidative injury in immortalized hippocampal HT-22 cells remain largely unknown. Therefore, in this study we investigated that the potential effects of nicotine on hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced oxidative injury and underlying mechanisms in HT-22 cells. We found that pretreatment with nicotine at low concentrations markedly recovered the cell cycle that was arrested at the G2/M phase in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through reduced intracellular ROS generation. Moreover, nicotine attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Mechanistically, the application of nicotine significantly upregulated the levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2. The neuroprotective effects of nicotine, in turn, were abolished by PD0325901, a selective Erk1/2 inhibitor. Further obtained investigation showed that nicotine exerted its neuroprotective effects via specifically activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs). A selective inhibitor of α7-nAChRs, methyllycaconitine citrate (MLA), not only completely prevented nicotine-mediated antioxidation but also abolished expression of p-Erk1/2. Taken together, our findings suggest that nicotine suppresses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced HT-22 cell injury through activating the α7-nAChR/Erk1/2 signaling pathway, which indicates that nicotine may be a novel strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathophysiology of NDD is still debated, and there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms behind the onset and progression of these heterogenous diseases. The eye represents a unique window to the brain that can be easily assessed via non-invasive ocular imaging. As such, ocular measurements have been recently considered as potential sources of biomarkers for the early detection and management of NDD. However, the current use of ocular biomarkers in the clinical management of NDD patients is particularly challenging. Specifically, many ocular biomarkers are influenced by local and systemic factors that exhibit significant variation among individuals. In addition, there is a lack of methodology available for interpreting the outcomes of ocular examinations in NDD. Recently, mathematical modeling has emerged as an important tool capable of shedding light on the pathophysiology of multifactorial diseases and enhancing analysis and interpretation of clinical results. In this article, we review and discuss the clinical evidence of the relationship between NDD in the brain and in the eye and explore the potential use of mathematical modeling to facilitate NDD diagnosis and management based upon ocular biomarkers.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.530300">Transcutaneous Afferent Patterned Stimulation Therapy Reduces Hand Tremor for One Hour in Essential Tremor Patients</a></h4>

<p>Essential tremor (ET) patients often experience hand tremor that impairs daily activities. Non-invasive electrical stimulation of median and radial nerves in the wrist using a recently developed therapy called transcutaneous afferent patterned stimulation (TAPS) has been shown to provide symptomatic tremor relief in ET patients and improve patients’ ability to perform functional tasks, but the duration of tremor reduction is unknown. In this single-arm, open-label study, fifteen ET patients performed four hand tremor-specific tasks (postural hold, spiral drawing, finger-to-nose reach, and pouring) from the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale (FTM-CRS) prior to, during, and 0, 30, and 60 min following TAPS. At each time point, tremor severity was visually rated according to the FTM-CRS and simultaneously measured by wrist-worn accelerometers. The duration of tremor reduction was assessed using (1) improvement in the mean FTM-CRS score across all four tasks relative to baseline, and (2) reduction in accelerometer-measured tremor power relative to baseline for each task. Patients were labeled as having at least 60 min of therapeutic benefit from TAPS with respect to each specified metric if all three (i.e., 0, 30, and 60 min) post-therapy measurements were better than that metric’s baseline value. The mean FTM-CRS scores improved for at least 60 min beyond the end of TAPS for 80% (12 of 15, p = 4.6e–9) of patients. Similarly, for each assessed task, tremor power improved for at least 60 min beyond the end of TAPS for over 70% of patients. The postural hold task had the largest reduction in tremor power (median 5.9-fold peak reduction in tremor power) and had at least 60 min of improvement relative to baseline beyond the end of TAPS therapy for 73% (11 of 15, p = 9.8e–8) of patients. Clinical ratings of tremor severity were correlated to simultaneously recorded accelerometer-measured tremor power (r = 0.33–0.76 across the four tasks), suggesting tremor power is a valid, objective tremor assessment metric that can be used to track tremor symptoms outside the clinic. These results suggest TAPS can provide reductions in upper limb tremor symptoms for at least 1 h post-therapy in some patients, which may improve patients’ ability to perform tasks of daily living.</p>

<p>The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the urgent need to develop and deploy treatment approaches that can minimize mortality and morbidity. As infection, resulting illness, and the often prolonged recovery period continue to be characterized, therapeutic roles for transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) have emerged as promising non-pharmacological interventions. tES techniques have established therapeutic potential for managing a range of conditions relevant to COVID-19 illness and recovery, and may further be relevant for the general management of increased mental health problems during this time. Furthermore, these tES techniques can be inexpensive, portable, and allow for trained self-administration. Here, we summarize the rationale for using tES techniques, specifically transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), across the COVID-19 clinical course, and index ongoing efforts to evaluate the inclusion of tES optimal clinical care.</p>

<p>Immature auditory perception in children has generally been ascribed to deficiencies in cognitive factors, such as working memory and inattention. This notion appears to be commonly accepted for all children despite limited empirical evidence. In the present work, we examined whether working memory capacity would predict basic aspects of hearing, pure-tone frequency discrimination and temporal gap detection, in typically-developing, normal-hearing children (7–12 years). Contrary to our expectation, working memory capacity, as measured by digit spans, or intrinsic auditory attention (on- and off-task response variability) did not consistently predict the individual variability in auditory perception. Present results provide no evidence for a role of working memory capacity in basic measures of auditory perception in children. This lack of a relationship may partly explain why some children with perceptual deficits despite normal audiograms (commonly referred to as auditory processing disorders) may have typical cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>Pitch labeling in absolute pitch (AP), the ability to recognize the pitch class of a sound without an external reference, is effortless, fast, and presumably automatic. Previous studies have shown that pitch labeling in AP can interfere with task demands. In the current study, we used a cued auditory Go/Nogo task requiring same/different decisions to investigate both behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of increased inhibitory demands related to automatic pitch labeling. The task comprised two Nogo conditions: a Nogo condition with pitch differences larger than one semitone, and a second Nogo condition with pitch differences of only a quarter semitone. The first Nogo condition tested if auditory-related inhibition processes are generally altered in AP musicians. The second Nogo condition tested the suppressibility of the pitch labeling using a Stroop-like effect: the two tones belonged to the same pitch class but were not identical in terms of tone frequency. If pitch labeling cannot be suppressed, the conflicting information would be expected to increase the inhibitory load in AP musicians. Our data provided no evidence for an increased difficulty to inhibit a prepotent response or to suppress conflicting pitch-labeling information in AP: AP musicians showed similar commission error rates as non-AP musicians in both Nogo conditions. N2d and P3d amplitudes of AP musicians were also comparable to those of non-AP musicians. The event-related potentials (ERPs) were, however, modulated by the Nogo condition, probably indicating an effect of stimulus similarity. It is possible that, depending on the context, pitch labeling in AP musicians is not entirely automatic and can be suppressed.</p>

<p>There is controversy about the influence of compression garments on balance control. A positive influence was reported in elderly and injured individuals, whereas no beneficial effects were observed in young healthy active subjects, which is likely due to the large inter-individual differences in these subjects. Hence, this study investigated the acute effects of compression garments on balance control in young healthy active subjects by addressing the issue of heterogeneity of individuals’ responses to the wearing of compression garments. Thirteen young, healthy, active subjects were recruited. They stood on a force plate which recorded the center of foot pressure displacements in a monopedal stance with the eyes closed and on a wobble board with the eyes open, while wearing compression garments or not. Statistics were first calculated with the data from the whole sample. A hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed in order to categorize the participants’ behaviors into subgroups with similar characteristics. The whole group analysis showed that there were no significant effects attributed to compression garments. The clustering analysis identified distinct and homogeneous subgroups of participants. Only participants who swayed the more at baseline benefited from the wearing of compression garments to improve their balance control. These participants might have either a gravity-dependent preferred sensorimotor strategy with an exploratory postural behavior or poorer balance/proprioceptive abilities. Since poor balance control is a predictor of sports injury risk, wearing compression garments during sports practice could be viewed as a potential prevention strategy for individuals at risk.</p>

<p>Individuals who have suffered a severe brain injury typically require extensive hospitalization in intensive care units (ICUs), where critical treatment decisions are made to maximize their likelihood of recovering consciousness and cognitive function. These treatment decisions can be difficult when the neurological assessment of the patient is limited by unreliable behavioral responses. Reliable objective and quantifiable markers are lacking and there is both (1) a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the brain’s ability to reconstitute consciousness and cognition after an injury and (2) the absence of a reliable and clinically feasible method of tracking cognitive recovery in ICU survivors. Our goal is to develop and validate a clinically relevant EEG paradigm that can inform the prognosis of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. This protocol describes a study to develop a point-of-care system intended to accurately predict outcomes of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. We will recruit 200 continuously-sedated brain-injured patients across five ICUs. Between 24 h and 7 days post-ICU admission, high-density EEG will be recorded from behaviorally unresponsive patients before, during and after a brief cessation of pharmacological sedation. Once patients have reached the waking stage, they will be asked to complete an abridged Cambridge Brain Sciences battery, a web-based series of neurocognitive tests. The test series will be repeated every day during acute admission (ICU, ward), or as often as possible given the constraints of ICU and ward care. Following discharge, patients will continue to complete the same test series on weekly, and then monthly basis, for up to 12 months following injury. Functional outcomes will also be assessed up to 12 months post-injury. We anticipate our findings will lead to an increased ability to identify patients, as soon as possible after their brain injury, who are most likely to survive, and to make accurate predictions about their long-term cognitive and functional outcome. In addition to providing critically needed support for clinical decision-making, this study has the potential to transform our understanding of key functional EEG networks associated with consciousness and cognition.</p>

<p>Interest and investment in closed-loop or adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) systems have quickly expanded due to this neurotechnology’s potential to more safely and effectively treat refractory movement and psychiatric disorders compared to conventional DBS. A large neuroethics literature outlines potential ethical concerns about conventional DBS and aDBS systems. Few studies, however, have examined stakeholder perspectives about ethical issues in aDBS research and other next-generation DBS devices. To help fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers involved in aDBS trials (n = 23) to gain insight into the most pressing ethical questions in aDBS research and any concerns about specific features of aDBS devices, including devices’ ability to measure brain activity, automatically adjust stimulation, and store neural data. Using thematic content analysis, we identified 8 central themes in researcher responses. The need to measure and store neural data for aDBS raised concerns among researchers about data privacy and security issues (noted by 91% of researchers), including the avoidance of unintended or unwanted third-party access to data. Researchers reflected on the risks and safety (83%) of aDBS due to the experimental nature of automatically modulating then observing stimulation effects outside a controlled clinical setting and in relation to need for surgical battery changes. Researchers also stressed the importance of ensuring informed consent and adequate patient understanding (74%). Concerns related to automaticity and device programming (65%) were discussed, including current uncertainties about biomarker validity. Additionally, researchers discussed the potential impacts of automatic stimulation on patients’ autonomy and control over stimulation (57%). Lastly, researchers discussed concerns related to patient selection (defining criteria for candidacy) (39%), challenges of ensuring post-trial access to care and device maintenance (39%), and potential effects on personality and identity (30%). To help address researcher concerns, we discuss the need to minimize cybersecurity vulnerabilities, advance biomarker validity, promote the balance of device control between patients and clinicians, and enhance ongoing informed consent. The findings from this study will help inform policies that will maximize the benefits and minimize potential harms of aDBS and other next-generation DBS devices.</p>

<p>Neural patterns associated with viewing energy-dense foods can predict changes in eating-related outcomes. However, most research on this topic is limited to one follow-up time point, and single outcome measures. The present study seeks to add to that literature by employing a more refined assessment of food craving and consumption outcomes along with a more detailed neurobiological model of behavior change over several time points. Here, a community sample of 88 individuals (age: M = 39.17, SD = 3.47; baseline BMI: M = 31.5, SD = 3.9, range 24–42) with higher body mass index (BMI) performed a food craving reactivity and regulation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. At that time—and 1, 3, and 6 months later—participants reported craving for and consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods via the Food Craving Inventory (FCI) and ASA24 (N at 6 months = 52–55 depending on the measure). A priori hypotheses that brain activity associated with both viewing and regulating personally desired unhealthy, energy-dense foods would be associated with self-reported craving for and consumption of unhealthy foods at baseline were not supported by the data. Instead, regression models controlling for age, sex, and BMI demonstrated that brain activity across several regions measured while individuals were regulating their desires for unhealthy food was associated with the self-reported craving for and consumption of healthy food. The hypothesis that vmPFC activity would predict patterns of healthier eating was also not supported. Instead, linear mixed models controlling for baseline age and sex, as well as changes in BMI, revealed that more regulation-related activity in the dlPFC, dACC, IFG, and vmPFC at baseline predicted decreases in the craving for and consumption of healthy foods over the course of 6 months.</p>

<p>Hormonal changes across the menstrual cycle have been shown to influence reward-related motivation and impulsive behaviors. Here, with the aim of examining the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control of impulsivity, we compared event-related monetary delay discounting task behavior and concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed brain activity as well as resting state (rs)-fMRI activity, between women in the mid-luteal phase (LP) and women in the late follicular phase (FP). The behavioral data were analyzed and related to neural activation data. In the delay discounting task, women in the late FP were more responsive to short-term rewards (i.e., showed a greater discount rate) than women in the mid-LP, while also showing greater activity in the dorsal striatum (DS). Discount rate (transformed k) correlated with functional connectivity between the DS and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), consistent with previous findings indicating that DS-dlPFC circuitry may regulate impulsivity. Our rs-fMRI data further showed that the right dlPFC was significantly more active in the mid-LP than in late FP, and this effect was sensitive to absolute and relative estradiol levels during the mid-LP. DS-dlPFC functional connectivity magnitude correlated negatively with psychometric impulsivity scores during the late FP, consistent with our behavioral data and further indicating that relative estradiol levels may play an important role in augmenting cognitive control. These findings provide new insight into the treatment of conditions characterized by hyper-impulsivity, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In conclusion, our results suggest that cyclical gonadal hormones affect cognitive control of impulsive behavior in a periodic manner, possibility via DS-dlPFC circuitry.</p>

<p>Environmental hyperthermia is a common risk factor for occupational safety in many situations due to decreased vigilance performances. Previously, we have reported that decreased resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and decreased activations in dorsal attention network (DAN) such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were correlated with selective attention deficits during hyperthermia. However, whether the inherent functionally organized anti-correlation between the DMN and DAN would contribute to the behavioral deficits remains unclear. In this study, we collected the resting-state fMRI data of 25 participants during two simulated thermal conditions: normothermic condition (25°C for 1 h) and hyperthermic condition (50°C for 1 h). Using group independent component analysis (ICA), we investigated the functional connectivity within the DMN and DAN, as well as the anti-correlations between both networks. Paired comparisons revealed that decreased intranetwork functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the DMN contributed to executive control performance during hyperthermia using multivariate linear regression analysis. Paired comparison on the DAN showed that increased one in the posterior part of the middle and inferior temporal gyrus nearby the temporal–parietal junction area contributed to preserved alerting performance. Lastly but most importantly, we found that decreased correlation between mPFC in the DMN and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) area in the DAN contributed to the executive control deficit, suggesting a weaker intrinsic anti-correlation between DMN and DAN during hyperthermia. These findings indicated that a functional reorganized architecture of DMN and DAN might provide a potential neural basis of the selective deficits for different cognitive-demand attention tasks in high-temperature environments.</p>

<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as the third generation of artificial neural networks, which are more closely with information processing in biological brains. However, it is still a challenge for how to train the non-differential SNN efficiently and robustly with the form of spikes. Here we give an alternative method to train SNNs by biologically-plausible structural and functional inspirations from the brain. Firstly, inspired by the significant top-down structural connections, a global random feedback alignment is designed to help the SNN propagate the error target from the output layer directly to the previous few layers. Then inspired by the local plasticity of the biological system in which the synapses are more tuned by the neighborhood neurons, a differential STDP is used to optimize local plasticity. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark MNIST (98.62%) and Fashion MNIST (89.05%) have shown that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art SNNs trained with backpropagation.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and mortality in children and young adults and has a profound impact on the socio-economic wellbeing of patients and their families. Initially, brain damage is caused by mechanical stress-induced axonal injury and vascular dysfunction, which can include hemorrhage, blood-brain barrier disruption, and ischemia. Subsequent neuronal degeneration, chronic inflammation, demyelination, oxidative stress, and the spread of excitotoxicity can further aggravate disease pathology. Thus, TBI treatment requires prompt intervention to protect against neuronal and vascular degeneration. Rapid advances in the field of stem cells (SCs) have revolutionized the prospect of repairing brain function following TBI. However, more than that, SCs can contribute substantially to our knowledge of this multifaced pathology. Research, based on human induced pluripotent SCs (hiPSCs) can help decode the molecular pathways of degeneration and recovery of neuronal and glial function, which makes these cells valuable tools for drug screening. Additionally, experimental approaches that include hiPSC-derived engineered tissues (brain organoids and bio-printed constructs) and biomaterials represent a step forward for the field of regenerative medicine since they provide a more suitable microenvironment that enhances cell survival and grafting success. In this review, we highlight the important role of hiPSCs in better understanding the molecular pathways of TBI-related pathology and in developing novel therapeutic approaches, building on where we are at present. We summarize some of the most relevant findings for regenerative therapies using biomaterials and outline key challenges for TBI treatments that remain to be addressed.</p>

<p>Background: Hereditary hearing loss is a disorder with high genetic and allelic heterogeneity. Diagnostic screening of candidate genes commonly yields novel variants of unknown clinical significance. TBC1D24 is a pleiotropic gene associated with recessive DOORS syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy, myoclonic epilepsy, and both recessive and dominant hearing impairment. Genotype-phenotype correlations have not been established to date but could facilitate diagnostic variant assessment and elucidation of pathomechanisms.</p><p>Methods and Results: Whole-exome and gene panel screening identified a novel (c.919A&gt;C; p.Asn307His) causative variant in TBC1D24 in two unrelated Caucasian families with Autosomal dominant (AD) nonsyndromic late-onset hearing loss. Protein modeling on the Drosophila TBC1D24 ortholog Skywalker crystal structure showed close interhelix proximity (6.8Å) between the highly conserved residue p.Asn307 in α18 and the position of the single known pathogenic dominant variation (p.Ser178Leu) in α11 that causes a form of deafness with similar clinical characteristics.</p><p>Conclusion: Genetic variants affecting two polar hydrophilic residues in neighboring helices of TBC1D24 cause AD nonsyndromic late-onset hearing loss. The spatial proximity of the affected residues suggests the first genotype-phenotype association in TBC1D24-related disorders. Three conserved residues in α18 contribute to the formation of a functionally relevant cationic phosphoinositide binding pocket that regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking which may be involved in the molecular mechanism of disease.</p>

<p>Sensorineural hearing loss is a common disability often caused by the loss of sensory hair cells in the cochlea. Hair cell (HCs) regeneration has long been the main target for the development of novel therapeutics for sensorineural hearing loss. In the mammalian cochlea, hair cell regeneration is limited, but the auditory epithelia of non-mammalian organisms retain the capacity for hair cell regeneration. In the avian basilar papilla (BP), supporting cells (SCs), which give rise to regenerated hair cells, are usually quiescent. Hair cell loss induces both direct transdifferentiation and mitotic division of supporting cells. Here, we established an explant culture model for hair cell regeneration in chick basilar papillae and validated it for investigating the initial phase of hair cell regeneration. The histological assessment demonstrated hair cell regeneration via direct transdifferentiation of supporting cells. Labeling with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) revealed the occurrence of mitotic division in the supporting cells at specific locations in the basilar papillae, while no EdU labeling was observed in newly generated hair cells. RNA sequencing indicated alterations in known signaling pathways associated with hair cell regeneration, consistent with previous findings. Also, unbiased analyses of RNA sequencing data revealed novel genes and signaling pathways that may be related to the induction of supporting cell activation in the chick basilar papillae. These results indicate the advantages of our explant culture model of the chick basilar papillae for exploring the molecular mechanisms of hair cell regeneration.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have presented a promising neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Olfactory mucosa MSCs (OM-MSCs), a novel source of MSCs located in the human nasal cavity, are easy to obtain and situated for autologous transplantation. The present study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of OM-MSCs on cerebral I/R injury and the possible mechanisms. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model, excessive oxidative stress and increased swollen mitochondria were observed in the peri-infarct cortex. Intravenous injection of OM-MSCs ameliorated mitochondrial damage and restored oxidant/antioxidant imbalance. Using the oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in vitro, we discovered that the exposure of mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells to OGD/R triggers excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and induces mitochondrial deterioration with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces ATP content. OM-MSC transwell coculture attenuated the above perturbations accompanied with increased UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1) expression, whereas these protective effects of OM-MSCs were blocked when UBIAD1 was knocked down. UBIAD1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the increased membrane potential and ATP content promoted by OM-MSCs. Additionally, UBIAD1-specific siRNA blocked the oxidant/antioxidant balance treated by OM-MSCs. Overall, our results suggested that OM-MSCs exert neuroprotective effects in cerebral I/R injury by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and enhancing antioxidation via upregulation of UBIAD1.</p>

<p>Sound localization requires extremely precise development of auditory brainstem circuits, the molecular mechanisms of which are largely unknown. We previously demonstrated a novel requirement for non-apoptotic activity of the protease caspase-3 in chick auditory brainstem development. Here, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteolytic substrates of caspase-3 during chick auditory brainstem development. These auditory brainstem caspase-3 substrates were enriched for proteins previously shown to be cleaved by caspase-3, especially in non-apoptotic contexts. Functional annotation analysis revealed that our caspase-3 substrates were also enriched for proteins associated with several protein categories, including proteins found in extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-bound nanoparticles that function in intercellular communication. The proteome of EVs isolated from the auditory brainstem was highly enriched for our caspase-3 substrates. Additionally, we identified two caspase-3 substrates with known functions in axon guidance, namely Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) and Neuronal-glial Cell Adhesion Molecule (Ng-CAM), that were found in auditory brainstem EVs and expressed in the auditory pathway alongside cleaved caspase-3. Taken together, these data suggest a novel developmental mechanism whereby caspase-3 influences auditory brainstem circuit formation through the proteolytic cleavage of extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins.</p>

<p>Cognitive demands for postural control increase with aging and cognitive-motor interference (CMI) exists for a number of walking situations, especially with visuo-spatial cognitive tasks. Such interference also influences spatial learning abilities among older adults; however, this is rarely considered in research on aging in spatial navigation. We posited that visually and physically exploring an unknown environment may be subject to CMI for older adults. We investigated potential indicators of postural control interfering with spatial learning. Given known associations between age-related alterations in gait and brain structure, we also examined potential neuroanatomical correlates of this interference. Fourteen young and 14 older adults had to find an invisible goal in an unfamiliar, real, ecological environment. We measured walking speed, trajectory efficiency (direct route over taken route) and goal fixations (proportion of visual fixations toward the goal area). We calculated the change in walking speed between the first and last trials and adaptation indices for all three variables to quantify their modulation across learning trials. All participants were screened with a battery of visuo-cognitive tests. Eighteen of our participants (10 young, 8 older) also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Older adults reduced their walking speed considerably on the first, compared to the last trial. The adaptation index of walking speed correlated positively with those of trajectory efficiency and goal fixations, indicating a reduction in resource sharing between walking and encoding the environment. The change in walking speed correlated negatively with gray matter volume in superior parietal and occipital regions and the precuneus. We interpret older adults’ change in walking speed as indicative of CMI, similar to dual task costs. This is supported by the correlations between the adaptation indices and between the change in walking speed and gray matter volume in brain regions that are important for navigation, given that they are involved in visual attention, sensory integration and encoding of space. These findings under ecological conditions in a natural spatial learning task question what constitutes dual tasking in older adults and they can lead future research to reconsider the actual cognitive burden of postural control in aging navigation research.</p>

Objectives<p>To investigate the value of MRI-based radiomic model based on the radiomic features of different basal nuclei in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) from Parkinsonian variants of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P).</p>Methods<p>Radiomics was applied to the 3T susceptibility- weighted imaging (SWI) from 102 MSA-P patients and 83 IPD patients (allocated to a training and a testing cohort, 7:3 ratio). The substantia nigra (SN), caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PUT), globus pallidus (GP), red nucleus (RN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) were manually segmented, and 396 features were extracted. After feature selection, support vector machine (SVM) was generated, and its predictive performance was calculated in both the training and testing cohorts using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).</p>Results<p>Seven radiomic features were selected from the PUT, by which the SVM classifier achieved the best diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.867 in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.862 in the testing cohort. Furthermore, the combined model, which incorporating part III of the Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSIII) scores into radiomic features of the PUT, further improved the diagnostic performance. However, radiomic features extracted from RN, SN, GP, CN, and STN had moderate to poor diagnostic performance, with AUC values that ranged from 0.610 to 0.788 in the training cohort and 0.583 to 0.766 in the testing cohort.</p>Conclusion<p>Radiomic features derived from the PUT had optimal value in differentiating IPD from MSA-P. A combined radiomic model, which contained radiomic features of the PUT and UPDRSIII scores, further improved performance and may represent a promising tool for distinguishing between IPD and MSA-P.</p>

<p>Financial exploitation (FE) in old age is devastating and common; however, the neural correlates of FE are poorly understood. Previous studies of FE in older adults have implicated declines in decision making and social cognition as two risk factors for FE in later life. Here we examined whether functional connectivity among brain regions implicated in decision making and social cognition differed for those with an experience of FE vs. those without. Participants included 16 older adults without cognitive impairment who reported FE (Mean age = 70.5, 62.5% female, Mean education = 16.0 years) and 16 demographically and cognitively matched adults who denied a history of FE (Mean age = 65.1, 37.5% female, Mean education = 15.1 years). Measures of whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity in the hippocampus, insula, and medial frontal cortex were derived for each group. Compared to the non-FE group, FE was associated with greater functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and bilateral temporal regions, and less functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and the right cerebellum and bilateral lingual gyri. The FE group showed less connectivity between the right and left insula and cingulate cortex, and between the right insula and regions of the left lateral temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Finally, the FE group showed greater functional connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the right lateral temporal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex, and less functional connectivity with the right pre- and postcentral gyri. Results suggest that perceived FE in old age is associated with whole-brain functional connectivity differences involving the hippocampus, insula, and medial frontal cortex, consistent with models implicating age-associated changes in decision making and social cognition in FE.</p>

<p>The disease biology of frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTD) is complex and not fully understood, with limited translational value appreciated from animal models to date. Human cellular systems that can recapitulate phenotypic features of disease offer promise as translational tools to not only increase our understanding of disease processes but also increase the probability of success of translating novel treatment options to patients. However not all researchers may necessarily have access to well-characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human neurons. As an example, we therefore comprehensively profiled phenotypic features over time in one commercially-available IPSC-derived human neuron cell line. This included systems-level assessments of neurite outgrowth dynamics, neuronal network function, and genome-wide gene expression. By investigating progranulin biology as an example we then demonstrated the utility of these cells as a tool to investigate human disease biology. For example, by using the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the progranulin (GRN) gene, we demonstrated the establishment of an isogenic human cellular model to facilitate translational FTD research. We reproduced findings from rodent neurons by demonstrating that recombinant progranulin (rPGRN) mediated neuroprotection. Contrary to previous rodent data, in our human cellular models, growth factor treatment showed no consistent sensitivity to modulate neurite outgrowth dynamics. Our study further provides the first evidence that rRPGRN modulated neuronal firing and synchrony in human neurons. Taken together, our datasets are a valuable systems-level resource demonstrating the utility of the tested commercially-available human iPSC neurons for investigating basic human neurobiology, translational neuroscience, and drug discovery applications in neurodegenerative and other CNS diseases.</p>

<p>Age-related deficits in selective attention have been demonstrated to depend on the sensory modality through which targets and distractors are presented. Some of these investigations suggest a specific impairment of cross-modal auditory selective attention. For the first time, this study is taking on a whole brain approach while including a passive perception baseline, to investigate the neural underpinnings of selective attention across age groups, and taking the sensory modality of relevant and irrelevant (i.e., distracting) stimuli into account. Sixteen younger (mean age = 23.3 years) and 14 older (mean age = 65.3 years), healthy participants performed a series of delayed match-to-sample tasks, in which participants had to selectively attend to visual stimuli, selectively attend to auditory stimuli, or passively view and hear both types of stimuli, while undergoing 3T fMRI. The imaging analyses showed that areas recruited by cross-modal visual and auditory selective attention in both age groups included parts of the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks (i.e., intraparietal sulcus, insula, fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate, and inferior frontal cortex). Most importantly, activation throughout the brain did not differ across age groups, suggesting intact brain function during cross-modal selective attention in older adults. Moreover, stronger brain activation during cross-modal visual vs. cross-modal auditory selective attention was found in both age groups, which is consistent with earlier accounts of visual dominance. In conclusion, these results do not support the hypothesized age-related deficit of cross-modal auditory selective attention. Instead, they suggest that the underlying neural correlates of cross-modal selective attention are similar in younger and older adults.</p>

<p>by Teresa Maria Rosaria Noviello, Francesco Ceccarelli, Michele Ceccarelli, Luigi Cerulo</p>

Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are short non-coding sequences involved in gene regulation in many biological processes and diseases. The lack of a complete comprehension of their biological functionality, especially in a genome-wide scenario, has demanded new computational approaches to annotate their roles. It is widely known that secondary structure is determinant to know RNA function and machine learning based approaches have been successfully proven to predict RNA function from secondary structure information. Here we show that RNA function can be predicted with good accuracy from a lightweight representation of sequence information without the necessity of computing secondary structure features which is computationally expensive. This finding appears to go against the dogma of secondary structure being a key determinant of function in RNA. Compared to recent secondary structure based methods, the proposed solution is more robust to sequence boundary noise and reduces drastically the computational cost allowing for large data volume annotations.

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides 3D visualization of subcellular components in the near-native state and at sub-molecular resolutions in single cells, demonstrating an increasingly important role in structural biology <i>in situ</i>. However, systematic recognition and recovery of macromolecular structures in cryo-ET data remain challenging as a result of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small sizes of macromolecules, and high complexity of the cellular environment. Subtomogram structural classification is an essential step for such task. Although acquisition of large amounts of subtomograms is no longer an obstacle due to advances in automation of data collection, obtaining the same number of structural labels is both computation and labor intensive. On the other hand, existing deep learning based supervised classification approaches are highly demanding on labeled data and have limited ability to learn about new structures rapidly from data containing very few labels of such new structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach for subtomogram classification based on few-shot learning. With our approach, classification of unseen structures in the training data can be conducted given few labeled samples in test data through instance embedding. Experiments were performed on both simulated and real datasets. Our experimental results show that we can make inference on new structures given only five labeled samples for each class with a competitive accuracy (&gt; 0.86 on the simulated dataset with SNR = 0.1), or even one sample with an accuracy of 0.7644. The results on real datasets are also promising with accuracy &gt; 0.9 on both conditions and even up to 1 on one of the real datasets. Our approach achieves significant improvement compared with the baseline method and has strong capabilities of generalizing to other cellular components.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/krPd1qOwjh8" width="1" />

Complete resection of the tumor is important for survival in glioma patients. Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n = 565), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis. Our results show that a random forest based approach can distinguish samples with tumor cells and controls accurately and effectively with a median AUC of 85.6% and AUPR of 93.4%. We also show that we can further distinguish benign and malignant samples with a median AUC of 87.1% and AUPR of 96.1%. We analyze the feature (peak) importance for classification to interpret the results of the classifier. We validate that known malignancy biomarkers such as creatine and 2-hydroxyglutarate play an important role in distinguishing tumor and normal cells and suggest new biomarker regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.</p>

<p>Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adaptive memory requires the organism to form associations that bridge between events separated in time. Many studies show interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during formation of such associations. We analyze neural recording from monkey HPC and PFC during a memory task that requires the monkey to associate stimuli separated by about a second in time. After the first stimulus was presented, large numbers of units in both HPC and PFC fired in sequence. Many units fired only when a particular stimulus was presented at a particular time in the past. These results indicate that both HPC and PFC maintain a temporal record of events that could be used to form associations across time. This temporal record of the past is a key component of the temporal coding hypothesis, a hypothesis in psychology that memory not only encodes what happened, but when it happened.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prevalence of cancer‐related pain is 64% among patients with metastatic, advanced, or terminal cancer, 59% among patients undergoing anticancer treatment, and 33% among patients who completed curative treatment. According to the World Health Organization cancer pain relief guidelines, opioid analgesics are the mainstay analgesic therapy in addition to conventional first‐step analgesics, such as non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. The indications for strong opioids have recently been expanded to include mild‐to‐moderate pain in addition to moderate‐to‐severe pain. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines emphasize that realistic expectations should be weighed against potential serious harm from opioids, rather than relying on the unrealized long‐term benefits of these drugs. Therefore, treatment strategies for both cancer‐related chronic or acute pain have been unfortunately deviated from opioid analgesics. The barriers hindering adequate cancer‐related pain management with opioid analgesics are related to the inadequate knowledge of opioid analgesics (e.g., effective dose, adverse effects, and likelihood of addiction or tolerance). To achieve adequate opioid availability, these barriers should be overcome in a clinically suitable manner. Genetic assessments could play an important role in overcoming challenges in opioid management. To balance the improvement in opioid availability and the prevention of opioid misuse and addiction, the following two considerations concerning opioids and genetic polymorphisms warrant attention: (A) pain severity, opioid sensitivity, and opioid tolerance; and (B) vulnerability to opioid dependence and addiction.</p>

<p>All neurons possess a primary cilium that projects from the cell body into the extracellular space. This study investigates the behavioral responses of mice engineered to lack a primary cilium on either Gad2 expressing GABAergic neurons, or Dopaminergic neurons, to injections of amphetamine.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural mechanisms that underlie responses to drugs of abuse are complex, and impacted by a number of neuromodulatory peptides. Within the past 10 years it has been discovered that several of the receptors for neuromodulators are enriched in the primary cilia of neurons. Primary cilia are microtubule‐based organelles that project from the surface of nearly all mammalian cells, including neurons. Despite what we know about cilia, our understanding of how cilia regulate neuronal function and behavior is still limited. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of primary cilia on specific neuronal populations to behavioral responses to amphetamine. To test the consequences of cilia loss on amphetamine‐induced locomotor activity we selectively ablated cilia from dopaminergic or GAD2‐GABAergic neurons in mice. Cilia loss had no effect on baseline locomotion in either mouse strain. In mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons, locomotor activity compared to wild‐ type mice was reduced in both sexes in response to acute administration of 3.0 mg/kg amphetamine. In contrast, changes in the locomotor response to amphetamine in mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons were primarily driven by reductions in locomotor activity in males. Following repeated amphetamine administration (1.0 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> over 5 days), mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons exhibited enhanced sensitization of the locomotor stimulant response to the drug, whereas mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons did not differ from wild‐type controls. These results indicate that cilia play neuron‐specific roles in both acute and neuroplastic responses to psychostimulant drugs of abuse.</p>

<p>Detecting changes in the environment is fundamental for our survival. According to predictive coding theory, detecting these irregularities relies both on incoming sensory information and our top–down prior expectations (or internal generative models) about the world. Prediction errors (PEs), detectable in event-related potentials (ERPs), occur when there is a mismatch between the sensory input and our internal model (i.e., a surprise event). Many changes occurring in our environment are irrelevant for survival and may remain unseen. Such changes, even if subtle, can nevertheless be detected by the brain without emerging into consciousness. What remains unclear is how these changes are processed in the brain at the network level. Here, we used a visual oddball paradigm in which participants engaged in a central letter task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings while presented with task-irrelevant high- or low-coherence background, random-dot motion. Critically, once in a while, the direction of the dots changed. After the EEG session, we confirmed that changes in motion direction at high- and low-coherence were visible and invisible, respectively, using psychophysical measurements. ERP analyses revealed that changes in motion direction elicited PE regardless of the visibility, but with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To understand these responses, we applied dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to the EEG data. Bayesian Model Averaging showed visible PE relied on a release from adaptation (repetition suppression) within bilateral MT+, whereas invisible PE relied on adaptation at bilateral V1 (and left MT+). Furthermore, while feedforward upregulation was present for invisible PE, the visible change PE also included downregulation of feedback between right MT+ to V1. Our findings reveal a complex interplay of modulation in the generative network models underlying visible and invisible motion changes.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a highly variable and complex set of neurological disorders that alter neurodevelopment and cognitive function, which usually presents with social and learning impairments accompanied with other comorbid symptoms like hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity, or repetitive behaviors. Autism can be caused by genetic and/or environmental factors and unraveling the etiology of ASD has proven challenging, especially given that different genetic mutations can cause both similar and different phenotypes that all fall within the autism spectrum. Furthermore, the list of ASD risk genes is ever increasing making it difficult to synthesize a common theme. The use of rodent models to enhance ASD research is invaluable and is beginning to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disease. Recently, zebrafish have been recognized as a useful model of neurodevelopmental disorders with regards to genetics, pharmacology and behavior and one of the main foundations supporting autism research (SFARI) recently identified 12 ASD risk genes with validated zebrafish mutant models. Here, we describe what is known about those 12 ASD risk genes in human, mice and zebrafish to better facilitate this research. We also describe several non-genetic models including pharmacological and gnotobiotic models that are used in zebrafish to study ASD.</p>

<p>Background: It has been consistently reported that the deficiency of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensitive purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) ameliorates symptoms in animal models of brain diseases.</p><p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of P2X7R in rodent models of acute and subchronic schizophrenia based on phencyclidine (PCP) delivery in animals lacking or overexpressing P2X7R, and to identify the underlying mechanisms involved.</p><p>Methods: The psychotomimetic effects of acute i.p. PCP administration in C57Bl/6J wild-type, P2X7R knockout (P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup>) and overexpressing (P2X7-EGFP) young adult mice were quantified. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> and heterozygous P2X7-EGFP acutely treated animals was characterized through immunohistochemical staining. The prefrontal cortices of young adult P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> and P2rx7<sup>tg/+</sup> mice were examined with tritiated dopamine release experiments and the functional properties of the mPFC pyramidal neurons in layer V from P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> mice were assessed by patch-clamp recordings. P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> animals were subjected to a 7 days subchronic systemic PCP treatment. The animals working memory performance and PFC cytokine levels were assessed.</p><p>Results: Our data strengthen the hypothesis that P2X7R modulates schizophrenia-like positive and cognitive symptoms in NMDA receptor antagonist models in a receptor expression level-dependent manner. P2X7R expression leads to higher medial PFC susceptibility to PCP-induced circuit hyperactivity. The mPFC of P2X7R knockout animals displayed distinct alterations in the neuronal activation pattern, microglial organization, specifically around hyperactive neurons, and were associated with lower intrinsic excitability of mPFC neurons.</p><p>Conclusions: P2X7R expression exacerbated PCP-related effects in C57Bl/6J mice. Our findings suggest a pleiotropic role of P2X7R in the mPFC, consistent with the observed behavioral phenotype, regulating basal dopamine concentration, layer-specific neuronal activation, intrinsic excitability of neurons in the mPFC, and the interaction of microglia with hyperactive neurons. Direct measurements of P2X7R activity concerning microglial ramifications and dynamics could help to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved.</p>

<p>The degeneration of light-detecting rod and cone photoreceptors in the human retina leads to severe visual impairment and ultimately legal blindness in millions of people worldwide. Multiple therapeutic options at different stages of degeneration are being explored but the majority of ongoing clinical trials involve adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based gene supplementation strategies for select forms of inherited retinal disease. Over 300 genes are associated with inherited retinal degenerations and only a small proportion of these will be suitable for gene replacement therapy. However, while the origins of disease may vary, there are considerable similarities in the physiological changes that occur in the retina. When early therapeutic intervention is not possible and patients suffer loss of photoreceptor cells but maintain remaining layers of cells in the neural retina, there is an opportunity for a universal gene therapy approach that can be applied regardless of the genetic origin of disease. Optogenetic therapy offers such a strategy by aiming to restore vision though the provision of light-sensitive molecules to surviving cell types of the retina that enable light perception through the residual neurons. Here we review the recent progress in attempts to restore visual function to the degenerate retina using optogenetic therapy. We focus on multiple pre-clinical models used in optogenetic strategies, discuss their strengths and limitations, and highlight considerations including vector and transgene designs that have advanced the field into two ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<p>Numerous studies find that creativity is not only associated with low effort and flexible processes but also associated with high effort and persistent processes especially when defensive behavior is induced by negative emotions. The important role of self-esteem is to buffer negative emotions, and individuals with low self-esteem are prone to instigating various forms of defensive behaviors. Thus, we thought that the relationships between trait creativity and executive control brain networks might be modulated by self-esteem. The resting-state electroencephalogram (RS-EEG) microstates can be divided into four classical types (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4), which can reflect the brain networks as well as their dynamic characteristic. Thus, the Williams Creative Tendency Scale (WCTS) and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES) were used to investigate the modulating role of self-esteem on the relationships between trait creativity and the RS-EEG microstates. As our results showed, self-esteem consistently modulated the relationships between creativity and the duration and contribution of MS2 related to visual or imagery processing, the occurrence of MS3 related to cingulo-opercular networks, and transitions between MS2 and MS4, which were related to frontoparietal control networks. Based on these results, we thought that trait creativity was related to the executive control of bottom-up processing for individuals with low self-esteem, while the bottom-up information from vision or visual imagery might be related to trait creativity for individuals with high self-esteem.</p>

<p>Our understanding of the neurofunctional mechanisms of speech production and their pathologies is still incomplete. In this paper, a comprehensive model of speech production based on the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is presented. This model is able to activate sensorimotor plans based on cognitive-functional processes (i.e., generation of the intention of an utterance, selection of words and syntactic frames, generation of the phonological form and motor plan; feedforward mechanism). Since the generation of different states of the utterance are tied to different levels in the speech production hierarchy, it is shown that different forms of speech errors as well as speech disorders can arise at different levels in the production hierarchy or are linked to different levels and different modules in the speech production model. In addition, the influence of the inner feedback mechanisms on normal as well as on disordered speech is examined in terms of the model. The model uses a small number of core concepts provided by the NEF, and we show that these are sufficient to create this neurobiologically detailed model of the complex process of speech production in a manner that is, we believe, clear, efficient, and understandable.</p>

<p>Olfaction plays an important role in the evaluation, motivation, and palatability of food. The chemical identity of odorants is coded by a spatial combination of activated glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, which is referred to as the odor map. However, the functional roles of the olfactory cortex, a collective region that receives axonal projections from the olfactory bulb, and higher olfactory centers in odor-guided eating behaviors are yet to be elucidated. The olfactory tubercle (OT) is a component of the ventral striatum and forms a node within the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. Recent studies have revealed the anatomical domain structures of the OT and their functions in distinct odor-guided motivated behaviors. Another component of the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens, is well known for its involvement in motivation and hedonic responses for foods, which raises the possibility of functional similarities between the OT and nucleus accumbens in eating. This review first summarizes recent findings on the domain- and neuronal subtype-specific roles of the OT in odor-guided motivated behaviors and then proposes a model for the regulation of eating behaviors by the OT.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has a brain neurotropism through binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed by neurones and glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Systemic infection which accompanies severe cases of COVID-19 also triggers substantial increase in circulating levels of chemokines and interleukins that compromise the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain parenchyma and affect its defensive systems, astrocytes and microglia. Brain areas devoid of a blood-brain barrier such as the circumventricular organs are particularly vulnerable to circulating inflammatory mediators. The performance of astrocytes and microglia, as well as of immune cells required for brain health, is considered critical in defining the neurological damage and neurological outcome of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the implication of neuroinflammation, adaptive and innate immunity, autoimmunity, as well as astrocytic and microglial immune and homeostatic functions in the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during ageing, in the presence of systemic comorbidities, and for the exposed pregnant mother and foetus are also covered.</p>

<p>Neurons have been long regarded as the basic functional cells of the brain, whereas astrocytes and microglia have been regarded only as elements of support. However, proper intercommunication among neurons–astrocytes–microglia is of fundamental importance for the functional organization of the brain. Perturbation in the regulation of brain energy metabolism not only in neurons but also in astrocytes and microglia may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration, especially in hypoxia/ischemia. Glial activation has long been considered detrimental for survival of neurons, but recently it appears that glial responses to an insult are not equal but vary in different brain areas. In this review, we first take into consideration the modifications of the vascular unit of the glymphatic system and glial metabolism in hypoxic conditions. Using the method of triple-labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal microscopy (TIC), we recently studied the interplay among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in chronic brain hypoperfusion. We evaluated the quantitative and morpho-functional alterations of the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads comparing the hippocampal CA1 area, more vulnerable to ischemia, to the CA3 area, less vulnerable. In these contiguous and interconnected areas, in the same experimental hypoxic conditions, astrocytes and microglia show differential, finely regulated, region-specific reactivities. In both areas, astrocytes and microglia form triad clusters with apoptotic, degenerating neurons. In the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads, the cell body of a damaged neuron is infiltrated and bisected by branches of astrocyte that create a microscar around it while a microglial cell phagocytoses the damaged neuron. These coordinated actions are consistent with the scavenging and protective activities of microglia. In hypoxia, the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads are more numerous in CA3 than in CA1, further indicating their protective effects. These data, taken from contiguous and interconnected hippocampal areas, demonstrate that glial response to the same hypoxic insult is not equal but varies significantly. Understanding the differences of glial reactivity is of great interest to explain the differential susceptibility of hippocampal areas to hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies may evidence the differential reactivity of glia in different brain areas, explaining the higher or lower sensitivity of these areas to different insults and whether glia may represent a target for future therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Maternal exposure to the valproate short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) during pregnancy is known to possibly induce autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the offspring. By contrast, case studies have evidenced positive outcomes of this anticonvulsant drug in children with severe autism. Interestingly, the same paradoxical pattern applies to the IL-17a inflammatory cytokine involved in the immune system regulation. Such joint apparent contradictions can be overcome by pointing out that, among their respective signaling pathways, valproate and IL-17a share an enhancement of the “type A monoamine oxidase” (MAOA) enzyme carried by the X chromosome. In the Guided Propagation (GP) model of autism, such enzymatic rise triggers a prenatal epigenetic downregulation, which, without possible X-inactivation, and when coinciding with genetic expression variants of other brain enzymes, results in the delayed onset of autistic symptoms. The underlying imbalance of synaptic monoamines, serotonin in the first place, would reflect a mismatch between the environment to which the brain metabolism was prepared during gestation and the postnatal actual surroundings. Following a prenatal exposure to molecules that significantly elicit the MAOA gene expression, a daily treatment with the same metabolic impact would tend to recreate the fetal environment and contribute to rebalance monoamines, thus allowing proper neural circuits to gradually develop, provided behavioral re-education. Given the multifaceted other players than MAOA that are involved in the regulation of serotonin levels, potential compensatory effects are surveyed, which may underlie the autism heterogeneity. This explanatory framework opens up prospects regarding autism prevention and treatment, strikingly in line with current advances along the gut microbiome–brain axis.</p>

<p>Selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), targeting α5 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) as potential therapeutic targets for disorders associated with cognitive deficits, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), continually fail clinical trials. We investigated whether this was due to the change in the expression of α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, consequently altering synaptic function during AD pathogenesis. Using medicinal chemistry and computational modeling, we developed aqueous soluble hybrids of 6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl) thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophene-4(5H)-one, that demonstrated selective binding and high negative allosteric modulation, specifically for the α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes in constructed HEK293 stable cell-lines. Using a knock-in mouse model of AD (APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup>), which expresses a mutant form of human amyloid-β (Aβ), we performed immunofluorescence studies combined with electrophysiological whole-cell recordings to investigate the effects of our key molecule, α5-SOP002 in the hippocampal CA1 region. In aged APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup> mice, selective preservation of α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs was observed in, calretinin- (CR), cholecystokinin- (CCK), somatostatin- (SST) expressing interneurons, and pyramidal cells. Previously, we reported that CR dis-inhibitory interneurons, specialized in regulating other interneurons displayed abnormally high levels of synaptic inhibition in the APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup> mouse model, here we show that this excessive inhibition was “normalized” to control values with bath-applied α5-SOP002 (1 μM). However, α5-SOP002, further impaired inhibition onto CCK and pyramidal cells that were already largely compromised by exhibiting a deficit of inhibition in the AD model. In summary, using a multi-disciplinary approach, we show that exposure to α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R NAMs may further compromise aberrant synapses in AD. We, therefore, suggest that the α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R is not a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD or other cognitive deficits due to the widespread neuronal-networks that use α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>

<p>Progression of neuronal deterioration within specific brain regions is considered as one of the principal bases for the development of major depressive disorders. Therefore, protects and promotes the maintaining of normal structure and function of neurons might be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of depression. Here, we report that the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), inhibited neuronal injury through its capacity to reduce oxidative stress and exerted antidepressant effects. Specifically, we show that antioxidant enzyme activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of depressive rats, while treatment with NAC (300 mg/kg, i.p.) produced neuroprotective effects against mitochondrial oxidative stress injuries and oxidative DNA damage in CA1 neurons of these rats. Moreover, NAC treatment alleviated neuronal injury resulting from neuroinflammation and apoptosis in depressed rats, effects that were associated with reductions in dendritic spine atrophy, and synapse deficits. These effects appear to involve a down-regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-JNK signaling along with an up-regulation of ERK signaling within the hippocampal CA1 region. Moreover, this NAC treatment significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors as indicated by performance in the sucrose preference and forced swim tests (FST). Taken together, these results reveal the potential involvement of oxidative stress in the generation of depression. And, the antidepressant-like effects exerted by NAC may involve reductions in this oxidative stress that can result in neuronal deterioration. Such neuroprotective effects of NAC may indicate a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of stress-related depression.</p>

<p>Background: Intrinsically organized large-scale brain networks and their interactions support complex cognitive function. Investigations suggest that the default network (DN) is the earliest disrupted network and that the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) are subsequently impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These large-scale networks comprise different subsystems (DN: medial temporal lobe (MTL), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DM) subsystems and a Core; FPCN: FPCNA and FPCNB). Our previous research has indicated that different DN subsystems are not equally damaged in AD. However, changes in the patterns of interactions among these large-scale network subsystems and the underlying cause of the alterations in AD remain unclear. We hypothesized that disrupted DN subsystems cause specific impairments in inter-system interactions and a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.</p><p>Method: To test this hypothesis, Granger causality analysis (GCA) was performed to explore effective functional connectivity (FC) pattern of these networks. The regional information flow strength (IFS) was calculated and compared across groups to explore changes in the subsystems and their inter-system interactions and the relationship between them. To investigate specific inter-system changes, we summed the inter-system IFS and performed correlation analyses of the bidirectional inter-system IFS, which was compared across groups. Additionally, correlation analyses of dynamic effective FC patterns were performed to reveal alterations in the temporal co-evolution of sets of inter-subsystem interactions. Furthermore, we used partial correlation analysis to quantify the FPCN's regulatory effects. Finally, we applied a support vector machine (SVM) linear classifier to probe which network most effectively discriminated patients from controls.</p><p>Results: Compared with controls, AD patients showed a decreased intra-DN regional IFS, which was significantly related to the inter-network's IFS. The IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCN subsystems/DAN decreased. Critically, the correlation values of the decreased bidirectional IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCNA diminished. Additionally, the Core and DM play pivotal roles in disordered temporal co-evolution. Furthermore, the FPCNA showed enhanced regulation of the Core. Finally, the MTL subsystem and Core were effective at discriminating patients from controls.</p><p>Conclusion: The predominantly disrupted DN subsystems caused impaired inter-system interactions and created a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as mediators and biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Two distinct forms of Alzheimer disease (AD) are known: a late-onset sporadic form (SAD) and an early-onset familial form (FAD). Recently, neurovascular dysfunction and altered systemic immunological components have been linked to AD neurodegeneration. Therefore, we characterized systemic-EVs from postmortem SAD and FAD patients and evaluated their effects on neuroglial and endothelial cells. We found increase CLN-5 spots with vesicular morphology in the abluminal portion of vessels from SAD patients. Both forms of AD were associated with larger and more numerous systemic EVs. Specifically, SAD patients showed an increase in endothelial- and leukocyte-derived EVs containing mitochondria; in contrast, FAD patients showed an increase in platelet-derived EVs. We detected a differential protein composition for SAD- and FAD-EVs associated with the coagulation cascade, inflammation, and lipid-carbohydrate metabolism. Using mono- and cocultures (endothelium-astrocytes-neurons) and human cortical organoids, we showed that AD-EVs induced cytotoxicity. Both forms of AD featured decreased neuronal branches area and astrocytic hyperreactivity, but SAD-EVs led to greater endothelial detrimental effects than FAD-EVs. In addition, FAD- and SAD-EVs affected calcium dynamics in a cortical organoid model. Our findings indicate that the phenotype of systemic AD-EVs is differentially defined by the etiopathology of the disease (SAD or FAD), which results in a differential alteration of the NVU cells implied in neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>by Tiina Manninen, Ausra Saudargiene, Marja-Leena Linne</p>

Astrocytes have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in specific cortical synapses, but our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remains limited. Here we present a new biophysicochemical model of a somatosensory cortical layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapse to study the role of astrocytes in spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) <i>in vivo</i>. By applying the synapse model and electrophysiological data recorded from rodent somatosensory cortex, we show that a signal from a postsynaptic neuron, orchestrated by endocannabinoids, astrocytic calcium signaling, and presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors coupled with calcineurin signaling, induces t-LTD which is sensitive to the temporal difference between post- and presynaptic firing. We predict for the first time the dynamics of astrocyte-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying t-LTD and link complex biochemical networks at presynaptic, postsynaptic, and astrocytic sites to the time window of t-LTD induction. During t-LTD a single astrocyte acts as a delay factor for fast neuronal activity and integrates fast neuronal sensory processing with slow non-neuronal processing to modulate synaptic properties in the brain. Our results suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in synaptic computation during postnatal development and are of paramount importance in guiding the development of brain circuit functions, learning and memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hl6PJIbIOEc" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel Nüst, Vanessa Sochat, Ben Marwick, Stephen J. Eglen, Tim Head, Tony Hirst, Benjamin D. Evans</p>

Computational science has been greatly improved by the use of containers for packaging software and data dependencies. In a scholarly context, the main drivers for using these containers are transparency and support of reproducibility; in turn, a workflow’s reproducibility can be greatly affected by the choices that are made with respect to building containers. In many cases, the build process for the container’s image is created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows. By following the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective and sustainable personal workflows.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4EN5XLEWE9Q" width="1" />

Hypertension is the most important cause of death and disability in the elderly. In 9 out of 10 cases, the molecular cause, however, is unknown. One mechanistic hypothesis involves impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Indeed, ROS forming NADPH oxidase (<i>Nox</i>) genes associate with hypertension, yet target validation has been negative. We re-investigate this association by molecular network analysis and identify NOX5, not present in rodents, as a sole neighbor to human vasodilatory endothelial nitric oxide (NO) signaling. In hypertensive patients, endothelial microparticles indeed contained higher levels of NOX5—but not NOX1, NOX2, or NOX4—with a bimodal distribution correlating with disease severity. Mechanistically, mice expressing human <i>N</i>ox5 in endothelial cells developed—upon aging—severe systolic hypertension and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to uncoupled NO synthase (NOS). We conclude that NOX5-induced uncoupling of endothelial NOS is a causal mechanism and theragnostic target of an age-related hypertension endotype. <i>N</i>ox5 knock-in (KI) mice represent the first mechanism-based animal model of hypertension.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OYrIOvWWwEA" width="1" />

<p>by Silvio Macias, Kushal Bakshi, Francisco Garcia-Rosales, Julio C. Hechavarria, Michael Smotherman</p>

Echolocating bats rely upon spectral interference patterns in echoes to reconstruct fine details of a reflecting object’s shape. However, the acoustic modulations required to do this are extremely brief, raising questions about how their auditory cortex encodes and processes such rapid and fine spectrotemporal details. Here, we tested the hypothesis that biosonar target shape representation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is more reliably encoded by changes in spike timing (latency) than spike rates and that latency is sufficiently precise to support a synchronization-based ensemble representation of this critical auditory object feature space. To test this, we measured how the spatiotemporal activation patterns of A1 changed when naturalistic spectral notches were inserted into echo mimic stimuli. Neurons tuned to notch frequencies were predicted to exhibit longer latencies and lower mean firing rates due to lower signal amplitudes at their preferred frequencies, and both were found to occur. Comparative analyses confirmed that significantly more information was recoverable from changes in spike times relative to concurrent changes in spike rates. With this data, we reconstructed spatiotemporal activation maps of A1 and estimated the level of emerging neuronal spike synchrony between cortical neurons tuned to different frequencies. The results support existing computational models, indicating that spectral interference patterns may be efficiently encoded by a cascading tonotopic sequence of neural synchronization patterns within an ensemble of network activity that relates to the physical features of the reflecting object surface.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3FZBnVuZ3uI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.</p>

<p>WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) was first identified in <i>Drosophila</i> as a clock‐output molecule that regulates the timing of sleep and arousal. There is a single homolog of WAKE (mWAKE/ANKFN1/NMF9) in mice, which has previously shown to be enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian pacemaker. This present work surveys the brain expression pattern of mWAKE using multiple approaches. First, <i>mWake</i> mRNA expression is examined using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Second, mWAKE protein expression is investigated using two different transgenic animal models: an <i>mWake</i>
<sup>
   <i>V5</i>
</sup> mouse where a V5 tag is fused directly to the end of the protein and an <i>mWake</i>
<sup>
   <i>tdTomato‐2A‐Cre</i>
</sup> mouse where tdTomato is inserted in‐frame within the gene. Third, we analyze scRNA‐Seq data to characterize the molecular identity of <i>mWake</i> neurons in the hypothalamus. These data reveal that mWAKE labels a distributed subset of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons across the brainstem, subcortical regions, and cortex, with significant expression in the hypothalamus. This study may provide a potential roadmap for future studies of the circadian regulation of distinct circuits and behaviors.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Structure–function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically‐based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in <i>Drosophila</i>, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and our data suggest that its basic role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of <i>mWake</i> mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and tuberomammillary nucleus region), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non‐neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of <i>mWake</i>
<sup>+</sup> cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWAKE<sup>+</sup> cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Members of the POU4F/Brn3 transcription factor family have an established role in the development of retinal ganglion cell (RGCs) types, the main transducers of visual information from the mammalian eye to the brain. Our previous work using sparse random recombination of a conditional knock‐in reporter allele expressing alkaline phosphatase (AP) and intersectional genetics had identified three types of Brn3c positive (Brn3c<sup>+</sup>) RGCs. Here, we describe a novel Brn3c<sup>Cre</sup> mouse allele generated by serial Dre to Cre recombination and use it to explore the expression overlap of Brn3c with Brn3a and Brn3b and the dendritic arbor morphologies and visual stimulus response properties of Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGC types. Furthermore, we explore brain nuclei that express Brn3c or receive input from Brn3c<sup>+</sup> neurons. Our analysis reveals a much larger number of Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGCs and more diverse set of RGC types than previously reported. Most RGCs expressing Brn3c during development are still Brn3c positive in the adult, and all express Brn3a while only about half express Brn3b. Genetic Brn3c‐Brn3b intersection reveals an area of increased RGC density, extending from dorsotemporal to ventrolateral across the retina and overlapping with the mouse binocular field of view. In addition, we report a Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGC projection to the thalamic reticular nucleus, a visual nucleus that was not previously shown to receive retinal input. Furthermore, Brn3c<sup>+</sup> neurons highlight a previously unknown subdivision of the deep mesencephalic nucleus. Thus, our newly generated allele provides novel biological insights into RGC type classification, brain connectivity, and cytoarchitectonic.</p>

<p>Insects use UV light as navigation signals to locate the position of the sun. In this study, we construct a comprehensive map of the downstream circuitry of UV‐sensing R7 neurons by analyzing large‐scale 3D neural data at the single‐neuron resolution in <i>Drosophila</i>. We find six families of visual projection neurons that connect the optic lobe to the central brain. Our imaging study reveals the morphological diversity of these visual projection neurons of the medulla layer 6 (M<sub>6</sub>) downstream circuitry suggests the multi‐dimensional processing of UV information via hierarchical, multiple‐layer, parallel, and bilateral circuits in the brain. Furthermore, we describe a detailed neuroanatomical description of the lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and the bulb (BU).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain perceives visual information and controls behavior depending on its underlying neural circuits. How UV information is represented and processed in the brain remains poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, UV light is detected by the R7 photoreceptor that project exclusively into the medulla layer 6 (M<sub>6</sub>). Herein, we imaged 28,768 single neurons and identified 238 visual projection neurons linking M<sub>6</sub> to the central brain. Based on morphology and connectivity, these visual projection neurons were systematically classified into 94 cell types belonging to 12 families. Three tracts connected M<sub>6</sub> in each optic lobe to the central brain: One dorsal tract linking to the ipsilateral lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and two medial tracts linking to the ipsilateral ventral medial protocerebrum (VMP) and the contralateral VMP. The M<sub>6</sub> information was primarily represented in the L‐AOTU. Each L‐AOTU consisted of four columns that each contained three glomeruli. Each L‐AOTU glomerulus received inputs from M<sub>6</sub> subdomains and gave outputs to a glomerulus within the ellipsoid body dendritic region, suggesting specific processing of spatial information through the dorsal pathway. Furthermore, the middle columns of the L‐AOTUs of both hemispheres were connected via the intertubercle tract, suggesting information integration between the two eyes. In contrast, an ascending neuron linked each VMP to all glomeruli in the bulb and the L‐AOTU, bilaterally, suggesting general processing of information through the ventral pathway. Altogether, these diverse morphologies of the visual projection neurons suggested multi‐dimensional processing of UV information through parallel and bilateral circuits in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain.</p>

<p>Visual metacognition—the introspection and evaluation of one’s own visual perceptual processes—is measured through both decision confidence and “metacognitive efficiency.” Metacognitive efficiency refers to an individual’s ability to accurately judge incorrect and correct decisions through confidence ratings given their task performance. Previous imaging studies in humans and nonhuman primates reported widely distributed brain regions being involved in decision confidence and metacognition. However, the neural correlates of metacognition are remarkably inconsistent across studies concerning spatial outline. Therefore, this study investigates the neural correlates of visual metacognition by examining co-activation across regions that scale with visual decision confidence. We hypothesized that interacting processes of perceptual and metacognitive performance contribute to the arising decision confidence in distributed, but segregable co-activating brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we performed task-fMRI in healthy humans during a visual backward masking task with four-scale, post-decision confidence ratings. We measured blood oxygenation covariation patterns, which served as a physiological proxy for co-activation across brain regions. Decision confidence ratings and an individual’s metacognitive efficiency served as behavioral measures for metacognition. We found three distinct co-activation clusters involved in decision confidence: the first included right-centered fronto-temporal-parietal regions, the second included left temporal and parietal regions, and the left basal forebrain (BF), and the third included cerebellar regions. The right fronto-temporal-parietal cluster including the supplementary eye field and the right basal forebrain showed stronger co-activation in subjects with higher metacognitive efficiency. Our results provide novel evidence for co-activation of widely distributed fronto-parieto-temporal regions involved in visual confidence. The supplementary eye field was the only region that activated for both decision confidence and metacognitive efficiency, suggesting the supplementary eye field plays a key role in visual metacognition. Our results link findings in electrophysiology studies and human fMRI studies and provide evidence that confidence estimates arise from the integration of multiple information processing pathways.</p>

<p>Oscillations in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the cerebellar cortex have been related to behavior and could facilitate communication with the cerebral cortex. These local field potential (LFP) oscillations, strong at 4–12 Hz in the rodent cerebellar cortex during awake immobility, should also be an indicator of an underlying influence on the patterns of the cerebellar cortex neuronal firing during rest. To address this hypothesis, cerebellar cortex LFPs and simultaneous single-neuron activity were collected during LFP oscillatory periods in the GCL of awake resting rats. During these oscillatory episodes, different types of units across the GCL and Purkinje cell layers showed variable phase-relation with the oscillatory cycles. Overall, 74% of the Golgi cell firing and 54% of the Purkinje cell simple spike (SS) firing were phase-locked with the oscillations, displaying a clear phase relationship. Despite this tendency, fewer Golgi cells (50%) and Purkinje cell’s SSs (25%) showed an oscillatory firing pattern. Oscillatory phase-locked spikes for the Golgi and Purkinje cells occurred towards the peak of the LFP cycle. GCL LFP oscillations had a strong capacity to predict the timing of Golgi cell spiking activity, indicating a strong influence of this oscillatory phenomenon over the GCL. Phase-locking was not as prominent for the Purkinje cell SS firing, indicating a weaker influence over the Purkinje cell layer, yet a similar phase relation. Overall, synaptic activity underlying GCL LFP oscillations likely exert an influence on neuronal population firing patterns in the cerebellar cortex in the awake resting state and could have a preparatory neural network shaping capacity serving as a neural baseline for upcoming cerebellar operations.</p>

<p>Neural systems involved in processing natural rewards and drugs of abuse overlap and exposure to drugs of abuse induce neuroadaptations that can cause compulsive-like behavior. For example, the recruitment of the orexin (Orx) system by drugs of abuse has been proposed to induce neuroadaptations that in turn alter its function, reflected by maladaptive, compulsive, and addictive behavior. Orexin neurons project to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT)—particularly the posterior part (pPVT), a structure that plays a key role in stress regulation. This study investigated whether Orx transmission in the pPVT plays a role in stress-induced reinstatement of reward-seeking behavior toward ethanol (EtOH) and a highly palatable food reward [sweetened condensed milk (SCM)] in rats and whether this role changes with EtOH dependence. After being trained to orally self-administer EtOH or SCM, the rats were made dependent (EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub>) by chronic intermittent EtOH vapor exposure. The control nondependent groups (EtOH<sub>ND</sub> and SCM<sub>ND</sub>) were exposed to air. Following extinction, the rats were tested for stress-induced reinstatement of EtOH- and SCM-seeking behavior. Stress reinstated EtOH- and SCM-seeking behavior in all groups (EtOH<sub>D/ND</sub> and SCM<sub>D/ND</sub>). Administration of the dual Orx receptor (OrxR) antagonist TCS1102 (15 μg) in the pPVT prevented stress-induced reinstatement only in dependent rats (EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub>). In parallel, the qPCR analysis showed that Orx mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and OrxR1/R2 mRNA expression in the pPVT were increased at the time of testing in the EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub> groups. These results are the first to implicate Orx transmission in the pPVT in the stress-induced reinstatement of reward-seeking behavior in EtOH dependent rats and indicate the maladaptive recruitment of Orx transmission in the pPVT by EtOH dependence.</p>

<p>A large variety of methods exist to estimate brain coupling in the frequency domain from electrophysiological data measured, e.g., by EEG and MEG. Those data are to reasonable approximation, though certainly not perfectly, Gaussian distributed. This work is based on the well-known fact that for Gaussian distributed data, the cross-spectrum completely determines all statistical properties. In particular, for an infinite number of data, all normalized coupling measures at a given frequency are a function of complex coherency. However, it is largely unknown what the functional relations are. We here present those functional relations for six different measures: the weighted phase lag index, the phase lag index, the absolute value and imaginary part of the phase locking value (PLV), power envelope correlation, and power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction. With the exception of PLV, the final results are simple closed form formulas. In an excursion we also discuss differences between short time Fourier transformation and Hilbert transformation for estimations in the frequency domain. We tested in simulations of linear and non-linear dynamical systems and for empirical resting state EEG on sensor level to what extent a model, namely the respective function of coherency, can explain the observed couplings. For empirical data we found that for measures of phase-phase coupling deviations from the model are in general minor, while power envelope correlations systematically deviate from the model for all frequencies. For power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction the model cannot explain the observed couplings at all. We also analyzed power envelope correlation as a function of time and frequency in an event related experiment using a stroop reaction task and found significant event related deviations mostly in the alpha range.</p>

<p>One major challenge in medical imaging analysis is the lack of label and annotation which usually requires medical knowledge and training. This issue is particularly serious in the brain image analysis such as the analysis of retinal vasculature, which directly reflects the vascular condition of Central Nervous System (CNS). In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm to boost the performance of random forest under limited labeled data by exploiting the local structure of unlabeled data. We identify the key bottleneck of random forest to be the information gain calculation and replace it with a graph-embedded entropy which is more reliable for insufficient labeled data scenario. By properly modifying the training process of standard random forest, our algorithm significantly improves the performance while preserving the virtue of random forest such as low computational burden and robustness over over-fitting. Our method has shown a superior performance on both medical imaging analysis and machine learning benchmarks.</p>

<p>Previous studies have reported that some objects evoke a sense of local three-dimensional space (space-defining; SD), while others do not (space-ambiguous; SA), despite being imagined or viewed in isolation devoid of a background context. Moreover, people show a strong preference for SD objects when given a choice of objects with which to mentally construct scene imagery. When deconstructing scenes, people retain significantly more SD objects than SA objects. It, therefore, seems that SD objects might enjoy a privileged role in scene construction. In the current study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to compare the neural responses to SD and SA objects while they were being used to build imagined scene representations, as this has not been examined before using neuroimaging. On each trial, participants gradually built a scene image from three successive auditorily-presented object descriptions and an imagined 3D space. We then examined the neural dynamics associated with the points during scene construction when either SD or SA objects were being imagined. We found that SD objects elicited theta changes relative to SA objects in two brain regions, the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG). Furthermore, using dynamic causal modeling, we observed that the vmPFC drove STG activity. These findings may indicate that SD objects serve to activate schematic and conceptual knowledge in vmPFC and STG upon which scene representations are then built.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging studies have revealed a multitude of brain regions associated with self- and other-referential processing, but the question how the distinction between self, close other, and distant other is processed in the brain still remains unanswered. The default mode network (DMN) is the primary network associated with the processing of self, whereas task-positive networks (TPN) are indispensable for the processing of external objects. We hypothesize that self- and close-other-processing would engage DMN more than TPN, whereas distant-other-processing would engage TPN to a greater extent. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data obtained in the course of a trait adjective judgment task while subjects evaluated themselves, the best friend, a neutral stranger, and an unpleasant person. A positive association between the degree of self-relatedness and the degree of DMN dominance was revealed in cortical midline structures (CMS) and the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Relative to TPN, DMN showed greater connectivity in me than in friend, in friend than in stranger, and in stranger than in unpleasant conditions. These results show that the less the evaluated person is perceived as self-related, the more the balance of activity in the brain shifts from the DMN to the TPN.</p>

<p>Background: Antagonistic tasks are cognitive-motor task trainings. Intervention programs involving antagonistic exercise tasks are being employed to help prevent falls and reduce the need for nursing care in older populations. Meanwhile, the effects of such tasks on blood flow in the brain remain obscure. This study aimed to clarify the effects of antagonistic tasks on prefrontal cortical cerebral hemodynamics.</p><p>Materials and Methods: We assessed 13 healthy adults (two men, 11 women; mean age, 21.4 ± 1.0 years). Participants imitated each of the antagonistic tasks presented on a PC monitor placed at a 120-mm viewing distance. All participants performed six tasks, consisting of upper-limb tasks (non-antagonism, simple antagonism, and complex antagonism) and upper- and lower-limb tasks (tasks combining lower-limb opening and closing movements with each upper-limb task). We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure cerebral blood flow dynamics, with oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration changes as the main outcome. A 10-channel probe was placed on the participants’ forehead, focusing on the prefrontal cortex. We first obtained a baseline NIRS measurement for 10 s; the participants then imitated the task presented on the PC monitor for 90 s. We measured the number of errors and the subjective difficulty of each task.</p><p>Results: The increase in prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb concentration was significantly higher in the complex antagonist conditions than in the non-antagonistic and simple antagonistic conditions. There were no significant prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb differences between the upper limb and upper- and lower-limb conditions (increasing number of motor limbs).</p><p>Conclusions: The study findings support that an increase in finger-shaped complexity has a greater effect on cerebral blood flow dynamics in the prefrontal cortex than does an increase in the number of motor limbs involved in the task.</p>

<p>Facial trustworthiness and feedback information of trustees can influence trustors’ investment behavior in trust games. This study investigated the temporal features of outcome evaluation (evaluation of feedback) and how they influence the processing of facial trustworthiness. A total of 25 college students participated in a decision-making task in which feedback was presented prior to a face stimulus. The decision of participants to continue investing was evaluated. We observed that trustors were more inclined to keep investing in trustworthy trustees or those appearing after positive feedback (gains). Event-related potential (ERP) results revealed that in the face presentation stage, trustworthy faces with losses induced more negative feedback-related negativity (FRN) than did trustworthy faces with gains and untrustworthy faces with losses. Further, faces that did not meet expectations induced more negative FRN. Trustworthy faces with gains induced more positive late positive component (LPC) than did trustworthy faces with losses and generated more motivated attention. Bottom–up and top–down processes were integrated for facial trustworthiness perception at different stages. In sum, top–down processing exerted a greater impact during the early stage of facial trustworthiness perception, both top–down and bottom–up processing were involved in the medium term, and bottom–up processing exerted a greater impact in the later stage.</p>

<p>The radial dimension expands during central nervous system development after the proliferative neuroepithelium is molecularly patterned. The process is associated with neurogenesis, radial glia scaffolding, and migration of immature neurons into the developing mantle stratum. Radial histogenetic units, defined as a delimited neural polyclone whose cells share the same molecular profile, are molded during these processes, and usually become roughly stratified into periventricular, intermediate, and superficial (subpial) strata wherein neuronal cell types may differ and be distributed in various patterns. Cell-cell adhesion or repulsion phenomena together with interaction with local intercellular matrix cues regulate the acquisition of nuclear, reticular, or layer histogenetic forms in such strata. Finally, the progressive addition of inputs and outputs soon follows the purely neurogenetic and radial migratory phase. Frequently there is heterochrony in the radial development of adjacent histogenetic units, apart of peculiarities in differentiation due to non-shared aspects of the respective molecular profiles. Tangential migrations may add complexity to radial unit cytoarchitecture and function. The study of the contributions of such genetically controlled radial histogenetic units to the emerging complex neural structure is a key instrument to understand central nervous system morphology and function. One recent example in this scenario is the recently proposed radial model of the mouse pallial amygdala. This is theoretically valid generally in mammals (Garcia-Calero et al., 2020), and subdivides the nuclear complex of the pallial amygdala into five main radial units. The approach applies a novel ad hoc amygdalar section plane, given the observed obliquity of the amygdalar radial glial framework. The general relevance of radial unit studies for clarifying structural analysis of all complex brain regions such as the pallial amygdala is discussed, with additional examples.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, for which aging remains the major risk factor. Aging is under a consistent pressure of increasing brain entropy (BEN) due to the progressive brain deteriorations. Noticeably, the brain constantly consumes a large amount of energy to maintain its functional integrity, likely creating or maintaining a big “reserve” to counteract the high entropy. Malfunctions of this latent reserve may indicate a critical point of disease progression. The purpose of this study was to characterize BEN in aging and AD and to test an inverse-U-shape BEN model: BEN increases with age and AD pathology in normal aging but decreases in the AD continuum. BEN was measured with resting state fMRI and compared across aging and the AD continuum. Associations of BEN with age, education, clinical symptoms, and pathology were examined by multiple regression. The analysis results highlighted resting BEN in the default mode network, medial temporal lobe, and prefrontal cortex and showed that: (1) BEN increased with age and pathological deposition in normal aging but decreased with age and pathological deposition in the AD continuum; (2) AD showed catastrophic BEN reduction, which was related to more severe cognitive impairment and daily function disability; and (3) BEN decreased with education years in normal aging, but not in the AD continuum. BEN evolution follows an inverse-U trajectory when AD progresses from normal aging to AD dementia. Education is beneficial for suppressing the entropy increase potency in normal aging.</p>

<p>Recent research regards the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a promising method to study real-time brain dynamic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but a deeper understanding is needed to discern coincident pathophysiology, patterns of changes, and diagnosis. This review summarized recent research on EEG characterization related to the cognitive and motor functions in PD patients and discussed its potential to be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Thirty papers out of 220 published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed. Movement abnormalities and cognitive decline are related to changes in EEG spectrum and event-related potentials (ERPs) during typical oddball paradigms and/or combined motor tasks. Abnormalities in β and δ frequency bands are, respectively the main manifestation of dyskinesia and cognitive decline in PD. The review showed that PD patients have noteworthy changes in specific EEG characterizations, however, the underlying mechanism of the interrelation between gait and cognitive is still unclear. Understanding the specific nature of the relationship is essential for development of novel invasive clinical diagnostic and therapeutic methods.</p>

<p>Cell-based screening of bioactive compounds has served as an important gateway in drug discovery. In the present report, using human neuroblastoma cells and enrolling an extensive three-step screening of 57 phytochemicals, we have identified caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as a potent neurodifferentiating natural compound. Analyses of control and CAPE-induced neurodifferentiated cells revealed: (i) modulation of several key proteins (NF200, MAP-2, NeuN, PSD95, Tuj1, GAP43, and GFAP) involved in neurodifferentiation process; and (ii) attenuation of neuronal stemness (HOXD13, WNT3, and Msh-2) and proliferation-promoting (CDC-20, CDK-7, and BubR1) proteins. We anticipated that the neurodifferentiation potential of CAPE may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and tested it using the Drosophila model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mice model of amnesia/loss of memory. In both models, CAPE exhibited improved disease symptoms and activation of physiological functions. Remarkably, CAPE-treated mice showed increased levels of neurotrophin-BDNF, neural progenitor marker-Nestin, and differentiation marker-NeuN, both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Taken together, we demonstrate the differentiation-inducing and therapeutic potential of CAPE for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Human epidemiological evidence and animal experimental data suggest that chronic manganese (Mn) exposure increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD brain pathology, but the underlying mechanisms were not fully understood. Using the transgenic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) mouse model and mouse-derived microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines, we found that chronic 5-month Mn treatment increased beta amyloid peptide (Aβ) expression and Aβ plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in these 3×Tg-AD mice. Furthermore, we found that the β- and γ-secretase cleavage activities were markedly increased, while α-secretase cleavage activity was reduced in the brain of Mn-treated AD mice; these effects increase Aβ production and thus are amyloidogenic. Equally important, Mn treatment alone did not alter β-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene expression or Aβ production in amyloidogenic mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene hAPPsw-transfected N2a cells (APPsw-N2a), but in APPsw-N2a cells either co-cultured with microglia or cultured with microglia-conditioned media, Mn exposure increased BACE1 expression and amyloidogenesis. We further determined that Mn exposure promoted the activation of microglia both in 3×Tg-AD mouse brains and in cultured microglia cells, and increased the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Taken together, these results suggest that Mn may increase the release of IL-1β and TNF-α from microglia that in turn stimulates the expression of BACE1 gene and protein and consequently Aβ production; this novel molecular mechanism not only advances our understanding about the amyloidogenic effect of chronic Mn exposure reported for special human populations but also indicates Mn dyshomeostasis as a potential contributor to AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterised by the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the walls of cerebral capillaries and arteries representing a major cause of haemorrhagic stroke including lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Haemorrhaging from CAA predominantly involves smaller arteries rather than arterial aneurysm. Restricted bleeding into the subarachnoid space in CAA results in asymptomatic or mild symptomatic SAH. Herein, we present an autopsied case of massive SAH related to CAA. An 89-year-old male with a history of mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and advanced pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis developed sudden onset of coma. Head CT illustrated ICH located in the right frontal lobe and right insula, as well as SAH bilaterally spreading from the basal cistern to the Sylvian fissure, with hydrocephalus and brain herniation. He died about 24 h after onset and the post-mortem examination showed no evidence of arterial aneurysm. The substantial accumulation of Aβ in the vessels around the haemorrhagic lesions led to the diagnosis of ICH related to CAA and secondary SAH, which may have been aggravated by old age and malignancy. This case suggests that CAA can cause severe SAH resembling aneurysmal origin and thus may be overlooked when complicated by atypical cerebral haemorrhage.</p>

<p>by Elif Köksal Ersöz, Julien Modolo, Fabrice Bartolomei, Fabrice Wendling</p>

Epilepsy is a dynamic and complex neurological disease affecting about 1% of the worldwide population, among which 30% of the patients are drug-resistant. Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal neural discharges (the so-called seizures), which manifest themselves through a large-amplitude rhythmic activity observed in depth-EEG recordings, in particular in local field potentials (LFPs). The signature characterizing the transition to seizures involves complex oscillatory patterns, which could serve as a marker to prevent seizure initiation by triggering appropriate therapeutic neurostimulation methods. To investigate such protocols, neurophysiological lumped-parameter models at the mesoscopic scale, namely neural mass models, are powerful tools that not only mimic the LFP signals but also give insights on the neural mechanisms related to different stages of seizures. Here, we analyze the multiple time-scale dynamics of a neural mass model and explain the underlying structure of the complex oscillations observed before seizure initiation. We investigate population-specific effects of the stimulation and the dependence of stimulation parameters on synaptic timescales. In particular, we show that intermediate stimulation frequencies (&gt;20 Hz) can abort seizures if the timescale difference is pronounced. Those results have the potential in the design of therapeutic brain stimulation protocols based on the neurophysiological properties of tissue.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ikp9WQjg7DQ" width="1" />

<p>by Hai Yang, Qiang Wei, Dongdong Li, Zhe Wang</p>

Given the complexity and diversity of the cancer genomics profiles, it is challenging to identify distinct clusters from different cancer types. Numerous analyses have been conducted for this propose. Still, the methods they used always do not directly support the high-dimensional omics data across the whole genome (Such as ATAC-seq profiles). In this study, based on the deep adversarial learning, we present an end-to-end approach ClusterATAC to leverage high-dimensional features and explore the classification results. On the ATAC-seq dataset and RNA-seq dataset, ClusterATAC has achieved excellent performance. Since ATAC-seq data plays a crucial role in the study of the effects of non-coding regions on the molecular classification of cancers, we explore the clustering solution obtained by ClusterATAC on the pan-cancer ATAC dataset. In this solution, more than 70% of the clustering are single-tumor-type-dominant, and the vast majority of the remaining clusters are associated with similar tumor types. We explore the representative non-coding loci and their linked genes of each cluster and verify some results by the literature search. These results suggest that a large number of non-coding loci affect the development and progression of cancer through its linked genes, which can potentially advance cancer diagnosis and therapy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tZDTEu1VwSY" width="1" />

<p>by Richard Wilton, Alexander S. Szalay</p>

In large DNA sequence repositories, archival data storage is often coupled with computers that provide 40 or more CPU threads and multiple GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) devices. This presents an opportunity for DNA sequence alignment software to exploit high-concurrency hardware to generate short-read alignments at high speed. Arioc, a GPU-accelerated short-read aligner, can compute WGS (whole-genome sequencing) alignments ten times faster than comparable CPU-only alignment software. When two or more GPUs are available, Arioc's speed increases proportionately because the software executes concurrently on each available GPU device. We have adapted Arioc to recent multi-GPU hardware architectures that support high-bandwidth peer-to-peer memory accesses among multiple GPUs. By modifying Arioc's implementation to exploit this GPU memory architecture we obtained a further 1.8x-2.9x increase in overall alignment speeds. With this additional acceleration, Arioc computes two million short-read alignments per second in a four-GPU system; it can align the reads from a human WGS sequencer run–over 500 million 150nt paired-end reads–in less than 15 minutes. As WGS data accumulates exponentially and high-concurrency computational resources become widespread, Arioc addresses a growing need for timely computation in the short-read data analysis toolchain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GoN8bqwwA6Q" width="1" />

The tumor mutational burden (TMB) is increasingly recognized as an emerging biomarker that predicts improved outcomes or response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer. A multitude of technical and biological factors make it difficult to compare TMB values across platforms, histologies, and treatments. Here, we present a mechanistic model that explains the association between panel size, histology, and TMB threshold with panel performance and survival outcome and demonstrate the limitations of existing methods utilized to harmonize TMB across platforms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SChzzr3NQOM" width="1" />

The cell is compartmentalised into complex micro-environments allowing an array of specialised biological processes to be carried out in synchrony. Determining a protein’s sub-cellular localisation to one or more of these compartments can therefore be a first step in determining its function. High-throughput and high-accuracy mass spectrometry-based sub-cellular proteomic methods can now shed light on the localisation of thousands of proteins at once. Machine learning algorithms are then typically employed to make protein-organelle assignments. However, these algorithms are limited by insufficient and incomplete annotation. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach to novelty detection, allowing the discovery of additional, previously unannotated sub-cellular niches. Inference in our model is performed in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to quantify uncertainty in the allocation of proteins to new sub-cellular niches, as well as in the number of newly discovered compartments. We apply our approach across 10 mass spectrometry based spatial proteomic datasets, representing a diverse range of experimental protocols. Application of our approach to <i>hyper</i>LOPIT datasets validates its utility by recovering enrichment with chromatin-associated proteins without annotation and uncovers sub-nuclear compartmentalisation which was not identified in the original analysis. Moreover, using sub-cellular proteomics data from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we uncover a novel group of proteins trafficking from the ER to the early Golgi apparatus. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for novelty detection to yield biologically relevant niches that are missed by current approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t8e8t0V_BtA" width="1" />

Although less common than the evolution of antimicrobial drug resistance, vaccine resistance can and has evolved. How likely is it that COVID-19 vaccines currently in development will be undermined by viral evolution? We argue that this can be determined by repurposing samples that are already being collected as part of clinical trials. Such information would be useful for prioritizing investment among candidate vaccines and maximizing the potential long-term impact of COVID-19 vaccines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hUFF69rQUeg" width="1" />

<p>by Rebekah C. Kading, Tigga Kingston</p>

Human perturbation of natural systems is accelerating the emergence of infectious diseases, mandating integration of disease and ecological research. Bats have been associated with recent zoonoses, but our bibliometric analysis of coauthor relationships identified a separation of bat ecologists and infectious disease researchers with few cross-disciplinary relationships. Of 5,645 papers, true interdisciplinary collaborations occurred primarily in research focused on White Nose Syndrome (WNS). This finding is important because it illustrates how research with outcomes favoring both bat conservation and disease mitigation promotes domain integration and network connectivity. We advocate for increased engagement between ecology and infectious researchers to address such common causes and suggest that efforts focus on leveraging existing activities, building interdisciplinary projects, and networking individuals and networks to integrate domains and coordinate resources. We provide specific opportunities for pursuing these strategies through the Bat One Health Research Network (BOHRN).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2Ti93dMGzO0" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to analyze longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and their predictive value as biomarkers of disease progression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with Lewy body diseases were enrolled and prospectively evaluated at 3 years, including patients with iPD (n = 42), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 4), E46K‐<i>SNCA</i> mutation carriers (n = 4), and controls (n = 17). All participants underwent Spectralis retinal optical coherence tomography and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was obtained in patients. Macular ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness reduction rates were estimated with linear mixed models. Risk ratios were calculated to evaluate the association between baseline GCIPL and pRNFL thicknesses and the risk of subsequent cognitive and motor worsening, using clinically meaningful cutoffs.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>GCIPL thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63μm in iPD patients and 0.23μm in controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). iPD patients with lower parafoveal GCIPL and pRNFL thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–11.1, <i>p</i> = 0.03 and RR = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.03–10.45, <i>p</i> = 0.045, respectively). We did not identify significant associations between retinal thickness and motor deterioration.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide evidence of the potential use of optical coherence tomography–measured parafoveal GCIPL thickness to monitor neurodegeneration and to predict the risk of cognitive worsening over time in iPD. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>The central complex plays a key role in goal directed orientation of insects. Immunocytochemistry shows that the neuropeptide orcokinin is present in the central complex of the desert locust in neurons of all stages of signal processing and likely serves as cotransmitter with GABA and Dip‐allatostatin in certain cell types.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex is a group of highly interconnected neuropils in the insect brain. It is involved in the control of spatial orientation, based on external compass cues and various internal needs. The functional and neurochemical organization of the central complex has been studied in detail in the desert locust <i>Schistocerca gregaria</i>. In addition to classical neurotransmitters, immunocytochemistry has provided evidence for a major contribution of neuropeptides to neural signaling within the central complex. To complement these data, we have identified all orcokinin‐immunoreactive neurons in the locust central complex and associated brain areas. About 50 bilateral pairs of neurons innervating all substructures of the central complex exhibit orcokinin immunoreactivity. Among these were about 20 columnar neurons, 33 bilateral pairs of tangential neurons of the central body, and seven pairs of tangential neurons of the protocerebral bridge. In silico transcript analysis suggests the presence of eight different orcokinin‐A type peptides in the desert locust. Double label experiments showed that all orcokinin‐immunostained tangential neurons of the lateral accessory lobe cluster were also immunoreactive for GABA and the GABA‐synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Two types of tangential neurons of the upper division of the central body were, furthermore, also labeled with an antiserum against Dip‐allatostatin I. No colocalization was found with serotonin immunostaining. The data provide additional insights into the neurochemical organization of the locust central complex and suggest that orcokinin‐peptides of the orcokinin‐A gene act as neuroactive substances at all stages of signal processing in this brain area.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural retina is organized along central‐peripheral, dorsal‐ventral, and laminar planes. Cellular density and distributions vary along the central‐peripheral and dorsal‐ventral axis in species including primates, mice, fish, and birds. Differential distribution of cell types within the retina is associated with sensitivity to different types of damage that underpin major retinal diseases, including macular degeneration and glaucoma. Normal variation in retinal distribution remains unreported for multiple cell types in widely used research models, including mouse. Here we map the distribution of all known OFF bipolar cell (BC) populations and horizontal cells. We report significant variation in the distribution of OFF BC populations and horizontal cells along the dorsal‐ventral and central‐peripheral axes of the retina. Distribution patterns are much more pronounced for some populations of OFF BC cells than others and may correspond to the cell type's specialized functions.</p>

Background<p>To explore an expression profile in plasma exosomal miRNAs of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE + HS) patients and investigate the associated clinical significance and putative pathways involved.</p>Methods<p>Plasma exosomal miRNAs were measured in six mTLE + HS patients who were confirmed with pre-surgical stereo-electroencephalography and six without hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE−HS) using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Then six dysregulated miRNAs were chosen for validation in an independent sample of 18 mTLE + HS patients and 18 mTLE−HS controls using RT-qPCR. Receiver operating characteristic curve was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs in HS. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to reveal in which pathways these miRNAs were involved.</p>Results<p>We revealed that a total of 42 exosomal miRNAs were differentially expressed in mTLE + HS. Among them, 25 were increased and 17 decreased. After validation, hsa-miR-129-5p, -214-3p, -219a-5p, and -34c-5p were confirmed as being upregulated, while hsa-miR-421 and -184 were significantly downregulated in mTLE + HS. Moreover, hsa-miR-184 had the best diagnostic value for discriminating mTLE + HS with 88.9% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity. These six miRNAs regulated several genes from neurotrophin-, hippo-, p53-, TGF- beta-, HIF- 1-, mTOR-related pathways.</p>Conclusion<p>Six miRNAs were dysregulated in mTLE + HS patients and targeted several genes. This result might facilitate pathological mechanistic studies of miRNAs in HS and represent potential diagnostic biomarkers. These provided the rationale for further confirmation studies in larger cohorts of prospective patients.</p>

<p>In neuroscience, much attention is paid to intercellular interactions, in particular, to synapses. However, many researchers do not pay due attention to the contribution of intracellular contacts to the work of intercellular interactions. Nevertheless, along with synapses, intracellular contacts also have complex organization and a tremendous number of regulatory elements. Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs) are a specific site of interaction between the two organelles; they provide a basis for a large number of cellular functions, such as calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. Despite the presence of these contacts in various parts of neurons and glial cells, it is yet not known whether they fulfill the same functions. There are still many unsolved questions about the work of these intracellular contacts, and one of the most important among them is if MERCs, with their broad implication into synaptic events, can be considered the assistant to neurotransmission?</p>

<p>We report a qualitative study on central nervous system (CNS) damage that demonstrates the ability of X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT) to confirm data obtained with standard 2D methodology and permits the description of additional features that are not detected with 2D or other 3D techniques. In contrast to magnetic resonance or computed tomography, XPCT makes possible the high-resolution 3D imaging of soft tissues classically considered “invisible” to X-rays without the use of additional contrast agents, or without the need for intense processing of the tissue required by 2D techniques. Most importantly for studies of CNS diseases, XPCT enables a concomitant multi-scale 3D biomedical imaging of neuronal and vascular networks ranging from cells through to the CNS as a whole. In the last years, we have used XPCT to investigate neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), to shed light on brain damage and extend the observations obtained with standard techniques. Here, we show the cutting-edge ability of XPCT to highlight in 3D, concomitantly, vascular occlusions and damages, close associations between plaques and damaged vessels, as well as dramatic changes induced at neuropathological level by treatment in AD mice. We corroborate data on the well-known blood-brain barrier dysfunction in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and further show its extent throughout the CNS axis and at the level of the single vessel/capillary.</p>

<p>The extensible neuroimaging archive toolkit (XNAT) is a common platform for storing and distributing neuroimaging data and is used by many key repositories of public neuroimaging data. Some examples include the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC, https://nitrc.org/), the ConnectomeDB for the Human Connectome Project (https://db.humanconnectome.org/), and XNAT Central (https://central.xnat.org/). We introduce Rxnat (https://github.com/adigherman/Rxnat), an open-source R package designed to interact with any XNAT-based repository. The program has similar capabilities with PyXNAT and XNATpy, which were developed for Python users. Rxnat was developed to address the increased popularity of R among neuroimaging researchers. The Rxnat package can query multiple XNAT repositories and download all or a specific subset of images for further processing. This provides a lingua franca for the large community of R analysts to interface with multiple XNAT-based publicly available neuroimaging repositories. The potential of Rxnat is illustrated using an example of neuroimaging data normalization from two neuroimaging repositories, NITRC and HCP.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is a serious hazard to human health. Minimally invasive surgery is currently an extremely effective treatment to refractory epilepsy. However, it is challenging to localize the lesion for most patients because they are MRI negative. The identification of epileptic foci in local brain region will be helpful to the localization of epileptic foci because we can infer whether there is a lesion from the results of the classification. For the sake of simplicity and the data we collected, only the hippocampus was segmented as a local brain region and classified in this paper. We recruited 59 children with hippocampus epilepsy and 70 age- and sex-matched normal controls, and diffusion kurtosis images (DKI) for all subjects were collected because DKI can understand the pathological changes of local tissues and other regions of epileptic foci at the molecular level. Then, a mask of hippocampus was made to segment the hippocampus of FA, MD, and MK images for all subjects, which are the parameter images of DKI and were used to perform the independent-sample t-test and the classification task. At last, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning technique was developed to extract features of FA, MD, MK, and the fusion of FA and MK, and support vector machine was employed to classify epilepsy and normal control. Finally, the classifier produced 90.8% accuracy for patient vs. normal controls. Experimental results showed that the features extraction based on CNN is very effective, and the high accuracy of classification means that FA and MK are two remarkable features to identify epilepsy, which indicates that DKI images can act as an important biomarker for epilepsy from the point of view of clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Objectives: To study whether and to what extent the therapeutic impedance and current change under long-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) with constant stimulation settings, which could inform the role of constant current stimulation.</p><p>Methods: Therapy impedance and current measurements were retrospectively collected from patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or essential tremor (ET) undergoing ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). Baseline and follow-up measurements were obtained for intervals of at least 6 months without changes in stimulation settings. The single longest interval of constant stimulation for each electrode was included. Temporal trends in impedance and current were analyzed as absolute and relative differences and as the rate of change.</p><p>Results: Impedance and current data from 79 electrodes (60 in STN, 19 in VIM) in 44 patients (32 with PD, 12 with ET) met inclusion criteria. The duration between baseline and follow-up measurements with constant stimulation settings was 17 months (median, with an interquartile range of 12–26 months) in the mixed group. Therapy impedance decreased by 27 ± 12 Ω/year (mean ± 2 standard errors; p &lt; 0.0001), and therapy current increased at a rate of 0.142 ± 0.063 mA/year (p &lt; 0.0001). Similar results were observed in the STN and VIM subgroups.</p><p>Conclusions: Impedance decreases gradually over time, even when stimulation settings are kept constant. The rate of decrease is smaller than previously reported, suggesting that changes in stimulation settings contribute to impedance drift. Stimulation-independent impedance drift is gradual but relevant to constant-current programming.</p>

<p>Introduction:Typing on a keyboard requires complex collaboration between visuospatial/procedural memory, language, and motor function. The impaired ability to type, independent of motor deficits, apraxia, or aphasia has been coined “dystypia.”</p><p>Case Presentation: A 68-year-old woman with a history of blepharospasm, oromandibular, and segmental dystonia underwent bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) because of a waning response to botulinum toxin therapy. Following DBS, she discovered she no longer “remembered” how to type fluidly and had to “hunt and peck” for letters on the keyboard. This issue persisted at a 2-year follow-up. The patient underwent serial typing tests with the DBS ON vs. OFF. Post-operative lead reconstruction was performed using Lead-DBS. The volume of tissue activation (VTA) modeling was combined with whole-brain tractography.</p><p>Results: Typing improved when the device was switched to the DBS OFF state. Cortical mapping revealed strong modulation of the right angular gyrus, left calcarine fissure, and left cuneus. There was also activation of bilateral supplemental motor areas and superior parietal gyri.</p><p>Discussion: Shared lesion topography analysis of dystypia cases in the literature has suggested the involvement of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The SLF involves the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and arcuate fasciculus. Our patient’s connectivity pattern suggested SLF involvement. The improvement in OFF state typing and her imaging together suggested that the dystypia in her case was a stimulation-induced side effect.</p><p>Conclusion: Dystypia is a rare side effect of Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) DBS therapy and may be associated with SLF involvement.</p>

<p>Several studies have implied gender differences in startle reaction to emotional facial expressions. However, few studies have been designed to investigate the difference between responding to emotional female vs. male faces, nor gender differences in responses. The present experiment investigated startle EMG responses to a startle probe while viewing pictures of neutral, happy, angry, fearful, and sad facial expressions presented by female and male models. Participants were divided into female and male groups. Results showed that emotional facial expressions interact with model gender to produce startle potentiation to a probe: greater responses were found while viewing angry expressions by male models, and while viewing happy faces by female models. There were no differences in responses between male and female participants. We argue that these findings underline theimportance of controlling for model gender in research using facial expressions as stimuli.</p>

<p>The diversity and dense interconnectivity of cells in the nervous system present a huge challenge to understanding how brains work. Recent progress toward such understanding, however, has been fuelled by the development of techniques for selectively monitoring and manipulating the function of distinct cell types—and even individual neurons—in the brains of living animals. These sophisticated techniques are fundamentally genetic and have found their greatest application in genetic model organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila combines genetic tractability with a compact, but cell-type rich, nervous system and has been the incubator for a variety of methods of neuronal targeting. One such method, called Split Gal4, is playing an increasingly important role in mapping neural circuits in the fly. In conjunction with functional perturbations and behavioral screens, Split Gal4 has been used to characterize circuits governing such activities as grooming, aggression, and mating. It has also been leveraged to comprehensively map and functionally characterize cells composing important brain regions, such as the central complex, lateral horn, and the mushroom body—the latter being the insect seat of learning and memory. With connectomics data emerging for both the larval and adult brains of Drosophila, Split Gal4 is also poised to play an important role in characterizing neurons of interest based on their connectivity. We summarize the history and current state of the Split Gal4 method and indicate promising areas for further development or future application.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is behaviorally defined and diagnosed by delayed and/or impeded language, stereotyped repetitive behaviors, and difficulties with social interactions. Additionally, there are disruptions in motor processing, which includes the intent to execute movements, interrupted/inhibited action chain sequences, impaired execution of speech, and repetitive motor behaviors. Cortical loops through basal ganglia (BG) structures are known to play critical roles in the typical functioning of these actions. Specifically, corticostriate projections to the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) convey abundant input from motor, cognitive and limbic cortices and subsequently project to other BG structures. Excitatory dopamine (DA) type 1 receptors are predominantly expressed on GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsal striatum as part of the “direct pathway” to GPi and SNpr whereas inhibitory DA type 2 receptors are predominantly expressed on MSNs that primarily project to GPe. This study aimed to better understand how this circuitry may be altered in ASD, especially concerning the neurochemical modulation of GABAergic MSNs within the two major BG pathways. We utilized two classical methods to analyze the postmortem BG in ASD in comparison to neurotypical cases: ligand binding autoradiography to quantify densities of GABA-A, GABA-B, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, and DA type 1 and 2 receptors and in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) to quantify mRNA for D1, D2 receptors and three key GABAergic subunits (α1, β2, and γ2), as well as the GABA synthesizing enzymes (GAD65/67). Results demonstrated significant increases in D2 mRNA within MSNs in both the caudate and putamen, which was further verified by proenkephalin mRNA that is co-expressed with the D2 receptor in the indirect pathway MSNs. In contrast, all other GABAergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic markers in the dorsal striatum had comparable labeling densities. These results indicate alterations in the indirect pathway of the BG, with possible implications for the execution of competing motor programs and E/I imbalance in the direct/indirect motor feedback pathways through thalamic and motor cortical areas. Results also provide insights regarding the efficacy of FDA-approved drugs used to treat individuals with ASD acting on specific DA and 5-HT receptor subtypes.</p>

<p>Golgi-Cox staining has been used extensively in neuroscience. Despite its unique ability to identify neuronal interconnections and neural processes, its lack of consistency and time-consuming nature reduces its appeal to researchers. Here, using a spared nerve injury (SNI) mouse model and control mice, we present a modified Golgi-Cox staining protocol that can stain mouse hippocampal neurons within 8 days. In this improved procedure, the mouse brain was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then stored in a modified Golgi-Cox solution at 37 ± 2°C. The impregnation period was reduced from 5–14 days to 36–48 h. Brain slices prepared in this way could be preserved long-term at –80°C for up to 8 weeks. In addition to minimizing frequently encountered problems and reducing the time required to conduct the method, our modified protocol maintained, and even improved, the quality of traditional Golgi-Cox staining as applied to hippocampal neuronal morphology in SNI mice.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence staining is the most frequently applied technique to detect and visualize various molecules in biological samples. Many protocols can be found in the literature and the websites of commercial antibody producers. This can result in a time-consuming and costly methodical work to establish “simple” antibody staining. We here summarize in a stepwise manner an easy-to-follow immunofluorescence staining protocol with an improved specific fluorescent signal and a reduced background and non-specific binding signal. This will help scientists to save time, effort, and antibody costs during the application of such a valuable technique.</p>

<p>In the absence of an effective treatment to alter the progressive course of cognitive decline and dementia, identification of modifiable risk factors that could promote healthy cognitive aging has become a public health research priority. This study seeks to comprehensively determine the contemporaneous associations of a broad spectrum of time-varying modifiable lifestyle factors with age-related cognitive decline in a large population-based cohort of older adults. A total of 5,711 subjects aged 50 and older from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) in Shanghai were studied. Repeated measures of lifestyle factors and cognitive performance were conducted in 2009–2010 and 2014–2015. Linear random slope models were used to evaluate the contemporaneous associations between time-varying lifestyle factors and cognitive performance. Person-mean centering method was used to disaggregate the between- and within-person effects in the time-varying lifestyle factors in the random slope models. We found that higher vegetable and fruit consumption, as well as higher level of physical activity were positively associated with all cognitive domains. Body mass index (BMI) was negatively associated with all cognitive domains, whereas waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was negatively associated with verbal fluency score only. Sedentary time was negatively associated with digit span score but positively associated with verbal fluency score. The between-person effects seem to be more dominant than within-person effects. Overall, our findings suggest better management of multiple lifestyle factors may protect against cognitive decline in later life. Higher vegetable and fruit consumption and physical activity are protective, whereas obesity is detrimental to cognitive decline in older adults. This study underpins the development of multi-domain lifestyle recommendations to promote healthy cognitive aging.</p>

<p>Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) might not only be circumscribed to the motor system but also involves other neuronal systems including sensory abnormalities. In line with this notion, we aimed to assess the pathophysiology of sensory disturbances in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, focusing on the satellite glial cells (SGCs) at the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) as a new potential target of the disease.</p><p>Material and Methods: The presence of sensory disturbances was evaluated using von Frey, hot plate, and hot water tail immersion tests at 75 days old, which represented the motor-pre-symptomatic stage. Cell biology analysis was performed at 75 and 95 days old and included conventional histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of sensory neuron-SGC unit dissociates as a well as western blotting from DRG lysates.</p><p>Results: At 75 days old, von Frey and hot plate tests demonstrated clear thermoalgesic disturbances in ALS transgenic mice. Histological studies of the SN-SGC units revealed abnormal SOD1 accumulation, which was associated with nitro-oxidative stress and biogenesis of lipid droplets in SGCs. Interestingly, these alterations led to a progressive lysosomal storage disorder and occasionally vacuolar degeneration in SGCs.</p><p>Conclusions: SGCs emerge as a primary pathophysiological target in the SOD1 transgenic murine model of ALS, clearly reinforcing the pathogenic role of glial cells in motor neuron disease. Presymptomatic alterations of SGCs, might not only be responsible of sensory disturbances in ALS, but due to spinal cord sensory-motor circuits could also contribute to anterior horn motor disturbances.</p>

Background<p>Sensory peripheral neuropathy (PN) is associated with gait, balance problems and high fall risk. The walk2Wellness trial investigates effects of long-term, home-based daily use of a wearable sensory prosthesis on gait function, balance, quality of life and fall rates in PN patients. The device (Walkasins<sup>®</sup>, RxFunction Inc., MN, United States) partially substitutes lost nerve function related to plantar sensation providing directional tactile cues reflecting plantar pressure measurements during standing and walking. We tested the null hypothesis that the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) score would remain unchanged after 10 weeks of use.</p>Methods<p>Participants had PN with lost plantar sensation, gait and balance problems, an FGA score &lt; 23 (high fall risk), and ability to sense tactile stimuli above the ankle. Clinical outcomes included FGA, Gait Speed, Timed Up&amp;Go (TUG) and 4-Stage Balance Test. Patient-reported outcomes included Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale, PROMIS participation and satisfaction scores, pain rating, and falls. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Subjects were not made aware of changes in outcomes. No additional balance interventions were allowed.</p>Results<p>Forty-five participants of 52 enrolled across four sites completed in-clinic assessments. FGA scores improved from 15.0 to 19.1 (p &lt; 0.0001), normal and fast gait speed from 0.86 m/s to 0.95 m/s (p &lt; 0.0001) and 1.24 m/s to 1.33 m/s (p = 0.002), respectively, and TUG from 13.8 s to 12.5 s (p = 0.012). Four-Stage Balance Test did not improve. Several patient-reported outcomes were normal at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Interestingly, subjects with baseline ABC scores lower than 67% (high fall risk cut-off) increased their ABC scores (49.9% to 59.3%, p = 0.01), whereas subjects with ABC scores above 67% showed a decrease (76.6% to 71.8%, p = 0.019). Subjects who reported falls in the prior 6 months (n = 25) showed a decrease in the number of fall-risk factors (5.1 to 4.3, p = 0.023) and a decrease in fall rate (13.8 to 7.4 falls/1000 days, p = 0.014). Four pre-study non-fallers (n = 20) fell during the 10 weeks.</p>Conclusion<p>A wearable sensory prosthesis presents a new way to treat gait and balance problems and manage falls in high fall-risk patients with PN.</p>Trial registration<p>ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT03538756).</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With global increases in the aging population, the number of patients with dementia is greatly increasing, which has become a big social problem. Many studies have shown strong associations between oral disorders and systemic disorders, such as diabetes, arthritis, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, arteriosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and other cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, numerous cross‐sectional studies showed that patients with dementia usually have poor oral conditions and tooth loss. These have long been considered as a result of difficulty with oral care due to impaired cognitive function, memory, and physical ability in patients with dementia. Indeed, even in patients with mild cognitive impairment, oral care becomes insufficient owing to decreases in spontaneity of grooming and finger dexterity. However, recent studies have shown that tooth loss and occlusal dysfunction may affect brain function and trigger the onset of dementia found in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we highlight the relationships among aging, oral dysfunction, and the development of dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that oral dysfunction is not only a result of dementia in the elderly people, but could also be a causative factor for the onset of dementia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25948?af=R">Socioeconomic Status Mediates Racial Differences Seen Using the AT(N) Framework</a></h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>African Americans are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia than non‐Hispanic whites. In addition to biological considerations (eg, genetic influences and comorbid disorders), social and environmental factors may increase the risk of AD dementia. This paper (1) assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences and (2) considers mediating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease on observed race differences.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography [PET]) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting state functional connectivity (rs‐fc) were collected from African American (n = 131) and white (n = 685) cognitively normal participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] on MRI, blood pressure, and body mass index [BMI]) and area‐based SES were included in mediation analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to white participants, African American participants had greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes (Cohen's <i>f</i>
<sup>
   <i>2</i>
</sup> = 0.05, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between race and cortical volumes. There were no significant race effects for amyloid, tau, or rs‐fc signature.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Modifiable factors, such as differences in social contexts and resources, particularly area‐level SES, may contribute to observed racial differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant psychosocial factors in addition to the development of intentional diversity and inclusion efforts to improve the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic representativeness of AD studies.

<p>by Toshiyuki Ishii, Toshihiko Hosoya</p>

Neurons in various regions of the brain generate spike bursts. While the number of spikes within a burst has been shown to carry information, information coding by interspike intervals (ISIs) is less well understood. In particular, a burst with <i>k</i> spikes has <i>k−</i>1 intraburst ISIs, and these <i>k−</i>1 ISIs could theoretically encode <i>k−</i>1 independent values. In this study, we demonstrate that such combinatorial coding occurs for retinal bursts. By recording ganglion cell spikes from isolated salamander retinae, we found that intraburst ISIs encode oscillatory light sequences that are much faster than the light intensity modulation encoded by the number of spikes. When a burst has three spikes, the two intraburst ISIs combinatorially encode the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory sequence. Analysis of trial-to-trial variability suggested that intraburst ISIs are regulated by two independent mechanisms responding to orthogonal oscillatory components, one of which is common to bursts with a different number of spikes. Therefore, the retina encodes multiple stimulus features by exploiting all degrees of freedom of burst spike patterns, i.e., the spike number and multiple intraburst ISIs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w8_kA1Ixbko" width="1" />

<p>by Pei-Yau Lung, Dongrui Zhong, Xiaodong Pang, Yan Li, Jinfeng Zhang</p>

Reusability is part of the FAIR data principle, which aims to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. One of the current efforts to increase the reusability of public genomics data has been to focus on the inclusion of quality metadata associated with the data. When necessary metadata are missing, most researchers will consider the data useless. In this study, we developed a framework to predict the missing metadata of gene expression datasets to maximize their reusability. We found that when using predicted data to conduct other analyses, it is not optimal to use all the predicted data. Instead, one should only use the subset of data, which can be predicted accurately. We proposed a new metric called Proportion of Cases Accurately Predicted (PCAP), which is optimized in our specifically-designed machine learning pipeline. The new approach performed better than pipelines using commonly used metrics such as F1-score in terms of maximizing the reusability of data with missing values. We also found that different variables might need to be predicted using different machine learning methods and/or different data processing protocols. Using differential gene expression analysis as an example, we showed that when missing variables are accurately predicted, the corresponding gene expression data can be reliably used in downstream analyses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F6Pjad6S8o0" width="1" />

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of coexisting medical conditions, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus–host protein–protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated disease manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data show that co-expression of <i>ACE2</i> and <i>TMPRSS2</i> is elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an intermediate inflammatory molecular profile with asthma (including <i>IRAK3</i> and <i>ADRB2</i>). To prioritize potential treatments, we combined network-based prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry. We identified that melatonin usage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.91) is significantly associated with a 28% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay. Using a PS matching user active comparator design, we determined that melatonin usage was associated with a reduced likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positive test result compared to use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.92) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.90). Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.31–0.75) is associated with a 52% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history, and various disease comorbidities using PS matching. In summary, this study presents an integrative network medicine platform for predicting disease manifestations associated with COVID-19 and identifying melatonin for potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uvpeSBS7OcA" width="1" />

Cues of maternal and paternal origins interact to control seed development, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still far from clear. Here, we show that <i>TOPOISOMERASE Iα</i> (<i>TOP1α</i>), <i>UP-FRAMESHIFT SUPPRESSOR 1</i> (<i>UPF1</i>), and <i>TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2</i> (<i>TTG2</i>) gametophytically, biparentally regulate seed size in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. <i>TOP1α</i> and <i>UPF1</i> are mainly expressed in antipodal cells, and loss of their function leads to ectopic <i>TTG2</i> expression in these female gametophytic cells. We further demonstrate that TOP1α and UPF1 directly repress <i>TTG2</i> expression through affecting its chromatin status and determine its relative expression in antipodal cells versus sperm cells, which controls seed size in a dosage-dependent and parent-of-origin-dependent manner. The molecular interplay among these three genes explains their biparental gametophytic effect during diploidy and interploidy reciprocal crosses. Taken together, our findings reveal a molecular framework of parental interaction for seed size control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/c7D7CMFvyYo" width="1" />

<p>by Zvi N. Roth, Minyoung Ryoo, Elisha P. Merriam</p>

The brain exhibits widespread endogenous responses in the absence of visual stimuli, even at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing. Such responses have been studied in monkeys using optical imaging with a limited field of view over visual cortex. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) in human participants to study the link between arousal and endogenous responses in visual cortex. The response that we observed was tightly entrained to task timing, was spatially extensive, and was independent of visual stimulation. We found that this response follows dynamics similar to that of pupil size and heart rate, suggesting that task-related activity is related to arousal. Finally, we found that higher reward increased response amplitude while decreasing its trial-to-trial variability (i.e., the noise). Computational simulations suggest that increased temporal precision underlies both of these observations. Our findings are consistent with optical imaging studies in monkeys and support the notion that arousal increases precision of neural activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/v9y0OkBopAc" width="1" />

There is a great need for antiviral drugs to treat enterovirus (EV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections, which can be severe and occasionally life-threatening. The conserved nonstructural protein 2C, which is an AAA+ ATPase, is a promising target for drug development. Here, we present a structure-activity relationship study of a previously identified compound that targets the 2C protein of EV-A71 and several EV-B species members, but not poliovirus (PV) (EV-C species). This compound is structurally related to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug fluoxetine—which also targets 2C—but has favorable chemical properties. We identified several compounds with increased antiviral potency and broadened activity. Four compounds showed broad-spectrum EV and RV activity and inhibited contemporary strains of emerging EVs of public health concern, including EV-A71, coxsackievirus (CV)-A24v, and EV-D68. Importantly, unlike (<i>S</i>)-fluoxetine, these compounds are no longer neuroactive. By raising resistant EV-A71, CV-B3, and EV-D68 variants against one of these inhibitors, we identified novel 2C resistance mutations. Reverse engineering of these mutations revealed a conserved mechanism of resistance development. Resistant viruses first acquired a mutation in, or adjacent to, the α2 helix of 2C. This mutation disrupted compound binding and provided drug resistance, but this was at the cost of viral fitness. Additional mutations at distantly localized 2C residues were then acquired to increase resistance and/or to compensate for the loss of fitness. Using computational methods to identify solvent accessible tunnels near the α2 helix in the EV-A71 and PV 2C crystal structures, a conserved binding pocket of the inhibitors is proposed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GgWFfF1rxno" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin D. Knapp, Lillian Zhu, Kerwyn Casey Huang</p>

Single-cell imaging, combined with recent advances in image analysis and microfluidic technologies, have enabled fundamental discoveries of cellular responses to chemical perturbations that are often obscured by traditional liquid-culture experiments. Temperature is an environmental variable well known to impact growth and to elicit specific stress responses at extreme values; it is often used as a genetic tool to interrogate essential genes. However, the dynamic effects of temperature shifts have remained mostly unstudied at the single-cell level, due largely to engineering challenges related to sample stability, heatsink considerations, and temperature measurement and feedback. Additionally, the few commercially available temperature-control platforms are costly. Here, we report an inexpensive (&lt;$110) and modular Single-Cell Temperature Controller (SiCTeC) device for microbial imaging—based on straightforward modifications of the typical slide-sample-coverslip approach to microbial imaging—that controls temperature using a ring-shaped Peltier module and microcontroller feedback. Through stable and precise (±0.15°C) temperature control, SiCTeC achieves reproducible and fast (1–2 min) temperature transitions with programmable waveforms between room temperature and 45°C with an air objective. At the device’s maximum temperature of 89°C, SiCTeC revealed that <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells progressively shrink and lose cellular contents. During oscillations between 30°C and 37°C, cells rapidly adapted their response to temperature upshifts. Furthermore, SiCTeC enabled the discovery of rapid morphological changes and enhanced sensitivity to substrate stiffness during upshifts to nonpermissive temperatures in temperature-sensitive mutants of cell-wall synthesis enzymes. Overall, the simplicity and affordability of SiCTeC empowers future studies of the temperature dependence of single-cell physiology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HHvrzfx-gmo" width="1" />

Background<p>Investigations into the benefits of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) through pre-clinical and clinical research have led to promising findings for treating several disorders. Despite proven effectiveness of VNS on conditions such as epilepsy and depression, understanding of off-target effects and contributing factors such as sex differences can be beneficial to optimize therapy design.</p>New Methods<p>In this article, we assessed longitudinal effects of VNS on cardiovascular and immune systems, and studied potential sex differences using a rat model of long-term VNS. Rats were implanted with cuff electrodes around the left cervical vagus nerve for VNS, and wireless physiological monitoring devices for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular system using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. ECG morphology and heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted to assess cardiovascular changes resulting from VNS in short-term and long-term timescales. We also assessed VNS effects on expression of inflammatory cytokines in blood during the course of the experiment. Statistical analysis was performed to compare results between Treatment and Sham groups, and between male and female animals from Treatment and Sham groups.</p>Results<p>Considerable differences between male and female rats in cardiovascular effects of VNS were observed in multiple cardiovascular features. However, the effects seemed to be transient with approximately 1-h recovery after VNS. While short-term cardiovascular effects were mainly observed in male rats, females in general showed more significant long-term effects even after VNS stopped. We did not observe notable changes or sex differences in systemic cytokine levels resulting from VNS.</p>Comparison With Existing Methods<p>Compared to existing methods, our study design incorporated wireless physiological monitoring and systemic blood cytokine level analysis, along with long-term VNS experiments in unanesthetized rats to study sex differences.</p>Conclusion<p>The contribution of sex differences for long-term VNS off-target effects on cardiovascular and immune systems was assessed using awake behaving rats. Although VNS did not change the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers in systemic circulation for male and female rats, we observed significant differences in cardiovascular effects of VNS characterized using ECG morphology and HRV analyses.</p>

<p>The genes involved in the metabolic pathways of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins significantly influence the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Various studies have explored the associations between some of these genes and AD in the Caucasian population; however, researches regarding these associations remain limited in the Chinese population. To systematically evaluate the associations of these genes with AD, we investigated 19 genes involved in the metabolism of Aβ and tau based on previous studies selected using the PubMed database. This study included 372 patients with sporadic late-onset AD (sLOAD) and 345 cognitively healthy individuals from southern China. The results were replicated in the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP). Protein–protein interactions were determined using the STRING v11 database. We found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs11682128, of BIN1 conferred susceptibility to sLOAD after adjusting for age, sex, and APOE ε4 status and performing the Bonferroni correction {corrected P = 0.000153, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.403 (1.079–1.824)}, which was replicated in the IGAP. Protein–protein interactions indicated that BIN1 was correlated with MAPT. Moreover, rare variants of NEP and FERMT2 (0.0026 &lt; corrected P &lt; 0.05), and the Aβ degradation, tau pathology, and tau phosphatase pathways (0.01 &lt; corrected P &lt; 0.05), were nominally significantly associated with sLOAD. This study suggested that the genes involved in the metabolic pathways of Aβ and tau contributed to the etiology of sLOAD in the southern Han Chinese population.</p>

<p>by Carolin Zitzmann, Lars Kaderali, Alan S. Perelson</p>

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes acute hepatitis C and can lead to life-threating complications if it becomes chronic. The HCV genome is a single plus strand of RNA. Its intracellular replication is a spatiotemporally coordinated process of RNA translation upon cell infection, RNA synthesis within a replication compartment, and virus particle production. While HCV is mainly transmitted via mature infectious virus particles, it has also been suggested that HCV-infected cells can secrete HCV RNA carrying exosomes that can infect cells in a receptor independent manner. In order to gain insight into these two routes of transmission, we developed a series of intracellular HCV replication models that include HCV RNA secretion and/or virus assembly and release. Fitting our models to <i>in vitro</i> data, in which cells were infected with HCV, suggests that initially most secreted HCV RNA derives from intracellular cytosolic plus-strand RNA, but subsequently secreted HCV RNA derives equally from the cytoplasm and the replication compartments. Furthermore, our model fits to the data suggest that the rate of virus assembly and release is limited by host cell resources. Including the effects of direct acting antivirals in our models, we found that in spite of decreasing intracellular HCV RNA and extracellular virus concentration, low level HCV RNA secretion may continue as long as intracellular RNA is available. This may possibly explain the presence of detectable levels of plasma HCV RNA at the end of treatment even in patients that ultimately attain a sustained virologic response.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rQYSbDpFc8I" width="1" />

Resources are rarely distributed uniformly within a population. Heterogeneity in the concentration of a drug, the quality of breeding sites, or wealth can all affect evolutionary dynamics. In this study, we represent a collection of properties affecting the fitness at a given location using a color. A green node is rich in resources while a red node is poorer. More colors can represent a broader spectrum of resource qualities. For a population evolving according to the birth-death Moran model, the first question we address is which structures, identified by graph connectivity and graph coloring, are evolutionarily equivalent. We prove that all properly two-colored, undirected, regular graphs are evolutionarily equivalent (where “properly colored” means that no two neighbors have the same color). We then compare the effects of background heterogeneity on properly two-colored graphs to those with alternative schemes in which the colors are permuted. Finally, we discuss dynamic coloring as a model for spatiotemporal resource fluctuations, and we illustrate that random dynamic colorings often diminish the effects of background heterogeneity relative to a proper two-coloring.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3hN2z9vY2h4" width="1" />

Interactive digital notebooks provide an opportunity for researchers and educators to carry out data analysis and report the results in a single digital format. Further to just being digital, the format allows for rich content to be created in order to interact with the code and data contained in such a notebook to form an educational narrative. This primer introduces some of the fundamental aspects involved in using Jupyter notebooks in an educational setting for teaching in the bio/health informatics disciplines. We also provide 2 case studies that detail how we used Jupyter notebooks to teach non-coders programming skills on a blended Master’s degree module for a Health Informatics programme and a fully online distance learning unit on Programming for a postgraduate certificate (PG Cert) in Clinical Bioinformatics with a more technical audience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kU7-jU-ioWY" width="1" />

In eukaryotes, polyadenylation (poly(A)) is an essential process during mRNA maturation. Identifying the <i>cis</i>-determinants of poly(A) signal (PAS) on the DNA sequence is the key to understand the mechanism of translation regulation and mRNA metabolism. Although machine learning methods were widely used in computationally identifying PAS, the need for tremendous amounts of annotation data hinder applications of existing methods in species without experimental data on PAS. Therefore, cross-species PAS identification, which enables the possibility to predict PAS from untrained species, naturally becomes a promising direction. In our works, we propose a novel deep learning method named Poly(A)-DG for cross-species PAS identification. Poly(A)-DG consists of a Convolution Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron (CNN-MLP) network and a domain generalization technique. It learns PAS patterns from the training species and identifies PAS in target species without re-training. To test our method, we use three species and build cross-species training sets with two of them and evaluate the performance of the remaining one. Moreover, we test our method against insufficient data and imbalanced data issues and demonstrate that Poly(A)-DG not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also maintains relatively high accuracy when it comes to a smaller or imbalanced training set.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XwVqYO6XZ-M" width="1" />

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations seek to provide atomic-level insights into conformationally dynamic biological systems at experimentally relevant time resolutions, such as those afforded by single-molecule fluorescence measurements. However, limitations in the time scales of MD simulations and the time resolution of single-molecule measurements have challenged efforts to obtain overlapping temporal regimes required for close quantitative comparisons. Achieving such overlap has the potential to provide novel theories, hypotheses, and interpretations that can inform idealized experimental designs that maximize the detection of the desired reaction coordinate. Here, we report MD simulations at time scales overlapping with <i>in vitro</i> single-molecule Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements of the amino acid binding protein LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> at sub-millisecond resolution. Computationally efficient all-atom structure-based simulations, calibrated against explicit solvent simulations, were employed for sampling multiple cycles of LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> clamshell-like conformational changes on the time scale of seconds, examining the relationship between these events and those observed by smFRET. The MD simulations agree with the smFRET measurements and provide valuable information on local dynamics of fluorophores at their sites of attachment on LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> and the correlations between fluorophore motions and large-scale conformational changes between LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> domains. We further utilize the MD simulations to inform the interpretation of smFRET data, including Förster radius (R<sub>0</sub>) and fluorophore orientation factor (κ<sup>2</sup>) determinations. The approach we describe can be readily extended to distinct biochemical systems, allowing for the interpretation of any FRET system conjugated to protein or ribonucleoprotein complexes, including those with more conformational processes, as well as those implementing multi-color smFRET.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NTOMs9cRepw" width="1" />

<p>In the present study, we physiologically mapped the representation of lower jaw (chin vibrissae, chin microvibrissae, and lower lip) in rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and correlated the physiological map to the underlying morphological barrel field map in the lower jaw barrel subfield in SI. We report that the lower jaw barrel subfield is somatopically organized in a single map of the contralateral lower jaw skin surface.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Barrel subfields in rodent primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are important model systems for studying cortical organization and reorganization. During cortical reorganization that follows limb deafferentation, neurons in deafferented forelimb SI become responsive to previously unexpressed inputs from the lower jaw. Although the lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) is a likely source of the input, this subfield has received little attention. Our aim was to describe the structural and functional organization of the normal LJBSF. To investigate LJBSF organization, a nomenclature for lower jaw skin surface was developed, cytochrome oxidase (CO) was used to label flattened‐cut LJBSF sections, microelectrodes were used to map the lower jaw skin surface representation in SI, and electrolytic lesions, recovered from electrode penetrations, were used to align the physiological map to the underlying barrel map. LJBSF is a tear‐shaped subfield containing approximately 24 barrels, arranged in eight mediolateral rows and a barrel‐free zone capping the anterior border. The representation of the lower jaw skin consisting of chin vibrissae and microvibrissae embedded in common fur is somatotopically organized in a single map in the contralateral SI. This physiological map shows that the activity from the vibrissae aligns with the CO‐staining of the underlying LJBSF. LJBSF barrels receive topographically ordered barrel‐specific input from individual vibrissa and microvibrissae in the lower jaw but not from trident whiskers. The barrel‐free zone receives topographically ordered input from the lower lip. These data demonstrating that the LJBSF is a highly organized subfield are essential for understanding its possible role in cortical reorganization.</p>

<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is susceptible to continuous fibrillar beta amyloid plaque deposition in aged amyloid precursor protein/PS1 mice. In contrast, after 12 months of age, fibrillar plaque load plateaus in the primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (SS2). Midlife (6–12 months of age) environmental enrichment (EE) decreases the accumulation of fibrillar plaque in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC region.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmentally enriched housing conditions can increase performance on cognitive tasks in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice; however, the potential effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on disease modification in terms of pathological change are inconclusive. We hypothesized that previous contrasting findings may be attributable to regional differences in susceptibility to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque deposition in cortical regions that are functionally associated with EE. We characterized fibrillar plaque deposition in 6, 12, and 18–22 months old APP/PS1 mice in the prefrontal (PFC), somatosensory (SS2), and primary motor cortex (M1). We found a significant increase in plaque load between 6 and 12 months in all regions. In animals over 12 months, only the PFC region continued to significantly accumulate plaques. Additionally, 12 months old animals subjected to 6 months of EE showed improved spatial navigation and had significantly fewer plaques in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC. These findings suggest that the PFC region is selectively susceptible to Aβ deposition and less responsive to the attenuating effects of EE. In contrast, M1 and SS2 regions plateau with respect to Aβ deposition by 12 months of age and are susceptible to amyloid pathology modification by midlife EE.</p>

<p>In comparison to conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta burst stimulation is stronger and more effective as a brain stimulation approach within short periods. Although this deep rTMS technique is being applied in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, few animal studies have attempted to clarify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects. This animal study examined the effects of deep rTMS on the cuprizone-induced neuropathologic and behavioral anomalies and explored the underlying mechanism. Adolescent male C57BL/6 mice were fed a rodent chow without or with cuprizone (CPZ; 0.2% w/w) for 5 weeks. Another two groups of mice were subjected to deep rTMS or sham rTMS once a day during weeks 2–5 of the CPZ-feeding period. The behaviors of all mice were assessed after the withdrawal of CPZ before neuropathological and immunological analyses. Compared to the CNT group, mice in CPZ and CPZ + Sham groups showed deficits in social recognition and spatial working memory as well as anxiety-like behavior, in addition to myelin breakdown and OL loss in the corpus callosum (CC), caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of the brain. Deep rTMS effectively reduced behavioral anomalies and blocked myelin breakdown and OL loss in CPZ-fed mice. Besides, it also dampened microglia activation at lesion sites and rectified cytokines levels (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) in CPZ-affected regions. The most significant effect was seen in the cerebral cortex where alleviated neuropathology co-existed with less microglia activation and higher IL-10 level. These data provided experimental evidence for the beneficial effects of deep rTMS in CPZ-fed mice and revealed a neurobiological mechanism of the modality.</p>

<p>We previously reported that spinal cord transection (TX) in the lamprey causes mRNA to accumulate in the injured tips of large reticulospinal (RS) axons. We sought to determine whether this mRNA accumulation results from phosphorylation and transport of retrograde signals, similar to what has been reported in mammalian peripheral nerve. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk), mediates the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of many neurotrophic factors. To assess the role of Erk in retrograde signaling of RS axon injury, we used immunoblot and immunohistochemistry to determine the changes in phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) in the spinal cord after spinal cord TX. Immunostaining for p-Erk increased within axons and local cell bodies, most heavily within the 1-2 mm closest to the TX site, at between 3 and 6 h post-TX. In axons, p-Erk was concentrated in 3-5 μm granules that became less numerous with distance from the TX. The retrograde molecular motor dynein colocalized with p-Erk, but vimentin, which in peripheral nerve was reported to participate with p-Erk as part of a retrograde signal complex, did not colocalize with p-Erk, even though vimentin levels were elevated post-TX. The results suggest that p-Erk, but not vimentin, may function as a retrograde axotomy signal in lamprey central nervous system neurons, and that this signal may induce transcription of mRNA, which is then transported down the axon to its injured tip.</p>

In this review, we summarize metabolic alterations in aging brain and AD-related metabolic deficits associated with glucose metabolism dysregulation, glycolysis dysfunction, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficits, and pentose phosphate pathway impairment. Additionally, we discuss recent treatment strategies targeting metabolic defects in AD, including their limitations, in an effort to encourage the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Many current computational models that aim to simulate cortical and hippocampal modules of the brain depend on artificial neural networks. However, such classical or even deep neural networks are very slow, sometimes taking thousands of trials to obtain the final response with a considerable amount of error. The need for a large number of trials at learning and the inaccurate output responses are due to the complexity of the input cue and the biological processes being simulated. This article proposes a computational model for an intact and a lesioned cortico-hippocampal system using quantum-inspired neural networks. This cortico-hippocampal computational quantum-inspired (CHCQI) model simulates cortical and hippocampal modules by using adaptively updated neural networks entangled with quantum circuits. The proposed model is used to simulate various classical conditioning tasks related to biological processes. The output of the simulated tasks yielded the desired responses quickly and efficiently compared with other computational models, including the recently published Green model.</p>

<p>The ability of humans and animals to localize the source of a sound in a complex acoustic environment facilitates communication and survival. Two cues are used for sound localization at horizontal planes, interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD), which are analyzed by distinct neural circuits in the brainstem. Here, we review the studies on metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated neuromodulation of both intrinsic and synaptic properties of brainstem neurons in these circuits. Both mammalian and avian animal models have been used, with each having their advantages that are not present in the other. For the mammalian model, we discuss mGluR neuromodulation in the ILD circuit, with an emphasis on the recent discovery of differential modulation of synaptic transmission of different transmitter release modes. For the avian model, we focus on reviewing mGluR neuromodulation in the ITD pathway, with an emphasis on tonotopic distribution and synaptic plasticity of mGluR modulation in coincidence detector neurons. Future works are proposed to further investigate the functions and mechanisms of mGluRs in the sound localization circuits.</p>

<p>Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) plays an essential role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) are expressed in key areas that are implicated in regulating energy homeostasis. Although the importance of MC4Rs in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) has been well documented, the role of MC4Rs in the medial amygdala (MeA) on feeding remains controversial. In this study, we specifically examine the role of a novel ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA neural circuit in the regulation of short-term food intake. To map a local melanocortinergic neural circuit, we use monosynaptic anterograde as well as retrograde viral tracers and perform double immunohistochemistry to determine the identity of the neurons receiving synaptic input from POMC neurons in the ARC. To investigate the role of the ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA projection on feeding, we optogenetically stimulate channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing POMC fibers in the MeA. Anterograde viral tracing studies reveal that ARC POMC neurons send axonal projections to estrogen receptor-α (ER-α)- and MC4R-expressing neurons in the MeA. Retrograde viral tracing experiments show that the neurons projecting to the MeA is located mainly in the lateral part of the ARC. Optogenetic stimulation of the ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA pathway reduces short-term food intake. This anorectic effect is blocked by treatment with the MC4R antagonist SHU9119. In addition to the melanocortinergic local circuits within the hypothalamus, this extrahypothalamic ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA neural circuit would play a role in regulating short-term food intake.</p>

<p>During the last 50 years, the serotonergic (5-HT) system was reported to exert a complex modulation of locomotor activity. Here, we focus on two key factors that likely contribute to such complexity. First, locomotion is modulated directly and indirectly by 5-HT neurons. The locomotor circuitry is directly innervated by 5-HT neurons in the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. Also, indirect control of locomotor activity results from ascending projections of 5-HT cells in the rostral brainstem that innervate multiple brain centers involved in motor action planning. Second, each approach used to manipulate the 5-HT system likely engages different 5-HT-dependent mechanisms. This includes the recruitment of different 5-HT receptors, which can have excitatory or inhibitory effects on cell activity. These receptors can be located far or close to the 5-HT release sites, making their activation dependent on the level of 5-HT released. Here we review the activity of different 5-HT nuclei during locomotor activity, and the locomotor effects of 5-HT precursors, exogenous 5-HT, selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), electrical or chemical stimulation of 5-HT neurons, genetic deletions, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. We highlight both the coherent and controversial aspects of 5-HT modulation of locomotor activity from basal vertebrates to mammals. This mini review may hopefully inspire future studies aiming at dissecting the complex effects of 5-HT on locomotor function.</p>

<p>Neurons typically receive synaptic input in their dendritic arbor, integrate inputs in their soma, and send output action potentials through their axon, following Cajal’s law of dynamic polarization. Two notable exceptions are retinal amacrine cells and olfactory granule cells (GCs), which flout Cajal’s edict by providing synaptic output from the same dendrites that collect synaptic input. Amacrine cells, a diverse cell class comprising &gt;60 subtypes, employ various dendritic input/output strategies, but A17 amacrine cells (A17s) in particular share further interesting functional characteristics with GCs: both receive excitatory synaptic input from neurons in the primary glutamatergic pathway and return immediate, reciprocal feedback via GABAergic inhibitory synapses to the same synaptic terminals that provided input. Both neurons thereby process signals locally within their dendrites, shaping many parallels, signaling pathways independently. The similarities between A17s and GCs cast into relief striking differences that may indicate distinct processing roles within their respective circuits: First, they employ partially dissimilar molecular mechanisms to transform excitatory input into inhibitory output; second, GCs fire action potentials, whereas A17s do not. Third, GC signals may be influenced by cortical feedback, whereas the mammalian retina receives no such retrograde input. Finally, A17s constitute just one subtype within a diverse class that is specialized in a particular task, whereas the more homogeneous GCs may play more diverse signaling roles via multiple processing modes. Here, we review these analogies and distinctions between A17 amacrine cells and granule cells, hoping to gain further insight into the operating principles of these two sensory circuits.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.595523">A Comparison of the Primary Sensory Neurons Used in Olfaction and Vision</a></h4>

<p>Vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch are the tools used to perceive and navigate the world. They enable us to obtain essential resources such as food and highly desired resources such as mates. Thanks to the investments in biomedical research the molecular unpinning’s of human sensation are rivaled only by our knowledge of sensation in the laboratory mouse. Humans rely heavily on vision whereas mice use smell as their dominant sense. Both modalities have many features in common, starting with signal detection by highly specialized primary sensory neurons—rod and cone photoreceptors (PR) for vision, and olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) for the smell. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how these two types of primary sensory neurons operate while highlighting the similarities and distinctions.</p>
