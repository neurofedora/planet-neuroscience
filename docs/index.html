              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09320">Mapping Connectomic Structure to Function(s) in Cerebellar-like Networks using Kernel Regression</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebellar-like networks, in which input activity patterns are separated by projection to a much higher-dimensional space before classification, are a recurring neurobiological motif, present in the cerebellum, dentate gyrus, insect olfactory system, and electrosensory system of the electric fish. Their relatively well-understood design presents a promising test-case for probing principles of biological learning. The circuits' expansive projections have long been modelled as random, enabling effective general purpose pattern separation. However, electron-microscopy studies have discovered interesting hints of structure in both the fly mushroom body and mouse cerebellum. Recent numerical work suggested that this non-random connectivity enables the circuit to prioritise learning of some, presumably natural, tasks over others. Here, rather than numerical results, we present a robust mathematical link between the observed connectivity patterns and the cerebellar circuit's learning ability. In particular, we extend a simplified kernel regression model of the system and use recent machine learning theory results to relate connectivity to learning. We find that the reported structure in the projection weights shapes the network's inductive bias in intuitive ways: functions are easier to learn if they depend on inputs that are oversampled, or on collections of neurons that tend to connect to the same hidden layer neurons. Our approach is analytically tractable and pleasingly simple, and we hope it continues to serve as a model for understanding the functional implications of other processing motifs in cerebellar-like networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08855">Evolutionary tuning of TAM receptor-ligand interfaces highlights electrostatic features associated with regenerative phagocytic signaling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient resolution of neuroinflammation and debris clearance is a key determinant of successful central nervous system regeneration. Regenerative vertebrates such as Danio rerio often exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance than mammals, yet the molecular determinants underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S are central regulators of phagocytosis and immune resolution in the nervous system, but whether intrinsic structural properties of these receptor-ligand complexes contribute to regenerative efficiency has not been systematically explored.
  Here, we present a comparative in silico analysis of TAM receptors and ligands from zebrafish, human, and mouse, integrating sequence evolution, high-confidence structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic analysis. Despite substantial sequence divergence, ligand-binding domains display strong structural conservation, supporting a conserved global mode of TAM-ligand engagement. At the interface level, zebrafish complexes show enhanced electrostatic contributions and increased salt-bridge density, particularly in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction. Residue-level electrostatic analysis reveals clustered interface hotspots that are spatially conserved across species despite evolutionary rewiring of individual contacts.
  Together, these results suggest that TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are evolutionarily tuned through subtle electrostatic and geometric optimization rather than large-scale structural changes, providing a conserved yet adaptable framework for species-specific modulation of phagocytic signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16070">A Hypothesis-First Framework for Mechanistic Modeling in Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turning rich neuroimaging data into mechanistic insight remains challenging. Statistical models capture associations but remain largely agnostic to underlying mechanisms. Biophysical models embody candidate mechanisms but remain difficult to deploy without specialized expertise. Here, we present a hypothesis-first framework recasting model specifications as testable mechanistic hypotheses and streamlines the procedure for rejecting inappropriate hypotheses before moving to typical analyses. The key innovation is an expectation of model behavior under feature generalization constraints: we compute the model's expected $Y$ output across the parameter space based on the likelihood for a broader/distinct feature $Z$. Mirror statistical models are derived from these expected outputs and compared to the empirical ones with standard statistics. In synthetic experiments, our framework rejected mis-specified hypotheses and penalized unnecessary degrees of freedom while retaining valid hypotheses. These results demonstrate a practical hypothesis-driven approach for using mechanistic models in neuroimaging without requiring advanced training, complementing traditional analyses.

                arXiv:2511.08101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives an in-depth theoretical analysis of the direction and speed selectivity properties of idealized models of the spatio-temporal receptive fields of simple cells and complex cells, based on the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.
  By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii) different visual neurons having broader vs. sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580">Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09557">SiliconHealth: A Complete Low-Cost Blockchain Healthcare Infrastructure for Resource-Constrained Regions Using Repurposed Bitcoin Mining ASICs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SiliconHealth, a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare infrastructure designed for resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems.

                arXiv:2601.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental robot optimization often requires evaluating each candidate policy for seconds to minutes. The chosen evaluation time influences optimization because of a speed-accuracy tradeoff: shorter evaluations enable faster iteration, but are also more subject to noise. Here, we introduce a supplement to the CMA-ES optimization algorithm, named Adaptive Sampling CMA-ES (AS-CMA), which assigns sampling time to candidates based on predicted sorting difficulty, aiming to achieve consistent precision. We compared AS-CMA to CMA-ES and Bayesian optimization using a range of static sampling times in four simulated cost landscapes. AS-CMA converged on 98% of all runs without adjustment to its tunable parameter, and converged 24-65% faster and with 29-76% lower total cost than each landscape's best CMA-ES static sampling time. As compared to Bayesian optimization, AS-CMA converged more efficiently and reliably in complex landscapes, while in simpler landscapes, AS-CMA was less efficient but equally reliable. We deployed AS-CMA in an exoskeleton optimization experiment and found the optimizer's behavior was consistent with expectations. These results indicate that AS-CMA can improve optimization efficiency in the presence of noise while minimally affecting optimization setup complexity and tuning requirements.

Abstract: When some resources are to be distributed among a set of agents following egalitarian social welfare, the goal is to maximize the utility of the agent whose utility turns out to be minimal. In this context, agents can have an incentive to lie about their actual preferences, so that more valuable resources are assigned to them. In this paper we analyze this situation, and we present a practical study where genetic algorithms are used to assess the benefits of lying under different situations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07348">Controlled Self-Evolution for Algorithmic Code Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.07348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 15 January 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68093-6">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68093-6</a></p>He, Ongwae, and colleagues show that flow cytometry provides a high-throughput, solution-based platform for analysing the behavior of biomolecular condensates at the single-droplet level. Using this approach, the authors quantify condensate formation and track molecular exchange in real-time, and they reveal that condensate aging reduces molecular dynamisms.

                <p>Speech in everyday life is often masked by background noise, making comprehension effortful. Characterizing brain activity patterns when individuals listen to masked speech can help clarify the mechanisms underlying such effort. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans of either sex to investigate how neural signatures of story listening change in the presence of masking noise. We show that, as speech masking increases, spatial and temporal activation patterns in auditory regions become more idiosyncratic to each listener. In contrast, spatial activity patterns in brain networks linked to effort (e.g., cingulo-opercular network) are more similar across listeners when speech is highly masked and less intelligible, suggesting shared neural processes. Moreover, at times during stories when one meaningful event ended and another began, neural activation increased in frontal, parietal, and medial cortices. This event-boundary response appeared little affected by background noise, suggesting that listeners process meaningful units and, in turn, the gist of naturalistic, continuous speech even when it is masked somewhat by background noise. The current data may indicate that people stay engaged and cognitive processes associated with naturalistic speech processing remain intact under moderate levels of noise, whereas auditory processing becomes more idiosyncratic to each listener.</p>

                <p>The chemokine CXCL12 plays critical roles in the development of the hippocampus dentate gyrus during both embryogenesis and adulthood. While multiple cell types in the hippocampus express <I>Cxcl12</I>, their individual contributions to the dentate gyrus development and function remain unclear. Here, using <I>Cxcl12</I> reporter mice of both sexes, we characterize <I>Cxcl12</I> expression in Cajal&ndash;Retzius (CR) cells&mdash;neurons that guide dentate gyrus morphogenesis and influence hippocampal circuitry. We show that CR cells prominently express <I>Cxcl12</I> during early postnatal development, although both the number and proportion of <I>Cxcl12</I>-expressing CR cells decline significantly in adulthood. Notably, partial deletion of <I>Cxcl12</I> from hippocampal CR cells in male and female mice does not result in detectable changes in dentate gyrus architecture, adult neurogenesis, or specific behaviors. These findings suggest that CR cell-derived CXCL12 may be less critical for dentate gyrus development than previously assumed and underscore the complexity and potential redundancy of CXCL12 signaling in the hippocampus.</p>

                Plastic waste accumulation is a global environmental issue. Current methods (recycling, incineration, landfilling, etc.) are not a sustainable long-term solution and so far they cannot prevent continuous accumulation of plastic waste worldwide. This article introduces the concept of deep geological disposal (DGD) of plastic waste as an alternative strategy. The concept principally differs from the traditional landfilling. In the latter, plastic waste is affected by chemical, physical, and microbial factors that cause plastic fragmentation and environmental leakage. On the contrary, DGD isolates plastic waste in abandoned mines, quarries and caves, ensuring safe long-term containment of the waste and the possibility of its reuse as a raw material in the future. Another advantage of DGD is that these geological structures usually have transport infrastructure and storage facilities, and, as a result, they offer a more controlled environment with reduced risk of leachate, microplastic dispersion, and surface pollution. The paper discusses the practical, economic, and environmental aspects of the concept of DGD of plastic waste. The proposal does not offer to replace other available mechanisms of plastic waste management, it presents DGD as a complementary and potentially effective method for addressing non-recyclable and mismanaged plastic waste worldwide.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1110/v2?src=rss">Evaluating the implementation of adult smoking cessation programs in community settings: Protocol for a scoping review [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Morbidity and mortality due to tobacco smoking is a public health crisis predicted to rise in coming years with the growing global population. Smoking cessation programs are an important tool to support service users to quit smoking. Understanding how programs are implemented to support the uptake of smoking cessation services may help enhance service design and delivery, service user engagement, and cessation outcomes. Objectives The objective of this review is to evaluate the implementation of smoking cessation programs for adult smokers aged 18 years or older. Rationale Whilst the effectiveness of smoking cessation programs have been previously investigated, there is limited research examining the implementation of programs in practice. This scoping review will provide novel information by evaluating the implementation of smoking cessation programs, including smoking cessation interventions; implementation strategies; and implementation theories, models, and frameworks. Inclusion criteria This review will include the implementation of smoking cessation programs for adults aged 18 years or older, who are daily smokers of tobacco-based cigarettes, accessing a community-based service for smoking cessation support. Methods A search of research databases Medline, CENTRAL, Embase, and Web of Science will be undertaken, in addition to searching for grey literature and hand searches for potential articles for inclusion. Data will be extracted into a spreadsheet and ordered into predetermined categories based on the inclusion criteria; intervention; implementation strategies; and implementation theories, models and/or frameworks. Conclusions This scoping review will evaluate the implementation of smoking cessation services to adults in the community. An evidence map highlighting current knowledge will be developed, contributing to the body of literature on community-based smoking cessation programs. Evidence gaps will be identified, providing direction for future research and service delivery internationally.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-862/v2?src=rss">Long-term Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey among Students and Technical Staff in Health Care Institutions [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students and technical personnel at healthcare institutions, with a focus on levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Methods A total of 250 participants were included, comprising 130 students from health sciences and 120 individuals from technical fields. In total, 164 participants were females, and 192 participants were aged ≤20 years. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered electronic questionnaire. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), followed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), was used to retrospectively assess psychological distress linked to the pandemic. The data were analysed via the chi-square test. Results DASS severity ratings revealed that 41.3% of participants aged ≤20 years experienced severe or extremely severe anxiety, which was statistically significant (p = 0.013). The stress scores were also significantly higher in this age group (p = 0.004). Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that younger age and female sex were significantly associated with increased odds of depression and stress. Males had comparatively lower odds of experiencing psychological distress. Participants from technical fields demonstrated higher odds of anxiety and stress, although not of depression. Conclusion The long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be more pronounced among younger individuals, females, and technical staff in healthcare institutions. Although students may have greater awareness about the disease, this awareness may contribute to heightened psychological distress.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-60/v1?src=rss">A Revolutionary Concept in Innate Immunity and its Implications for Vaccine Development and Immune Therapies: A Comprehensive Review of Trained Immunity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune cells can acquire a form of memory through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming following exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), resulting in an enhanced, heterologous inflammatory response upon subsequent stimulation, a phenomenon termed trained immunity. This emerging concept challenges the traditional view that immunological memory is restricted to the adaptive immune system and is reshaping current understanding of host defense. Trained immunity is driven by long-lasting functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, particularly monocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and their progenitors, leading to heightened responsiveness to secondary, often unrelated, stimuli. Comparable forms of innate immune memory have been documented across diverse biological systems, including systemic acquired resistance in plants, immune priming in insects, and trained immunity in mammals, highlighting its evolutionary conservation. The capacity of trained immunity to enhance immune responses provides a mechanistic basis for improved protection against reinfection and strengthened tumor surveillance. However, its dysregulated or excessive activation may also contribute to the development of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, underscoring its dual and context-dependent nature. Consequently, trained immunity holds significant relevance for a wide range of clinical and translational applications, including infectious disease control, cancer immunotherapy, inflammatory disorders, and vaccine development. Harnessing trained immunity in vaccine design offers promising opportunities to achieve broader protective coverage, prolonged immune durability, and improved vaccine efficacy. Despite these advances, key challenges remain, including elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying trained immunity, understanding its crosstalk with adaptive immune responses, and identifying optimal inducers and adjuvants capable of safely modulating trained immune pathways. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be essential for translating the concept of trained immunity into effective and safe therapeutic and vaccine strategies for human health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-59/v1?src=rss">Mapping Research on AI Ethics and Human Rights: A Bibliometric Study with a TCCM-Based Agenda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The fast-paced acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in various sectors of society, such as health, the judiciary, and education, has had several socio-ethical, legal, and human rights consequences. While AI technologies allow for more efficiency and specialization in decision-making processes, the use of such technologies in very sensitive spheres of social life brings with it great potential dangers, such as bias, discrimination, and violation of privacy. Methods The analysis was performed using Biblioshiny, which is the web interface of the Bibliometric R-package and VOSviewer, to ascertain trends in publication rates, citation impact, keyword development, concentration of journals, institutional affiliations, and inter-country contributions. A co-word and cluster analysis was also performed to show the current dominant and emerging themes of the literature and the thematic evolution from 2018 to 2025. The (theo–context–characteristics–methodology TCCM () framework was applied to analyze the theoretical, contextual, characteristic, and methodological gaps in the literature. Results Most of the heavier hits and influential research are found in only a small number of journals and institutions, mainly located in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. There is a predominance of the themes of AI ethics, governance, and data protection. New themes, such as AI governance and algorithmic accountability, have become apparent in recent years. Conclusions This study contributes to the research in the area in that it provides a comprehensive overview of the developments in AI ethics and human rights and also notes the major gaps in this area. A future agenda for research using the TCCM framework is presented, whereby a call is made for the integration of formal ethical theories into the sphere, a move to empirical methodologies, and enhancement of the geographic and sectoral spread of research.

                Abstract* Background Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among men in South Africa, particularly affecting those in rural and underserved communities. Despite growing awareness, late presentation and poor health-seeking behaviour remain significant challenges. Understanding the sociocultural factors that shape men’s experiences and decision-making regarding prostate cancer is essential for improving early detection and care. Objective This study explores the perspectives of prostate cancer survivors and men in the general population on prostate cancer, its prevention, treatment and related health-seeking behaviour in rural South African context. Methods This study adopts a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews conducted with two purposefully sampled groups: prostate cancer survivors (n=15) and men from the general population with no known diagnosis (n=15), in the OR Tambo District OF THE eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Interviews will be conducted in isiXhosa (the local language), audio recorded, transcribes and translated into English. Data will be analysed thematically using NVivo software. Ethical approval has been obtained from the Walter Sisulu University Human Research Ethics Committee (014/2025), with additional permissions granted by the Eastern Cape Provincial Department of health and Nelson Mandela Academic hospital. Conclusion the findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of individual and community-level factors influencing prostate cancer health-seeking behaviour. This study will generate context-specific qualitative evidence to guide public health policy and prostate cancer awareness campaigns in rural African settings, male-friendly community interventions to promote early detection in rural areas, with broader implications for addressing health inequities in non-communicable disease care.

                Background This study evaluated the effects of Curcuma longa on histomorphometric parameters and reticular fiber expression in the testes of methamphetamine-exposed Wistar rats. Methods Twenty-five adult male rats were divided into five groups: Group 1 (Normal Control) received distilled water; Group 2 (Methamphetamine-Only) was administered 5 mg/kg b.w. methamphetamine; Group 3 received methamphetamine alongside a low dose of Curcuma longa extract (100 mg/kg b.w.); Group 4 was given methamphetamine with a medium dose of Curcuma longa extract (200 mg/kg b.w.); and Group 5 received methamphetamine and a high dose of Curcuma longa extract (400 mg/kg b.w.), all treatments were administered for 28 days. Histomorphometric analysis (seminiferous tubular diameter, germinal epithelial height) was conducted using ImageJ software, while reticular fibers were visualized via Gomori’s methenamine silver staining. Results Methamphetamine exposure significantly increased reticular fiber density around seminiferous tubules and dilated tubular diameter compared to other groups (p < 0.05). Curcuma longa treatment dose-dependently reversed these alterations, with the High Dose Curcuma longa treated Group (400 mg/kg) showing reduced reticular fiber expression and restored tubular diameter (247.35 ± 4.40 μm), comparable to the normal control group. Germinal epithelial heights remained statistically unchanged across groups, suggesting shorter intervention periods may limit observable epithelial recovery. Tissue anti-oxidant analysis revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels in the methamphetamine group compared to the control, whereas treatment groups showed significant reductions (p< 0.05) compared to the methamphetamine group. The ameliorative effects of Curcuma longa are attributed to curcumin’s antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, which mitigate oxidative stress and extracellular matrix remodeling induced by methamphetamine. Conclusions Curcuma longa attenuates methamphetamine-induced testicular damage, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic adjunct for drug-associated male infertility. Further clinical studies are warranted to validate these findings in human populations.

                Background The performance of regional-owned multi-business enterprises (BUMD Aneka Usaha) in Indonesia is crucial for regional economic development, yet many still face challenges related to weak corporate governance, leadership, and business strategy. Methods Data were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to 176 directors of regional-owned multi-business enterprises across Indonesia. The data were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), with higher-order constructs estimated in SmartPLS. Results The findings show that corporate governance, transformational leadership, and business strategy each have positive and significant effects on business performance, and that business strategy mediates the effects of governance and leadership on performance. Government policy also significantly moderates the relationships between corporate governance, transformational leadership, business strategy, and business performance, strengthening their positive impact. Conclusions These results highlight the need to reinforce internal capabilities through stronger governance practices, transformational leadership, and flexible, innovation-oriented strategies, while ensuring a supportive government policy environment so that regional-owned enterprises can improve their sustainable performance and public value creation.

                Background Competence-Based Education (CBE) has become a central reform in higher education, emphasizing mastery of practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge. Kampala International University (KIU) recognizes the importance of aligning its programs with labour market expectations. However, challenges remain in staff understanding, curriculum adaptation, and identification of essential competencies. Quality assurance monitoring and evaluation frameworks are critical in guiding institutions through this transition. Methods The study adopted a cross-sectional design and employed a concurrent mixed-methods approach. A sample of 357 participants was drawn from a population of 5,400, including 328 students, 28 lecturers, and the Director of Quality Assurance. Data were collected using questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation, while qualitative responses were examined through thematic analysis. Results The findings revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between institutional quality assurance monitoring and evaluation and the promotion of CBE. Student responses showed a weak but significant correlation (r (304) = 0.17, p = 0.003), whereas lecturer responses showed a moderate correlation (r (23) = 0.62, p = 0.001). Lecturers perceived their institution as having a well-defined monitoring and evaluation framework, which influenced their professional conduct more strongly than students’ daily learning experiences. Conclusion The study concludes that robust quality assurance mechanisms are essential for advancing CBE implementation. Effective governance structures, organized data management, continuous staff training, and stakeholder participation strengthen institutional readiness and compliance with national standards. These mechanisms ensure that CBE reforms at KIU contribute to sustainable educational transformation and improved workforce preparedness.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Stimulation of nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) opioid receptors by the endogenous ligand nociceptin (Noc) leads to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibition or G protein inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel activation. One mechanism of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization occurs when G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) phosphorylate the agonist-bound receptors. In the continued presence of an agonist, Gβγ recruits GRK to the plasma membrane where GPCR are then phosphorylated by GRK. The purpose of this study was to identify the GRK subtype responsible for desensitization of the Noc-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inhibition in rat stellate ganglion (SG) neurons. We observed that GRK2 and GRK5 are expressed in SG neurons. Further, silencing either GRK subtype alone or together employing siRNA did not overtly alter their Noc pharmacological profile. We assessed NOP receptor desensitization employing a protocol where the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inhibition was measured during intermittent application of high Noc concentrations in the continued presence of the IC<sub>50</sub> Noc concentration. With this approach, we observed complete Ca<sup>2+</sup> current desensitization in neurons transfected with either scrambled or GRK2 siRNA following exposure to high Noc concentrations. On the other hand, full desensitization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents was not observed in neurons in which GRK5 was silenced alone or with GRK2. That is, coupling of NOP receptors with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels was still observed following application of high Noc concentration. These results suggest that GRK5 plays a key role in the mechanism that mediates NOP receptor desensitization in SG neurons.</p>

                Introduction Anger, aggression, and hostility are interconnected and are difficult to evaluate. Aggression, in particular, may be a negative behavior and should be minimized. This study aimed to obtain the perceptions of anger, hostility, and aggression among medical students by comparing self-rating detailed assessment tool scores with students’ self, social and academic factors. Methods This cross-sectional study measured the anger, aggression, and hostility of medical students using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AGQ). AGQ scores were compared with age, body mass index (BMI), sex, physical activity, academic level, college grade point average (GPA), study duration, gaming, and social media time using t-test, ANOVA, and Spearman’s correlation. Results A total of 138 medical students were included in this study: 109 males (79.0%) and 29 females (21.0%), with ages ranging from 18 to 27 years. The median Total AGQ was 71.5 with an IQR of 43.3. Insignificant results were found comparing total aggression scores (AGQ) with sex or educational levels, with p-value of 0.93 and 0.243, respectively, with the exception of hostility scores (AGQ_Host), which showed a significant association with educational level, with a p-value of 0.023. A significant inverse association was found between physical activity level and both the AGQ and AGQ-Host, with p-values of 0.047 and 0.002, respectively. Finally, GPA had a significant positive correlation with the AGQ-Host, with a p-value of 0.021. Conclusion Physical activity level, educational levels, and GPA were found to be the most influential factors in affecting the AGQ scores among other factors in this study. The use of better coping mechanisms, encouraging physical activity, improving sleep quality, and maintaining proper studying techniques may help reduce the AGQ scores.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-53/v1?src=rss">MorphoCloud: Democratizing Access to High-Performance Computing for Morphological Data Analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The digitization of biological specimens has revolutionized morphology, generating massive 3D datasets such as microCT scans. While open-source platforms like 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph have democratized access to advanced visualization and analysis software, a significant “compute gap” persists. Processing high-resolution 3D data requires high-end GPUs and substantial RAM, resources that are frequently unavailable at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and other educational settings. This “digital divide” prevents many researchers and students from utilizing the very data and software that have been made open to them. Methods We present MorphoCloud, a platform designed to bridge this hardware barrier by providing on-demand, research-grade computing environments via a web browser. MorphoCloud utilizes an “IssuesOps” architecture, where users manage their remote workstations entirely through GitHub Issues using natural-language commands (e.g., /create, /unshelve). The technology stack leverages GitHub Issues and Actions for front-end and orchestration respectively, JetStream2 for backend compute, and Apache Guacamole to deliver a high-performance, GPU-accelerated desktop experience to any modern browser. Results The platform enables a streamlined lifecycle for remote instances, which come pre-configured with the SlicerMorph ecosystem, R/RStudio, and AI-assisted segmentation tools like NNInteractive and MEMOs. Users have access to a persistent storage volume that is decoupled from the instance. For educational purposes, MorphoCloud supports “Workshop” instances that allow for bulk provisioning and stay online continuously for short-term events. This identical environment ensures that instructors can conduct complex 3D workflows without the typical troubleshooting delays caused by heterogeneous student hardware. Conclusion MorphoCloud demonstrates that true scientific accessibility requires not just open data and software, but also open infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of cloud administration into a simple, command-driven interface, MorphoCloud empowers researchers at under-resourced institutions to engage in high-performance morphological analysis and AI-assisted segmentation.

The activation trajectories induced by different ligands explain ligand-specific efficacies of G-protein activation and preferences for G-protein subtypes.

Brain recordings reveal that two distinct groups of neurons respond to stimuli and contextual information. These groups then cooperate to form flexible memories, rather than individual neurons encoding both signal types.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93108">The RNA-binding protein HuR modulates the expression of the disease-linked CCL2 rs1024611G-rs13900T haplotype</a></h4>

              
                CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases associated with monocyte/macrophage recruitment, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), tuberculosis, and atherosclerosis. The rs1024611 (alleles: A&gt;G; G is the risk allele) polymorphism in the <i>CCL2 cis</i>-regulatory region is associated with increased CCL2 expression in vitro and ex vivo, leukocyte mobilization in vivo, and deleterious disease outcomes. However, the molecular basis for the rs1024611-associated differential CCL2 expression remains poorly characterized. It is conceivable that genetic variant(s) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1024611 could mediate such effects. Previously, we used rs13900 (alleles: C&gt;T) in the <i>CCL2</i> 3′untranslated region (3′ UTR) that is in perfect LD with rs1024611 to demonstrate allelic expression imbalance (AEI) of <i>CCL2</i> in heterozygous individuals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the rs13900 could modulate <i>CCL2</i> expression by altering mRNA turnover and/or translatability. The rs13900 T allele conferred greater stability to the <i>CCL2</i> transcript when compared to the rs13900 C allele. The rs13900 T allele also had increased binding to Human Antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein, in vitro and ex vivo. The rs13900 alleles imparted differential activity to reporter vectors and influenced the translatability of the reporter transcript. We further demonstrated the role of HuR in mediating allele-specific effects on CCL2 expression in overexpression and silencing studies. Our studies suggest that the differential interactions of HuR with rs13900 could modulate CCL2 expression and could in part explain the interindividual differences in CCL2-mediated disease susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104691">Prefoldin 5 is a microtubule-associated protein that suppresses Tau aggregation and neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies represent a major class of neurodegenerative disorders associated with intracellular aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. To identify molecular modulators of Tau toxicity, we used a genetic screen to identify protein chaperones whose RNAi-mediated knockdown could modulate hTau<sup>V337M</sup>-induced eye-ommatidial degeneration in <i>Drosophila</i>. This screen identified the Prefoldins Pfdn5 and Pfdn6 as strong modifiers of hTau<sup>V337M</sup> cytotoxicity. Consistent with the known function of Pfdn as a cotranslational chaperone for tubulin, <i>Pfdn5</i> mutants showed substantially reduced levels of tubulin monomer. However, additional microtubule-related functions were indicated by the robust unexpected association of Pfdn5 with axonal microtubules in vivo, as well as binding with stabilized microtubules in biochemical assays. Loss of Pfdn5 resulted in neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) defects similar to those previously described in hTau-expressing flies: namely, increased supernumerary boutons and fewer microtubule loops within mature presynaptic boutons. Significantly, synaptic phenotypes caused by hTau<sup>V337M</sup> overexpression were also strongly enhanced in a <i>Pfdn5</i> mutant background. Consistent with a role in modulating Tau toxicity, not only did loss of <i>Pfdn5</i> result in increased accumulations of Tau aggregates in hTau<sup>V337M</sup>-expressing neurons, but also neuronal overexpression of Prefoldin strikingly ameliorated age-dependent neurodegeneration and memory deficits induced by pathological hTau. Together, these and other observations described herein: (a) provide new insight into Prefoldin-microtubule interactions; (b) point to essential post-translational roles for Pfdn5 in controlling Tau toxicity in vivo; and (c) demonstrate that Pfdn5 overexpression is sufficient to restrict Tau-induced neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99931">A unifying account of replay as context-driven memory reactivation</a></h4>

              
                During rest and sleep, sequential neural activation patterns corresponding to awake experience re-emerge, and this replay has been shown to benefit subsequent behavior and memory. Whereas some studies show that replay directly recapitulates recent experience, others demonstrate that replay systematically deviates from the temporal structure, the statistics, and even the content of recent experience. Given these disparate characteristics, what is the nature and purpose of replay? Here, we offer a theoretical framework in which replay reflects simple context-guided processes that facilitate memory. We suggest that during awake learning, the brain associates experiences with the contexts in which they are encoded, at encoding rates that vary according to the salience of each experience. During quiescence, replay emerges as the result of a cascade of autonomous bidirectional interactions between contexts and their associated experiences, which in turn facilitates memory consolidation. A computational model instantiating this proposal explains numerous replay phenomena, including findings that existing models fail to account for and observations that have been predominantly construed through the lens of reinforcement learning. Our theory provides a unified, mechanistic framework of how the brain initially encodes and subsequently replays experiences in the service of memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107460">Insights from aquaporin structures into drug-resistant sleeping sickness</a></h4>

              
                <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> is the causal agent of African trypanosomiasis in humans and animals, the latter resulting in significant negative economic impacts in afflicted areas of the world. Resistance has arisen to the trypanocidal drugs pentamidine and melarsoprol through mutations in the aquaglyceroporin TbAQP2 that prevent their uptake. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of TbAQP2 from <i>T. brucei</i>, bound to either the substrate glycerol or to the sleeping sickness drugs, pentamidine or melarsoprol. The drugs bind within the AQP2 channel at a site completely overlapping that of glycerol. Mutations leading to a drug-resistant phenotype were found in the channel lining. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed the channel can be traversed by pentamidine, with a low energy binding site at the centre of the channel, flanked by regions of high energy association at the extracellular and intracellular ends. Drug-resistant TbAQP2 mutants are still predicted to bind pentamidine, but the much weaker binding in the centre of the channel observed in the MD simulations would be insufficient to compensate for the high energy processes of ingress and egress, hence impairing transport at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. The structures of drug-bound TbAQP2 represent a novel paradigm for drug–transporter interactions and are a new mechanism for targeting drugs in pathogens and human cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98357">Fish CDK2 recruits Dtx4 to degrade TBK1 through ubiquitination in the antiviral response</a></h4>

              
                Although the classical biological protein cell cycle protein kinase CDK2 has been extensively studied in higher vertebrates, its function in lower vertebrates beyond the regulation of mitosis remains unknown. In this study, we report a distinct mechanism whereby IFN expression is negatively regulated in fish by CDK2. After infection with the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), fish CDK2 expression significantly increased in tissues and cells. Moreover, antiviral resistance was improved in <i>cdk2</i><sup>-/-</sup> homozygotes, and the antiviral cytokine interferon (IFN) expression was significantly higher. At the cellular level, CDK2 overexpression reduced IFN expression, while <i>cdk2</i> knockdown increased the ability of cells to produce IFN. Subsequently, it was discovered that fish CDK2 binds and degrades TBK1, resulting in reduced IFN. CDK2 increases the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, causing its degradation, while E3 ubiquitin ligase Dtx4 was found to be involved in this process following the significant enhancement of TBK1 K48-linked ubiquitination. Protein mass spectrometry and immunoblot analysis confirmed that the K567 site on TBK1 is essential for CDK2 to engage with Dtx4 and degrade TBK1; thus, after mutating the K567 site, K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 was not enhanced by Dtx4, and TBK1 was not degraded by CDK2. Our data demonstrate that fish CDK2 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Dtx4 to target the K567 site of TBK1 and promote its degradation. These results suggest that CDK2 in lower vertebrates is implicated in a specialized role for antiviral innate immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101673">Secreted exosomes induce filopodia formation</a></h4>

              
                Filopodia are dynamic adhesive cytoskeletal structures that are critical for directional sensing, polarization, cell-cell adhesion, and migration of diverse cell types. Filopodia are also critical for neuronal synapse formation. While dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is known to be critical for filopodia biogenesis, little is known about the upstream extracellular signals. Here, we identify secreted exosomes as potent regulators of filopodia formation. Inhibition of exosome secretion inhibited the formation and stabilization of filopodia in both cancer cells and neurons and inhibited subsequent synapse formation by neurons. Rescue experiments with purified small and large extracellular vesicles (EVs) identified exosome-enriched small EVs (SEVs) as having potent filopodia-inducing activity. Proteomic analyses of cancer cell-derived SEVs identified the TGF-β family coreceptor endoglin as a key SEV-enriched cargo that regulates filopodia. Cancer cell endoglin levels also affected filopodia-dependent behaviors, including metastasis of cancer cells in chick embryos and 3D migration in collagen gels. As neurons do not express endoglin, we performed a second proteomics experiment to identify SEV cargoes regulated by endoglin that might promote filopodia in both cell types. We discovered a single SEV cargo that was altered in endoglin-KD cancer SEVs, the transmembrane protein Thrombospondin Type 1 Domain Containing 7A (THSD7A). We further found that both cancer cell and neuronal SEVs carry THSD7A and that add-back of purified THSD7A is sufficient to rescue filopodia defects of both endoglin-KD cancer cells and exosome-inhibited neurons. We also find that THSD7A induces filopodia formation through activation of the Rho GTPase, Cdc42. These findings suggest a new model for filopodia formation, triggered by exosomes carrying THSD7A.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105575">Afadin sorts different retinal neuron types into accurate cellular layers</a></h4>

              
                Neurons use cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) to interact with other neurons and the extracellular environment: the combination of CAMs specifies migration patterns, neuronal morphologies, and synaptic connections across diverse neuron types. Yet little is known regarding the intracellular signaling cascade mediating the CAM recognitions at the cell surface across different neuron types. Using mouse genetics and viral labeling, we investigated the neural developmental role of Afadin (Mandai et al., 1997; Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takahashi et al., 1999), a cytosolic adapter protein that connects multiple CAM families to intracellular F-actin. We introduced the conditional Afadin mouse mutant (Beaudoin et al., 2012) to an embryonic retinal Cre, <i>Six3<sup>Cre</sup></i> (Oliver et al., 1995; Liu and Cvekl, 2017; Diacou et al., 2018). We reported that the mouse mutants lead to the scrambled retinal neuron distribution, including bipolar cells (BCs), amacrine cells (ACs), and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), across three cellular layers of the retina. This scrambled pattern was first reported here at neuron-type resolution. Importantly, the mutants do not display deficits for BCs, ACs, or RGCs in terms of neural fate specifications or survival. Additionally, the displayed RGC types still maintain synaptic partners with putative AC types, indicating that other molecular determinants instruct synaptic choices independent of Afadin. Lastly, there is a significant decline in visual function and mis-targeting of RGC axons to incorrect zones of the superior colliculus, one of the major retinorecipient areas. Collectively, our study uncovers a unique cellular role of Afadin in sorting retinal neuron types into proper cellular layers as the structural basis for orderly visual processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100555">Nonlinear transcriptional responses to gradual modulation of transcription factor dosage</a></h4>

              
                Genomic loci associated with common traits and diseases are typically non-coding and likely impact gene expression, sometimes coinciding with rare loss-of-function variants in the target gene. However, our understanding of how gradual changes in gene dosage affect molecular, cellular, and organismal traits is currently limited. To address this gap, we induced gradual changes in gene expression of four genes using CRISPR activation and inactivation in human-derived K562 cells. Downstream transcriptional consequences of dosage modulation of three master trans-regulators associated with blood cell traits (<i>GFI1B</i>, <i>NFE2</i>, and <i>MYB</i>) were examined using targeted single-cell multimodal sequencing. We showed that guide tiling around the TSS is the most effective way to modulate <i>cis</i> gene expression across a wide range of fold changes, with further effects from chromatin accessibility and histone marks that differ between the inhibition and activation systems. Our single-cell data allowed us to precisely detect subtle to large gene expression changes in dozens of <i>trans</i> genes, revealing that many responses to dosage changes of these three TFs are nonlinear, including non-monotonic behaviours, even when constraining the fold changes of the master regulators to a copy number gain or loss. We found that the dosage properties are linked to gene constraint and that some of these nonlinear responses are enriched for disease and GWAS genes. Overall, our study provides a straightforward and scalable method to precisely modulate gene expression and gain insights into its downstream consequences at high resolution.

">Pathogenic KIF1A variants differentially disrupt axonal trafficking and impede synaptic development</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system relies on billions of neurons connected through trillions of synapses to support a vast array of vital functions. Despite the critical importance of this synaptic network, the cellular mechanisms dictating synapse formation during human neurodevelopment remain unclear. Long-distance trafficking of synaptic components is critical for both synaptogenesis and the maintenance of synaptic function across lifespan. The microtubule motor KIF1A has a highly conserved role in the trafficking of synaptic vesicle precursors, while mutations in KIF1A are causal for the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease KIF1A-Associated Neurological Disorder (KAND). Here, we employ isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) gene-edited to express pathogenic KIF1A variants to assess how disparate mutations alter synaptic trafficking and function. We compared the effects of both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations on KIF1A motor activity. We found that both null (p.C92*) and hypoactive (p.P305L) mutations induce delayed neurite outgrowth, mislocalization of synaptic cargos, and decreased synapse density. Conversely, the hyperactive KIF1A mutation (p.R350G) supports neurite outgrowth but leads to aberrant motility of synaptic vesicle precursors along the axon. Further, live imaging reveals that hyperactive KIF1A induces deficits in the microtubule-dependent patterning of presynaptic components along the developing axon, suggesting a failure to respond to cytoskeletal cues directing cargo delivery. Functional analysis of neuronal activity via multi-electrode arrays reveals delayed synaptic maturation in loss-of-function mutations (p.P305L, p.C92*). In contrast, the hyperactive p.R350G mutation exhibits accelerated activity maturation and possible excitotoxicity. Together, these data provide insights detailing how pathogenic variants in KIF1A causative for KAND exhibit distinct effects at the molecular level that lead to significant downstream deficits in synaptic function in human neurons.

">Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal stress-related prefrontal activation in Tourette disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tics are sudden, partially controllable motor or vocal events that arise from disruptions within cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits. Within this network, converging evidence implicates the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as an important cortical node supporting voluntary tic control. This region is critical for top-down regulation and is particularly sensitive to stress, raising the possibility that molecular vulnerabilities within the DLPFC may influence the capacity to suppress tics. However, the underlying cellular and molecular architecture remains poorly defined. Methods: To address this gap, we conducted the first single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis of postmortem DLPFC tissue from men with Tourette disorder (TD) and age-matched neurotypical controls. Results: Overall cell-type proportions did not differ significantly between groups. In contrast, gene ontology analyses revealed broad upregulation of transcripts involved in protein synthesis, most prominently in microglia, oligodendrocytes, and interneurons. Among neuronal lineages, these changes were most pronounced in superficial and middle-layer pyramidal neurons and vasointestinal peptide-positive interneurons. To determine whether these alterations reflect engagement of stress-related transcriptional programs, we compared TD-associated differentially expressed genes with published single-nucleus datasets from major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Across DLPFC cell populations, and especially within pyramidal neurons and interneurons, we observed significant enrichment for stress-associated gene signatures, including glucocorticoid-responsive transcripts and immediate early genes. Conclusion: Together, these findings identify the DLPFC in TD as a region of heightened stress responsivity and altered excitatory-inhibitory dynamics, offering new insight into cortical mechanisms that may constrain tic suppression.

">A glucocorticoid-responsive polygenic signature in the anterior cingulate cortex moderates the association of early-life adversity and vulnerability for depression</a></h4>

              
                Stress exposure is a major risk factor for psychopathology, yet how stress mediators shape long-term psychiatric vulnerability in humans remains unclear. Glucocorticoids, central effectors of the stress response, regulate gene expression through tissue-specific transcriptional programs, suggesting that glucocorticoid-responsive networks may shape sensitivity to adversity. Using RNA-sequencing following chronic glucocorticoid exposure in a non-human primate model, we identified a gene co-expression network specific to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that was highly preserved across human post-mortem brain datasets relevant to depression. We derived an expression-based polygenic score (ePGS) reflecting genetic variation in network activity and tested its interaction with adversity in the UK Biobank. The ACC-specific glucocorticoid-responsive ePGS moderated the association between adversity and depressive symptoms in adult females, with the strongest effects for early-life adversity. Network genes were enriched for neurodevelopmental processes and showed stronger co-expression during childhood, highlighting a developmentally sensitive, region-specific mechanism linking stress exposure to depression risk.

">Disrupted cortex-wide dynamics impair motor planning in Shank3-mutant mice</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated cortical activity underlies voluntary movement planning, yet its disruption is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Mutations in the SHANK3 gene, a key ASD risk factor, affect synaptic integrity and cortical network function, but their impact on preparatory cortical dynamics remains unclear. Here, we employed wide-field calcium imaging combined with motion tracking and computational motif analysis to examine cortex-wide activity in Shank3b+/- mice during spontaneous forepaw movements. We found reduced correlation between cortical activity and behavior preceding movement onset, alongside decreased expression of specific cortical motifs involving associative and motor areas. These changes contributed to global functional hyperconnectivity and impaired motor planning. Our findings reveal that disrupted spatiotemporal cortical dynamics in Shank3b+/- mice impair preparatory motor processes, providing insight into neural mechanisms underlying ASD-related motor deficits.

">Neurophysiological excitation/inhibition imbalance in young adults burdened with childhood interpersonal trauma</a></h4>

              
                Adverse childhood experiences, such as violence, abuse, and neglect, are increasingly recognized as significant modifiers of brain development. Here, we tested whether adults with histories of childhood trauma, but without psychiatric comorbidities exhibit altered excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, as indicated by electroencephalography (EEG) signatures. Participants, divided into low-trauma and high-trauma groups, underwent two experimental conditions: eyes-closed resting-state recording and a reaction-time task with visual stimuli. From these data, we computed 1/f spectral slopes, a widely used electrophysiological marker of E/I balance; we complemented these analyses with a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) microcircuit model combined with a biophysically grounded forward-modeling approach to simulate realistic brain signals and derive E/I balance estimates. Group comparisons for both slopes and E/I estimates revealed significant resting-state differences, characterized by a shift toward increased neuronal excitation in the high-trauma group. The high-trauma group exhibited altered stimulus-related 1/f slope dynamics relative to the pre-stimulus baseline, reflecting attenuated neuronal inhibition. E/I ratio measures were not significantly correlated with participants' transient affective states. Together, these findings suggest that childhood trauma is associated with enduring, trait-like alterations in cortical E/I balance that extend beyond affective state and manifest across both resting and task-related brain dynamics.

">2-AG as a potential biomarker for predicting response to short-term fluoxetine treatment in a mouse model of depression</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric condition with significant individual and social impact and marked variability in treatment response. Identifying biomarkers that predict antidepressant efficacy remains a major challenge, and metabolomic approaches offer a powerful tool to uncover biochemical changes associated with depression and treatment outcome. The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are key brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of MDD and antidepressant response. Fluoxetine, one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants, influences not only serotonergic signaling but also the endocannabinoid system. Accordingly, evaluating endocannabinoid levels in these brain regions might provide critical insight into their contribution to mood disorders and the effect of fluoxetine. To identify biomarkers associated with early antidepressant response, male mice were exposed for 5 weeks to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) protocol, with fluoxetine treatment administered during the final week. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of hippocampal and prefrontal cortex samples revealed that the depression-like phenotype induced by UCMS was associated with increased hippocampal anandamide (AEA) levels. Behavioral improvement following short-term fluoxetine treatment was accompanied by enhanced hippocampal 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which was associated with reduced GABA and glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that increased 2-AG levels may serve as a predictor of early response to fluoxetine.

">Alterations in amygdala function explain how aging and loneliness impair trust learning</a></h4>

              
                Functional relationships are essential for healthy aging and they rely on social cognition skills such as establishing and monitoring whom to trust. However, aging and loneliness can negatively affect social brain function, potentially leading to a vicious cycle. Using functional MRI and computational modeling we investigated trust learning in a sample of neurotypical older (64-84 years, n=29f/23m) compared to younger adults (20-33 years, n=31f/31m). Older participants displayed lower initial trust and less trust learning when repeatedly interacting with a trustworthy and an untrustworthy trustee. Their basolateral and central amygdala activation was lower during trust decisions, and this was associated with less optimal trust behavior. Computational modeling also revealed that a crucial learning parameter, trust prediction error precision, was decoupled from basolateral amygdala activation, and this effect was pronounced in lonely older adults. These findings indicate that differences in amygdala function and reward signaling at older age and higher loneliness could drive detrimental effects on trust learning, leading to poorer social cognition and putting individuals' sociality and well-being at risk.

">Lightweight Adaptive and Recoverable Implants (LARI) for Chronic Single and Dual Neuropixels 2.0 Recordings for Naturalistic Behaviors in Feature-Rich Environments</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic decision-making requires chronic, high-quality neural recordings from distributed brain regions in freely behaving animals. However, existing silicon probe implants for mice are limited by weight, fragility, lack of independent probe adjustment, and poor suitability for long-term recordings in complex environments. Here we introduce LARI-1.0 (Lightweight Adjustable and Reusable Implant) and LARI-mini, two Neuropixels 2.0 implant systems designed for stable, recoverable, and independently adjustable single- and dual-probe recordings in mice. LARI-1.0 enables independent vertical and lateral positioning of two probes, while LARI-mini provides a lighter single-probe alternative, reducing implant mass by ~20%. Fully assembled weights of ~2.3 g (LARI-1.0) and ~1.5 g (LARI-mini) remain within 10% and 7.5% of adult male mouse body weight, respectively. We validated implant performance in a custom feature-rich naturalistic foraging environment that elicited full-body movements, rapid elevation changes, and ethological foraging behaviors across fed, fasted, and high-fat diet states. Both implants exhibited excellent mechanical stability, minimal motion-related artifacts, and probe drift comparable to previous studies. High-quality single-unit activity with stable waveform features, 5-6 fold signal-to-noise ratios, and no systematic loss of well-isolated units was maintained for up to 180 days. These results demonstrate that LARI-1.0 and LARI-mini provide lightweight, durable, and customizable implant solutions enabling long-term, high-fidelity neural recordings during naturalistic behavior.

">Early-Stage Corticostriatal Circuit Hyperactivity Impairs Cholinergic Function and Cognitive Flexibility in an Alzheimer's Model</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility deficits are a hallmark of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the 5xFAD mouse model of AD neuropathology exhibited early deficits in instrumental reversal learning, indicating cognitive inflexibility preceding spatial memory deficits. This impairment was associated with excessive neuronal reactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS), key regions for goal-directed behavior. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that mPFC neurons in young 5xFAD mice were hyperexcitable and received elevated excitatory input. Moreover, the mPFC-to-direct pathway medium spiny neuron (dMSN) circuit and the dMSNs themselves were selectively hyperactive. These hyperactive dMSNs exerted increased inhibitory control over cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the DMS, coinciding with reduced CIN firing and diminished striatal acetylcholine (ACh) release. Critically, sustained chemogenetic inhibition of the mPFC-to-DMS circuit in 5xFAD mice reduced cortical A{beta} accumulation, normalized glutamatergic transmission in both the mPFC and DMS, restored striatal ACh levels, and rescued reversal learning deficits. Together, these findings identify a hyperactive mPFC-to-DMS circuit that disrupts corticostriatal and cholinergic signaling, contributing to cognitive inflexibility in 5xFAD mice. Targeting this circuit may offer a therapeutic strategy to preserve cognitive function in the early stages of AD.

                The term generative model is widely used in human neuroimaging; however, its meaning is often left implicit. Prompted by observations and discussions at the 2025 Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Annual Meeting, we surveyed members of the neuroimaging community to examine how generative models are defined, used, and evaluated in practice. Responses revealed some agreement on functional criteria--such as a model's ability to simulate data--alongside marked disagreement about whether specific, widely used methods should be considered generative models. Evaluative priorities also varied across respondents, though out-of-sample generalization and interpretability were consistently emphasized. Rather than proposing a single definition, this perspective highlights the diversity of current usage and argues for greater clarity when the term is invoked.

                Human genetic association studies have linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the alpha5 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to an increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and schizophrenia. We used transgenic mice expressing either the SNP rs16969968 (termed 5SNP or 5KI) or a knockout of the Chrna5 gene (5KO) to investigate the role of 5-containing nAChRs (5*nAChRs) in emotion recognition and prosocial, rescuing-like behavioral tasks. We found that 5KO mice are impaired in the recognition of a negative affective state in a familiar peer, and displayed severely altered pro-social, altruistic behaviors, eventually assaulting peers in distress. In contrast, 5KI mice exhibited normal or improved emotion recognition and increased rescuing-like behavior. Importantly, effects of 5 mutations on emotion recognition were modulated by sex. These results demonstrate the critical implication of 5*nAChRs in emotion recognition and prosocial behaviors, revealing, sex-dependent patterns of these social emotional deficits in 5KI and 5KO mice. The current study also supports the view that 5KI and 5KO may provide a valuable preclinical model of Type I (female 5KI mice), and Type II (male 5KO mice) behavioral profiles of AUD.

">NEuRT: A Transformer-Based Model for Explainable Neuronal Activity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                The study of neuronal activity is essential for understanding brain function and its alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. Advances in in vivo imaging have enabled real-time observation of neuronal dynamics, but classical statistical methods struggle to capture the complex, time-dependent interactions within neuronal networks. Machine learning offers promising solutions for analyzing high-dimensional neuronal data, yet their application in neuroscience remains limited. Here, we introduce NEuRT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model adapted for neuronal activity analysis. NEuRT leverages self-attention mechanisms to interpret complex neuronal interactions, providing insights into patterns that traditional methods may overlook. Pre-trained on the recently introduced large annotated dataset MICrONS for signal reconstruction, NeuRT demonstrates strong generalization, effectively reconstructing activity from both visual cortex two-photon and hippocampal miniature fluorescence microscopy. Built on the BERT architecture, the NEuRT model can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. We showcase its application in classifying wild-type and transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice, based on hippocampal activity, revealing group-specific features through attention map analysis. By reducing reliance on extensive labeled data, addressing a critical challenge in neuroscience, NEuRT bridges fundamental neuroscience and disease research, offering a robust framework for AI-driven and explainable neuronal activity analysis.

">Dose-dependent power and connectivity modulation of low frequency oscillations through transcranial magnetic stimulation in non-human primates.</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful non-invasive tool for safely modulating neural activity in humans. In particular, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a common target site for clinical interventions in disorders such as treatment-resistant depression. Yet, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of TMS often lack neural markers of target engagement of the DLPFC. Local field potentials (LFPs), such as prefrontal theta oscillations, have been implicated in the clinical symptoms of these disorders. However, non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in humans are limited by their spatial resolution and challenges of interpreting EEG signals. In this study, we investigate the effects of single-pulse TMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex in non-human primates on LFPs recorded through intracranial EEG. Compared to sham TMS, the intensity of active TMS pulses scaled with LFP power changes in a 1-13 Hz range at contacts close to the stimulation site in the prefrontal cortex (e.g., caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex) as well as contacts that were more distal (e.g., posterior cingulate cortex, temporal lobe). To test how TMS modulates connectivity between these regions, we conducted a phase-based connectivity analysis. TMS pulses initially enhanced and then disrupted connectivity at 1-13 Hz between the stimulation site and other contacts. Connectivity rebounded approximately 1500 ms post-stimulation. Only the initial enhancement in connectivity scaled with TMS intensity. Our results demonstrate a dose-dependent power modulation of low frequency LFPs across prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortical regions by single pulses. Furthermore, they show that TMS applied over the left prefrontal cortex can enhance and interrupt short- and long-range connectivity. Our study advances the understanding of the effects of TMS on brain oscillations and connectivity with direct relevance for clinical applications in neuromodulation therapies.

">Dual Engram Architecture within a Single Striatal Cell Type Distinctly Controls Alcohol Relapse and Extinction</a></h4>

              
                Relapse is a major obstacle in the treatment of alcohol and drug addiction and is thought to be driven by persistent drug-associated memories formed during their use. Behavioral therapies such as extinction training can reduce relapse and are proposed to work by creating a competing memory trace. However, where and how these opposing memories are stored in the brain is unknown. Here, we show that two anatomically and functionally distinct engram ensembles within the same genetically defined striatal cell type, direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs), encode these opposing memories. Using engram-tagging tools in mice, we found that the acquisition of operant alcohol learning recruits a dMSN ensemble enriched in the striatal matrix compartment that stores alcohol-associated memories and whose activation selectively promotes relapse. Conversely, extinction of alcohol seeking recruits a dMSN ensemble enriched in the striosome compartment that stores extinction-related memories and whose activation suppresses relapse. Furthermore, we reveal that the physical memory trace storing the relapse-promoting memory is embedded within persistently strengthened corticostriatal synapses engaged during learning, and that artificially reproducing this plasticity is sufficient to trigger relapse-like behavior. These findings uncover a dual-engram architecture within dMSNs that governs relapse and extinction, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how competing memories regulate drug-seeking behavior.

">Minimally verbal children with autism may see the global, but point local: A behavioral and eye-tracking study in visual perceptual processing</a></h4>

              
                Recent work suggests that pointing based assessments may underestimate or mischaracterize perceptual and cognitive abilities in minimally verbal autism (mvASD). Extending this line of work, we address the classic global local question by testing whether mvASD children access global visual structur and whether it is consistently expressed in behavior using Kanizsa illusory contours (KIC) and circular colinear contours (CC). Typically developing (TD) and mvASD children viewed KIC and CC stimuli on a touchscreen while spontaneous eye gaze and pointing were recorded. Participants also completed a goal directed drag and drop matching task that required selecting the solid shape corresponding to the global KIC configuration. In spontaneous responses, mvASD children were more drawn to local elements (e.g., individual inducers, the CC frame, single Gabors) and showed less centralized responding than TD peers. Notably, CC pointing was often anchored to one half of the contour regardless of contour screen location, suggesting object centered global selection. Also, in the drag and drop task, approx. 90% of mvASD participants performed above chance in at least one condition and half performed at ceiling, demonstrating accurate global matching. These findings suggest that global structure is available in mvASD but may be underweighted in spontaneous response selection under ambiguity, consistent with the Affordance Competition Hypothesis and ambiguity resolution accounts.

">Pupil size reflects moment-to-moment fluctuations in mental imagery, but not (or hardly) individual differences in imagery</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has shown that the eyes' pupils are larger when imaging dark as compared to bright objects or scenes. Based on this, it has been claimed that pupil size is a sensitive marker of mental-imagery vividness. We investigated this claim in three experiments, conducted in two countries (Norway and The Netherlands; Ntotal = 115), in which participants read, listened, or freely imagined stories that evoked a sense of darkness or brightness. In addition, participants rated their imagery vividness after each story, as a measure of moment-to-moment fluctuations in imagery; and their imagery vividness in general, as a measure of individual differences in imagery. Overall, we found that darkness-evoking stories induced larger pupils than brightness-evoking stories, although this effect was highly variable and only statistically reliable for longer (> 1 min) audio stories. Importantly, we consistently found that this pupil-size difference (dark - bright) was largest for vividly imagined stories. Finally, we did not find any relationship between this pupil-size difference and individual differences in general in imagery. We conclude that the strength of pupil-size changes in response to imagined darkness or brightness reflects moment-to-moment fluctuations in imagery vividness within an individual rather than individual differences in imagery vividness as a personal trait.

">Motor Intention Drives Corticospinal Facilitation during Interception Planning</a></h4>

              
                Intercepting a moving target requires integrating visual motion information with motor preparation, yet how action intention and gaze strategy jointly shape corticospinal excitability during interception planning remains unclear. We applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex to probe corticospinal excitability while participants either prepared to intercept a moving target or passively viewed its motion. Targets moved at one of two speeds, and participants judged target speed relative to a reference after each trial. Across blocks, participants were instructed to either smoothly pursue the target or fixate their eyes on the interception zone. Motor-evoked potentials were elicited at baseline, after task instruction, early during target motion, or shortly before target arrival. Task goal and gaze strategy interacted to influence both perceptual judgments and corticospinal excitability. Passive viewing led to overestimation of target speed and was associated with sustained suppression of corticospinal excitability, particularly during fixation. In contrast, preparing to intercept produced a robust facilitation of corticospinal excitability immediately before movement onset, regardless of gaze strategy. Smooth pursuit improved perceptual accuracy and reduced interception timing error compared with fixation but did not independently influence corticospinal facilitation. These findings demonstrate that the intention to act is the primary determinant of the transition from corticospinal suppression to facilitation during interception planning, whereas eye movements modulate perceptual estimates and support behavioral performance.

">An engineered nanobody inhibitor for molecular-to-circuit control of opioid receptor function</a></h4>

              
                Opioid receptors (ORs) orchestrate pain relief, reward, and dependence, yet their signaling arises from diverse cell types and subcellular compartments that cannot be selectively interrogated with existing pharmacological or genetic approaches. Single-domain antibodies, or nanobodies (Nbs), can probe receptor states, but their potential as tools for controlling native receptor signaling at the system level has remained unexplored. Here, we engineer a suite of high-affinity intracellular Nbs that bind active ORs through structure-guided evolution and in silico design. Iterative optimization yields Nb64, a potent inhibitor that rapidly suppresses transducer engagement, receptor internalization, and downstream signaling, including endogenous pathways in neuronal cells. Organelle targeting highlights Nb64's capacity to control OR activity with subcellular precision, while bio-reversible cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) conjugation enables non-genetic cytosolic delivery. Cell-type-specific expression of Nb64 in VTA interneurons attenuates fentanyl-evoked dopamine release and behavioral responses in mice, demonstrating targeted control of opioid actions in vivo. Nb64 provides a versatile strategy for dissecting OR biology and establishes a generalizable framework for precision inhibition of native GPCR signaling in vivo.

">Distinct roles of the human cuneiform and pedunculopontine nuclei in gait initiation and freezing of gait</a></h4>

              
                Freezing of gait in Parkinson disease (PD) is a major cause of disability, often resistant to dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Its underlying mechanisms remain unclear, mainly because the roles of the human mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) nuclei are not well understood. Here, we combined rare local field potentials (LFP) recordings from the cuneiform (CuN) and pedunculopontine nuclei (PPN) with biomechanical markers of gait initiation (GI) in four PD patients. We identified functional differences: increases in CuN alpha-band activity precede anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) and correlate with the rhythm of upcoming steps, whereas decreases in PPN beta-band activity occur during APA just before the lead foot lifts off. Imminent freezing is characterized by a breakdown of this organization, marked by mistimed alpha-band surges across the MLR and abnormal PPN beta-band modulation. CuN stimulation selectively improved the stepping rhythm, while PPN stimulation worsened pace or forward vigor. Furthermore, exaggerated mesencephalic alpha-band power was associated with poor clinical responses. These results clarify the individual roles of MLR nuclei in human locomotion and identify pathological alpha dynamics as a biomarker for advancing adaptive neurostimulation.

">Cross-brain transfer of high-performance intracortical speech and handwriting BCIs</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode complex movements, such as handwriting and speech, can require substantial training data to achieve high performance. We investigated whether leveraging the neural activity recordings of previous users could reduce this initial data collection burden for new BCI users (an approach we call "cross-brain transfer"). Using intracortical recordings from five BrainGate2 clinical trial participants, we tested cross-brain transfer for both speech and handwriting neural decoders trained and evaluated on general, unconstrained corpora of spoken and written English. We found that cross-brain transfer improved decoding performance when training data from the target user was limited (< 200 sentences), and that dataset-specific input layers to the decoder were critical for combining data across users. Without trainable input layers, transfer failed and performed worse than training from scratch on target user data only. Finally, we measured the effectiveness of cross-brain transfer relative to training with (1) more data from the same user and (2) more electrode-permuted data from the same user, which simulates sampling from another brain with identical neural latent structure. In some cases (T16 speech, T12 handwriting), cross-brain transfer appeared as effective as additional permuted data from the same user, while in others (T12 speech, T15 speech) electrode-permuted data was more beneficial. Our results successfully demonstrate and characterize cross-brain transfer learning between multiple intracortical BCI users, for both speech and handwriting, using a general open-ended dataset not restricted to small sets of words or phrases. This work highlights a promising path towards addressing a key barrier to the clinical translation of BCIs, while clarifying when cross-brain transfer may be most beneficial and the decoder design choices needed to realize those gains.

">Time Cells in the Human Brain Support Working Memory Maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM), the active retention of information over short periods, is a fundamental cognitive function, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In rodents, cue-selective "time cells" fire at specific timepoints after a WM memory cue, collectively forming sequences that encode cue-memory and elapsed time, providing a temporal code for maintaining information across time intervals. Whether similar dynamics support WM in the human brain is unknown. Here, we analyzed intracranial single-neuron recordings from medial frontal and medial temporal regions of patients performing a WM task. We found time cells with temporally tuned activation during WM maintenance, collectively forming robust sequences that tiled a delay period. Time-cell coordination in the hippocampus predicted successful WM maintenance, whereas in the pre-supplementary motor area it reflected memory load. Furthermore, we identified distributed cue-selective time cells that encoded both the identity of a memorandum and elapsed maintenance time, providing a temporally structured mnemonic code that complements persistent firing of concept cells. Together, these findings establish time-cell sequences as a conserved neural mechanism supporting human working memory.

">The order, but not the structure, of cross-domain learning influences memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Everyday activities often require learning sequences that necessitate the involvement of both the declarative and the procedural memory domains. Previous research has shown that a learning structure that is common across tasks from different domains can improve learning and resistance to interference. However, it remains unknown whether such shared learning structure can enhance longer-term memory retention. To address this question, forty-eight healthy adults participated in a pre-registered study in which they learned both an object sequence task (declarative learning) and a motor sequence task (procedural learning) in two separate sessions separated by 4h. Participants were assigned to either an associated group, where the two tasks shared a common learning structure - that consisted of a specific mapping between finger movements and object categories across learning sessions - or an unassociated group with no such cross-domain shared structure. Memory retention was assessed with a 24h retest session on both tasks. Contrary to our predictions, a shared higher-order structure between tasks from different domains did not enhance memory retention. Exploratory follow-up analyses revealed that the order the tasks were learned (i.e., object or motor first), rather than their structural overlap, influenced performance. Specifically, learning the motor task before the object task impaired the consolidation of the object task irrespective of whether the tasks shared a common learning structure or not. This effect was unidirectional as learning the object task before the motor task had no effect on the consolidation of the motor task. Altogether, the current findings suggest that the order of cross-domain learning experiences rather than their structure influences memory consolidation.

">Mapping memory-guided saccade population receptive fields reveals principles of cortical organization along the human intraparietal sulcus</a></h4>

              
                The intraparietal sulcus is a central hub for motor planning and sensorimotor integration. Its responses are known to support coordinate transformations across reference frames and modalities for example, eye position gain fields that convert retinotopic, fovea centred signals into head centred representations. In the oculomotor domain, the human intraparietal sulcus is sensitive to eye movement planning and has been extensively studied using memory-guided saccade paradigms. These classic approaches have revealed topographic organization and contralateral sensitivity for preferred direction in saccade planning and execution. However, such designs provide detailed information about preferred direction; they do not probe tuning width: how narrowly or broadly a given cortical location responds around its preferred direction. At present, it remains unclear whether and how tuning width is organized along the human intraparietal sulcus. Critically, neurophysiological studies in non human primates do not offer systematic and extensive measurements of tuning width. Moreover, the relationship between tuning width and preferred direction at the population level in human intraparietal cortex is unknown. Here, we address these questions using a forward modelling approach combined with high field (7 Tesla) functional MRI. We observe contralateral preference for preferred direction in saccade planning and execution, as well as a novel large scale organization of preferred saccade tuning width, in vivo, in humans.

">Dynamic engagement of the motor cortex in controlling movement</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits do not contribute equally or continuously to behavior. In mice, the motor cortex can be essential or dispensable for movement in different contexts, but how it is dynamically recruited as behavioral demands evolve remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that motor cortical involvement in movement exhibits rapid, discrete state transitions even during movements that otherwise appear continuous. While robust and reproducible across animals, the timing and presence of these state transitions are highly sensitive to task structure. We find that motor cortical engagement is sustained under conditions of sensorimotor uncertainty and dissipates rapidly when sensorimotor contingencies are resolved and actions and outcomes thus become predictable. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized layer of fast-timescale flexibility in the neural control of movement and offer a conceptual framework for understanding how cortical circuits dynamically govern behavior as demands evolve.

">Predictive coding narrows the gap between convolutional networks and human brain function in misspelled-word reading</a></h4>

              
                Humans can readily recognize words even when they are misspelled, though with slower responses, demonstrating remarkable robustness in reading. The computational mechanisms underlying this combination of robustness and cost in reading remain unclear. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to model primate visual and human word processing. However, standard CNNs lack recurrent and feedback connections abundant in the ventral visual stream, which are thought to support robust vision. Here, we incorporated brain-inspired predictive coding dynamics into a CNN to investigate whether predictive coding can enhance brain-likeness in misspelled-word reading. The CNN backbone was trained to classify images of a 1000-word Finnish vocabulary (supervised), and the predictive coding modules were trained to reconstruct the activity in the previous layer (unsupervised). The model, with and without the predictive coding dynamics, was then evaluated using the same real and misspelled word stimuli presented to human participants during a magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. Predictive coding improved model performance on misspelled words, particularly reducing the accuracy gap between real and word-like misspelled words, mirroring human behavioral patterns. Furthermore, representational similarity and ridge regression analyses showed stronger correspondence between model activations and human MEG responses. These findings provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that predictive coding dynamics narrows the gap between CNN performance and human brain function in misspelled-word reading, offering a biologically plausible computational mechanism for the brain's robust reading ability.

">Autism associated mutation in Cacna1d causes perseverative behavioral phenotype in mice</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral inflexibility and perseveration are core features of autism spectrum disorder and are frequently modeled in mice using reversal learning and repetitive behavior assays. Mutations in CACNA1D, which encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.3, have been linked to autism, yet their behavioral consequences remain incompletely characterized. We examined mice carrying the autism-associated Cacna1dG407R gain-of-function mutation across a battery of assays assessing learning, flexibility, and repetitive behavior. Mutant mice learned spatial discriminations and instrumental contingencies at rates comparable to wild-type controls but exhibited deficits during reversal learning following intermediate and extended overtraining, as well as under probabilistic reinforcement. Across ethological assays, mutant mice showed increased grooming, marble burying, and nestlet shredding, consistent with enhanced perseverative behavior. Anxiety-related measures and general locomotion were largely unaffected. These results identify Cav1.3 gain-of-function as a selective regulator of behavioral flexibility and support a role for calcium-dependent corticostriatal plasticity in autism-associated perseveration.

">Striatal Acetylcholine Dip-Rebound Is Induced by Direct Pathway Neurons and Encodes Action-Outcome Contingency</a></h4>

              
                Learning contingencies between actions and outcomes is pivotal in adaptive behavior and requires ongoing flexible sensory, motor, and reward information integration. The striatum is central to the integration. However, it remains unclear how the striatal neurons interact with each other to facilitate learning. Here we show that in the dorsomedial striatum, direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs), but not dopamine (DA), inhibit cholinergic interneurons, inducing a characteristic acetylcholine (ACh) dip-rebound, encoding action-outcome (A-O) contingency. Using genetically encoded sensors and in vivo fiber photometry, we find that dMSN activation, ACh dip-rebound, and DA transients emerge only after mice acquire the contingency. dMSN activity and ACh dynamics persist even when rewards are probabilistic, adapt in time as the learned relationship between action and reward evolves, and vanish when the contingency is degraded. Ex vivo recordings and in vivo optogenetics further show that dMSN activity is both sufficient and required to generate the ACh dip-rebound through GABAergic inhibition of cholinergic interneurons. Disrupting the dip-rebound slows acquisition and accelerates extinction. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized dMSN-ACh circuit mechanism that encodes contingency during instrumental learning, operating alongside DA signals that track reward outcomes.

">KCC2 Activation Reverses Neurophysiological and Behavioral Deficits in Female Rett Mice</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from mutations in the MeCP2 gene, leading to intellectual disability, impaired motor coordination, decreased sociability, and seizures. Central to the underlying pathophysiology are deficits in synaptic inhibition, which are mediated by hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents. These events develop postnatally and are dependent upon increased neuronal Cl- extrusion mediated by SLC12A5 (KCC2). Therefore, we tested whether its activation modifies the disease phenotypes evident in female MeCP2+/- mice, using OV350, a direct activator of KCC2. OV350 rapidly induced a sustained reduction in EEG power, accompanied by a decrease in the severity of epileptic discharges. Increased motor coordination, sociability, and spatial memory were also observed. Deficits in KCC2 phosphorylation were also seen in MeCP2+/- mice, consistent with reductions in its activity that were also ameliorated by OV350. Thus, KCC2 activation may be efficacious in limiting the impact of Rett syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Substantia nigra pars reticulata regulates prefrontal cortex via ventromedial thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The ventromedial thalamus (VM) innervates layer 1 (L1) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to influence executive function and arousal. Thalamocortical (TC) cells in VM process inputs from cortex that are important for generating persistent activity in closed reciprocal loops. However, little is known about connectivity and influence of subcortical inputs to TC cells, and how they are routed through VM to circuits in the mPFC. Here we use anatomical tracing, electrophysiology, and optogenetics to investigate subcortico-thalamo-cortical circuits in mouse VM. We first characterize the morphology and physiology of TC cells in VM and determine their main subcortical input arises from substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). We then show how SNr inputs make strong inhibitory connections onto TC cells, which are mediated by GABAA receptors and effectively suppress action potential firing. Lastly, we utilize intersectional approaches to show how SNr inputs are channeled via TC cells in VM to engage specific inhibitory networks in L1 of mPFC. Together, our results indicate how subcortical inputs engage higher-order thalamus to influence the frontal cortex, highlighting differences from equivalent circuits in motor systems.

                Background Low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint experienced by pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, which can interfere with daily activities, sleep quality, and readiness for labor. Nonpharmacological approaches such as music therapy and hypnobirthing are developing as alternatives that are considered safe, inexpensive, and minimal in side effects, but the effectiveness of the combination of the two methods has not been widely studied in the context of pregnancy in Indonesia Methods This quasi-experimental study aimed to examine the effectiveness of hypnobirthing, music therapy, and their combination in alleviating LBP among third-trimester pregnant women. A total of 200 participants were divided into four groups: hypnobirthing (n=50), music therapy (n=50), a combination group (n=50), and a control group receiving standard antenatal care (n=50). The study was conducted at four Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) in Palembang City, South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. Pain levels were assessed before and after the intervention using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The statistical analyses used included the Paired Sample t-test, One-Way ANOVA, and Post hoc comparisons using Tukey HSD test for mean pain scores between the groups. Results The study showed a statistically significant reduction in LBP intensity in all the intervention groups compared to that in the control group (p < 0.001), with the combined intervention group demonstrating the greatest improvement. These findings suggest that both hypnobirthing and music therapy are effective in managing pregnancy-related LBP, and their combination may offer enhanced benefits for managing pregnancy-related LBP. Conclusions Music therapy and hypnobirthing have been proven effective in reducing lower back pain intensity in pregnant women in their third trimester, with the combination of both therapies providing the most significant effect. This study supports the inclusion of non-pharmacological approaches in routine antenatal care to improve maternal comfort and well-being.

                Background This study addresses the limited awareness of local history, low sense of patriotism, and weak participation in national activities among elementary school students. These issues are linked to conventional learning methods and the lack of innovative, technology-based media in social studies education. Methods The research aimed to develop an immersive and contextual learning medium using Augmented Reality (AR) to foster students’ nationalism through the local history of the Rawa Gede Monument in Karawang, Indonesia. A Research and Development (R&D) design was applied using the ADDIE model, which includes five stages: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. Participants consisted of 126 fifth-grade students from five public elementary schools in four subdistricts of Karawang Regency. Data were collected through classroom observations, nationalism attitude scales, questionnaires, and interviews with students and teachers. Results The AR-based media, titled Rawa Gede History AR, was developed to integrate local historical content with interactive 3D visualizations. Expert validation indicated that the media was valid, practical, and feasible for classroom use. The implementation phase involved limited and broader field testing to evaluate effectiveness. Statistical analysis of pre-test and post-test results yielded a significance value of 0.001 (p < 0.05), showing a significant improvement in students’ nationalism after using the AR media. Observations and interviews further confirmed increased engagement, enthusiasm, and understanding of local history. Conclusions The findings suggest that integrating AR technology with local historical content enhances learning engagement and contextual understanding while strengthening students’ sense of national identity. Overall, Rawa Gede History AR serves as a validated, effective, and practical innovation for promoting nationalism and meaningful social studies learning in elementary schools.

                The web of power in the struggle for forest resources arose as a response to forest resource conflicts between the state and local communities. In Foucault’s concept, power was not held solely by the state but existed in social relations involving various parties. This study aimed to map the web of power in the struggle for access rights to forest resources. It used a qualitative approach and a comparative case study method. The informants for this study were local governments, forest managers, local communities, and NGOs. Ten informants were selected purposively in each location. Data collection techniques were observation, in-depth interviews, and literature studies. Data analysis was carried out using thematic analysis. The study results showed that in Mount Halimun Salak National Park (TNGHS), conflict occurred due to the policy of expanding the national park, resulting in the loss of local community access to the forest area. Meanwhile, in Sungai Utik, the conflict was triggered by a state policy that issued a business permit to use forest products (IUPHHK) in the customary forest area. Although the IUPHHK has never been revoked, the power relations have shown a more egalitarian pattern based on the state’s recognition and the community’s solidarity. The findings indicated that contestation over access rights to forest resources in two different forests had resulted in two distinct webs of power models. Power relations were not static, but constantly changed depending on the configuration of local communities’ political power, legal support, advocacy networks, and social capital.

                Introductıon The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of apocynin in a selenite-induced cataract model, and to evaluate its impact on cataract severity and antioxidant enzyme activities. Methods Thirty-five rats were randomly separated into five groups (n = 7 per group). The control group received only saline. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were administered sodium selenite at a dose of 30 nmol/g. In addition, Group 2 received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Group 3 received 10 mg/kg apocynin, and Group 4 received 20 mg/kg apocynin. The apocynin treatment was administered intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. Results Low-dose apocynin was seen to enhance antioxidant defence by increasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) levels (p = 0.003, p = 0.002) without altering malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (p = 0.04). High-dose apocynin (20 mg/kg) led to an increase in MDA, suggesting a possible dose-related pro-oxidant effect. Conclusion This study suggests that apocynin, particularly at a low dose (10 mg/kg), may prevent selenite-induced cataract formation. Low-dose apocynin effectively delayed cataract progression by enhancing antioxidant defence and limiting oxidative stress. In contrast, high-dose exposure revealed a possible pro-oxidant effect, highlighting the need for careful dose optimization.

                Financial networks, and neural architectures—generate nonstationary, heavy-tailed, and highly irregular time series that are poorly captured by classical statistical summaries. Conventional performance metrics like mean latency and throughput often fail to reveal early-warning signatures of systemic stress or impending failure. There is a growing need for scale-aware analytical tools that can capture hidden structure in consensus dynamics and network perturbations. We develop an end-to-end statistical framework that treats consensus protocols as high-dimensional discrete-time dynamical systems subject to stochastic latency and failure processes. Using a Python-based discrete-event simulator implementing the Raft consensus algorithm, we generate time series of consensus latency, message complexity, and network latency under multiple operational regimes (normal load, high load, denial-of-service–type attacks, and partial node failures). We then apply Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to these time series, deriving generalized Hurst exponents, singularity spectra f(α), and spectrum width Δα as multifractal descriptors. Synthetic results are complemented with an analysis of block chain-style data based on block inter-arrival and propagation times. Across all simulated regimes, consensus latency exhibits nontrivial multifractal structure with finite spectrum width Δα. Stress scenarios driven by heavy-tailed latency and node failures produce substantially broader and more left-skewed spectra than baseline conditions, indicating richer intermittency and clustered extremes. We find a strong positive association between Δα and mean consensus latency, and a moderate association between Δα and failure incidence. Comparative analysis of Raft-like traces and proof-of-work–style traces shows that multifractal spectra retain algorithm-specific signatures while sharing common stress-induced broadening. The findings support the view that multifractal descriptors offer a sensitive, scale-aware complement to traditional performance metrics for distributed consensus systems. Spectrum width Δα acts as a quantitative indicator of systemic complexity and can serve as an early-warning marker for performance degradation and partial instability. The proposed framework bridges chaos theory, multifractal analysis, and consensus protocols and suggests practical pathways for integrating multifractal monitoring into the design, diagnosis, and control of big-data, block chain, and cyber-physical infrastructures.

                Background There is urgent need for comprehensive climate change policies to mitigate impacts and protect the interests of those most vulnerable to its worst effects. The Labour Government has rejected its own 2021 £28bn annual investment in climate change policies on account of commitment to economic restraint and public opinion. Not only does this pose real risks to the UK’s ability to respond to climate change, it may also reduce a range of social and economic benefits. Methods We report findings of innovative mixed-methods survey analysis of public perceptions of an illustrative Green New Deal within three surveys (1) n=693; 2) n=10; 3) n=2,200) of adult UK residents conducted between November 2023-January 2024. Results We analyse the findings of survey 3 to show that levels of support for a Green New Deal are high across parties and demographic groups, and increase further when voters are presented with narrative justifications adversarially co-produced with opponents – termed ‘haters’ – of the policy. We find clear associations between risk of destitution and various other socioeconomic characteristics, health status and levels of support. We present innovative Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) of these associations and find moderately strong positive correlations with levels of support for key infrastructural policies. Conclusions This article presents further evidence in support of the notion that exposure to risk of destitution, which varies by age, is a key determinant of policy preference at a time in which political affiliation is increasingly fluid and the prima facie need for a Green New Deal is considerable. This suggests that, in order to understand preferences and to present responses to challenges, there is good reason to focus on material outcomes. Given the importance of a Green New Deal to enhancing financial security, progressive politicians have every reason to commit to substantive reform.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Immunothrombosis contributes to ischemic stroke pathophysiology through neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, which promotes thrombus stabilization and microvascular dysfunction. DNase1 is the principal endonuclease responsible for NET degradation. The rs1053874 polymorphism in DNase1 gene influences enzymatic activity and protein stability in vitro, but its clinical relevance in ischemic stroke remains unexplored. We investigated whether this variant modulates systemic NET burden and impacts stroke-related outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective observational cohort study including 492 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Genotyping of rs1053874 was performed via Sanger sequencing and categorized into AA versus GG + GA genotypes (dominant model). Clinical variables, NET biomarkers (elastase, myeloperoxidase [MPO], and dsDNA), DNAse1 activity, infarct volume, thrombectomy metrics, and survival were assessed. Multivariable regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore associations between genotype and outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AA genotype carriers (7.9%) had a significantly lower burden of prior vascular events compared to GG + GA carriers. At admission, they exhibited higher DNAse1 activity, reduced levels of circulating NET markers (elastase, MPO, and dsDNA), and lower neutrophil and monocyte counts. Despite similar initial stroke severity, AA carriers required fewer thrombectomy passes and had significantly better early neurological recovery and smaller infarcts. In adjusted models, both the AA genotype and dyslipidemia were independently associated with improved long-term survival. However, stratified analyses revealed the most robust survival benefit among AA carriers without dyslipidemia. No significant interaction was observed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DNase1 rs1053874 polymorphism influences NET-related inflammation and is associated with improved vascular profile, procedural efficiency, and long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke. These findings support the potential of DNase1 as a therapeutic and prognostic target in personalized stroke care. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Background Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for financial stability, and sector-specific Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI-ML) models have proven superior in performance. However, a significant gap exists, as most models are designed for advanced economies, leaving their efficacy in emerging markets like India unexplored. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the applicability of these advanced models to predict bankruptcy within India’s dynamic trade services sector. Methods The research utilized a substantial sample of 5,527 Indian companies. To counter the challenge of having far fewer bankrupt firms than solvent ones, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed. The study then leveraged a comprehensive suite of eight popular AI-ML models, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, with performance rigorously evaluated using repeated k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and guard against overfitting. To add practical context, business rules based on key financial metrics—liquidity, profitability, and asset size—were integrated. Results The findings robustly demonstrate that AI-ML models can accurately predict bankruptcy in Indian trade services firms. A critical discovery was the variation in early warning signals between an analysis of the entire dataset (aggregate) and segmented groups of companies. This indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach obscures important, segment-specific risk factors. The segmented analysis successfully uncovered hidden risks that were not apparent at the aggregate level. Conclusions The study concludes that AI-ML models are highly effective for bankruptcy prediction in India’s trade services sector. For stakeholders like investors and creditors, the key takeaway is the superior value of a segmented analytical approach. This strategy maintains high predictive accuracy while revealing nuanced, specific risks. Ultimately, it provides a powerful, tailored tool for safeguarding financial interests in an emerging market context.

                Background Accurate forecasting of agricultural commodity prices is crucial for maintaining economic stability and informing data-driven policy interventions in emerging economies, such as India. Price volatility in key spices, such as pepper and turmeric, can significantly impact producers, consumers, and market stakeholders, underscoring the need for robust predictive models that capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies. Methods This study develops an integrated forecasting framework that combines Machine Learning (Random Forest), Deep Learning (LSTM), and Econometric (VECM) approaches to analyse the dynamic behaviour of Indian pepper and turmeric prices. The models incorporate major macroeconomic determinants, including GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI), exchange rate, gold price, interest rate, trade volume, and foreign institutional investments (FII), to capture both non-linear and long-term relationships. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and symmetric MAPE (sMAPE) metrics, alongside SHAP-based feature explainability analysis. Results The findings reveal that Random Forest delivers the most robust predictive accuracy overall, especially for Turmeric, while LSTM achieves slightly lower forecast errors for Pepper. Both machine-learning models substantially outperform the VECM in short-term price forecasts. Feature importance and SHAP analyses identified NIFTY50, GDP, CPI, exchange rate, interest rate and gold prices as key drivers of spice price movements. Conclusions Integrating machine learning, deep learning, and econometric models enhances the robustness and interpretability of commodity price forecasting. The study provides empirical evidence that macroeconomic variables significantly influence spice price dynamics, offering a hybrid framework that can support policymakers, traders, and researchers in mitigating market risks and designing more effective agricultural price stabilisation strategies.

                Habits of mind have increasingly been recognized as foundational dispositions for developing 21st-century skills and supporting sustainability-oriented education. This study presents a systematic literature review combined with bibliometric analysis to map the intellectual structure, research trends, and thematic evolution of habits of mind in educational research, with particular attention to sustainability and Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation). A Scopus-based dataset of peer-reviewed publications published between 2010 and 2025 was analyzed using co-authorship, co-citation, and keyword co-occurrence techniques implemented in VOSviewer. The analysis identifies dominant research clusters related to critical thinking, STEM education, teacher education, and sustainability-oriented learning, as well as leading authors, journals, and countries contributing to the field. While sustainability-related themes are increasingly visible, explicit connections between habits of mind and SDG 6 related educational issues remain limited and unevenly distributed, particularly in the Indonesian context. The findings highlight underexplored research areas and reveal opportunities for strengthening the integration of cognitive dispositions, sustainability education, and water sanitation awareness through culturally responsive educational strategies. This study contributes by providing a structured overview of the field and clarifying research gaps to guide future educational research and policy aligned with SDG 6.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-48/v1?src=rss">Software Tools for Passive Acoustic Monitoring in Aquatic and Terrestrial Bio- and Ecoacoustics: A Living Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for understanding species trends and their responses to anthropogenic change. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers a scalable, non-invasive approach to capture ecological information across large spatial and temporal scales. However, it generates vast amounts of audio recordings, whose management and analysis present technical challenges. To support diverse user needs in ecoacoustic research, a growing number of software tools have emerged, but the landscape remains fragmented and difficult to navigate. We provide a systematic overview of software tools used for soundscape assessment across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. We screened peer-reviewed literature and complemented it with database cross-checking to identify and categorize tools according to four PAM data workflow components: data management, signal pre-processing, visualisation and navigation, and acoustic analysis. We found 221 available tools of which 174 were explicitly designed for PAM. Most tools were freely accessible (83%) with only a smaller fraction being commercial (12%) or limited access (5%). Terrestrial research accounted for most software mentions (476 studies), followed by aquatic (319) and cross-realm (64) studies. Nearly half (45%) were package-based frameworks within R, Python, or MATLAB. Acoustic analysis was the most represented workflow component, while only 40 tools covered all four of them. This diversity illustrates the field’s rapid technical growth but also its redundancy and methodological fragmentation: to date, many tools target only a subset of workflow components and replicate similar functionalities. Despite this, the prevalence of PAM-dedicated software indicates increasing specialization and technical maturity within ecoacoustics. Our structured inventory underscores the need for greater collaboration and continuity in software development, promoting the improvement and accessibility of existing tools rather than further proliferation. This living systematic review, provides a practical, biannually updated reference for tool selection and fosters transparency, comparability, and cooperation across bioacoustic and ecoacoustic research communities.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to descriptively characterize and explore the differences in the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20-40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the descriptive relationship between the relative abundance of periodontopathogens and nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was isolated and pooled in equimolar quantities from all individuals within each group to create three pooled libraries: type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3). Sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity were measured using bioinformatic methods, and all analyses of sequencing data were strictly descriptive and exploratory. Salivary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured on individual, un-pooled samples. Results The salivary microbiota among people with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease (G2; G3) was observed to have greater bacterial diversity and abundance than that of patients without periodontal disease (G1), according to descriptive alpha-diversity analysis. The G3 group exhibited the largest relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key periodontopathogen. Descriptive analysis also suggested that periodontopathic bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria have different community structures across the groups. Furthermore, comparison of individual salivary samples showed that nitrite/nitrate concentration was significantly lower in the G3 group compared to the G1 group (p< 0.05). Results reveal that the inverse interaction between increased P. gingivalis and decreased nitrate-reducing bacteria serves as a descriptive hallmark for periodontal disease progression in the T2DM population. Conclusion Results of this exploratory study suggest that the relationship between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in the salivary microbiome varies among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis. These distinct microbial features observed may be microbiological characteristics associated with the progression of periodontal disease in this population, warranting further validation as potential indicators for early management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-927/v3?src=rss">StaggR: an interactive R/Shiny application for planning and visualizing staggered experimental protocols [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for parallelized execution of identical processing workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental schedules, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.

                Background Smoking remains a major public health problem, particularly among Tunisian health students, with a prevalence of 26%. Assessing motivation to quit smoking requires tools that have been validated in the local language. This study aimed to translate and validate the psychometric properties of the Motivation to Quit Smoking Questionnaire (Q-MAT) into Arabic. Method A cross-sectional methodological study was conducted among 203 smoking health science students in March 2022. The cross-cultural validation process followed Vallerand’s seven steps, including translation/back-translation, expert panel review, pre-testing, and psychometric analyses. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and temporal stability (test-retest). Content validity was measured by the CVI index, and construct validity by exploratory factor analysis. Results The sample included 197 students (mean age: 18.95±1.07 years, sex ratio: 0.89). The Arabic Q-MAT demonstrated excellent reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.840, a test-retest correlation of 0.831, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.886. Content validity was satisfactory (CVI = 0.89). Principal component analysis revealed that two factors explained 89.148% of the total variance. Conclusions This initial validation of the Q-MAT in literary Arabic provides a reliable and valid tool for assessing motivation to quit smoking among Arabic-speaking populations, facilitating the development of targeted public health interventions.

                Background Research misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of research misconduct (KoRM) level in this population is lacking. This brief report assessed KoRM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey (i.e. ; Laval University quiz) with 11 questions on KoRM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoRM. Results The mean±SD KoRM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoRM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoRM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoRM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). Conclusion North-African PGDSs have a low-level of KoRM. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoRM in this population.

                Background Every day we are faced with different treatment claims, in the news, in social media, and by our family and friends. Some of these claims are true, but many are unsubstantiated. Without being supported by reliable evidence such guidance can lead to waste and harmful health choices. The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Network facilitates development of interventions for teaching children and adults the ability to assess treatment claims (informedhealthchoices.org). Our objective was to develop and evaluate a new assessment tool developed from the item bank for use in an upcoming trial of lower secondary school resources in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluating a questionnaire including two item-sets was used. The first evaluated ability using multiple-choice questions (scored dichotomously) and the other evaluated intended behaviour and self-efficacy (measured using Likert scales). This study was conducted in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda in 2021. We recruited children (over 12 years old) and adults through schools and our networks. We entered 1,671 responses into our analysis. Summary and individual fit to the Rasch model (including Cronbach’s Alpha) were assessed using the RUMM2030 software. Results Both item-sets were found to have good fit to the Rasch model and were acceptable to our target audience. The reliability was good (Cronbach’s alpha >0.7). Observations of the individual item and person fit provided us with guidance on how we could improve the design, scoring, and administration of the two item-sets. There was no local dependency in either of the item-sets, and both item-sets were found to have acceptable unidimensionality. Conclusion Overall, the two item-sets were found to have satisfactory measurement properties. Based on our analysis, we consider these instruments to be suitable for our target audiences in Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda.

                Background Food safety is a major public health concern, particularly in developing countries where inadequate hygiene practices among street food vendors contribute to foodborne illnesses. In Ghana, street-vended foods remain a common source of meals for many households, necessitating regular assessment of vendors’ food hygiene and safety practices. Objective This study assessed food hygiene and safety practices among street food vendors in the Bibiani–Anhwiaso–Bekwai Municipality of the Western North Region of Ghana. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed involving 152 street food vendors selected through purposive and simple random sampling techniques. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and observational checklists. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 15. Descriptive statistics summarized socio-demographic characteristics and hygiene practices. Chi-square tests were used to examine associations between socio-demographic factors and hygiene practices, while binary logistic regression identified predictors of good food hygiene and safety practices. Results Most vendors were female (93.4%) and married (61.8%). Awareness of food hygiene was high (92.1%). Only 56.6% of vendors had undergone medical screening, 53.3% had received food hygiene training, and 53.9% had been inspected within the past six months. Observational findings indicated that while most vendors washed foodstuffs before cooking (86.2%) and maintained clean surroundings (84.2%), some did not use aprons or hair coverings (17.8%), operated in unhygienic environments (21.7%), or lacked valid medical certificates (27.0%). Significant associations were found between hygiene practices and educational level, prior food hygiene training, and municipal health inspections (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that food hygiene training and regular inspections significantly increased the likelihood of practicing safe food handling. Conclusion Despite high awareness of food hygiene, adherence to recommended hygiene and safety practices among street food vendors remains suboptimal. Strengthening food hygiene training, enhancing regulatory enforcement, and improving environmental sanitation are essential to improve food safety and protect public health. Recommendation The government of Ghana and MMDAs should establish the pre-requisite standard operating procedures for all institutions undertaking hospitality regarding food safety and hygiene.

                Fan et al. identify a mechanism where nutrient-mTORC1 signaling controls β cell function by phosphorylating PDX1 at S61, enhancing its expression and insulin transcription. S61 phosphorylation influences glucose homeostasis, promoting hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and steatosis under a Western diet. Mutations disrupting this site impair PDX1 activity, linking it to diabetes risk.
