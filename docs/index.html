<p>Regulation of ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. And organelles play a role in different cellular interactions with ferroptosis. Targeting organelle metabolic pathways and redox responses may be an effective strategy for disease treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimerʼs disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, is a striking global health problem. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation products and the accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species. Strict regulation of iron metabolism is essential to ensure neuronal homeostasis. Excess and deficiency of iron are both associated with neurodegeneration. Studies have shown that oxidative stress caused by cerebral iron metabolism disorders in the body is involved in the process of AD, ferroptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, and regulating ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of AD. Various organelles are closely related to ferroptosis: mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis from the aspects of iron metabolism and redox imbalance. In this review, the relationship between AD and the dysfunction of organelles (including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, and Golgi apparatus) and the role of organelles in ferroptosis of AD were reviewed to provide insights for understanding the relationship between organelles and ferroptosis in AD and the treatment of AD.</p>

     alt="The role of sex in the association between cannabis use and working memory-related brain activity"/>
<p>Compared to controls, cannabis users show a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing working memory (WM) load and a relatively smaller reduction in WM related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. No sex differences emerged generally or in cannabis users in WM and WM load related activity or performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although cannabis use patterns differ between men and women, studies on sex differences on the effects of cannabis on the brain and cognitive control are largely lacking. Working memory (WM) is a component of cognitive control believed to be involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. In this study, we evaluated the association between cannabis use and WM (load) related brain activity in a large sample, enabling us to assess sex effects in this association. The brain activity of 104 frequent cannabis users (63% men) and 85 controls (53% men) was recorded during an N-back WM task. Behavioral results showed a significant interaction between WM load and group for both accuracy and reaction time, with cannabis users showing a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing WM load. Cannabis users compared to controls showed a relatively smaller reduction in WM (load) related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. This WM (load) related activity was not associated with performance nor cannabis use and related problems. An exploratory analysis showed higher WM-related activity in the superior frontal gyrus in men compared to women. While cannabis users showed higher WM (load) related activity in central nodes of the default mode network, this was not directly attributable to group specific worsening of performance under higher cognitive load. Further research is necessary to assess whether observed group differences increase with higher cognitive load, how group differences relate to measures of cannabis use, and how sex affects these group differences.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent clinical studies, in both children/adolescents and adults, have shown the extreme neuropsychological heterogeneity of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): specific neuropsychological deficits have been found only in a minority of individuals, with no direct correlation between discrete cognitive performances and the trajectory of clinical symptoms. Deficits in specific neuropsychological functions may be common in ADHD, but nevertheless no cognitive or neuropsychological profile may fully explain the disorder. Sex differences in the ADHD presentation, both at a neuropsychological and clinical level, also contribute to this clinical and neuropsychological heterogeneity. At a neuropsychological level, females with ADHD may show greater working memory problems, poorer vocabulary skills and worse visual spatial reasoning. Structural and functional imaging study also show discrete differences across sex; however, the great majority of clinical studies mainly or exclusively include male participants with insufficient data to draw firm conclusions on sex differences within the disorder. Here, we report the recent literature data, discussing still open research questions about the clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and neuropsychological functioning in ADHD with a focus on the impact of sex differences—a deeper insight in these unresolved issues may have relevant clinical and therapeutic implications for tailored, effective, and long-lasting interventions.</p>

<p>We investigated fiber distribution patterns of corticospinal neurons within the cortical area projecting to the lumbar cord gray matter of mice. The lumbar-cord-projecting area fundamentally innervates the gray matter in the same way as the cervical-cord-projecting area does.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticospinal neurons are known to be distributed in both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (S1), details of the projection pattern of their fibers to the lumbar cord gray matter remain largely uncharacterized, especially in rodents. We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.</p>

                Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the commonest indirect medical cause of maternal deaths worldwide, both in high-income and low and middle-income countries. To minimize the effects of CVD in pregnancy, proper risk assessment and appropriate referral is required. In Sri Lanka, cardiovascular disease complicating pregnancy is a significant cause of maternal mortality, second only to postpartum hemorrhage. Screening for CVD in pregnancy in Sri Lanka is limited to a routine clinical assessment. Evidence-based guidelines are yet to be developed, and this deficit may have resulted in a substantial underestimation of the CVD burden. This study aims to determine the burden of CVD in early pregnancy and develop a risk prediction model to be used in field pregnancy clinics in Sri Lanka to reduce CVD effects in pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out in the Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Following registration to the antenatal care, pregnant women fulfilling the eligibility criteria were invited to attend a special clinic at their relevant Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area. Risk assessment was done through history and a clinical examination, and suspected/probable cases were referred for an echocardiogram by a consultant cardiologist. All the recruited participants in the first trimester were prospectively followed up and screened again between 24–28 weeks of the period of amenorrhoea (POA). Antenatal ward admissions with CVD complicating pregnancy will be extracted, and a telephone interview will be carried out between 6–12 weeks after the expected delivery date to cover postpartum morbidities.  Discussion This proposed study will be the largest of its kind carried out in the local setting. The study's findings will be beneficial for policymakers to develop guidelines to reduce maternal cardiovascular disease morbidities and mortalities in Sri Lanka.

                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was firstly identified in China and has been declared a global pandemic. Several serious extrapulmonary manifestations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been reported and associated with hypercoagulability thrombotic vasculopathy. In addition, cases of Mycobacterium-leprae infection have also been known associated with blood coagulation abnormality. Methods: Here, we report a 56-year-old male with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with concomitant leprosy infection with manifestation of glans penile necrosis, presented to the emergency department with acute penile pain. This case is unique because no occlusion blood flow to the penile was observed in the radiographic imaging. We described the potential pathophysiology in this case through a literature review. Results: The patient received treatment according to the COVID-19 protocol and was given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy for 4 days. During the follow up, the clinical and functional condition of the penis showed significant improvement. Conclusions: Microthrombus involvement, platelet abnormalities and impaired hemostasis due to SARS-CoV-2 and leprosy co-infection are the hypothesis in this case report.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Visual Perceptual Decision-Making in Freely Behaving Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The temporal dynamics of perceptual decisions offer a key window into the cognitive processes contributing to decision-making. Investigating perceptual dynamics in a genetically tractable animal model can facilitate the subsequent unpacking of the underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated the time course as well as fundamental psychophysical constants governing visual perceptual decision-making in freely behaving mice. We did so by analyzing response accuracy against reaction time (RT), i.e., conditional accuracy, in a series of two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) orientation discrimination tasks in which we varied target size, luminance, duration, and presence of a foil. Our results quantified two distinct stages in the time course of mouse visual decision-making: a "sensory encoding" stage in which conditional accuracy exhibits a classic trade-off with response speed, and a subsequent "short-term memory (STM)-dependent" stage in which conditional accuracy exhibits a classic asymptotic decay following stimulus offset. We estimated the duration of visual sensory encoding as 200&ndash;320 ms across tasks, the lower bound of the duration of STM as ~1700 ms, and the briefest duration of visual stimulus input that is informative as &le;50 ms. Separately, by varying stimulus onset delay, we demonstrated that the conditional accuracy function (CAF) and RT distribution can be independently modulated, and found that the duration for which mice naturally withhold from responding is a quantitative metric of impulsivity. Taken together, our results establish a quantitative foundation for investigating the neural circuit bases of visual decision dynamics in mice.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is involved in the expression of fear and has been implicated in several anxiety disorders. This structure is densely innervated by DAergic projections that impinge on amygdalar neurons expressing various dopamine (DA) receptor subtypes, including D2 receptors (D2Rs). Although various pharmacological approaches have assessed the role of D2Rs in the CeA, the actual participation of postsynaptic D2Rs in the CeA to defensive behaviors remains unclear. Here, we investigated the distribution of D2Rs in the CeA and their role in modifying neuronal activity and fear related behaviors in mice. First, using the mouse reporter strain D2R-EGFP, we verified that D2Rs are present both in neurons of the CeA and in A10 dorsocaudal (A10dc) DAergic neurons that innervate the CeA. Moreover, we showed that pharmacological stimulation of D2Rs increases the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) cells present in the CeA, a type of neuron previously associated with reduced defensive behaviors. Finally, using a molecular genetics approach that discriminates postsynaptic D2Rs from presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, we demonstrated that mice carrying targeted deletions of postsynaptic D2Rs in the CeA display increased risk avoidance in exploratory tasks. Together, our results indicate that postsynaptic D2Rs in the CeA attenuate behavioral reactions to potential environmental threats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Transmission of yellow fever vaccine virus from breast feeding mothers to their infants: reporting of yellow fever virus (YFV) RNA detection in milk specimens [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Because of yellow fever’s serious impact on health, vaccination is the principal strategy to control the disease. Administration of the yellow fever vaccine to breastfeeding women should be before they complete 9 months post-delivery, in order to prevent transmission of the yellow fever vaccine virus to their infants through breast feeding. This study aimed to confirm whether the excretion of yellow fever vaccine virus is in milk of vaccinated breastfeeding mothers and to confirm the probable transmission to their infants through breast milk. Methods: Samples were taken as follows: one serum specimen was taken 3-14 days after the date of the vaccination, and breast milk specimens were taken at four different time points between 3-4 days apart. Specimens were obtained from eight nursing mothers, who received the YVF vaccine (17DD). Mothers were asymptomatic before and after the vaccine administration but their infants developed symptoms after administration. Maternal serum samples were tested for YFV specific IgM antibodies through immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA). RNA was extracted from serum and breast milk specimens and YFV RNA screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In total, five mothers (62.5%) were positive for YFV IgM and two mothers (25%) had YFV RNA in serum. Among milk specimens, YFV RNA was detected during the four different mentioned collection times as follows (positive milk specimens/total milk specimens): 3/8 (37.5 %), 4/6 (66.6%) and 1/4(25%). RNA was completely undetectable in the last collection time. Conclusions: YFV transmission from mothers to their babies through breast-feeding was highly probable indicated by the temporal relationship to mother’s YF vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of exercise on thyroid hormones in children and adolescents with thyroid function disorders: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Exercise leads to changes in hormonal concentration and metabolites which impacts growth and development; during physical activity, energy metabolism is influenced by hormones associated with pubertal development, and characterization of its response to exercise is essential. Therefore, we aimed to identify the effects of exercise on thyroid hormones in children and adolescents with thyroid function disorders. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase based on the search strategy, and the articles were screened based on inclusion criteria, for which two independent reviewers conducted data extraction. The eligible studies were methodologically assessed using a modified Downs and Black’s checklist. The extracted data were summarized according to study population, intervention, type and duration, outcome measures, and results. Results: The total number of screened articles was 1,710, out of which six papers were included for review. Studies included children and adolescents with hypothyroidism, intellectual disabilities, and obesity who received exercise or physical activity as an intervention. The outcomes included thyroid hormones T3, T4, and TSH. Studies were generally of low quality. The findings of the studies throw some light on the benefits of exercise or physical activity. Conclusions: Structured physical activity and exercise followed for a more extended period showed some thyroid function changes in this population. The intensity of change was directly proportional to exercise intensity. However, this review does not provide sufficient evidence stating that exercise results in changes of thyroid function returning to normal, which requires further higher-quality studies to strengthen the review’s findings.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Caffeine consumption and dementia: Are Lewy bodies the link?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the association between caffeine intake and cognitive impairment. Caffeine-neuropathology correlations and interactions with lifestyle and genetic factors impacting caffeine metabolism and response were also tested.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 888 participants aged 59+ from the Rush Memory and Aging Project(MAP) and 303,887 participants aged 55+ from UK Biobank(UKB). MAP participants took part in annual cognitive testing. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. A subset provided postmortem tissue for neuropathologic evaluation for common age-related diseases (e.g. AD, Lewy bodies, vascular). For UKB, dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Self-reported caffeine intake was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires in both cohorts. Cox proportional hazard ratio(HR), regression and mixed models were used to examine associations of caffeine intake with incident dementia, cognitive decline, and neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In MAP, compared to ≤100mg/d, caffeine intake &gt;100mg/d was associated with a significantly higher HR(95%CI) of all-cause[1.35(1.03,1.76)] and Alzheimer's[1.41(1.07,1.85)] dementia. Caffeine intake was not associated with cognitive decline. In UKB, compared to ≤100mg/d, the HRs(95%CI) of all-cause dementia for consuming 100≤200, 200≤300, 300≤400 and &gt;400mg/d were 0.83(0.72,0.94), 0.74(0.64,0.85), 0.74(0.64,0.85) and 0.92(0.79,1.08), respectively. Similar results were observed for Alzheimer's dementia. In MAP, caffeine intake was inversely associated with postmortem Lewy bodies but no other age-related pathologies. Caffeine intake &gt;100mg/d was associated with lower neocortical type Lewy bodies[Odds ratio(95%CI): 0.40(0.21,0.75)].</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Caffeine intake was inconsistently associated with clinical dementia; potentially explained by cohort differences in underlying dementia etiology. Lewy bodies may link caffeine to lower risk in some persons.</p>

                Chang et al. report the regulation of ILC3s, a subset of the innate lymphoid cells, by histone methyltransferase Setd2. Loss of Setd2 increases the generation and anti-tumor function of NKp46+ILC3s. Setd2 expression in ILC3s also supports homeostasis of the immunosuppressive RORγt+ regulatory T cells and prevents intestinal inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The PAF1 complex promotes 3′ processing of pervasive transcripts</a></h4>

              
                Liu et al. show that the transcriptional elongation factor PAF1 complex (PAF1C) plays a general role in facilitating pervasive transcript cleavage and promoting termination through Integrator. Loss of PAF1C results in aberrant lengthening and accumulation of eRNA, PROMPTs, and nascent RNAs from non-productive elongation on coding genes.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Drosophila functional screening of de novo variants in autism uncovers damaging variants and facilitates discovery of rare neurodevelopmental diseases</a></h4>

              
                Marcogliese et al. generate >300 Drosophila mutants and use complementary rescue-based and overexpression approaches to study the function of de novo missense variants found in autism. They find that 38% of missense changes have functional consequences and identify variants in GLRA2 that cause a variable neurological disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cerebellar modulation of memory encoding in the periaqueductal grey and fear behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The pivotal role of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in fear learning is reinforced by the identification of neurons in male rat ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) that encode fear memory through signalling the onset and offset of an auditory-conditioned stimulus during presentation of the unreinforced conditioned tone (CS+) during retrieval. Some units only display CS+ onset or offset responses, and the two signals differ in extinction sensitivity, suggesting that they are independent of each other. In addition, understanding cerebellar contributions to survival circuits is advanced by the discovery that (i) reversible inactivation of the medial cerebellar nucleus (MCN) during fear consolidation leads in subsequent retrieval to (a) disruption of the temporal precision of vlPAG offset, but not onset responses to CS+, and (b) an increase in duration of freezing behaviour. And (ii) chemogenetic manipulation of the MCN-vlPAG projection during fear acquisition (a) reduces the occurrence of fear-related ultrasonic vocalisations, and (b) during subsequent retrieval, slows the extinction rate of fear-related freezing. These findings show that the cerebellum is part of the survival network that regulates fear memory processes at multiple timescales and in multiple ways, raising the possibility that dysfunctional interactions in the cerebellar-survival network may underlie fear-related disorders and comorbidities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Correlation between leukocyte phenotypes and prognosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                The prognostic role of immune cells in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains undetermined. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal cohort study including 288 ALS patients with up to 5-year follow-up during 2015–2020 recruited at the only tertiary referral center for ALS in Stockholm, Sweden, and measured the levels of differential leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations. The primary outcome was risk of death after diagnosis of ALS and the secondary outcomes included functional status and disease progression rate. Cox model was used to evaluate the associations between leukocytes and risk of death. Generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the correlation between leukocytes and functional status and disease progression rate. We found that leukocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes increased gradually over time since diagnosis and were negatively correlated with functional status, but not associated with risk of death or disease progression rate. For lymphocyte subpopulations, NK cells (HR= 0.61, 95% CI = [0.42–0.88] per SD increase) and Th2-diffrentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> central memory T cells (HR= 0.64, 95% CI = [0.48–0.85] per SD increase) were negatively associated with risk of death, while CD4<sup>+</sup> effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (EMRA) T cells (HR= 1.39, 95% CI = [1.01–1.92] per SD increase) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (HR= 1.38, 95% CI = [1.03–1.86] per SD increase) were positively associated with risk of death. None of the lymphocyte subpopulations was correlated with functional status or disease progression rate. Our findings suggest a dual role of immune cells in ALS prognosis, where neutrophils and monocytes primarily reflect functional status whereas NK cells and different T lymphocyte populations act as prognostic markers for survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">C-type natriuretic peptide facilitates autonomic Ca2+ entry in growth plate chondrocytes for stimulating bone growth</a></h4>

              
                The growth plates are cartilage tissues found at both ends of developing bones, and vital proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes are primarily responsible for bone growth. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulates bone growth by activating natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) which is equipped with guanylate cyclase on the cytoplasmic side, but its signaling pathway is unclear in growth plate chondrocytes. We previously reported that transient receptor potential melastatin-like 7 (TRPM7) channels mediate intermissive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in growth plate chondrocytes, leading to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) for promoting bone growth. In this report, we provide evidence from experiments using mutant mice, indicating a functional link between CNP and TRPM7 channels. Our pharmacological data suggest that CNP-evoked NPR2 activation elevates cellular cGMP content and stimulates big-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels as a substrate for cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). BK channel-induced hyperpolarization likely enhances the driving force of TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and seems to accordingly activate CaMKII. Indeed, ex vivo organ culture analysis indicates that CNP-facilitated bone growth is abolished by chondrocyte-specific <i>Trpm7</i> gene ablation. The defined CNP signaling pathway, the NPR2-PKG-BK channel–TRPM7 channel–CaMKII axis, likely pinpoints promising target proteins for developing new therapeutic treatments for divergent growth disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Strategy-dependent effects of working-memory limitations on human perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Deliberative decisions based on an accumulation of evidence over time depend on working memory, and working memory has limitations, but how these limitations affect deliberative decision-making is not understood. We used human psychophysics to assess the impact of working-memory limitations on the fidelity of a continuous decision variable. Participants decided the average location of multiple visual targets. This computed, continuous decision variable degraded with time and capacity in a manner that depended critically on the strategy used to form the decision variable. This dependence reflected whether the decision variable was computed either: 1) immediately upon observing the evidence, and thus stored as a single value in memory; or 2) at the time of the report, and thus stored as multiple values in memory. These results provide important constraints on how the brain computes and maintains temporally dynamic decision variables.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nup98-dependent transcriptional memory is established independently of transcription</a></h4>

              
                Cellular ability to mount an enhanced transcriptional response upon repeated exposure to external cues is termed transcriptional memory, which can be maintained epigenetically through cell divisions and can depend on a nuclear pore component Nup98. The majority of mechanistic knowledge on transcriptional memory has been derived from bulk molecular assays. To gain additional perspective on the mechanism and contribution of Nup98 to memory, we used single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH) to examine the dynamics of transcription in <i>Drosophila</i> cells upon repeated exposure to the steroid hormone ecdysone. We combined smFISH with mathematical modeling and found that upon hormone exposure, cells rapidly activate a low-level transcriptional response, but simultaneously begin a slow transition into a specialized memory state characterized by a high rate of expression. Strikingly, our modeling predicted that this transition between non-memory and memory states is independent of the transcription stemming from initial activation. We confirmed this prediction experimentally by showing that inhibiting transcription during initial ecdysone exposure did not interfere with memory establishment. Together, our findings reveal that Nup98’s role in transcriptional memory is to stabilize the forward rate of conversion from low to high expressing state, and that induced genes engage in two separate behaviors – transcription itself and the establishment of epigenetically propagated transcriptional memory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortico-fugal regulation of predictive coding</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems must account for both contextual factors and prior experience to adaptively engage with the dynamic external environment. In the central auditory system, neurons modulate their responses to sounds based on statistical context. These response modulations can be understood through a hierarchical predictive coding lens: responses to repeated stimuli are progressively decreased, in a process known as repetition suppression, whereas unexpected stimuli produce a prediction error signal. Prediction error incrementally increases along the auditory hierarchy from the inferior colliculus (IC) to the auditory cortex (AC), suggesting that these regions may engage in hierarchical predictive coding. A potential substrate for top-down predictive cues is the massive set of descending projections from the auditory cortex to subcortical structures, although the role of this system in predictive processing has never been directly assessed. We tested the effect of optogenetic inactivation of the auditory cortico-collicular feedback in awake mice on responses of IC neurons to stimuli designed to test prediction error and repetition suppression. Inactivation of the cortico-collicular pathway led to a decrease in prediction error in IC. Repetition suppression was unaffected by cortico-collicular inactivation, suggesting that this metric may reflect fatigue of bottom-up sensory inputs rather than predictive processing. We also discovered populations of IC units that exhibit repetition enhancement, a sequential increase in firing with stimulus repetition. Cortico-collicular inactivation led to a decrease in repetition enhancement in the central nucleus of IC, suggesting that it is a top-down phenomenon. Negative prediction error, a stronger response to a tone in a predictable rather than unpredictable sequence, was suppressed in shell IC units during cortico-collicular inactivation. These changes in predictive coding metrics arose from bidirectional modulations in the response to the standard and deviant contexts, such that units in IC responded more similarly to each context in the absence of cortical input. We also investigated how these metrics compare between the anesthetized and awake states by recording from the same units under both conditions. We found that metrics of predictive coding and deviance detection differ depending on the anesthetic state of the animal, with negative prediction error emerging in the central IC and repetition enhancement and prediction error being more prevalent in the absence of anesthesia. Overall, our results demonstrate that the auditory cortex provides cues about the statistical context of sound to subcortical brain regions via direct feedback, regulating processing of both prediction and repetition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Boosting of cross-reactive antibodies to endemic coronaviruses by SARS-CoV-2 infection but not vaccination with stabilized spike</a></h4>

              
                Preexisting antibodies to endemic coronaviruses (CoV) that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to influence the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination and infection for better or worse. In this observational study of mucosal and systemic humoral immunity in acutely infected, convalescent, and vaccinated subjects, we tested for cross-reactivity against endemic CoV spike (S) protein at subdomain resolution. Elevated responses, particularly to the β-CoV OC43, were observed in all natural infection cohorts tested and were correlated with the response to SARS-CoV-2. The kinetics of this response and isotypes involved suggest that infection boosts preexisting antibody lineages raised against prior endemic CoV exposure that cross-react. While further research is needed to discern whether this recalled response is desirable or detrimental, the boosted antibodies principally targeted the better-conserved S2 subdomain of the viral spike and were not associated with neutralization activity. In contrast, vaccination with a stabilized spike mRNA vaccine did not robustly boost cross-reactive antibodies, suggesting differing antigenicity and immunogenicity. In sum, this study provides evidence that antibodies targeting endemic CoV are robustly boosted in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection but not to vaccination with stabilized S, and that depending on conformation or other factors, the S2 subdomain of the spike protein triggers a rapidly recalled, IgG-dominated response that lacks neutralization activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thalamocortical axons control the cytoarchitecture of neocortical layers by area-specific supply of VGF</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal abundance and thickness of each cortical layer is specific to each area, but how this fundamental feature arises during development remains poorly understood. While some of area-specific features are controlled by intrinsic cues such as morphogens and transcription factors, the exact influence and mechanisms of action by cues extrinsic to the cortex, in particular the thalamic axons, have not been fully established. Here we identify a thalamus-derived factor, VGF, which is indispensable for thalamocortical axons to maintain the proper amount of layer 4 neurons in the mouse sensory cortices. This process is prerequisite for further maturation of the primary somatosensory area, such as barrel field formation instructed by a neuronal activity-dependent mechanism. Our results provide an actual case in which highly site-specific axon projection confers further regional complexity upon the target field through locally secreting signaling molecules from axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional characterization of a 'plant-like' HYL1 homolog in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis indicates a conserved involvement in microRNA biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                While the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in both animals and plants depends on the RNase III Dicer, its partner proteins are considered distinct for each kingdom. Nevertheless, recent discovery of homologs of Hyponastic Leaves1 (HYL1), a 'plant-specific' Dicer partner, in the metazoan phylum Cnidaria, challenges the view that miRNAs evolved convergently in animals and plants. Here we show that the HYL1 homolog Hyl1-like a (Hyl1La) is crucial for development and miRNA biogenesis in the cnidarian model <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>. Inhibition of Hyl1La by morpholinos resulted in metamorphosis arrest in <i>Nematostella</i> embryos and a significant reduction in levels of most miRNAs. Further, meta-analysis of morphants of miRNA biogenesis components, like Dicer1, shows clustering of their miRNA profiles with Hyl1La morphants. Strikingly, immunoprecipitation of Hyl1La followed by quantitative PCR revealed that in contrast to the plant HYL1, Hyl1La interacts only with precursor miRNAs and not with primary miRNAs. This was complemented by an in vitro binding assay of Hyl1La to synthetic precursor miRNA. Altogether, these results suggest that the last common ancestor of animals and plants carried a HYL1 homolog that took essential part in miRNA biogenesis and indicate early emergence of the miRNA system before plants and animals separated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">microRNA-138 controls hippocampal interneuron function and short-term memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                The proper development and function of neuronal circuits relies on a tightly regulated balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic transmission, and disrupting this balance can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, e.g. schizophrenia. microRNA-dependent gene regulation in pyramidal neurons is important for excitatory synaptic function and cognition, but its role in inhibitory interneurons is poorly understood. Here, we identify <i>miR138-5p</i> as a regulator of short-term memory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mouse hippocampus. Sponge-mediated <i>miR138-5p</i> inactivation specifically in mouse parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons impairs spatial recognition memory and enhances GABAergic synaptic input onto pyramidal neurons. Cellular and behavioural phenotypes associated with <i>miR138-5p</i> inactivation are paralleled by an upregulation of the schizophrenia-associated <i>Erbb4</i>, which we validated as a direct <i>miR138-5p</i> target gene. Our findings suggest that <i>miR138-5p</i> is a critical regulator of PV interneuron function in mice, with implications for cognition and schizophrenia. More generally, they provide evidence that microRNAs orchestrate neural circuit development by fine-tuning both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A new early-branching armoured dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic of southwestern China</a></h4>

              
                The early evolutionary history of the armoured dinosaurs (Thyreophora) is obscured by their patchily distributed fossil record and by conflicting views on the relationships of Early Jurassic taxa. Here, we describe an early-diverging thyreophoran from the Lower Jurassic Fengjiahe Formation of Yunnan Province, China, on the basis of an associated partial skeleton that includes skull, axial, limb and armour elements. It can be diagnosed as a new taxon based on numerous cranial and postcranial autapomorphies and is further distinguished from all other thyreophorans by a unique combination of character states. Although the robust postcranium is similar to that of more deeply nested ankylosaurs and stegosaurs, phylogenetic analysis recovers it as either the sister taxon of <i>Emausaurus</i> or of the clade <i>Scelidosaurus</i>+Eurypoda. This new taxon, <i>Yuxisaurus</i> <i>kopchicki</i>, represents the first valid thyreophoran dinosaur to be described from the Early Jurassic of Asia and confirms the rapid geographic spread and diversification of the clade after its first appearance in the Hettangian. Its heavy build and distinctive armour also hint at previously unrealised morphological diversity early in the clade's history.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-resolution mapping demonstrates inhibition of DNA excision repair by transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                DNA base damage arises frequently in living cells and needs to be removed by base excision repair (BER) to prevent mutagenesis and genome instability. Both the formation and repair of base damage occur in chromatin and are conceivably affected by DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors (TFs). However, to what extent TF binding affects base damage distribution and BER in cells is unclear. Here, we used a genome-wide damage mapping method, <i>N</i>-methylpurine-sequencing (NMP-seq), and characterized alkylation damage distribution and BER at TF binding sites in yeast cells treated with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Our data shows that alkylation damage formation was mainly suppressed at the binding sites of yeast TFs Abf1 and Reb1, but individual hotspots with elevated damage levels were also found. Additionally, Abf1 and Reb1 binding strongly inhibits BER <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, causing slow repair both within the core motif and its adjacent DNA. Repair of UV damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER) was also inhibited by TF binding. Interestingly, TF binding inhibits a larger DNA region for NER relative to BER. The observed effects are caused by the TF-DNA interaction, because damage formation and BER can be restored by depletion of Abf1 or Reb1 protein from the nucleus. Thus, our data reveal that TF binding significantly modulates alkylation base damage formation and inhibits repair by the BER pathway. The interplay between base damage formation and BER may play an important role in affecting mutation frequency in gene regulatory regions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Octopamine drives honeybee thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                In times of environmental change species have two options to survive: they either relocate to a new habitat or they adapt to the altered environment. Adaptation requires physiological plasticity and provides a selection benefit. In this regard, the Western honeybee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) protrudes with its thermoregulatory capabilities, which enables a nearly worldwide distribution. Especially in the cold, shivering thermogenesis enables foraging as well as proper brood development and thus survival. In this study, we present octopamine signaling as a neurochemical prerequisite for honeybee thermogenesis: we were able to induce hypothermia by depleting octopamine in the flight muscles. Additionally, we could restore the ability to increase body temperature by administering octopamine. Thus, we conclude that octopamine signaling in the flight muscles is necessary for thermogenesis. Moreover, we show that these effects are mediated by β octopamine receptors. The significance of our results is highlighted by the fact the respective receptor genes underlie enormous selective pressure due to adaptation to cold climates. Finally, octopamine signaling in the service of thermogenesis might be a key strategy to survive in a changing environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Particle foraging strategies promote microbial diversity in marine environments</a></h4>

              
                Microbial foraging in patchy environments, where resources are fragmented into particles or pockets embedded in a large matrix, plays a key role in natural environments. In the oceans and freshwater systems, particle-associated bacteria can interact with particle surfaces in different ways: some colonize only during short transients, while others form long-lived, stable colonies. We do not yet understand the ecological mechanisms by which both short-term and long-term colonizers can coexist. Here, we address this problem with a mathematical model that explains how marine populations with different detachment rates from particles can stably coexist. In our model, populations grow only while on particles, but also face the increased risk of mortality by predation and sinking. Key to coexistence is the idea that detachment from particles modulates both net growth and mortality, but in opposite directions, creating a trade-off between them. While slow-detaching populations show the highest growth return (i.e., produce more net offspring), they are more susceptible to suffer higher rates of mortality than fast-detaching populations. Surprisingly, fluctuating environments, manifesting as blooms of particles (favoring growth) and predators (favoring mortality) significantly expand the likelihood that populations with different detachment rates can coexist. Our study shows how the spatial ecology of microbes in the ocean can lead to a predictable diversification of foraging strategies and the coexistence of multiple taxa on a single growth-limiting resource.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dopaminergic challenge dissociates learning from primary versus secondary sources of information</a></h4>

              
                Some theories of human cultural evolution posit that humans have social-specific learning mechanisms that are adaptive specialisations moulded by natural selection to cope with the pressures of group living. However, the existence of neurochemical pathways that are specialised for learning from social information and from individual experience is widely debated. Cognitive neuroscientific studies present mixed evidence for social-specific learning mechanisms: some studies find dissociable neural correlates for social and individual learning whereas others find the same brain areas and, dopamine-mediated, computations involved in both. Here we demonstrate that, like individual learning, social learning is modulated by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol when social information is the primary learning source, but not when it comprises a secondary, additional element. Two groups (total N = 43) completed a decision-making task which required primary learning, from own experience, and secondary learning from an additional source. For one group the primary source was social, and secondary was individual; for the other group this was reversed. Haloperidol affected primary learning irrespective of social/individual nature, with no effect on learning from the secondary source. Thus, we illustrate that dopaminergic mechanisms underpinning learning can be dissociated along a primary-secondary but not a social-individual axis. These results resolve conflict in the literature and support an expanding field showing that, rather than being specialised for particular inputs, neurochemical pathways in the human brain can process both social and non-social cues and arbitrate between the two depending upon which cue is primarily relevant for the task at hand.

                Functional network connectivity has previously been shown to distinguish patient groups from healthy controls (HC). However, the overlap across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar (BP), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) is not clear yet. This study focuses on finding overlap across these three psychotic disorders using dynamic FNC (dFNC) and compares it with static FNC (sFNC). We used resting-state fMRI, demographics, and clinical information from the Bipolar Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes cohort. The data includes three groups of patients with schizophrenia (SZP, N=102), bipolar (BPP, N=102), and schizoaffective (SADP, N=102), their relatives SZR (N=102), BPR (N=102), SADR (N=102), and HC (N=118) groups. After estimating each individual's dFNC, we put them into three identical states. We estimated five different features, including occupancy rate (OCR), number of transitions, the total number of transitions, and the total distance traveled. Finally, the extracted features are tested statistically across patients and HC groups. In addition, we explored the link between the clinical scores and the extracted features. We found the OCR difference between SZP and SZR in state2, between BPP and HC in state1, and between SADP and HC in state2. Also, state2 OCR separates SZP from BPP, state3 OCR separates BPP from SZP and SADP. Moreover, the OCR and traveled distance feature extracted from SZ and BP could significantly predict PANSS Total and PANSS General scores. Finally, combined distance features of all disorders showed a significant relationship to PANSS Total and PANSS General scores.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Place cells are non-randomly clustered by field location in CA1 hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                A challenge in both modern and historic neuroscience has been achieving an understanding of neuron circuits, and determining the computational and organizational principles that underlie these circuits. Deeper understanding of the organization of brain circuits and cell types, including in the hippocampus, is required for advances in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, as well as for understanding principals governing brain development and evolution. In this manuscript, we pioneer a new method to analyze the spatial clustering of active neurons in the hippocampus. We use calcium imaging and a rewarded navigation task to record from 100s of place cells in the CA1 of freely moving rats. We then use statistical techniques developed for and in widespread use in geographic mapping studies, global Moran's I and local Moran's I to demonstrate that cells that code for similar spatial locations tend to form small spatial clusters. We present evidence that this clustering is not the result of artifacts from calcium imaging, and show that these clusters are primarily formed by cells that have place field around previously rewarded locations. We go on to show that, although cells with similar place fields tend to form clusters, there is no obvious topographic mapping of environmental location onto the hippocampus, such as seen in the visual cortex. Insights into hippocampal organization, as in this study, can elucidate mechanisms underlying motivational behaviors, spatial navigation, and memory formation.

                The human brain achieves visual object recognition through multiple stages of nonlinear transformations operating at a millisecond scale. To predict and explain these rapid transformations, computational neuroscientists employ machine learning modeling techniques. However, state-of-the-art models require massive amounts of data to properly train, and to the present day there is a lack of vast brain datasets which extensively sample the temporal dynamics of visual object recognition. Here we collected a large and rich dataset of high temporal resolution EEG responses to images of objects on a natural background. This dataset includes 10 participants, each with 82,160 trials spanning 16,740 image conditions. Through computational modeling we established the quality of this dataset in five ways. First, we trained linearizing encoding models that successfully synthesized the EEG responses to arbitrary images. Second, we correctly identified the recorded EEG data image conditions in a zero-shot fashion, using EEG synthesized responses to hundreds of thousands of candidate image conditions. Third, we show that both the high number of conditions as well as the trial repetitions of the EEG dataset contribute to the trained models' prediction accuracy. Fourth, we built encoding models whose predictions well generalize to novel participants. Fifth, we demonstrate full end-to-end training of randomly initialized DNNs that output M/EEG responses for arbitrary input images. We release this dataset as a tool to foster research in visual neuroscience and computer vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic and selective engrams emerge with memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memories are encoded by sparse populations of neurons activated during an experience1. These neural ensembles constitute memory engrams that are both necessary and sufficient for inducing recall even long after memory acquisition2. This suggests that following encoding, engrams are stabilized to reliably support memory retrieval. However, little is known about the temporal evolution of engrams over the course of memory consolidation or how it impacts mnemonic properties. Here we employed computational and experimental approaches to examine how the composition and selectivity of engrams change with memory consolidation. We modeled engram cells using a spiking recurrent neural network that yielded three testable predictions: memories transition from unselective to selective as neurons are removed from and added to the engram, inhibitory activity during recall is essential for memory selectivity, and inhibitory synaptic plasticity during memory consolidation is critical for engrams to become selective. Using the Cal-Light system to tag activated neurons in vivo with high spatiotemporal precision3 as well as optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques, we conducted contextual fear conditioning experiments that supported each of our model's predictions. Our results reveal that engrams are dynamic even within hours of memory consolidation and that changes in engram composition mediated by inhibitory synaptic plasticity are crucial for the emergence of memory selectivity. These findings challenge classical theories of stable memory traces and point to a close link between engram state and memory expression.

                Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial-temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we sought to clarify ADRD-related co-dependencies between the MTL's most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the highly associative DN at a subregion resolution. We confronted the effects of APOE {epsilon}2 and {epsilon}4, rarely investigated together, with their impact on HC-DN co-variation regimes at the population level. In a two-pronged decomposition of structural brain scans from ~40,000 UK Biobank participants, we located co-deviating structural patterns in HC and DN subregions as a function of ADRD family risk. Across the disclosed HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornix's fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Phenome-wide profiling of HC-DN co-variation expressions from these population signatures revealed male-specific associations with air-pollution, and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We highlighted three main factors associated with brain-APOE associations across the different gene variants: happiness, and satisfaction with friendships, and with family. We further showed that APOE {epsilon}2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our findings reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between APOE {epsilon}2 dosage and sex, which we have linked to fine-grained structural divergences indicative of ADRD susceptibility.

                Introduction: Chronic pain is associated with dysfunctional cortical excitability. Research has identified altered intracortical motor cortex excitability in Chronic Lower Back Pain (CLBP). However, research identifying the specific intracortical changes underlying CLBP has been met with inconsistent findings. In the present case-control study, we examined intracortical excitability of the primary motor cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in individuals with CLBP. Methods: Twenty participants with CLBP (Mage = 54.45 years, SDage = 15.89 years) and 18 age- and gender-matched, pain-free controls (M = 53.83, SD = 16.72) were included in this study. TMS was applied to the hand motor area of the right hemisphere and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the contralateral hand. Resting motor threshold (rMT) and MEP amplitude were measured using single-pulse stimulation. Short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were assessed using paired-pulse stimulation. Results: Individuals with CLBP had significantly higher rMT (decreased corticospinal excitability) and reduced ICF compared to controls. No significant differences were found in MEP amplitude and SICI. Conclusion: These findings add to the growing body of evidence that CLBP is associated with deficits in intracortical modulation involving glutamatergic mechanisms.

                Most real-world behaviors are performed with incomplete information. Odor-guided locomotion, an ecologically important behavior essential to an animal's survival, is an example of such a behavior. Different odors activate different patterns of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) classes providing information about which odor is present but does not provide any navigational information. In this study, we investigate the sensorimotor transformation that relates ORN activation to locomotion changes in Drosophila by optogenetically activating different combinations of ORN classes and measuring the resulting changes in locomotion. Three features describe this sensorimotor transformation: First, locomotion depends on both the instantaneous firing frequency (f) and its change (df); the two together serve as short-term memory that allows the fly to automatically adapt its motor program to sensory context. Second, the mapping between f-df and locomotor parameters such as speed or curvature is distinct for each pattern of activated ORNs. Finally, the sensorimotor mapping changes with time after odor exposure allowing integration of information over a longer timescale.

                Abstract: Previous research has shown that resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between different brain regions (seeds) is related to motor learning and motor memory consolidation. Using high density electroencephalography (hdEEG) we addressed this question from a brain network perspective. Specifically, we examined frequency dependent functional connectivity in resting-state networks from twenty nine young healthy participants before and after they were trained on a motor sequence learning task. Consolidation was assessed with an overnight retest on the motor task. We showed training-related decreases in gamma band connectivity within the motor network, and between the motor and functionally distinct resting-state networks including the attentional network. Brain behavior correlation analyses revealed that baseline beta, delta and theta rsFC was related to subsequent motor learning and memory consolidation such that lower connectivity within the motor network and between the motor and several distinct resting state networks was correlated with better learning and overnight consolidation. Last, train-ing-related increases in beta-band connectivity between the motor and the visual networks were related to greater consolidation. Altogether our results indicate that connectivity in large-scale resting-state brain networks is related to (and modulated by) motor learning and memory consolidation processes. These finding corroborate previous seed-based connectivity research and provide evidence that frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting state networks is critically linked to motor learning and memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous rhythm processing</a></h4>

              
                When sensory input conveys rhythmic regularity, we are able to form predictions about the timing of upcoming events. Although rhythm processing capacities can differ considerably between individuals, these differences are often obscured by subject- and trial-level data averaging procedures in M/EEG research. Here, instead, we systematically assessed the neurophysiological variability exhibited by individuals listening to isochronous equitone sequences interspersed with unexpected deviant tones. First, we focused on rhythm tracking and tested the phase-relationship between neural activity in the delta-band and pre-tone onsets. We observed clear between- and within-subject variability, confirming that individuals employ variable, flexible, but consistent rhythm tracking at the single-trial level. Next, we modelled single-trial time-locked neural responses in the beta-band to investigate individual tendencies to employ binary or triplet grouping ('tic-toc effect'). Beta-band activity showed binary (strong-weak), triplet (strong-weak-weak) and mixed accentuation patterns, resembling the superimposition of a beat. Thus, we identified individual preferences for grouping patterns and tendencies to switch between binary, triplet, or combined patterns over trials. Notably, we demonstrated that the processing of standard and deviant tones was modulated by the employed grouping. This approach to neurophysiological profiling offers a sensitive strategy to identify individual and dynamically evolving neural signatures of rhythm and beat processing. We suggest that the observed neurophysiological variability reflects flexible windows of opportunity for evaluating and adapting to (un)predictable environmental rhythms.

                The human auditory system extracts rich linguistic abstractions from the speech signal. Traditional approaches to understand this complex process have used classical linear feature encoding models, with limited success. Artificial neural networks have recently achieved remarkable speech recognition performance and offer potential alternative computational models of speech processing. We used the speech representations learned by state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) models to investigate neural coding across the ascending auditory pathway from the peripheral auditory nerve to auditory speech cortex. We found that representations in hierarchical layers of the DNN correlated well to neural activity throughout the ascending auditory system. Unsupervised speech models achieve the optimal neural correlations among all models evaluated. Deeper DNN layers with context-dependent computations were essential for populations of high order auditory cortex encoding, and the computations were aligned to phonemic and syllabic context structures in speech. Accordingly, DNN models trained on a specific language (English or Mandarin) predicted cortical responses in native speakers of each language. These results reveal convergence between representations learned in DNN models and the biological auditory pathway and provide new approaches to modeling neural coding in the auditory cortex.

                Oscillatory slow-wave activity (0.5-100 Hz) emerges during fetal human cortex development reflecting functional consequences of cellular brain ontogeny. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) neural in vitro models recapitulate aspects of in vivo cellular brain ontogeny, while neuronal mesoscale functional ontogeny is largely uncharacterized. We utilized a human iPSC-derived 3D cortical aggregate model to assess properties of emerging oscillatory slow-wave activity and its relation to synchronous neuronal population activity in cortical circuits. We reveal that oscillatory slow-wave activity (<1 Hz), phased locked to synchronous population bursting, emerges within 14 days in vitro followed by consecutive stages of emerging delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-11 Hz), beta (11-30 Hz), and gamma (30-55 Hz) oscillatory activity, accompanied by stage-specific changes in neuronal population burst pattern characteristics. We provide a classification of neuronal mesoscale functional ontogeny stages of developing human iPSC-cortical circuits, where each stage is defined by specific oscillatory slow-wave activity and characteristic synchronous neuronal bursting patterns.

                To uncover how synaptic integration of feedforward sensory inputs is affected in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we used two-photon uncaging of caged glutamate to activate two clustered spines in the basal dendrites of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons from a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic cause of ASD. While subthreshold excitatory inputs integrate linearly in wild-type animals, surprisingly those with FXS summate sublinearly, contradicting what would be expected of a hyperexcitable cortex typically associated with ASD. Knockdown of the regulatory {beta}4 subunit of BK channels, rescues the synaptic integration, a result that was corroborated with numerical simulations. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is a differential impairment in the integration of feedforward sensory and feedback predictive inputs in L5 pyramidal neurons in FXS and potentially other forms of ASD. These results challenge the traditional view that FXS and other ASD are characterized by sensory hypersensitivity, but instead by hyposensitivity of sensory inputs and hypersensitivity of predictive inputs onto cortical neurons.

	<p>Gender differences in psychiatric disorders and drug use are well known. Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug among young people. In recent years, its use has been related to the development of psychiatric pathologies; however, few studies have incorporated the gender perspective as of yet. The present work analyses the literature to determine the existence of gender differences in the development of psychotic, depressive and anxious symptoms associated with cannabis use. First, we describe cannabis misuse and its consequences, paying special attention to adolescent subjects. Second, the main gender differences in psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, depression, anxiety and cannabis use disorders, are enumerated. Subsequently, we discuss the studies that have evaluated gender differences in the association between cannabis use and the appearance of psychotic, depressive and anxious symptoms; moreover, we consider the possible explanations for the identified gender differences. In conclusion, the studies referred to in this review reveal the existence of gender differences in psychiatric symptoms associated with cannabis use, although the direction of such differences is not always clear. Future research is necessary to discern the causal relationship between cannabis use and the development of psychiatric symptoms, as well as the gender differences found.</p>

	<p>Hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by monoallelic activating mutations in the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1) gene. While hyperinsulinism may be explained by a reduction in the allosteric inhibition of GLUD1, the pathogenesis of HA in HI/HA remains uncertain; interestingly, HA in the HI/HA syndrome is not associated with acute hyperammonemic intoxication events. We obtained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) in a woman with HI/HA syndrome with chronic asymptomatic HA. On MR spectroscopy, choline and myoinositol were decreased as in other HA disorders. In contrast, distinct from other HA disorders, combined glutamate and glutamine levels were normal (not increased). This observation suggests that brain biochemistry in HI/HA may differ from that of other HA disorders. In HI/HA, ammonia overproduction may come to the expense of glutamate levels, and this seems to prevent the condensation of ammonia with glutamate to produce glutamine that is typical of the other HA disorders. The absence of combined glutamate and glutamine elevation might be correlated to the absence of acute cerebral ammonia toxicity.</p>

	<p>Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) affects about 4&amp;amp;ndash;16% of adult women, and about one-third of them require medical assistance due to severe symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been shown to manage pain in refractory CPPS. Focal muscle vibration (FMV) has also been reported to relieve pelvic pain. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and effect of rTMS coupled with FMV to reduce pain in seven adult women with refractory CPPS. This pilot, open-labeled, prospective trial examined treatment by 5 Hz rTMS over SMA and 150 Hz FMV over the perineum, suprapubic, and sacrococcygeal areas, with one daily session for five consecutive days for three weeks. We assessed tolerance and subjective pain changes (as per visual analog scale, VAS) until one month post-treatment, with a primary endpoint at day 7. No patients experienced serious adverse effects or a significant increase in pain. Six out of seven patients experienced a VAS improvement of at least 10% at T7; three of these individuals experienced a VAS improvement of more than 30%. Overall, we found a significant VAS reduction of 15 points (95% CI 8.4&amp;amp;ndash;21.6) at T7 (t = 6.3, p = 0.001; ES = 2.3 (1.1&amp;amp;ndash;3.9)). Three of the women who demonstrated a significant VAS reduction at T7 retained such VAS improvement at T30. VAS decreased by six points (95% CI 1.3&amp;amp;ndash;10.7) at T30 (t = 3.1, p = 0.02; ES = 1.5 (0.2&amp;amp;ndash;2.6)). This coupled approach seems promising for pain management in adult women with refractory CPPS and paves the way for future randomized controlled trials.</p>

	<p>Background: patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) might need a flow diverter (FD) placement for complex acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs). We conducted a meta-analysis and developed a prediction model to estimate the favorable clinical outcome after the FD treatment in acutely ruptured IAs. Methods: a systematic literature search was performed from 2010 to January 2021 in PubMed and Embase databases. Studies with more than five patients treated with FDs within fifteen days were included. In total, 1157 studies were identified. The primary outcome measure was the favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0&amp;amp;ndash;2). Secondary outcome measures were complete occlusion rates, aneurysm rebleeding, permanent neurologic deficit caused by procedure-related complications, and all-cause mortality. A prediction model was constructed using individual patient-level data. Results: 26 retrospective studies with 357 patients and 368 aneurysms were included. The pooled rates of the favorable clinical outcome, mortality, and complete aneurysm occlusion were 73.7% (95% CI 64.7&amp;amp;ndash;81.0), 17.1% (95% CI 13.3&amp;amp;ndash;21.8), and 85.6% (95% CI 80.4&amp;amp;ndash;89.6), respectively. Rebleeding occurred in 3% of aneurysms (11/368). The c-statistic of the final model was 0.83 (95% CI 0.76&amp;amp;ndash;0.89). All the studies provided a very low quality of evidence. Conclusions: FD treatment can be considered for complex ruptured IAs. Despite high complication rates, the pooled clinical outcomes seem favorable. The prediction model needs to be validated by larger prospective studies before clinical application.</p>

	<p>In the monkey brain, the precentral gyrus and ventral intraparietal area are two interconnected brain regions that form a system for detecting and responding to events in nearby &amp;amp;ldquo;peripersonal&amp;amp;rdquo; space (PPS), with threat detection as one of its major functions. Behavioral studies point toward a similar defensive function of PPS in humans. Here, our aim was to find support for this hypothesis by investigating if homolog regions in the human brain respond more strongly to approaching threatening stimuli. During fMRI scanning, naturalistic social stimuli were presented in a 3D virtual environment. Our results showed that the ventral premotor cortex and intraparietal sulcus responded more strongly to threatening stimuli entering PPS. Moreover, we found evidence for the involvement of the amygdala and anterior insula in processing threats. We propose that the defensive function of PPS may be supported by a subcortical circuit that sends information about the relevance of the stimulus to the premotor cortex and intraparietal sulcus, where action preparation is facilitated when necessary.</p>

	<p>Affective information is processed in different ways across one&amp;amp;rsquo;s lifespan. Explanations for this pattern of performance are multiple and range from top-down motivational shifts and cognitive control to faster bottom-up and implicit processes. In this study, we aimed to investigate implicit affective information processing and positivity effects by examining performance in a modified version of the dot-probe task across three image-pair conditions (positive/neutral; negative/neutral; and positive/negative). We examined data from 50 older adults and 50 younger adults. The results showed that affective information processing varies with age and valence and that age effects in affective processing may occur early during information processing. Positivity biases emerge in both younger and older adults. However, while younger adults seem to prioritize positive information independently of context, older adults showed this prioritization only when presented in an emotional (i.e., negative) context. Moreover, older adults showed a tendency to avoid negative information whereas younger adults showed a general bias for affective content modulated by image-pair context.</p>

	<p>Background: For hearing-impaired individuals, hearing aids are clinically fit according to subjective measures of threshold and loudness. The goal of this study was to evaluate objective measures of loudness perception that might benefit hearing aid fitting. Method: Seventeen adult hearing aid users and 17 normal-hearing adults participated in the study. Outcome measures including categorical loudness scaling, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs), and pupillometry. Stimuli were 1-kHz tone bursts presented at 40, 60, and 80 dBA. Results: Categorical loudness scaling showed that loudness significantly increased with intensity for all participants (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). For CAEPs, high intensity was associated with greater P1, N1, and P2 peak amplitude for all listeners (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); a significant but small effect of hearing aid amplification was observed. For all participants, pupillometry showed significant effects of high intensity on pupil dilation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); there was no significant effect of hearing aid amplification. A Focused Principal Component analysis revealed significant correlations between subjective loudness and some of the objective measures. Conclusion: The present data suggest that intensity had a significant impact on loudness perception, CAEPs, and pupil response. The correlations suggest that pupillometry and/or CAEPs may be useful in determining comfortable amplification for hearing aids.</p>

	<p>Background. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in the DDX3X gene account for 1&amp;amp;ndash;3% of females with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The clinical presentation is variable, including a wide range of neurological and behavioral deficits and structural defects of the brain. Approximately 52% of affected females remain nonverbal after five years of age. Case presentation: We report a 7 year old nonverbal female with a likely novel de novo pathogenic heterozygous variant in the DDX3X gene affecting the non-canonical splice-site in the intron 1 (NM_001356:c.45+12G&amp;amp;gt;A). The patient presents with features typical for the DDX3X phenotype, such as: movement disorders, behavioral problems, a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and some other features uncommon for DDX3X such as: muscle hypertonia and spinal asymmetry evaluated through the scoliometer. Conclusions. Due to its rare occurrence, the clinical picture of DDX3X syndrome is yet to be fully determined. So far, behavioral disorders, including those from ASD, and neurological abnormalities seem to be the dominant features of this disorder.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neural basis of attention is thought to involve the allocation of limited neural resources. However, the quantitative validation of this hypothesis remains challenging. Here, we provide quantitative evidence that the nonuniform allocation of neural resources across the whole cerebral gray matter reflects the broad-task process of sustained attention. We propose a neural measure for the nonuniformity of whole-cerebral allocation using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that this measure was significantly correlated with conventional indicators of attention level, such as task difficulty and pupil dilation. We further found that the broad-task neural correlates of the measure belong to frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. Finally, we found that patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder showed abnormal decreases in the level of the proposed measure, reflecting the executive dysfunction. This study proposes a neuromarker suggesting that the nonuniform allocation of neural resources may be the broad-task neural basis of sustained attention.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Identifying the spinal circuits controlling locomotion is critical for unravelling the mechanisms controlling the production of gaits. Development of the circuits governing left-right coordination relies on axon guidance molecules such as ephrins and netrins. To date, no other class of proteins have been shown to play a role during this process. Here, we have analyzed <I>hop</I> mice, which walk with a characteristic hopping gait using their hindlimbs in synchrony. Fictive locomotion experiments suggest that a local defect in the ventral spinal cord contributes to the aberrant locomotor phenotype. <I>Hop</I> mutant spinal cords had severe morphologic defects, including the absence of the ventral midline and a poorly defined border between white and gray matter. The <I>hop</I> mice represent the first model where, exclusively found in the lumbar domain, the left and right components of the central pattern generators (CPGs) are fused with a synchronous hindlimb gait as a functional consequence. These defects were associated with abnormal developmental processes, including a misplaced notochord and reduced induction of ventral progenitor domains. Whereas the underlying mutation in <I>hop</I> mice has been suggested to lie within the <I>Ttc26</I> gene, other genes in close vicinity have been associated with gait defects. Mouse embryos carrying a CRISPR replicated point mutation within <I>Ttc26</I> displayed an identical morphologic phenotype. Thus, our data suggest that the assembly of the lumbar CPG network is dependent on fully functional TTC26 protein.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictors of social response to COVID-19 among health care workers caring for individuals with confirmed COVID-19 in Jordan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 forced public health authorities around the world to call for national emergency plans. Public responses, in the form of social discrimination and stigmatizing behaviors, are increasingly being observed against individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for those individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the perception of social discrimination and coping strategies, and explore predictors of social discrimination and coping with COVID-19 among HCWs and individuals with confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional descriptive-comparative design to collect data, using a convenience sample of 105 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and 109 HCWs using a web-based survey format. Results: In this study, individuals confirmed with COVID-19 reported a high level of social discrimination compared with HCWs (t = 2.62, p < 0.01), while HCWs reported a high level of coping with COVID-19 compared to individuals with COVID-19 (t = -3.91, p < 0.001). Educational level, age, monthly income, and taking over-the-counter medication were predictors of social discrimination and coping with COVID-19 among HCWs and individuals with confirmed COVID-19. Conclusions: The findings showed that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to face social discrimination, and HCWs cope with COVID-19 better than ordinary individuals with confirmed COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synchronous Display and Whiteboard-Like Freehand Writing App as Teaching Tool for Virtual Classroom amidst the Pandemic [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The research evaluates if teachers can achieve better teaching outcomes by using a proposed mobile interactive system (MIS) developed for this study as an additional approach to enhancing teachers’ proficiency in Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) in the virtual classroom.   Background: According to previous studies, teachers’ self-assessment on TPACK might be affected by their ego because they have autonomy over the students in the classroom. Some studies suggest that utilisation of an interactive whiteboard (IWB) promotes creativity in teaching and learning but that it is unsuitable for a virtual environment due to its large size and the high maintenance costs associated with owning one in a teacher’s residence. Besides, some studies also reveal that allowing the students to assess their teachers through TPACK  is able to reduce potential errors which might result from the TPACK self-assessment done by teachers.   Methods: Pre- and post- experiments were conducted with the developed MIS integrated into teaching process. Synchronous display (SD) and whiteboard-like freehand writing (WFW) were features of the MIS integrated into the experimental group. Questionnaires were distributed to the students, and a reflective measurement model was formed using SmartPLS and IBM SPSS Statistics.   Findings: Based on our findings, teachers’ Technological Content Knowledge had a significant positive effect on TPACK with the inclusion of MIS in online teaching. Predictive relevance was also evaluated through a Q2 value to predict the endogenous construct of the constructed model. The Q2 value was greater than zero, indicating that the model possesses a predictive relevance.   Conclusion: The integration of the developed MIS in the virtual classroom has a significant positive impact on the students’ academic performance relating to concept learning and knowledge acquisition of subject matter.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in frailty and its associated factors in the community dwelling elderly Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective analytical study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is a scarcity of quality literature on the prevalence of frailty among community dwelling elderly in India. This study was originally planned to analyze the longitudinal trends in frailty status of community dwelling elderly in an Indian population as well to identify factors associated with frailty in the Indian context. However, the recruitment phase of this study coincided with one of the largest lockdowns in history, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and this gave us a unique opportunity to study the effects this pandemic enforced, as a result of the necessary restrictions, on the frailty status as well the factors affecting frailty in the elderly. Methods: A prospective observational study was designed and conducted amongst 19 community dwelling elderly of Dakshina Kannada District, in Karnataka India. Outcome variables of frailty (EFIP), physical activity (PASE), functional mobility (TUG), gait speed (10-meter walk test), nutritional status (MNA®-SF) body composition (BIA), and strength (dynamometry), were measured at baseline and on follow-up after three months. The changes occurring in these variables over the three-month period were analyzed and the change in frailty was independently correlated with changes in each of the other outcomes. Results: We couldn’t identify any statistically significant difference in frailty over a period of three months. However, there was a highly significant change in the physical activity status, lower extremity muscle strength, body composition, functional mobility, gait speed, and cognitive function in the same time period. Conclusions: Though individual determinants of frailty in community dwelling changed over a three-month period, these changes failed to produce any observable/measurable difference in frailty status.

                <p>by Thierry Pécot, Maria C. Cuitiño, Roger H. Johnson, Cynthia Timmers, Gustavo Leone</p>

Automatic characterization of fluorescent labeling in intact mammalian tissues remains a challenge due to the lack of quantifying techniques capable of segregating densely packed nuclei and intricate tissue patterns. Here, we describe a powerful deep learning-based approach that couples remarkably precise nuclear segmentation with quantitation of fluorescent labeling intensity within segmented nuclei, and then apply it to the analysis of cell cycle dependent protein concentration in mouse tissues using 2D fluorescent still images. First, several existing deep learning-based methods were evaluated to accurately segment nuclei using different imaging modalities with a small training dataset. Next, we developed a deep learning-based approach to identify and measure fluorescent labels within segmented nuclei, and created an ImageJ plugin to allow for efficient manual correction of nuclear segmentation and label identification. Lastly, using fluorescence intensity as a readout for protein concentration, a three-step global estimation method was applied to the characterization of the cell cycle dependent expression of E2F proteins in the developing mouse intestine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SMetABF: A rapid algorithm for Bayesian GWAS meta-analysis with a large number of studies included</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianle Sun, Ruiqi Lyu, Luojia Deng, Qianwen Li, Yang Zhao, Yue Zhang</p>

Bayesian methods are widely used in the GWAS meta-analysis. But the considerable consumption in both computing time and memory space poses great challenges for large-scale meta-analyses. In this research, we propose an algorithm named SMetABF to rapidly obtain the optimal ABF in the GWAS meta-analysis, where shotgun stochastic search (SSS) is introduced to improve the Bayesian GWAS meta-analysis framework, MetABF. Simulation studies confirm that SMetABF performs well in both speed and accuracy, compared to exhaustive methods and MCMC. SMetABF is applied to real GWAS datasets to find several essential loci related to Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the results support the underlying relationship between PD and other autoimmune disorders. Developed as an R package and a web tool, SMetABF will become a useful tool to integrate different studies and identify more variants associated with complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution of innate behavioral strategies through competitive population dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tong Liang, Braden A. W. Brinkman</p>

Many organism behaviors are innate or instinctual and have been “hard-coded” through evolution. Current approaches to understanding these behaviors model evolution as an optimization problem in which the traits of organisms are assumed to optimize an objective function representing evolutionary fitness. Here, we use a mechanistic birth-death dynamics approach to study the evolution of innate behavioral strategies in a simulated population of organisms. In particular, we performed agent-based stochastic simulations and mean-field analyses of organisms exploring random environments and competing with each other to find locations with plentiful resources. We find that when organism density is low, the mean-field model allows us to derive an effective objective function, predicting how the most competitive phenotypes depend on the exploration-exploitation trade-off between the scarcity of high-resource sites and the increase in birth rate those sites offer organisms. However, increasing organism density alters the most competitive behavioral strategies and precludes the derivation of a well-defined objective function. Moreover, there exists a range of densities for which the coexistence of many phenotypes persists for evolutionarily long times.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Motor-related signals support localization invariance for stable visual perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrea Benucci</p>

Our ability to perceive a stable visual world in the presence of continuous movements of the body, head, and eyes has puzzled researchers in the neuroscience field for a long time. We reformulated this problem in the context of hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNN)—whose architectures have been inspired by the hierarchical signal processing of the mammalian visual system—and examined perceptual stability as an optimization process that identifies image-defining features for accurate image classification in the presence of movements. Movement signals, multiplexed with visual inputs along overlapping convolutional layers, aided classification invariance of shifted images by making the classification faster to learn and more robust relative to input noise. Classification invariance was reflected in activity manifolds associated with image categories emerging in late CNN layers and with network units acquiring movement-associated activity modulations as observed experimentally during saccadic eye movements. Our findings provide a computational framework that unifies a multitude of biological observations on perceptual stability under optimality principles for image classification in artificial neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Does plasmid-based beta-lactam resistance increase E. coli infections: Modelling addition and replacement mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noortje G. Godijk, Martin C. J. Bootsma, Henri C. van Werkhoven, Valentijn A. Schweitzer, Sabine C. de Greeff, Annelot F. Schoffelen, Marc J. M. Bonten</p>

Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become more prevalent during past decades. Yet, it is unknown whether such infections occur in addition to infections with antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, thereby increasing the incidence of infections, or whether they replace such infections, leaving the total incidence unaffected. Observational longitudinal studies cannot separate both mechanisms. Using plasmid-based beta-lactam resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> as example we applied mathematical modelling to investigate whether seven biological mechanisms would lead to replacement or addition of infections. We use a mathematical neutral null model of individuals colonized with susceptible and/or resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, with two mechanisms implying a fitness cost, i.e., increased clearance and decreased growth of resistant strains, and five mechanisms benefitting resistance, i.e., 1) increased virulence, 2) increased transmission, 3) decreased clearance of resistant strains, 4) increased rate of horizontal plasmid transfer, and 5) increased clearance of susceptible <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> due to antibiotics. Each mechanism is modelled separately to estimate addition to or replacement of antibiotic-susceptible infections. Fitness costs cause resistant strains to die out if other strain characteristics are maintained equal. Under the assumptions tested, increased virulence is the only mechanism that increases the total number of infections. Other benefits of resistance lead to replacement of susceptible infections without changing the total number of infections. As there is no biological evidence that plasmid-based beta-lactam resistance increases virulence, these findings suggest that the burden of disease is determined by attributable effects of resistance rather than by an increase in the number of infections.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The role of cell geometry and cell-cell communication in gradient sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan Fiorentino, Antonio Scialdone</p>

Cells can measure shallow gradients of external signals to initiate and accomplish a migration or a morphogenetic process. Recently, starting from mathematical models like the local-excitation global-inhibition (LEGI) model and with the support of empirical evidence, it has been proposed that cellular communication improves the measurement of an external gradient. However, the mathematical models that have been used have over-simplified geometries (e.g., they are uni-dimensional) or assumptions about cellular communication, which limit the possibility to analyze the gradient sensing ability of more complex cellular systems. Here, we generalize the existing models to study the effects on gradient sensing of cell number, geometry and of long- versus short-range cellular communication in 2D systems representing epithelial tissues. We find that increasing the cell number can be detrimental for gradient sensing when the communication is weak and limited to nearest neighbour cells, while it is beneficial when there is long-range communication. We also find that, with long-range communication, the gradient sensing ability improves for tissues with more disordered geometries; on the other hand, an ordered structure with mostly hexagonal cells is advantageous with nearest neighbour communication. Our results considerably extend the current models of gradient sensing by epithelial tissues, making a step further toward predicting the mechanism of communication and its putative mediator in many biological processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A network-based approach to integrate nutrient microenvironment in the prediction of synthetic lethality in cancer metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Iñigo Apaolaza, Edurne San José-Enériz, Luis V. Valcarcel, Xabier Agirre, Felipe Prosper, Francisco J. Planes</p>

Synthetic Lethality (SL) is currently defined as a type of genetic interaction in which the loss of function of either of two genes individually has limited effect in cell viability but inactivation of both genes simultaneously leads to cell death. Given the profound genomic aberrations acquired by tumor cells, which can be systematically identified with -omics data, SL is a promising concept in cancer research. In particular, SL has received much attention in the area of cancer metabolism, due to the fact that relevant functional alterations concentrate on key metabolic pathways that promote cellular proliferation. With the extensive prior knowledge about human metabolic networks, a number of computational methods have been developed to predict SL in cancer metabolism, including the genetic Minimal Cut Sets (gMCSs) approach. A major challenge in the application of SL approaches to cancer metabolism is to systematically integrate tumor microenvironment, given that genetic interactions and nutritional availability are interconnected to support proliferation. Here, we propose a more general definition of SL for cancer metabolism that combines genetic and environmental interactions, namely loss of gene functions and absence of nutrients in the environment. We extend our gMCSs approach to determine this new family of metabolic synthetic lethal interactions. A computational and experimental proof-of-concept is presented for predicting the lethality of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition in different environments. Finally, our approach is applied to identify extracellular nutrient dependences of tumor cells, elucidating cholesterol and myo-inositol depletion as potential vulnerabilities in different malignancies.

                <p>by Burke Q. Rosen, Eric Halgren</p>

The tracts between cortical areas are conceived as playing a central role in cortical information processing, but their actual numbers have never been determined in humans. Here, we estimate the absolute number of axons linking cortical areas from a whole-cortex diffusion MRI (dMRI) connectome, calibrated using the histologically measured callosal fiber density. Median connectivity is estimated as approximately 6,200 axons between cortical areas within hemisphere and approximately 1,300 axons interhemispherically, with axons connecting functionally related areas surprisingly sparse. For example, we estimate that <5% of the axons in the trunk of the arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi connect Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas. These results suggest that detailed information is transmitted between cortical areas either via linkage of the dense local connections or via rare, extraordinarily privileged long-range connections.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Fuzzy MCDM models for selection of the tourism development site: the case of Azerbaijan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the vital issues in promoting the sustainable tourism industry in developing countries, including Azerbaijan, is the well-grounded selection of tourism sites. Applying traditional approaches as a solution to this task, does not provide a relevant result in all cases in these countries due to local specifics of the tourism, the incompleteness of statistical data, the high-level uncertainty of the internal and external environment, and the questionable reliability of the available information. Methods: Since the statistical data are limited, and conventional formalization tools used for uncertainty description do not consider the reliability degree of the data, it is suggested to make decisions based on the Z-extension of fuzzy logic. A Delphi panel with the expert group is conducted to obtain the information required for the model development. Fuzzy Z-information-based TOPSIS and PROMETHEE methods are applied for the problem solution. Within these approaches Z-number-based procedures of the decision matrix normalization, defining the distance between solutions and the preference function, and swing weights determination are realized. Direct computations with Z-numbers are implemented.  Results: By applying Z-number-based multi-criteria decision-making methods, five potential regions of Azerbaijan have been evaluated for six criteria. The criteria reflect government policy to the development of the regions, economical, geographical, environmental factors, and infrastructure of the locations. Derived solutions are comparable in sense of sites ranking, and similar results were obtained using both methods. Direct calculations allow obtaining results based on the linguistic Z-evaluations of experts without distorting transformations. Conclusion: The managerial decision-making problems in the tourism sector, raised due to the aforementioned barriers, can be successfully resolved by applying Z-number-based multi-criteria approaches. The obtained results allow increasing a range of the decision-making tasks under a high degree of uncertainty to be solved for sustainable development studies and other areas.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) effectively suppresses arm tremor. Uncontrolled studies suggest the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) may be superior. We compared the intra-individual efficacy of VIM- versus PSA-DBS on tremor suppression and arm function.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial at Oslo University Hospital in patients (18–80 years) with isolated or combined action tremor affecting at least one arm. Four-contact DBS leads were implanted (bi- or unilaterally) with a trajectory to cover the VIM (upper two contacts) and PSA (lower two contacts). Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) post-surgery to: Group 1, VIM-stimulation months 0–3 (period 1), then PSA-stimulation months 4–6 (period 2); Group 2, PSA-stimulation first, then VIM-stimulation. Primary endpoint was the difference in improvement from baseline to the end of the VIM- versus PSA-period in the sum of the dominant arm tremor scores of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), items 5/6 + 10−14.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-five patients were randomized to Group 1 (<i>n</i> = 23) or 2 (<i>n</i> = 22). In the primary endpoint per-protocol analysis (mixed model, n = 40), mean difference in the sum FTMTRS score improvement for the dominant arm was −2.65 points (95% CI −4.33 to −0.97; <i>p</i> = 0.002). The difference in favour of PSA stimulation was highly significant in period 2, but not period 1.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our randomized trial demonstrated that PSA stimulation provided superior tremor suppression compared with VIM stimulation. A period effect reducing tremor for up to three months in both groups was most likely attributed to a post-surgery stun effect. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Cardiac metastases from phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare. Herein, we report a case of a 37-year-old female patient with a history of borderline breast PTs, admitted to the cardiology department for acute cardiac failure revealing concomitant cardiac and pulmonary metastases of malignant PTs. Cardiac metastasis occurred through direct extension from pulmonary metastasis to the left atrium via the right inferior pulmonary vein, causing severe mitral valve obstruction. Although the metastasis was surgically removed, the patient had an uncommon complication, which led to acute heart failure and huge relapse resulting in her death.

                We developed a new time-calibrated tree incorporating primarily endemic along with some cryptic Ryukyu islands cicada data, following the recent publication of global cicada data by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021).  A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1. X software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations as old as Triassic were adopted largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), and a Quaternary geological event calibration was adopted following Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b) and input into BEAST v1. X. Our timetree suggests that Tettigarctidae had a cicada basal lineage as old as 200.63 Ma, with Derotettiginae the next oldest lineage at 99.2 Ma. Tibicininae is a sister of the remaining subfamilies of Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae, and their species level differentiation and radiation began at 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of specific tribes with parapheletic relationship, and the vicariance and adaptive radiation generated many cryptic species in each tribe. We estimated base substitution rate as a function of age, and the result strongly indicates an exponential increase of base substitution rate in recent geologic time. The consequent increase in cicada biodiversity, including generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surroundings, may have been driven by the generation and spreading of C4 grasses and coeval Quaternary climate change.

                Background: Caesarean sections have become the most popular method for delivering twin babies because of the safety concerns associated with a natural birth. This study aims to identify the maternal characteristics and obstetric parameters that serve as risk factors influencing caesarean delivery in twin pregnancies by comparing women delivering via caesarean section and vaginal birth. Methods: A retrospective chart review design was used to analyse 47 women with multiple pregnancies from the medical records at a primary referral hospital in East Java, Indonesia. Women delivering vaginally were then compared with women who underwent a caesarean section to identify any differences between the groups. Results: In our study, more women delivered by caesarean section than by vaginal birth. Women were more likely to undergo a caesarean section if they had a previous history of undergoing a caesarean section. Similar to previous studies, we found that foetal malpresentation significantly increase the risk of caesarean delivery, while labour augmentation decrease the likelihood of caesarean section. There was also a significant difference in maternal age between groups. Conclusions: The percentage of multiple pregnancies delivered via caesarean section is quite high. Other larger cohort study are warranted, since many factors were involved in the decision of caesarean section.

                Background: Infrared (IR) sensors are useful tools for detecting distance and proximity. However, these sensors are not good at detecting edges of an area, therefore when used in a smart toilet it has difficulty in detecting the orientation and position of the user’s body. The aim of this study was to design an IR sensor for a smart toilet with a more accurate and consistent detection.  Methods: A total of 12(six men and six women) participants with different body types were involved in this study. IR sensor detection was tested in the sitting and squatting toilets. For the best accuracy, the  IR sensor's angle was measured. Red, blue, and red-blue plastic covers were used, as these colors improve precision. The microcontroller was  set up to calculate the participant’s distance and presence in the cubicle.    Results:  Toilet positioning varied greatly depending on whether one is sitting or squatting. For sitting toilet, the red cover was close to the accurate distance at a 172˚ angle. IR detected a man but not a woman's body. The blue cover provided the same best angle of 172˚ with a higher sensor distance. When the red and blue cover combination was applied, the reading of 141cm detected both men and women, at 172˚  angle. The actual distance for squatting toilets  was 158cm. The optimal angle for both red and blue covers was 176˚, however the sensor distance was greater for the blue cover. Finally, the red and blue cover combination gave a more accurate distance of up to 163cm from the actual reading, when detecting both genders at a normal angle of 76˚.  Conclusion: The combination of red and blue cover gave the most accurate detection for the squatting and sitting toilets. The best angle for sitting was 172˚, and for squatting was 176˚.

                Background: Spirulina platensis contains several bioactive molecules such as phenol, flavonoid and phycocyanin pigments. This study unveils total phenol, flavonoid, antioxidant activity, phycocyanin content and evaluated encapsulation efficiency from Ocimum basilicum intervention on S. platensis. O. basilicum intervention aims to reduce unpleasant odors from S. platensis that will increase consumption and increase bioactive compounds.   Methods: The intervention was carried out by soaking a S. platensis control sample (SP) in O. basilicum with a ratio of 1:4 (w/v) and it was then dried (DSB) and microencapsulated by freeze drying methods (MSB) using a combination of maltodextrin and gelatin. Total flavonoid and phenolic analysis with curve fitting analysis used a linear regression approach. Antioxidant activity of samples was analysed with the 2,2’-azino-bis-3-3thylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) method. Data were analysed using ANOVA at significance level (p < 0.05) followed by Tukey test models using SPSS v.22.  Results: The result of this study indicated that O. basilicum intervention treatment (DSB) has the potential to increase bioactive compounds such as total phenol, antioxidant activity and phycocyanin, and flavonoid content. Intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis (DSB) significantly increases total phenol by 49.5% and phycocyanin by 40.7%. This is due to the phenol and azulene compounds in O. basilicum which have a synergistic effect on phenol and phycocyanin in S. platensis. Microencapsulation using a maltodexrin and gelatin coating is effective in phycocyanin protection and antioxidant activity with an encapsulation efficiency value of 71.58% and 80.5%.   Conclusion: The intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis improved the total phenol and phycocyanin content and there is potential for a pharmaceutical product for a functional food and pharmaceutical product.

                Background: IT tools assist in creating a more participative and independent learning environment. They have brought a new perspective to collaborative learning where students do not just sit in a chair and swallow lecture content but instead participate in creating and sharing knowledge. However, interactivity promoted through the implementation of technology is limited in many cases.    Purpose: This research develops an interactive application for learning calculus that promotes human-system interaction via augmented reality (AR) and human-human interaction through chat functions. The study examines the effect of both interactivities on learning experience and how that learning experience affects the performance of learning.   Methods: The research adopted a quasi-experimental study design and pre-post test data analysis to evaluate the effect of interactivities on learning experience and consequently the effect of learning experience on learning performance. The subjects were exposed to the developed application for learning the calculus chapter ‘Revolution of Solids” in a controlled environment. The study validated its research framework through partial least squares path modelling and tested three hypotheses via pre-and post-test evaluation.   Conclusions: The results found that both interactivities affect learning experience positively; human-human interactivity has a higher impact than human-system interactivity. It was also found that learning performance as part of the learning experience increased from pre-test to post-test.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tmax Volumes Predict Final Infarct Size and Functional Outcome in Ischemic Stroke Patients Receiving Endovascular Treatment</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the utility of Tmax-based target mismatch on CT perfusion (CTP) in predicting radiological and clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) selected for endovascular treatment (EVT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>AIS patients underwent CTP within 24 hours from onset followed by EVT. Critically hypoperfused tissue and ischemic core volumes were automatically calculated using Tmax thresholds &gt;9.5 s and &gt; 16 s, respectively. The difference between Tmax&gt;9.5 s and Tmax&gt;16 s volumes and the ratio between Tmax&gt;9.5 s and Tmax&gt;16 s volumes were considered ischemic penumbra and Tmax mismatch ratio, respectively. Final infarct volume (FIV) was measured on follow-up non-contrast CT at 24 hours. Favorable clinical outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale 0–2. Predictors of FIV and outcome were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Optimal Tmax volumes for identification of good outcome was defined using receiver operating curves.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 393 patients were included, of whom 298 (75.8%) achieved successful recanalization and 258 (65.5%) achieved good outcome. In multivariable analyses, all Tmax parameters were independent predictors of FIV and outcome. Tmax&gt;16 s volume had the strongest association with FIV (beta coefficient = 0.596, p &lt;0.001) and good outcome (OR = 0.96 per 1 mL increase, 95% CI = 0.95–0.97, p &lt;0.001). Tmax&gt;16 s volume had the highest discriminative ability for good outcome (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.842–0.909). A Tmax&gt;16 s volume of ≤67 mL best identified subjects with favorable outcome (sensitivity = 0.91, specificity = 0.73).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tmax target mismatch predicts radiological and clinical outcomes in AIS patients with LVO receiving EVT within 24 hours from onset.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Nonpermissive skin environment impairs nerve regeneration in diabetes via Sec31a</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although the microenvironment for peripheral nerve regeneration is permissive, such a mechanism is defective in diabetes, and the molecular mediators remain elusive. This study aimed to (1) investigate the relationship between skin innervation and collagen pathology in diabetic neuropathy and to (2) clarify the molecular alterations that occur in response to hyperglycemia and their effects on axon regeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We addressed this issue using two complementary systems: (1) human skin from patients with diabetic neuropathy and to (2) a coculture model of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons in the context of intrinsic neuronal factor and extrinsic microenvironmental collagen and its biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In diabetic neuropathy, the skin innervation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFd), a measure of sensory nerve degeneration, was reduced with similar expression of a growth associated protein 43, a marker of nerve regeneration. In contrast, the content and packing of collagen in the diabetic skin became more rigid than the control skin. Sec31a, a protein that regulates the collagen biosynthetic pathway, was upregulated and inversely correlated with IENFd. In the cell model, activated HDFs exposed to high-glucose medium enhanced the expression of Sec31a and collagen I through the activation of transforming growth factor β, a profibrotic molecule. Sec31a upregulation impaired neurite outgrowth. This effect was reversed by silencing Sec31a expression and neurite outgrowth was resumed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The current study provides evidence that Sec31a plays a key role in inhibiting nerve regeneration in diabetic neuropathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Greater diffusion restriction in white matter in Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Continuum is biologically defined by beta-amyloid deposition which, at the earliest stages, is superimposed upon white matter degeneration in aging. However, the extent to which these co-occurring changes are characterized is relatively under-explored. The goal of this study was to use Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and biophysical modeling to detect and describe amyloid-related white matter changes in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</p>
<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>Cognitively unimpaired participants ages 45-85 completed brain MRI, amyloid PET (florbetapir), neuropsychological testing, and other clinical measures at baseline in a cohort study. We tested whether beta amyloid-negative (AB-) and -positive (AB+) participants differed on DKI-based conventional (i.e. Fractional Anisotropy [FA], Mean Diffusivity [MD], Mean Kurtosis [MK]) and modeling (i.e. Axonal Water Fraction [AWF], extra-axonal radial diffusivity [<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>]) metrics, and whether these metrics were associated with other biomarkers.</p>
<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>We found significantly greater diffusion restriction (higher FA/AWF, lower MD/ <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>) in white matter in AB+ than AB- (partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.08-0.19), more notably in the extra-axonal space within primarily late-myelinating tracts. Diffusion metrics predicted amyloid status incrementally over age (AUC=0.84) with modest yet selective associations, where AWF (a marker of axonal density) correlated with speed/executive functions and neurodegeneration, whereas <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub> (a marker of gliosis/myelin repair) correlated with amyloid deposition and white matter hyperintensity volume.</p>
<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>These results support prior evidence of a non-monotonic change in diffusion behavior, where an early increase in diffusion restriction is hypothesized to reflect inflammation and myelin repair prior to an ensuing decrease in diffusion restriction, indicating glial and neuronal degeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Decreasing Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Expenditures and Improving Quality at the Health System Level</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate a multi-component health system intervention designed to reduce escalating disease-modifying treatment (DMT) expenditures and improve multiple sclerosis (MS) outcomes by increasing use of preferred formulary, and highly effective DMTs (HET).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a trend study of treatment utilization and expenditure outcomes prior to (2009-2011) and during (2012-2018) MS Treatment Optimization Program (MSTOP) implementation in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) compared to a KP region of similar size. Annual relapse rates (ARR) were obtained from KPSC’s electronic health records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adherence to preferred formulary DMTs increased from 25.4% in 2011 to 72.2% in 2017 following MSTOP implementation in KPSC and 22.1% to 43.8%, respectively in the comparator. KPSC’s annual DMT expenditures in 2018 were less than in 2011 despite 11.3% increase in DMT-treated members. The decline in average per-patient-per-year of treatment expenditures from a peak of $43.1K in 2014 to $26.3K in 2018 in KSPC was greater than the comparator, which peaked at $52.1K and declined to $40.0K in 2018. Over the 7 years following initiation of MSTOP, cumulative MS DMT expenditures were $161.6 million less than the comparator. HET use increased to 62.5% of per-patient-treatment-years versus 32.4% in the comparator. This corresponded to a 69% decline in adjusted ARR (95%CI 64.1-73.2%; p&lt;0.0001) among DMT-treated patients at KPSC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A novel, expert-led health system intervention reduced MS DMT expenditures despite rising prices while simultaneously reducing MS relapse rates. Our focus on health system progress toward meaningful, measurable targets could serve as a model to improve quality and affordability of MS care in other settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">APOE antibody inhibits Aβ‐associated tau seeding and spreading in a mouse model</a></h4>

              
                <p><i>APOE</i> is the strongest genetic factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A specific conformation of the ApoE protein is present in amyloid-β (Aβ) containing plaques. Immunotherapy targeting ApoE in plaques reduces brain Aβ deposits in mice. Here, we evaluated the effects of the anti-human APOE antibody HAE-4 on amyloid plaques, Aβ-mediated tau seeding and spreading, and neuritic dystrophy in the 5XFAD amyloid mice expressing human ApoE4. HAE-4 reduced Aβ plaques as well as Aβ-driven tau seeding/spreading and neuritic dystrophy. These results demonstrate that HAE-4 may provide therapeutic effects on amyloid removal and Aβ driven downstream consequences such as tauopathy.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>As SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, a plasma system for quantifying central nervous system proteins in living humans was used to investigate neuropathogenic mechanisms of long-COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins (MPs) in enriched plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) were quantified in resolved acute COVID-19 without post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), PASC without neuropsychiatric manifestations (NP), PASC with NP and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NDEV and ADEV mean levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were higher in all PASC sub-groups than controls, but only N levels were higher in PASC with than without NP. Exosome marker CD81-normalized NDEV mean levels of subunit 6 of MP respiratory chain complex I and subunit 10 of complex III, and neuroprotective MPs Humanin and mitochondrial open-reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c (MOTS-c) all were decreased significantly in PASC with NP but not in PASC without NP relative to controls. NDEV levels of MPs voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) were decreased in PASC without and with NP, whereas those of calcium channel MPs mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX) and leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane 1 protein (LETM1) were decreased only in PASC with NP. ADEV levels of MCU and NCLX only were increased in PASC without and with NP.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Abnormal NDEV and ADEV levels of SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 protein and MPs correlate with NP and may be biomarkers for long-COVID prognostics and therapeutic trials.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Associative learning drives longitudinally-graded presynaptic plasticity of neurotransmitter release along axonal compartments</a></h4>

              
                Anatomical and physiological compartmentalization of neurons is a mechanism to increase the computational capacity of a circuit, and a major question is what role axonal compartmentalization plays. Axonal compartmentalization may enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter neuronal output in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. Here we show that olfactory learning generates compartmentalized, bidirectional plasticity of acetylcholine release that varies across the longitudinal compartments of <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB) axons. The directionality of the learning-induced plasticity depends on the valence of the learning event (aversive vs. appetitive), varies linearly across proximal to distal compartments following appetitive conditioning, and correlates with learning-induced changes in downstream mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that modulate behavioral action selection. Potentiation of acetylcholine release was dependent on the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 calcium channel subunit <i>cacophony</i>. In addition, contrast between the positive conditioned stimulus and other odors required the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R), which maintained responsivity to odors upon repeated presentations, preventing adaptation. Downstream from the mushroom body, a set of MBONs that receive their input from the g3 MB compartment were required for normal appetitive learning, suggesting that they represent a key node through which reward learning influences decision-making. These data demonstrate that learning drives valence-correlated, compartmentalized, bidirectional potentiation and depression of synaptic neurotransmitter release, which rely on distinct mechanisms and are distributed across axonal compartments in a learning circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dysregulated heparan sulfate proteoglycan metabolism promotes Ewing sarcoma tumor growth</a></h4>

              
                The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is a group of malignant small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs) that affects children, adolescents, and young adults. The tumors are characterized by reciprocal chromosomal translocations that generate chimeric fusion oncogenes, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. Survival is extremely poor for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease, and no molecularly-targeted therapy for this disease currently exists. The absence of a reliable genetic animal model of Ewing sarcoma has impaired investigation of tumor cell/microenvironmental interactions <i>in vivo</i>. We have developed a new genetic model of Ewing sarcoma based on Cre-inducible expression of human <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> in wild type zebrafish, which causes rapid onset of SRBCTs at high penetrance. The tumors express canonical EWSR1-FLI1 target genes and stain for known Ewing sarcoma markers including CD99. Growth of tumors is associated with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, which we link to dysregulated extracellular matrix metabolism in general and heparan sulfate catabolism in particular. Targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans with the specific heparan sulfate antagonist Surfen reduces ERK1/2 signaling and decreases tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These results highlight the important role of the extracellular matrix in Ewing sarcoma tumor growth and the potential of agents targeting proteoglycan metabolism as novel therapies for this disease.

                Caenorhabditis elegans Nuclear Hormone Receptor NHR-49, an orthologue of mammalian Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha (PPARα). We show that <i>nhr-49</i> is required for animal survival in hypoxia and is synthetic lethal with <i>hif-1</i> in this context, demonstrating that these factors act in parallel. RNA-seq analysis shows that in hypoxia <i>nhr-49</i> regulates a set of genes that are <i>hif-1-</i>independent, including autophagy genes that promote hypoxia survival. We further show that Nuclear Hormone Receptor <i>nhr-67</i> is a negative regulator and Homeodomain-interacting Protein Kinase <i>hpk-1 </i>is a positive regulator of the NHR-49 pathway. Together, our experiments define a new, essential hypoxia response pathway that acts in parallel with the well-known HIF-mediated hypoxia response.

                Humans can often handle daunting tasks with ease by developing a set of strategies to reduce decision making into simpler problems. The ability to use heuristic strategies demands an advanced level of intelligence and has not been demonstrated in animals. Here, we trained macaque monkeys to play the classic video game Pac-Man. The monkeys' decision-making may be described with a strategy-based hierarchical decision-making model with over 90% accuracy. The model reveals that the monkeys adopted the take-the-best heuristic by using one dominating strategy for their decision-making at a time and formed compound strategies by assembling the basis strategies to handle particular game situations. With the model, the computationally complex but fully quantifiable Pac-Man behavior paradigm provides a new approach to understanding animals’ advanced cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pericyte-mediated constriction of renal capillaries evokes no-reflow and kidney injury following ischaemia</a></h4>

              
                Acute kidney injury is common, with ~13 million cases and 1.7 million deaths/year worldwide. A major cause is renal ischaemia, typically following cardiac surgery, renal transplant or severe hemorrhage. We examined the cause of the sustained reduction in renal blood flow ('no-reflow'), which exacerbates kidney injury even after an initial cause of compromised blood supply is removed. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, or NG2-dsRed male mice were used in this study. After 60 min kidney ischaemia and 30-60 min reperfusion, renal blood flow remained reduced, especially in the medulla, and kidney tubule damage was detected as Kim-1 expression. Constriction of the medullary descending vasa recta and cortical peritubular capillaries occurred near pericyte somata, and led to capillary blockages, yet glomerular arterioles and perfusion were unaffected, implying that the long-lasting decrease of renal blood flow contributing to kidney damage was generated by pericytes. Blocking Rho kinase to decrease pericyte contractility from the start of reperfusion increased the post-ischaemic diameter of the descending vasa recta capillaries at pericytes, reduced the percentage of capillaries that remained blocked, increased medullary blood flow and reduced kidney injury. Thus, post-ischaemic renal no-reflow, contributing to acute kidney injury, reflects pericytes constricting the descending vasa recta and peritubular capillaries. Pericytes are therefore an important therapeutic target for treating acute kidney injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation in cone photoreceptors contributes to an unexpected insensitivity of primate On parasol retinal ganglion cells to spatial structure in natural images</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits are constructed from nonlinear building blocks, and not surprisingly overall circuit behavior is often strongly nonlinear. But neural circuits can also behave near linearly, and some circuits shift from linear to nonlinear behavior depending on stimulus conditions. Such control of nonlinear circuit behavior is fundamental to neural computation. Here, we study a surprising stimulus dependence of the responses of macaque On (but not Off) parasol retinal ganglion cells: these cells respond nonlinearly to spatial structure in some stimuli but near-linearly to spatial structure in others, including natural inputs. We show that these differences in the linearity of the integration of spatial inputs can be explained by a shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that originates at least partially from adaptation in the cone photoreceptors. More generally, this highlights how subtle asymmetries in signaling - here in the cone signals - can qualitatively alter circuit computation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis of dynamic P5CS filaments</a></h4>

              
                The bifunctional enzyme Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) is vital to the synthesis of proline and ornithine, playing an essential role in human health and agriculture. Pathogenic mutations in P5CS gene (ALDH18A1) lead to neurocutaneous syndrome and skin relaxation connective tissue disease in humans, and P5CS deficiency seriously damages the ability to resist adversity in plants. We have recently found that P5CS forms the cytoophidium in vivo and filaments in vitro. However, it is difficult to appreciate the function of P5CS filamentation without precise structures. Using cryo-electron microscopy, here we solve structures of <i>Drosophila</i> full-length P5CS in three states at resolution from 3.1 to 4.3 Å. We observe distinct ligand-binding states and conformational changes for the GK and GPR domains, respectively. Divergent helical filaments are assembled by P5CS tetramers and stabilized by multiple interfaces. Point mutations disturbing those interfaces prevent P5CS filamentation and greatly reduce the enzymatic activity. Our findings reveal that filamentation is crucial for the coordination between the GK and GPR domains, providing structural basis for catalytic function of P5CS filaments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation of the CaMKII-Sarm1-ASK1-p38 MAP kinase pathway protects against axon degeneration caused by loss of mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial defects are tightly linked to axon degeneration, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans,</i> PVQ axons that lack mitochondria degenerate spontaneously with age. Using an unbiased genetic screen, we found that cell-specific activation of CaMKII/UNC-43 suppresses axon degeneration due to loss of mitochondria. Unexpectedly, CaMKII/UNC-43 activates the conserved Sarm1/TIR-1-ASK1/NSY-1-p38 MAPK pathway and eventually the transcription factor CEBP-1 to protect against degeneration. In addition, we show that disrupting a trafficking complex composed of calsyntenin/CASY-1, Mint/LIN-10, and kinesin suppresses axon degeneration. Further analysis indicates that disruption of this trafficking complex activates the CaMKII-Sarm1-MAPK pathway through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Our findings identify CaMKII as a pivot point between mitochondrial defects and axon degeneration, describe how it is regulated, and uncover a surprising neuroprotective role for the Sarm1-p38 MAPK pathway in this context.

                The mammalian circadian clock exerts control of daily gene expression through cycles of DNA binding. Here we develop a quantitative model of how a finite pool of BMAL1 protein can regulate thousands of target sites over daily time scales. We used quantitative imaging to track dynamic changes in endogenous labelled proteins across peripheral tissues and the SCN. We determine the contribution of multiple rhythmic processes coordinating BMAL1 DNA binding, including cycling molecular abundance, binding affinities and repression. We find nuclear BMAL1 concentration determines corresponding CLOCK through heterodimerization and define a DNA residence time of this complex. Repression of CLOCK:BMAL1 is achieved through rhythmic changes to BMAL1:CRY1 association and high affinity interactions between PER2:CRY1 which mediates CLOCK:BMAL1 displacement from DNA. Finally, stochastic modelling reveals a dual role for PER:CRY complexes in which increasing concentrations of PER2:CRY1 promotes removal of BMAL1:CLOCK from genes consequently enhancing ability to move to new target sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early lock-in of structured and specialised information flows during neural development</a></h4>

              
                The brains of many organisms are capable of complicated distributed computation underpinned by a highly advanced information processing capacity. Although substantial progress has been made towards characterising the information flow component of this capacity in mature brains, there is a distinct lack of work characterising its emergence during neural development. This lack of progress has been largely driven by the lack of effective estimators of information processing operations for the spiking data available for developing neural networks. Here, we leverage recent advances in this estimation task in order to quantify the changes in transfer entropy during development. We do so by studying the changes in the intrinsic dynamics of the spontaneous activity of developing dissociated neural cell cultures.  We find that the quantity of information flowing across these networks undergoes a dramatic increase across development. Moreover, the spatial structure of these flows exhibits a tendency to lock in at the point when they arise, after which there is a substantial temporal correlation in the information flows across recording days. We analyse the flow of information during the crucial periods of population bursts. We find that, during these bursts, nodes tend to undertake specialised computational roles as either transmitters, mediators or receivers of information, with these roles tending to align with their average spike ordering - either early, mid or late in the bursts. Further, we find that the specialised computational roles occupied by nodes during bursts are regularly locked-in when the information flows are established. Finally, we briefly compare these results to information flows in a model network developing according to an STDP learning rule from a state of independent firing to synchronous bursting. The phenomena of large increases in information flow, early lock-in of information flow spatial structure and computational roles based on burst position were also observed in this model, hinting at the broader generality of these phenomena.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selective YAP activation in Procr cells is essential for ovarian stem/progenitor expansion and epithelium repair</a></h4>

              
                Ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) undergoes recurring ovulatory rupture and OSE stem cells rapidly generate new cells for the repair. How the stem cell activation is triggered by the rupture and promptly turns on proliferation is unclear. Our previous study has identified that Protein C Receptor (Procr) marks OSE progenitors. In this study, we observed decreased adherent junction and selective activation of YAP signaling in Procr progenitors at OSE rupture site. OSE repair is impeded upon deletion of Yap1 in these progenitors. Interestingly, Procr+ progenitors show lower expression of Vgll4, an antagonist of YAP signaling. Overexpression of Vgll4 in Procr+ cells hampers OSE repair and progenitor proliferation, indicating that selective low Vgll4 expression in Procr+ progenitors is critical for OSE repair. In addition, YAP activation promotes transcription of the OSE stemness gene <i>Procr</i>. The combination of increased cell division and Procr expression leads to expansion of Procr+ progenitors surrounding the rupture site. These results illustrate a YAP-dependent mechanism by which the stem/progenitor cells recognize the murine ovulatory rupture, and rapidly multiply their numbers, highlighting a YAP-induced stem cell expansion strategy.

                TDP-43 mediates proper Stathmin-2 (STMN2) mRNA splicing, and STMN2 protein is reduced in the spinal cord of most ALS patients. To test the hypothesis that STMN2 loss contributes to ALS pathogenesis, we generated constitutive and conditional STMN2 knockout mice. Constitutive STMN2 loss results in early-onset sensory and motor neuropathy featuring impaired motor behavior and dramatic distal neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation of fast-fatigable motor units, which are selectively vulnerable in ALS, without axon or motoneuron degeneration. Selective excision of STMN2 in motoneurons leads to similar NMJ pathology. STMN2 KO heterozygous mice, which better model the partial loss of STMN2 protein found in ALS patients, display a slowly progressive, motor-selective neuropathy with functional deficits and NMJ denervation. Thus, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that STMN2 reduction due to TDP-43 pathology contributes to ALS pathogenesis.

                In low oxygen conditions, increases in cerebral blood flow maintain brain oxygen delivery but the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced dilations of cerebral vasculature are incompletely understood. Here we show that astrocytes accumulate nitrite and in response to hypoxia produce nitric oxide via mitochondrial reduction of nitrite by a molybdenum-containing enzyme sulfite oxidase. These data suggest that astrocytes can modulate cerebral blood flow in accord with brain tissue oxygenation via mitochondrial production of nitric oxide.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal theta and episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of rodent physiology implicate hippocampal theta as a key modulator of learning and memory (Buzsaki & Moser, 2013; J.E. Lisman & Jensen, 2013), yet human hippocampal recordings have shown divergent theta correlates of memory formation. Herweg et al. (2020) suggest that decreases in memory-related broadband power mask narrowband theta increases. Their survey also suggests that theta's role in memory appears strongest in contrasts that isolate associative retrieval processes and when aggregating signals across large brain regions. We evaluate these hypotheses by analyzing human hippocampal recordings captured as 161 neurosurgical patients performed a free recall task. Using the irregular-resampling auto-spectral analysis to separate broad and narrow-band components of the field potential we show: 1) Broadband and narrowband components of theta exhibit opposite effects, with broadband signals decreasing and narrow-band theta increasing during successful encoding; 2) Whereas low-frequency theta oscillations increase prior to successful recall, higher-frequency theta and alpha oscillations decrease, masking theta's positive effect when aggregating across the full band; 3) Theta's effects on memory encoding and retrieval do not differ between reference schemes that accentuate local signals (bipolar) and those that aggregate across large reference (whole brain average). In line with computational models that ascribe a fundamental role for hippocampal theta in memory our large-scale study of human hippocampal recordings shows that 3-4 Hz theta oscillations reliably increase during successful memory encoding and prior to spontaneous recall of previously studied items.

                Excitotoxicity is a neuronal death process initiated by over-stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Although dysregulation of proteolysis and protein phosphorylation signaling networks is critical for excitotoxicity, the identity of affected proteins and mechanisms by which they induce neuronal cell death remains unclear. To address this, we used quantitative N-terminomics to identify proteins modified by proteolysis in neurons undergoing excitotoxic cell death. Our investigation led to the discovery of proteins that, upon proteolysis by calpains, perturb synaptic organization and function. These included key synaptic regulatory proteins including CRMP2, doublecortin-like kinase I, Src tyrosine kinase and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II{beta} (CaMKII{beta}), which we found to undergo calpain-catalyzed proteolytic processing to generate stable truncated fragments with altered activities. We further show that blockade of proteolysis of Src by calpains could protect against neuronal loss in a rat model of neurotoxicity, and that CaMKII{beta} and its isoform CaMKII undergo differential processing by calpains in mouse brains under physiological conditions and during ischemic stroke. Our findings thus reveal new insights into excitotoxic neuronal death mechanisms and suggest potential therapeutic targets for neurological disorders.

                Variations in size and complexity of the cerebral cortex result from differences in neuron number and composition, which are rooted in evolutionary changes in direct and indirect neurogenesis (dNG and iNG) mediated by radial glial progenitors and intermediate progenitors, respectively. How dNG and iNG differentially contribute to cortical neuronal number, diversity, and connectivity are unknown. Establishing a genetic fate-mapping method to differentially visualize dNG and iNG in mice, we found that while both dNG and iNG contribute to all cortical structures, iNG contributes the largest relative proportions to the hippocampus and neocortex compared to insular and piriform cortex, claustrum, and the pallial amygdala. Within the neocortex, whereas dNG generates all major glutamatergic projection neuron (PN) classes, iNG differentially amplifies and diversifies PNs within each class; the two neurogenic pathways generate distinct PN types and assemble fine mosaics of lineage-based cortical subnetworks. Our results establish a ground-level lineage framework for understanding cortical development and evolution by linking foundational progenitor types and neurogenic pathways to PN types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sample size requirement for achieving multisite harmonization using structural brain MRI features</a></h4>

              
                When data is pooled across multiple sites, the extracted features are confounded by site effects. Harmonization methods attempt to correct these site effects while preserving the biological variability within the features. However, little is known about the sample size requirement for effectively learning the harmonization parameters and their relationship with the increasing number of sites. In this study, we performed experiments to find the minimum sample size required to achieve multisite harmonization (using neuroHarmonize) using volumetric and surface features by leveraging the concept of learning curves. Our first two experiments show that site-effects are effectively removed in a univariate and multivariate manner; however, it is essential to regress the effect of covariates from the harmonized data additionally. Our following two experiments with actual and simulated data showed that the minimum sample size required for achieving harmonization grows with the increasing average Mahalanobis distances between the sites and their reference distribution. We conclude by positing a general framework to understand the site effects using the Mahalanobis distance. Further, we provide insights on the various factors in a cross-validation design to achieve optimal inter-site harmonization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Examination of diurnal variation and sex differences in hippocampal neurophysiology and spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms are biological processes that cycle across 24 hours and regulate many facets of neurophysiology, including learning and memory. Circadian variation in performance on spatial memory tasks is well-documented; however, the effect of sex across circadian time remains unclear. Additionally, little is known regarding the impact of time-of-day on hippocampal neuronal physiology. Here, we investigated the influence of both sex and time-of-day on hippocampal neurophysiology and memory. Performance on the object location memory (OLM) task depended on both circadian time and sex, with memory enhanced at night in males but during the day in females. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) magnitude at CA3-CA1 synapses was greater at night compared to day in both sexes. Next, we measured spontaneous synaptic excitation and inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Frequency and amplitude of inhibition was greater during the day compared to night, regardless of sex. Frequency and amplitude of excitation was larger in females, compared to males, independent of time-of-day, although both time-of-day and sex influenced presynaptic release probability. At night, CA1 pyramidal neurons showed enhanced excitability (action potential firing and/or baseline potential) that was dependent on synaptic excitation and inhibition, regardless of sex. This study emphasizes the importance of sex and time-of- day in hippocampal physiology, especially given that many neurological disorders impacting the hippocampus are linked to circadian disruption and present differently in men and women. Knowledge about how sex and circadian rhythms affect hippocampal physiology can improve the translational relevancy of therapeutics and inform the appropriate timing of existing treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Associations between locus coeruleus MRI contrast and physiological responses to acute stress in younger and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Acute stress robustly activates the brain's noradrenergic system, the hub of which is the locus coeruleus (LC). Recent studies have indicated that structural integrity of the LC, assessed through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is associated with better cognitive outcomes in later life. However, no studies have examined whether MRI-assessed LC integrity is related to arousal responses to acute stress in either younger or older adults, despite the LC's documented role in promoting physiological arousal as part of the acute stress response. In this study, 102 younger and 51 older adults completed an acute stress induction task while we assessed multiple measures of physiological arousal (heart rate, breathing rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, sympathetic tone, and heart rate variability, HRV). We used turbo spin echo MRI scans to quantify LC MRI contrast as a measure of LC integrity. Using univariate and multivariate approaches, we assessed how LC MRI contrast was associated with arousal at rest and during acute stress reactivity and recovery. We found that in older adults, having higher caudal LC MRI contrast was associated with greater stress-related increases in systolic blood pressure and decreases in HRV, as well as lower HRV during recovery from acute stress. These results suggest that having higher caudal LC integrity in older adulthood is associated with more pronounced physiological responses to acute stress. Further work is needed to confirm these patterns in larger samples of older adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impairments in fear extinction memory and basolateral amygdala plasticity in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease are distinct from non-pathological aging.</a></h4>

              
                Fear-based disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) steepen age-related cognitive decline and doubles the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Due to the seemingly hyperactive properties of fear memories, PTSD symptoms can worsen with age. Perturbations in the synaptic circuitry supporting fear memory extinction are key neural substrates of PTSD. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a medial temporal lobe structure critical in the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of fear memories. As little is known about fear extinction memory and BLA synaptic dysfunction within the context of aging and AD, the goal of this study was to investigate how fear extinction memory deficits and basal amygdaloid nucleus (BA) synaptic dysfunction differentially associate in non-pathological aging and AD in the TgF344AD (TgAD) rat model of AD. Young, middle-aged, and older-aged WT and TgAD rats were trained on a delay fear conditioning and extinction procedure prior to ex vivo extracellular field potential recording experiments in the BA. Relative to young WT rats, long-term extinction memory was impaired, and in general, associated with a hyperexcitable BA and impaired LTP in TgAD rats at all ages. In contrast, long-term extinction memory was impaired in aged WT rats and associated with impaired LTP but not BA hyperexcitability. Interestingly, the middle-aged TgAD rats showed intact short-term extinction and BA LTP, suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, whereas differential neural recruitment in older-aged WT rats may have facilitated short-term extinction. As such, associations between fear extinction memory and amygdala deficits in non-pathological aging and AD are dissociable.

                We present a functionally relevant, quantitative characterization of the neural circuitry of Drosophila melanogaster at the mesoscopic level of neuron types as classified exclusively based on network connectivity. Starting from a large neuron-to-neuron brain-wide connectome of the fruit fly, we use stochastic block modeling and spectral graph clustering to group neurons together into a common 'cell class' if they connect to neurons of other classes according to the same probability distributions. Thus, nodes of the identified circuit represent cell classes, while the directed edges represent the connection probabilities between neurons in those respective classes. We then characterize the connectivity-based cell classes with standard neuronal biomarkers, including neurotransmitters, developmental birthtimes, morphological features, spatial embedding, and functional anatomy. Mutual information indicates that connectivity-based classification reveals aspects of neurons that are not adequately captured by traditional classification schemes. Next, using graph-theoretic and random walk analyses to identify neuron classes as hubs, sources, or destinations, we detect patterns of directional connectivity and information flow that potentially underpin specific functional interactions in the Drosophila brain. We uncover a core of highly interconnected dopaminergic cell classes functioning as the backbone information highway for multisensory integration. We also recognize glutamatergic-dominant connections between the motor and optic regions, possibly facilitating circadian rhythmic activity. Additional predicted pathways pertain to spatial orientation, fight-or-flight response, and olfactory learning. Mapping the developmental birthtimes of neurons also pinpoints the temporal change of the circuit blueprint over the fly lifespan, revealing distinct critical growth periods of individual pathways. Our analysis provides experimentally testable hypotheses critically deconstructing complex brain function from organized connectomic architecture.

                Our ability to enact successful goal-directed actions involves multiple learning processes. Among these processes, implicit motor adaptation ensures that the sensorimotor system remains finely tuned in response to changes in the body and environment. Whether Parkinson's Disease (PD) impacts implicit motor adaptation remains a contentious area of research: whereas multiple reports show impaired performance in this population, many others show intact performance. While there is a range of methodological differences across studies, one critical issue is that performance in many of the studies may reflect a combination of implicit adaptation and strategic re-aiming. Here, we revisited this controversy using a visuomotor task designed to isolate implicit adaptation. In two experiments, we found that adaptation in response to a wide range of visual perturbations (3{degrees} - 45{degrees}) was similar in PD and matched control participants. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of previously published work, we found that the mean effect size contrasting PD and controls across 16 experiments was not significant. Together, these analyses indicate that implicit adaptation is preserved in PD, offering a fresh perspective on the role of the basal ganglia in sensorimotor learning.

                Calcium imaging has been widely adopted for its ability to record from large neuronal populations. To summarize the time course of neural activity, dimensionality reduction methods, which have been applied extensively to population spiking activity, may be particularly useful. However, it is unclear if the dimensionality reduction methods applied to spiking activity are appropriate for calcium imaging. We thus carried out a systematic study of design choices based on standard dimensionality reduction methods. We also developed a novel method to perform deconvolution and dimensionality reduction simultaneously (termed CILDS). CILDS most accurately recovered the single-trial, low-dimensional time courses from calcium imaging that would have been recovered from spiking activity. CILDS also outperformed the other methods on calcium imaging recordings from larval zebrafish and mice. More broadly, this study represents a foundation for summarizing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal populations using dimensionality reduction in diverse experimental settings.

                Our brains continuously acquire sensory information and make judgments even when visual information is limited. In some circumstances, an ambiguous object can be recognized from how it moves, such as an animal hopping or a plane flying overhead. Yet it remains unclear how movement is processed by brain areas involved in visual object recognition. Here we investigate whether inferior temporal cortex, an area traditionally known for shape processing, has access to motion information during degraded shape recognition. We developed a matching task that required monkeys to recognize moving shapes with variable levels of shape degradation. Neural recordings in area IT showed that, surprisingly, some IT neurons preferred blurry shapes over clear ones. Further, many of the neurons exhibited motion sensitivity at different times during the presentation of the blurry target. Population decoding analyses showed that motion pattern could be decoded from IT neuron pseudo-populations. Contrary to previous findings, these results suggest that neurons in IT can integrate visual motion and shape information, particularly when shape information is degraded, in a way that has been previously overlooked. Our results highlight the importance of using challenging multi-feature recognition tasks to understand the role of area IT in naturalistic visual object recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chemogenetic enhancement of cAMP signaling renders hippocampal synaptic plasticity resilient to the impact of acute sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep facilitates memory storage and even brief periods of sleep loss lead to impairments in memory, particularly memories that are hippocampus dependent. In previous studies, we have shown that the deficit in memory seen after sleep loss is accompanied by deficits in synaptic plasticity. Our previous work has also found that sleep deprivation is associated with reduced levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the hippocampus, and that the reduction of cAMP mediates the diminished memory performance. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that cAMP acts as a mediator for not only the cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation, but also the observed deficits in synaptic plasticity. In this study, we expressed the heterologous Drosophila melanogaster Gs-protein coupled octopamine receptor (DmOct{beta}1R) in mouse hippocampal neurons. This receptor is selectively activated by the systemically injected ligand (octopamine), thus allowing us to increase cAMP levels in hippocampal neurons during a five-hour sleep deprivation period. Our results show that chemogenetic enhancement of cAMP during the period of sleep deprivation prevents deficits in a persistent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that is induced at the Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region. We also found that elevating cAMP levels only in the early or later half of sleep deprivation successfully prevented LTP deficits. These findings reveal that cAMP-dependent signaling pathways are key mediators of sleep deprivation at the synaptic level. Targeting these pathways could be useful in designing strategies to prevent the impact of sleep loss.

                Background: The development of therapeutics for Parkinsons disease (PD) requires the establishment of biomarker assays to enable stratifying patients, monitoring disease progression and assessing target engagement. Attempts to develop diagnostic assays based on detecting levels of the alpha-synuclein (aSYN) protein, a central player in the pathogenesis of PD, have yielded inconsistent results. Objective: To determine whether the three commercial kits that have been extensively used for total aSYN quantification in human biological fluids (from Euroimmun, MSD, and Biolegend) are capable of capturing the diversity and complexity of relevant aSYN proteoforms. Methods: We investigated and compared the ability of the different assays to detect the diversity of aSYN proteoform using a library of aSYN proteins that compromise the majority of disease-relevant aSYN variants and post-translational modification. Results: Our findings showed that none of the three tested immunoassays accurately capture the totality of relevant aSYN species and are unable to recognize most disease-associated C-terminally truncated variants of aSYN. Moreover, several N-terminal truncations and phosphorylation/nitration differentially modify the level of aSYN detection and recovery by different immunoassays, and a CSF matrix effect was observed for most of the aSYN proteoforms analyzed by the three immunoassays. Conclusions: Our results showed that these immunoassays do not capture the totality of the relevant aSYN species and therefore may not be appropriate tools to provide an accurate measure of total aSYN levels in samples containing modified forms of the protein. This highlights the need for next-generation aSYN immunoassays that capture the diversity of aSYN proteoforms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coherent network oscillations regulate quiescence and behavioral responsiveness in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Quiescent states such as sleep restore vital physiological functions across phyla and are characterized by reduced locomotion and diminished behavioral responsiveness to external stimuli. In humans, synchronous activity across cortical networks is a hallmark of deep sleep, but how network coherence elevates arousal thresholds to maintain quiescent states remains largely unclear. Here, we build on our recent discovery of slow wave activity (SWA) mediating sleep need in the R5 ring network of Drosophila and investigate interactions across sleep- and arousal mediating networks. We demonstrate that information of sleep need travels across a recently described recurrent network for sleep regulation (dFSB-helicon-R5) and elicits oscillatory Ca2+ signatures in the presynaptic terminals of the interconnected networks. Subject to circadian modulation, the sleep need mediating circuits within this network (dFSB and R5) reciprocally promote these oscillatory signatures. Optogenetically imposing slow rhythms (1 Hz) on R5 and dFSB induces entrainable quiescent states while high-frequency stimulation of R5 (10 Hz) leads to flies losing postural control. We further discover that increased excitability in the master sleep homeostat (dFSB) likely acts as a switch that synchronizes the presynaptic electrical patterns of R5 and arousal mediating neurons (helicon) at night. Exposing the behavioral significance by optogenetically mimicking coherent activity we show that R5/helicon synchronization facilitates suppression of responsiveness to visual stimuli in sleeping flies. Moreover, neural activity in downstream head-direction neurons targeted by both helicon and R5 can be completely inhibited through activation of the R5 network. We therefore propose that sleep need mediating circuits promote coherent SWA to induce quiescent states by rhythmically associating neural networks that mediate locomotion, arousal and postural control.

                Neurotransmitters are released by exocytosis from synaptic vesicles at the active zone in the presynaptic terminal. The scaffold of the active zone consists of only a few evolutionarily conserved proteins, including RIM, CAST/ELKS, and RIM-BP, and tethers Munc13 and Ca2+ channels. The molecular principles that enable these proteins to mediate synaptic diversity have remained unclear. Here, we identified synapse type-specific molecular nanoconfigurations in the active zone by systematic quantification of active zone proteins using nanoscopy at two types of excitatory synapses and two types of inhibitory synapses in the rat hippocampal CA3 region. Quantitative analysis revealed that Munc13 content was particularly varied among the various synapse types and that the physical proximity of Ca2+ channels to the active zone scaffolds correlated with the efficacy of neurotransmitter release. We propose that the active zone is a flexible supramolecular assembly that can tune its composition and spatial configuration to adjust neurotransmitter release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel automated morphological analysis of microglia activation using a deep learning assisted model</a></h4>

              
                There is growing evidence for the key role of microglial activation in brain pathophysiology. Consequently, there is a need for efficient automated methods to measure the morphological changes distinctive of microglia functional states in research settings. Currently, many commonly used automated methods can be subject to sample representation bias, time consuming imaging, specific hardware requirements, and difficulty in maintaining an accurate comparison across research environments. To overcome these issues, we use commercially available deep learning tools (Aiforia(R) Cloud (Aifoira Inc., Cambridge, United States ) to quantify microglial morphology and cell counts from histopathological slides of Iba1 stained tissue sections. We provide evidence for the effective application of this method across a range of independently collected datasets in mouse models of viral infection and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive workflow with training details and annotation strategies by feature layer that can be used as a guide to generate new models. In addition, all models described in this work are shared within the Aiforia(R) platform and are available for study-specific adaptation and validation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BrainQCNet: a Deep Learning attention-based model for multi-scale detection of artifacts in brain structural MRI scans</a></h4>

              
                Analyses of structural MRI (sMRI) data depend on robust upstream data quality control (QC). It is also crucial that researchers retain the maximum amount of usable data to ensure reproducible, generalisable models. The time-consuming task of manual QC evaluation has prompted the development of tools for the automatic assessment of brain sMRI scans. Such tools are particularly valuable in this age of big data. One limitation of the most commonly used tools is that execution time is long, which poses a challenge in terms of duration and resource usage, particularly when processing large datasets. Further, evaluation is global (pass/fail) rather than localized. Having a tool that localizes areas of low quality could prevent unnecessary data loss. To address these issues, we trained a Deep Learning model, ProtoPNet, to classify minimally preprocessed 2D slices of scans that were manually annotated with a refined quality assessment (ABIDE 1 n = 980 scans). To validate the best model, we assessed 2141 ABCD scans for which gold-standard manual QC annotations were available. We obtained excellent accuracy: 82.4% for good quality scans (Pass), 91.4% for medium to low quality scans (Fail). Further validation using 799 scans from ABIDE 2 and 751 scans from ADHD-200 confirmed the reliability of our model. Accuracy was comparable to or exceeded that of another commonly used tool (MRIQC), but with dramatically reduced processing and prediction time (1 min per scan, GPU machine, CUDA-compatible). To facilitate faster and more accurate QC prediction for the neuroimaging community, we have shared the model that returned the most reliable global quality scores, local predictions of quality, and maps and prototypes of local artifacts as a BIDS-app (https://github.com/garciaml/BrainQCNet).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A robust Reeb graph model of white matter fibers with application to Alzheimer's disease progression</a></h4>

              
                Tractography generates billions of complex curvilinear fibers (streamlines) in 3D that exhibit the geometry of white matter pathways. Analysis of raw streamlines on such a large scale is time-consuming and intractable. Further, it is well known that tractography computations produce noisy streamlines, and this in turn severely affect their use in structural brain connectivity analysis. Prompted by these challenges, we propose a novel method to model the bundling structures of streamlines using the construct of a Reeb graph. Three key parameters in our method capture the geometry and topology of the streamlines: (i) {varepsilon} - distance between a pair of streamlines in a bundle that defines its sparsity; (ii)  - spatial length of the bundle that introduces persistence; and (iii) {delta} - the bundle thickness. Together, these parameters control the robustness and granularity of the model to provide a compact signature of the streamlines and their underlying anatomic fiber structure. We validate the robustness of the bundling structure using synthetic and ISMRM datasets. Next, we demonstrate the potential of this approach as a tool for efficient tractogram comparison by quantifying the fiber densities in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Our results on ADNI data localize the maximal bundles of various brain regions and show a significant depletion in the fiber density as Alzheimer's disease progresses. The source code for the implementation is available on GitHub.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synapse-type-specific competitive Hebbian learning forms functional recurrent networks</a></h4>

              
                Cortical networks exhibit complex stimulus-response patterns. Previous work has identified the balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents as a central component of cortical computations, but has not considered how the required synaptic connectivity emerges from biologically plausible plasticity rules. Using theory and modeling, we demonstrate how a wide range of cortical response properties can arise from Hebbian learning that is stabilized by the synapse-type-specific competition for synaptic resources. In fully plastic recurrent circuits, this competition enables the development and decorrelation of inhibition-balanced receptive fields. Networks develop an assembly structure with stronger connections between similarly tuned neurons and exhibit response normalization and surround suppression. These results demonstrate how neurons can self-organize into functional circuits and provide a foundational understanding of plasticity in recurrent networks.

	<p>Background: Although Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent worldwide, treating this condition remains challenging. Further, potential treatments for AUD do not fully address alcohol-induced neuroadaptive changes. Understanding the effects of pharmacotherapies for AUD on the human brain may lead to tailored, more effective treatments, and improved individual clinical outcomes. Objectives: We systematically reviewed the literature for studies investigating pharmacotherapies for AUD that included neuroimaging-based treatment outcomes. We searched the PubMed, Scielo, and PsycINFO databases up to January 2021. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: Eligible studies included those investigating pharmacotherapies for AUD and employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and/or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two independent reviewers screened studies&amp;amp;rsquo; titles and abstracts for inclusion. Data extraction forms were shared among all the authors to standardize data collection. We gathered information on the following variables: sample size; mean age; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics; alcohol use status; study design and methodology; main neuroimaging findings and brain-regions of interest (i.e., brain areas activated by alcohol use and possible pharmacological interactions); and limitations of each study. Results: Out of 177 studies selected, 20 studies provided relevant data for the research topic. Findings indicate that: (1) Acamprosate and gabapentin may selectively modulate limbic regions and the anterior cingulate cortex; (2) Naltrexone and disulfiram effects may involve prefrontal, premotor, and cerebellar regions; (3) Pharmacotherapies acting on glutamate and GABA neurotransmission involve primarily areas underpinning reward and negative affective states, and; (4) Pharmacotherapies acting on opioid and dopamine systems may affect areas responsible for the cognitive and motor factors of AUD. Limitations: Most of the studies were focused on naltrexone. A small number of studies investigated the action of disulfiram and gabapentin, and no neuroimaging studies investigated topiramate. In addition, the time between medication and neuroimaging scans varied widely across studies. Conclusions: We identified key-brain regions modulated by treatments available for AUD. Some of the regions modulated by naltrexone are not specific to the brain reward system, such as the parahippocampal gyrus (temporal lobe), parietal and occipital lobes. Other treatments also modulate not specific regions of the reward system, but play a role in the addictive behaviors, including the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The role of these brain regions in mediating the AUD pharmacotherapy response warrants investigation in future research studies.</p>

	<p>Background: Both depressive disorders (DD) and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) are caused by immune system dysfunction. Affected individuals show increased proinflammatory cytokine concentration levels. Also, it has been hypothesized that DD and PTSD might be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. The study assessed the concentration of IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10 in depression alone and with PTSD. Methods: The study involved 460 participants. Out of them, 420 subjects comprised a study group and 40 subjects comprised a control group. Each study group consisted of 60 patients with mild depression (MD), moderate depression (MOD), severe depression (SeD), MD and PTSD (MD + PTSD), MOD and PTSD (MOD + PTSD), SeD and PTSD (SeD + PTSD), and with PTSD alone. All patients had serum concentration of IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10 measured with ELISA. Results: DD and PTSD are reflected in IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10 concentration levels. It was reported that mean levels of IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-4, IL-8 increase as depression became more severe. A regular decrease in IL-10 concentration levels was noted with the onset and exacerbation of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The findings might be useful when considering chronic inflammation as a potential target or biomarker in depression and PTSD treatment.</p>
