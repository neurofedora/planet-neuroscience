                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>As a monovalent cation channel, the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel is a unique member of the transient receptor potential family. Abnormal TRPM4 activity has been identified in various neurologic disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pathologic pain, and epilepsy. Following brain hypoxia/ischemia and inflammation, TRPM4 up-regulation and enhanced activity contribute to the cell death of neurons, vascular endothelial cells, and astrocytes. Enhanced ionic influx via TRPM4 leads to cell volume increase and oncosis. Depolarization of membrane potential following TRPM4 activation and interaction between TRPM4 and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors exacerbate excitotoxicity during hypoxia. Importantly, TRPM4 expression and activity remain low in healthy neurons, making it an ideal drug target. Current approaches to inhibit or modulate the TRPM4 channel have various limitations that hamper the interpretation of TRPM4 physiology in the nervous system and potentially hinder their translation into therapy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiologic roles of TRPM4 and the different inhibitors that modulate TRPM4 activity for potential treatment of neurologic diseases.

                arXiv:2502.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of open-sourced vision-language models (VLMs) has catalyzed a plethora of applications across diverse domains. Ensuring the transparency and interpretability of these models is critical for fostering trustworthy and responsible AI systems. In this study, our objective is to delve into the internals of VLMs to interpret the functions of individual neurons. We observe the activations of neurons with respects to the input visual tokens and text tokens, and reveal some interesting findings. Particularly, we found that there are neurons responsible for only visual or text information, or both, respectively, which we refer to them as visual neurons, text neurons, and multi-modal neurons, respectively. We build a framework that automates the explanation of neurons with the assistant of GPT-4o. Meanwhile, for visual neurons, we propose an activation simulator to assess the reliability of the explanations for visual neurons. System statistical analyses on top of one representative VLM of LLaVA, uncover the behaviors/characteristics of different categories of neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18710">Bridging Critical Gaps in Convergent Learning: How Representational Alignment Evolves Across Layers, Training, and Distribution Shifts</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding convergent learning -- the extent to which artificial and biological neural networks develop similar representations -- is crucial for neuroscience and AI, as it reveals shared learning principles and guides brain-like model design. While several studies have noted convergence in early and late layers of vision networks, key gaps remain. First, much existing work relies on a limited set of metrics, overlooking transformation invariances required for proper alignment. We compare three metrics that ignore specific irrelevant transformations: linear regression (ignoring affine transformations), Procrustes (ignoring rotations and reflections), and permutation/soft-matching (ignoring unit order). Notably, orthogonal transformations align representations nearly as effectively as more flexible linear ones, and although permutation scores are lower, they significantly exceed chance, indicating a robust representational basis. A second critical gap lies in understanding when alignment emerges during training. Contrary to expectations that convergence builds gradually with task-specific learning, our findings reveal that nearly all convergence occurs within the first epoch -- long before networks achieve optimal performance. This suggests that shared input statistics, architectural biases, or early training dynamics drive convergence rather than the final task solution. Finally, prior studies have not systematically examined how changes in input statistics affect alignment. Our work shows that out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs consistently amplify differences in later layers, while early layers remain aligned for both in-distribution and OOD inputs, suggesting that this alignment is driven by generalizable features stable across distribution shifts. These findings fill critical gaps in our understanding of representational convergence, with implications for neuroscience and AI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18594">Error-related Potential driven Reinforcement Learning for adaptive Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative communication methods for individuals with motor disabilities by allowing control and interaction with external devices. Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.
  This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness.

                arXiv:2502.18725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional psychological experiments utilizing naturalistic stimuli face challenges in manual annotation and ecological validity. To address this, we introduce a novel paradigm leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs) as proxies to extract rich semantic information from naturalistic images through a Visual Question Answering (VQA) strategy for analyzing human visual semantic representation. LLM-derived representations successfully predict established neural activity patterns measured by fMRI (e.g., faces, buildings), validating its feasibility and revealing hierarchical semantic organization across cortical regions. A brain semantic network constructed from LLM-derived representations identifies meaningful clusters reflecting functional and contextual associations. This innovative methodology offers a powerful solution for investigating brain semantic organization with naturalistic stimuli, overcoming limitations of traditional annotation methods and paving the way for more ecologically valid explorations of human cognition.

                arXiv:2502.19146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Conventional echo planar imaging(EPI) based functional MRI(fMRI) uses the BOLD contrast to map activity changes in human brains. Introducing an efficient ZTE sequence for functional brain mapping can help address limitations of EPI and demonstrate the feasibility of using T1 related changes as a surrogate marker of brain activity. Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain. ZTE is robust against susceptibility artefacts and significantly reduces acoustic noise. Radial sampling pattern allows for high undersampling rates to increase temporal resolution.

                arXiv:2406.16749v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.

                arXiv:2502.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing functional brain networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding psychiatric disorders and addictive behaviors. While existing fMRI-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) show considerable promise for feature extraction, they often fall short in characterizing complex relationships between brain regions and demographic factors and accounting for interpretable variables linked to psychiatric conditions. We propose NeuroTree to overcome these limitations, integrating a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This framework leverages an attention mechanism to optimize functional connectivity (FC), thereby enhancing dynamic FC feature learning for brain disease classification. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets and provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns. These findings underscore the model's efficacy in predicting psychiatric disorders and elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.

                arXiv:2410.13866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In "Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning," Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield introduced a general technique for the systematic construction of neural ordinary differential equations with non-increasing energy or Lyapunov function. We study this energy function and identify that it is vulnerable to the problem of dead neurons. Each point in the state space where the neuron dies is contained in a non-compact region with constant energy. In these flat regions, energy function alone does not completely determine all degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, can not be used to analyze stability or find steady states or basins of attraction. We perform a direct analysis of the dynamical system and show how to resolve problems caused by flat directions corresponding to dead neurons: (i) all information about the state vector at a fixed point can be extracted from the energy and Hessian matrix (of Lagrange function), (ii) it is enough to analyze stability in the range of Hessian matrix, (iii) if steady state touching flat region is stable the whole flat region is the basin of attraction. The analysis of the Hessian matrix can be complicated for realistic architectures, so we show that for a slightly altered dynamical system (with the same structure of steady states), one can derive a diverse family of Lyapunov functions that do not have flat regions corresponding to dead neurons. In addition, these energy functions allow one to use Lagrange functions with Hessian matrices that are not necessarily positive definite and even consider architectures with non-symmetric feedforward and feedback connections.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18623">On the Privacy-Preserving Properties of Spiking Neural Networks with Unique Surrogate Gradients and Quantization Levels</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models increasingly process sensitive data, understanding their vulnerability to privacy attacks is vital. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit model responses to infer whether specific data points were used during training, posing a significant privacy risk. Prior research suggests that spiking neural networks (SNNs), which rely on event-driven computation and discrete spike-based encoding, exhibit greater resilience to MIAs than artificial neural networks (ANNs). This resilience stems from their non-differentiable activations and inherent stochasticity, which obscure the correlation between model responses and individual training samples. To enhance privacy in SNNs, we explore two techniques: quantization and surrogate gradients. Quantization, which reduces precision to limit information leakage, has improved privacy in ANNs. Given SNNs' sparse and irregular activations, quantization may further disrupt the activation patterns exploited by MIAs. We assess the vulnerability of SNNs and ANNs under weight and activation quantization across multiple datasets, using the attack model's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric, where lower values indicate stronger privacy, and evaluate the privacy-accuracy trade-off. Our findings show that quantization enhances privacy in both architectures with minimal performance loss, though full-precision SNNs remain more resilient than quantized ANNs. Additionally, we examine the impact of surrogate gradients on privacy in SNNs. Among five evaluated gradients, spike rate escape provides the best privacy-accuracy trade-off, while arctangent increases vulnerability to MIAs. These results reinforce SNNs' inherent privacy advantages and demonstrate that quantization and surrogate gradient selection significantly influence privacy-accuracy trade-offs in SNNs.

                arXiv:2502.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational demands for artificial intelligence (AI) have spurred the exploration of computing principles beyond conventional digital computers. Physical neural networks (PNNs) offer efficient neuromorphic information processing by harnessing the innate computational power of physical processes; however, training their weight parameters is computationally expensive. We propose a training approach for substantially reducing this training cost. Our training approach merges an optimal control method for continuous-time dynamical systems with a biologically plausible training method--direct feedback alignment. In addition to the reduction of training time, this approach achieves robust processing even under measurement errors and noise without requiring detailed system information. The effectiveness was numerically and experimentally verified in an optoelectronic delay system. Our approach significantly extends the range of physical systems practically usable as PNNs.

                arXiv:2502.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms frequently impose restrictive policies to moderate user content, prompting the emergence of creative evasion language strategies. This paper presents a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the iterative evolution of language strategies under regulatory constraints. In this framework, participant agents, as social media users, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents emulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a more faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies (constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an LLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of language strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios: an abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds increases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of information transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with 40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues and strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA, emphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall results.

                arXiv:2409.06706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) bridged the performance gap with Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) through sophisticated analysis of pre-trained parameter spaces. Starting from drawing insights from Neural Engrams (NE) in Biological Neural Networks (BNNs), we establish a connection between the low-rank property observed during PEFT's parameter space shifting and neurobiological mechanisms. This observation leads to our proposed method, Synapse and Neuron (SAN), which decomposes and propagates scaling components from anterior feature adjusting vectors towards posterior weight matrices. Our approach is theoretically grounded in Long-Term Potentiation/Depression (LTP/D) phenomena, which govern synapse development through neurotransmitter release modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: on \textbf{vision tasks} across VTAB, FGVC, and GIC (25 datasets) using ViT, SwinT and ConvNeXt, SAN outperforms FFT up to 8.7% and LoRA by 3.2%; on language tasks using Commonsense Reasoning (8 datasets) with LLaMA models (all generations), surpassing ChatGPT up to 8.5% and LoRA by 4.7%; on visual-language tasks using Mixed Visual Instruction (7 datasets) with LLaVA models, it exceeds FFT up to 2.4% and LoRA by 1.9%. Our code and W&B log will be released.

                arXiv:2408.04569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.

                arXiv:2408.16285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current interest in deep learning captures the attention of many programmers and researchers. Unfortunately, the lack of a unified schema for developing deep learning models results in methodological inconsistencies, unclear documentation, and problems with reproducibility. Some guidelines have been proposed, yet currently, they lack practical implementations. Furthermore, neural network training often takes on the form of trial and error, lacking a structured and thoughtful process. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we introduce Art, a Python library designed to help automatically impose rules and standards while developing deep learning pipelines. Art divides model development into a series of smaller steps of increasing complexity, each concluded with a validation check improving the interpretability and robustness of the process. The current version of Art comes equipped with nine predefined steps inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Recipe for Training Neural Networks, a visualization dashboard, and integration with loggers such as Neptune. The code related to this paper is available at: https://github.com/SebChw/Actually-Robust-Training.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                <p>The detrimental effects of oligomeric amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) on synapses are considered the leading cause for cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. However, through which mechanism A&beta; oligomers impair synaptic structure and function remains unknown. Here, we used electrophysiology and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) imaging on mouse and rat neurons to demonstrate that GluA3 expression in neurons lacking GluA3 is sufficient to resensitize their synapses to the damaging effects of A&beta;, indicating that GluA3-containing AMPARs at synapses are necessary and sufficient for A&beta; to induce synaptic deficits. We found that A&beta; oligomers trigger the endocytosis of GluA3 and promote its translocation toward endolysosomal compartments for degradation. Mechanistically, these A&beta;-driven effects critically depend on the PDZ-binding motif of GluA3. A single point mutation in the GluA3 PDZ-binding motif prevented A&beta;-driven effects and rendered synapses fully resistant to the effects of A&beta;. Correspondingly, proteomics on synaptosome fractions from APP/PS1-transgenic mice revealed a selective reduction of GluA3 at an early age. These findings support a model where the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of GluA3-containing AMPARs are a critical early step in the cascade of events through which A&beta; accumulation causes a loss of synapses.</p>

                <p>Generative models have diverse applications, including language processing and birdsong analysis. In this study, we demonstrate how a statistical test, designed to prevent overgeneralization in sequence generation, can be used to infer minimal models for the syllable sequences in Bengalese finch songs. We focus on the partially observable Markov model (POMM), which consists of states and the probabilistic transitions between them. Each state is associated with a specific syllable, with the possibility that multiple states may correspond to the same syllable. This characteristic differentiates the POMM from a standard Markov model, where each syllable is linked to a single state. The presence of multiple states for a syllable suggests that transitions between syllables are influenced by the specific contexts in which these transitions occur. We apply this method to analyze the songs of six adult male Bengalese finches, both before and after they were deafened. Our results indicate that auditory feedback plays a crucial role in shaping the context-dependent syllable transitions characteristic of Bengalese finch songs.</p>

                <p>Blunted sensitivity to ethanol&rsquo;s aversive effects can increase motivation to consume ethanol; yet, the neurobiological circuits responsible for encoding these aversive properties are not fully understood. Plasticity in cells projecting from the anterior insular cortex (aIC) to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical for taste aversion learning and retrieval, suggesting this circuit&rsquo;s potential involvement in modulating the aversive properties of ethanol. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GABAergic currents onto aIC-&gt;BLA projections would be facilitated as a consequence of retrieval of an ethanol-conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Consistent with this hypothesis, frequency of mIPSCs was increased 1&nbsp;h following retrieval of an ethanol-CTA across cell layers in aIC-&gt;BLA projection neurons. This increase in GABAergic plasticity occurred in a circuit-specific, time-limited, and ethanol-CTA retrieval-dependent manner. Additionally, local inhibitory inputs onto layer 2/3 aIC-&gt;BLA projection neurons were greater in number and strength following ethanol-CTA. Finally, DREADD-mediated inhibition of aIC parvalbumin-expressing cells blunted the retrieval of ethanol-CTA in male, but not female, mice. Collectively, this work implicates a circuit-specific and memory retrieval-dependent increase in GABAergic tone following retrieval of an ethanol-CTA, thereby advancing our understanding of how the aversive effects of ethanol are encoded in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/9/e0688242024?rss=1">A Shift Toward Supercritical Brain Dynamics Predicts Alzheimers Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with continuum of disease progression of increasing severity from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and lastly to AD. The transition from MCI to AD has been linked to brain hypersynchronization, but the underlying mechanisms leading to this are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that excessive excitation in AD disease progression would shift brain dynamics toward supercriticality across an extended regime of critical-like dynamics. In this framework, healthy brain activity during aging preserves operation at near the critical phase transition at balanced excitation&ndash;inhibition (E/I). To test this hypothesis, we used source-reconstructed resting-state MEG data from a cross-sectional cohort (<I>N</I> = 343) of individuals with SCD, MCI, and healthy controls (HC) as well as from a longitudinal cohort (<I>N</I> = 45) of MCI patients. We then assessed brain criticality by quantifying long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) and functional EI (fE/I) of neuronal oscillations. LRTCs were attenuated in SCD in spectrally and anatomically constrained regions while this breakdown was progressively more widespread in MC. In parallel, fE/I was increased in the MCI but not in the SC cohort. Both observations also predicted the disease progression in the longitudinal cohort. Finally, using machine learning trained on functional (LRTCs, fE/I) and structural (MTL volumes) features, we show that LRTCs and f/EI are the most informative features for accurate classification of individuals with SCD while structural changes accurate classify the individuals with MCI. These findings establish that a shift toward supercritical brain dynamics reflects early AD disease progression.</p>

                <p>The development of the nervous system is a complex process, with many challenging scientific questions yet to be resolved. Disruptions in brain development are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability and autism. While the genetic basis of autism is well established, the precise pathological mechanisms remain unclear. Variations on chromosome 2q have been linked to autism, yet the specific genes responsible for the disorder have not been identified. This study investigates the role of the transmembrane protein 169 (<I>TMEM169</I>) gene, located on human chromosome 2q35, which has not been previously characterized. Our findings indicate that<I> Tmem169</I> is highly expressed in the nervous system, and its deletion in the male mouse dorsal forebrain results in neuronal morphological abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction. Notably, <I>Tmem169</I>-deficient mice, irrespective of sex, display behavioral traits resembling those observed in individuals with autism. These results suggest that Tmem169 interacts with several key neuronal proteins, many of which are implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Tmem169 promotes neuronal process and synapse development through its interaction with Shank3.</p>

                <p>Damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) results in visual field deficits on the contralateral side of the world corresponding to the damaged region. Patients with such loss nonetheless show varying residual vision within this apparently blind region, with the neural mechanisms underlying this ability obscured by small study populations. We identified lesions on structural scans from 39 patients (12 female) with hemianopia and occipital lobe damage. We estimated the proportion of damage throughout the visual cortex and correlated this with performance in up to three different tests of residual vision in the blind field. We then performed voxel-based lesion&ndash;symptom mapping (VLSM) to determine the precise neural regions associated with residual vision. V1 damage did not show a relationship with residual vision measured with any task, although the extent of damage to V4 and hMT+/V5 both correlated with the ability to detect contrast-modulated stimuli. Indeed, damage to hMT+/V5 severely impacted performance across all three tasks, particularly motion detection. Although hMT+/V5 appeared necessary for residual vision, some patients with intact hMT+/V5 had no residual vision, indicating this area alone was not sufficient. VLSM revealed that damage to the optic radiation laterally was most highly associated with poor residual vision. Thus, VLSM indicates that hMT+/V5 and the optic radiation specifically are critical for residual vision in hemianopia.</p>

                <p>How do the neural representations underlying category learning change as skill develops? We examined perceptual category learning using a prototype learning task known to recruit a corticostriatal system including the posterior striatum, motor cortex, visual cortex, and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Male and female human participants practiced categorizing stimuli as category members or nonmembers (A vs not-A) across 3&nbsp;d, with fMRI data collected at the beginning and end. Univariate analyses found that corticostriatal activity in regions associated with habitual instrumental learning was recruited across both sessions, but activity in regions associated with goal-directed instrumental learning decreased from Day 1 to Day 3. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) indicated that after training, the trained category could be more easily decoded from the IPS when compared with a novel category. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) showed development of category representations in the IPS and motor cortex. In addition, RSA revealed evidence for category-related representations including prototype representation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex which may reflect parallel development of schematic memory for the category structure. Overall, the results converge to show how performance of category decisions and representations of the category structure emerge after extensive training across the corticostriatal system underlying perceptual category learning.</p>

                <p>Reciprocal neuronal connections exist between the internal organs of the body and the nervous system. These projections to and from the viscera play an essential role in maintaining and fine-tuning organ responses in order to sustain homeostasis and allostasis. Functional maps of brain regions participating in this bidirectional communication have been previously studied in awake humans and anesthetized rodents. To further refine the mechanistic understanding of visceral influence on brain states, however, new paradigms that allow for more invasive, and ultimately more informative, measurements and perturbations must be explored. Furthermore, such paradigms should prioritize human translatability. In the current paper, we address these issues by demonstrating the feasibility of nonanesthetized animal imaging during visceral manipulation. More specifically, we used a barostat interfaced with an implanted gastric balloon to cyclically induce distension of a nonanesthetized male rat's stomach during simultaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging. General linear modeling and spatial independent component analysis revealed several regions with BOLD activation temporally coincident with the gastric distension stimulus. The ON&ndash;OFF (20&ndash;0&nbsp;mmHg) barostat balloon pressure cycle resulted in widespread BOLD activation of the inferior colliculus, cerebellum, ventral midbrain, and a variety of hippocampal structures. These results suggest that neuroimaging models of gastric manipulation in the nonanesthetized rat are achievable and provide an avenue for more comprehensive studies involving the integration of other neuroscience techniques like electrophysiology.</p>

                <p>The inner ear houses both hearing and balance sensory modalities. The hearing and balance organs consist of similar cell types, including sensory hair cells and associated supporting cells. Previously we showed that <I>Notch1</I> is required for maintaining supporting cell survival during cochlear maturation. To understand the role of Notch during vestibular maturation, we deleted <I>Notch1</I> from the vestibular organs of both male and female mice at birth. Histological analyses showed a reduction of supporting cells accompanied by an increase in type II hair cells, indicating a conversion of supporting cells to hair cells. Analysis of mature sensory organs indicate the converted hair cells survive, despite a severe reduction of supporting cells. Vestibular sensory evoked potentials (VsEPs), thought to be generated within the striola regions of the maculae, were absent, indicating that NOTCH1 is critical for striolar function. Specialized type I hair cells in the striola failed to develop the complex calyces typical of these cells. <I>Notch1</I> mutants did not exhibit vestibular behaviors such as circling and head shaking but showed difficulties with tests of balance and swimming. These results indicate that, unlike the cochlea, supporting cells in balance organs retain the plasticity to convert to hair cells which can survive into adulthood. Despite hair cell survival, vestibular function is compromised likely due to the loss of supporting cells and altered innervation.</p>

                <p>Recordings from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show strong beta-band oscillations (13&ndash;35&nbsp;Hz), which can be modulated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). While high-frequency DBS (&gt;100&nbsp;Hz) ameliorates motor symptoms and reduces beta activity in the basal ganglia and motor cortex, the effects of low-frequency DBS (&lt;30&nbsp;Hz) are less clear. Clarifying these effects is relevant for the debate about the role of beta oscillations in motor slowing, which might be causal or epiphenomenal. Here, we investigated how subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta-band DBS affects cortical beta oscillations and motor performance. We recorded the magnetoencephalogram of 14 PD patients (nine males) with DBS implants while on their usual medication. Following a baseline recording (DBS OFF), we applied bipolar DBS at beta frequencies (10, 16, 20, 26, and 30&nbsp;Hz) via the left electrode in a cyclic fashion, turning stimulation on (5&nbsp;s) and off (3&nbsp;s) repeatedly. Cyclic stimulation was applied at rest and during right-hand finger tapping. In the baseline recording, we observed a negative correlation between the strength of hemispheric beta power lateralization and the tap rate. Importantly, beta-band DBS accentuated the lateralization and reduced the tap rate proportionally. The change in lateralization was specific to the alpha/beta range (8&ndash;26&nbsp;Hz), outlasted stimulation, and did not depend on the stimulation frequency, suggesting a remote-induced response rather than entrainment. Our study demonstrates that cortical beta oscillations can be manipulated by STN beta-band DBS. This manipulation has consequences for motor performance, supporting a causal role of beta oscillations.</p>

                <p>Based on the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons during behavioral states, the DA system has long been thought to be foundational in regulating sleep&ndash;wake behavior; over the past decade, advances in circuit manipulation and recording techniques have strengthened this perspective. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that DA release in regions of the limbic system is important in the promotion of REM sleep. Yet how DA dynamics change within bouts of sleep, how these changes are regulated, and whether they influence future state changes remains unclear. To address these questions, in mice of both sexes we used in vivo fiber photometry and inhibitory optogenetics to identify a specific role of DA transients in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in state transitions from NREM sleep. We found that DA transients increase their frequency and amplitude over the duration of NREM sleep and that this increase is more pronounced during NREM bouts that transition into REM sleep. Next, we found that DA transients in NREM sleep are influenced by changes in REM sleep pressure. Finally, we show that transient DA release in the NAcc plays a functional role in regulating the timing of REM sleep entrances, as inhibition of midbrain DA neuron terminals in the NAcc prolonged bouts of NREM sleep and decreased the frequency of bouts of REM sleep. These findings demonstrate that DA release in the NAcc is dynamically regulated by sleep pressure and has a functional role in transitions from NREM sleep, particularly those into REM sleep.</p>

                <p>Ghrelin enhances feeding by activating the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). In the brain, GHSRs are expressed in regions responsible for regulating food motivation including the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Endogenous cannabinoids also promote food-seeking behaviors through the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB-1Rs) in brain regions including the VTA. It is not known, however, if ghrelin and endocannabinoids interact in the VTA to produce these effects. We therefore examined if GHSR and CB-1R interact within the VTA to enhance food motivation. Results show that GHSR and CB-1R mRNA are expressed in the VTA cells in male and female rats and mice, with the GHSR being expressed in dopamine cells and the CB-1R being expressed primarily in nondopaminergic cells with no obvious sex differences. Ghrelin directly activated and increased excitatory tone onto dopamine cells of male and female mice. Male rats lacking fully functional GHSR signaling showed disrupted gene expression of transcripts important for regulating the synthesis, release, and degradation of endocannabinoids and lowered the levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) within the VTA. Moreover, pharmacological antagonism of VTA CB-1Rs attenuates the orexigenic and appetitive effects of intra-VTA ghrelin in rats and blocks the ability of ghrelin to promote excitatory drive to VTA dopamine neurons. Finally, blocking the breakdown of cannabinoids in the VTA enhances the effects of ghrelin on food motivation. Together, our data show that ghrelin stimulates VTA dopamine cells and ultimately food motivation in part through a mechanism that involves endocannabinoid signaling at the CB-1R.</p>

                <p>Limits on information processing capacity impose limits on task performance. We show that male and female mice achieve performance on a perceptual decision task that is near-optimal given their capacity limits, as measured by policy complexity (the mutual information between states and actions). This behavioral profile could be achieved by reinforcement learning with a penalty on high complexity policies, realized through modulation of dopaminergic learning signals. In support of this hypothesis, we find that policy complexity suppresses midbrain dopamine responses to reward outcomes. Furthermore, neural and behavioral reward sensitivity were positively correlated across sessions. Our results suggest that policy compression shapes basic mechanisms of reinforcement learning in the brain.</p>

                <p>Our visual system enables us to effortlessly navigate and recognize real-world visual environments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest a network of scene-responsive cortical visual areas, but much less is known about the temporal order in which different scene properties are analyzed by the human visual system. In this study, we selected a set of 36 full-color natural scenes that varied in spatial structure and semantic content that our male and female human participants viewed both in 2D and 3D while we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. MEG enables tracking of cortical activity in humans at millisecond timescale. We compared the representational geometry in the MEG responses with predictions based on the scene stimuli using the representational similarity analysis framework. The representational structure first reflected the spatial structure in the scenes in time window 90&ndash;125&nbsp;ms, followed by the semantic content in time window 140&ndash;175&nbsp;ms after stimulus onset. The 3D stereoscopic viewing of the scenes affected the responses relatively late, from ~140&nbsp;ms from stimulus onset. Taken together, our results indicate that the human visual system rapidly encodes a scene's spatial structure and suggest that this information is based on monocular instead of binocular depth cues.</p>

                <p>Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging is a well-established neuroimaging technology that offers high spatiotemporal resolution and a large field of view. Typical strategies for analyzing fUS data comprise either region-based averaging, typically based on reference atlases, or correlation with experimental events. Nevertheless, these methodologies possess several inherent limitations, including a restricted utilization of the spatial dimension and a pronounced bias influenced by preconceived notions about the recorded activity. In this study, we put forth single-voxel clustering as a third method to address these issues. A comparison was conducted between the three strategies on a typical dataset comprising visually evoked activity in the superior colliculus in awake mice. The application of single-voxel clustering yielded the generation of detailed activity maps, which revealed a consistent layout of activity and a clear separation between hemodynamic responses. This method is best considered as a complement to region-based averaging and correlation. It has direct applicability to challenging contexts, such as paradigm-free analysis on behaving subjects and brain decoding.</p>

Self-assessed intensity of emotions attributed to abortion in a national sample of women aged 41 to 45 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background It is widely reported that the most prominent emotion following abortions is relief. This claim primarily rests on two studies of abortion clinic patients which had methodological and self-censure bias. Other studies have indicated that negative emotions are more common than positive emotions. The objective of this study is to obtain self-assessed data on the intensity of emotional responses to abortion and pregnancy loss in a random national sample. Methods Using visual analog scales, a random sample of 1,925 women aged 41 to 45 completed a survey in which respondents rated the degree to which they experienced emotional responses to their first abortion or natural pregnancy loss. The emotions assessed included relief, grief, depression, anxiety, guilt, emptiness, anger, regret, shame, unforgiveness of self, uncontrollable weeping, frequent thoughts of the child they could have had, and difficulty completing the grief process. Women were categorized into five groups based on pregnancy outcomes, and four abortion decision types: Wanted, Inconsistent, Unwanted, or Coerced. Results Among women with a history of abortion (n=409), negative emotions were reported more intensely than relief. Relief was the predominant emotion only among the 29.8% of women whose abortions were freely wanted and consistent with their own values and preferences. For all other groups, relief was low and negative emotions were more prominent. Emotions following natural pregnancy losses were similar to those following abortion, but less severe following wanted abortions and more severe following coerced abortions. Conclusions Relief is only common after freely wanted abortions. Most abortions are inconsistent or contrary to women’s own values. In these cases, strong negative emotions are far more dominant than relief. These results should inform pre-abortion screening, counseling supportive of women’s own values and preferences, and mental health support post-abortion.

Treatment depends on the dominance of one histologic type. Knowledge of the genetic data of this association offers opportunity of treatment with the new targeted-therapy molecules. Surgical resection, may remain the curative treatment. Conclusions: Synchronous adenocarcinoma and GIST has been more commonly described in the stomach.  The pathogeneses of tumorigenesis may not be the same for the two tumors. More studies seem be necessary to clarify a potential role of different genes in the development of adenocarcinomas. And therefore, above all their therapeutic implications

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v1?src=rss">Impact of oral health perception on the quality of life of hospital staff [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The perception of oral health that hospital staff may have has repercussions on the general quality of life that they lead and the corresponding work performance. This work attempts to show how these two dimensions of the human being go hand in hand, which would provide the necessary knowledge to draw up strategies that can alleviate the aforementioned profile, and at the same time would help to build a work context that could well have a healthier horizon. Aim To determine the relationship between quality of life (QoL) and oral health perception (OHP) in the staff of level II-1 hospital, located in the northern zone of Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, a cross-sectional design, an applied type and a correlational-causal scope. The participation consisted of 72 participants. Reference was made to the validated questionnaires OHIP-14 and HU-DBI, which allow measuring the quality of life and the perception of oral health, and obtained reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Data processing was carried out by applying the Spearman correlation coefficient and ordinal logistic regression. Results The analyses showed a significant association between quality of life and oral health perception (Rho=0.391, p<0.05), with an impact of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R square. The dimensions of quality of life that most significantly influenced oral health perception were physical limitation (Rho=0.319, p<0.05) and social limitation (Rho=0.242, p<0.05). Regarding the general results, the excellent level of quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while the low level of oral health perception was the most frequent, with 52.8%. Conclusion The link between quality of life and the perception of oral health in hospital staff emphasizes the need to implement comprehensive strategies that optimize their well-being and work performance, contributing significantly to improving hospital services.

                Objective To develop an affordable kidney phantom for ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy training model. Methods Twenty one kidney models were manufactured and implemented as ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) training models for urologists without any prior experience of independently performing PCNL in Indonesia. The unit cost of an alternative model was less than 30 USD (IDR 450,000). Twenty one junior with no prior experience of performing ultrasound guided PCNL participated in the research. The evaluation was done through anonymous responses to a questionnaire using the Likert scale. Result The affordable PCNL model showed highly positive results among all participants (realistic anatomy 7.86/10, realistic visualization of calyx 8.19/10, realistic puncture 7.43/10, guidewire placement 8.19/10, realistic nephrostomy 7.57/10, stone visualization 7.76/10, feedback 7.52/10, post-training discussion 8.57/10). All of the participants recommended the affordable PCNL model phantom for ultrasound guided PCNL training in Indonesia. Conclusion An affordable model utilizing 3D printed mould, silicone, and gelatine jelly is a feasible option for ultrasound guided PCNL training among urologists in developing countries. The utilization of 3D printing and silicone moulding will be beneficial in reducing the cost of surgery model while preserving the realistic tactile feedback.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-236/v1?src=rss">Crush of Plasmatic Flesh: Dual Reproduction of Characters and Abjection in Manga Dragon Ball [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper analyzes the mechanism of the proliferation and disappearance of graphical characters in the manga Dragon Ball, a globally successful media franchise. Dragon Ball was serialized by Japanese manga artist, Toriyama Akira (1955–2024), in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine between 1984 and 1995. The manga, published in 42 volumes, was animated for TV from 1986 to 1996 as Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. Methods In support of the arguments on animation, such as Susan Napier’s metamorphosis, Sergei Eisenstein’s plasmaticity, and theories on characters in anime and manga studies, this paper analyses visual properties of characters in Toriyama’s Drgaon Ball, with a special focus on the graphical and biological reproduction. Results This paper found that characters in Dragon Ball operate as a vessel for the shape-shifting fluidity of ink lines. The free kinetic movement of lines results in the graphical proliferation of characters and reproduction devoid of sexual expression. This is a version of the “abjection” — a reaction of the subject to reject familiar things as something horrific — that Napier argued regarding metamorphosis in turn-of-the-century Japanese anime. In Dragon Ball, muscular men’s battles hide the potentially grotesque graphic/biological proliferation of the characters. What stops this medium-specific proliferation of images is light as the lack of ink, a media-aesthetic element inherent to manga and anime. It is not flesh-and-blood combat but energy waves that inflict death on the villains who resurrect even from a single cell, just as lines drawn in ink multiply endlessly. Conclusions These findings offer rich insights into the history of visual popular media in post-war Japan. The glow of the energy waves expressed by the lack of ink echoes the repeated motif of mass destruction in the history of Japanese anime and manga, which reminds us of the extinction of lives in the atomic bomb explosions.

                <p>by Sara Ershadmanesh, Sahar Rajabi, Reza Rostami, Rani Moran, Peter Dayan</p>

Humans and animals use multiple control systems for decision-making. This involvement is subject to meta-cognitive regulation – as a form of control over control or meta-control. However, the nature of this meta-control is unclear. For instance, Model-based (MB) control may be boosted when decision-makers generally lack confidence as it is more statistically efficient; or it may be suppressed, since the MB controller can correctly assess its own unreliability. Since control and metacontrol are themselves subject to the influence of neuromodulators, we examined the effects of perturbing the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems with propranolol and L-DOPA, respectively. We first administered a simple perceptual task to examine the effects of the manipulations on meta-cognitive ability. Using Bayesian analyses, we found that 81<i>%</i> of group M-ratio samples were lower under propranolol relative to Placebo, suggesting a decrease of meta-cognitive ability; and 60<i>%</i> of group M-ratio samples were higher under L-DOPA relative to Placebo, considered as no effect of L-DOPA on meta-cognitive ability . We then asked subjects to provide choices and confidence ratings in a two-outcome decision-making task that has been used to dissociate Model-free (MF) and MB control. MB behavior was enhanced by propranolol, while MF behavior was not significantly affected by either drug. The interaction between confidence and MF/MB behavior was highly variable under propranolol, but under L-DOPA, the interaction was significantly lower/higher relative to Placebo. Our results suggest a decrease in metacognitive ability under the influence of propranolol and an enhancement of MB behavior and meta-control under the influence of propranolol and L-DOPA, respectively. These findings shed light on the role of NE and DA in different aspects of control and meta-control and suggest potential avenues for mitigating dysfunction.

                Background The dynamic nature of consumer behavior and the complex design of banking services make digital banking interactions challenging. Automated systems/responses lack a personal touch and may lead to miscommunication creating further difficulty in retaining customers. Hence, a co-creating interaction and interactional value formation (IVF) becomes a necessity for banks to have meaningful and experiential customer interactions. This article adds to the limited body of banking literature by explaining the precursors that influence IVF in digital banking interactions. Methods 442 digitally active banking customers of private, public, and small finance banks were selected from the Karnataka region to assess the relationship of precursors with IVF. A quantitative approach was adopted through a survey questionnaire to gather the responses. The data gathered was analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0 software. Findings Knowledge has the most significant relationship with IVF. Customers perceive the seeking and sharing of information as the most critical for a co-creating interaction. Relationship quality moderately influences value formation in digital interactions; however, communication was not found to have a relationship with co-creation. Conclusions The study will help bank managers and employees align their resources to develop knowledge and relationship aspects in their digital interactions to foster co-creation. Banks must move beyond frequent, generic updates or promotional messages that may overwhelm customers. Instead, they should adopt a more tailored approach, emphasizing relevance and value in their interactions to avoid perceptions of intrusion or inefficiency.

                Background Women’s studies in Latin America are transcendental because they make visible and challenge gender inequalities to achieve a more just and equitable society. However, despite this, there are still many research gaps, for which the objective is to examine the trends in research on women’s studies in Latin America. Methods An exploratory methodology based on bibliometric analysis is proposed to evaluate the scientific literature, based on the parameters of the PRISMA-2020 declaration. Results The bibliometric analysis reveals a growth in women’s studies in Latin America, reflecting its importance and relevance. Scientific production has experienced exponential growth, with leading researchers and journals. The United States and Canada lead scientific production. A change is observed in the topics addressed, focusing more on gender and equality. The thematic clusters identified highlight priority areas such as politics, institutions and representation. Conclusions Emerging keywords include neoliberalism, gender violence, political participation, female empowerment, and femicide, reflecting new concerns and challenges addressed in gender studies in Latin America.

     alt="Review of Fish Neuropeptides: A Novel Perspective on Animal Welfare"/>
<p>Neuropeptides are conserved molecules regulating physiological processes and behaviours in fish. This review integrates recent findings on neuropeptide isoforms and their receptors, highlighting their roles in neuroendocrine, immune, digestive, and reproductive systems, and discusses how monitoring these neuropeptides can serve as a novel approach to assess fish welfare.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides are highly variable but widely conserved molecules, the main functions of which are the regulation and coordination of physiological processes and behaviors. They are synthesized in the nervous system and generally act on other neuronal and non-neuronal tissues or organs. In recent years, diverse neuropeptide isoforms and their receptors have been identified in different fish species, regulating functions in the neuroendocrine (e.g., corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine vasotocin), immune (e.g., vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and somatostatin), digestive (e.g., neuropeptide Y), and reproductive (e.g., isotocin) systems, as well as in the commensal microbiota. Interestingly, all these processes carried out by neuropeptides are integrated into the nervous system and are manifested externally in the behavior and affective states of fish, thus having an impact on the modulation of these actions. In this sense, the monitoring of neuropeptides may represent a new approach to assess animal welfare, targeting both physiological and affective aspects in fish. Therefore, although there are many studies investigating the action of neuropeptides in a wide range of paradigms, especially in mammals, their study within a fish welfare framework is scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that gathers and integrates up-to-date information on neuropeptides from an animal welfare perspective. In this review, we summarize current findings on neuropeptides in fish and discuss their possible implication in the physiological and emotional state of fish, and therefore in their welfare.</p>

<p>Immunohistochemical staining for orexin-A reveals the novel parvocellular orexinergic neuronal cluster (left) in the human brain. In comparison to the more typically observed orexinergic neurons of the main cluster (right), the parvocellular neurons have much smaller soma. Scale bar = 100 µm, applies to both images.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The phylogenetic contextualization of human neuroanatomy is crucial for understanding the positive, neutral, and/or negative effects of therapeutic interventions derived from animal models. Here we determined the parcellation of, and quantified, orexinergic (or hypocretinergic) neurons in the hypothalami of humans and several species of primates, including strepsirrhines (two species), platyrrhines (two species), cercopithecoids (three species), and hominoids (three species, including humans). The strepsirrhines, platyrrhines, and cercopithecoids presented with three distinct clusters of orexinergic neurons, revealing an organization like that observed in most mammals. In the three hominoids, an additional orexinergic cluster was found in the tuberal region of the hypothalamus, termed the optic tract cluster extension. In humans only, an additional parvocellular cluster of orexinergic neurons was observed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. The human presented with the most complex parcellation of orexinergic neurons of the primates studied. Total numbers of orexinergic neurons in nonhuman primates were strongly correlated to brain mass (<i>P</i>
<sub>uncorr</sub> = 1.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), with every doubling in brain mass leading to an ∼1.5-times increase in neuron number. In contrast, humans have approximately 74,300 orexinergic neurons, which is significantly less than the 205,000 predicted using the nonhuman primate regression for a brain mass of ∼1363 g. We conclude that although the human orexinergic system is the most complex of primates in terms of parcellation, with potential associated functional specializations, this system is quantitatively paradoxical in having a significantly lower neuronal number than expected for a primate with an ∼1363-g brain.</p>

                Bi and Bao et al. establish that BACE1 aberrantly cleaves GABAAR β1/2/3 subunits in the brains of APP23 mice and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This cleavage results in decreased GABAAR-mediated inhibitory currents. It thereby promotes neural hyperexcitability, which is regarded as a key feature and promoter of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments in AD.

                The integrity of the blood-CSF barrier in the choroid plexus is critical for a healthy brain, yet it deteriorates with aging. We find that inhibiting CTSS, a macrophage-derived protease that cleaves the epithelial tight junction at the blood-CSF barrier, rejuvenates barrier function and restores neural function in aged mice.

Their findings reveal how deep and superficial pyramidal cells independently shape parallel, manipulable spatial codes, providing key insights into hippocampal population dynamics.

Their study reveals that the X chromosomes in B cells exhibit similar compaction, unlike fibroblasts, and that B cell activation induces local-scale topologically associated domain changes independent of gene expression.

                Katkeviciute et al. demonstrate that serum containing 3OH Dodeca suppresses tumor growth. This metabolite shows efficacy across multiple solid tumors. The effect is driven via GPR84-receptor-induced production of IL-12 and CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration. Human metabolomics analysis suggests a decline in protective metabolites through tumor progression.

                Dhoonmoon et al. investigate the lesion-specific recruitment of translesion synthesis polymerases during DNA replication stress. They show that translesion synthesis occurs predominantly behind the restarted replication fork in order to fill PrimPol-derived gaps. This is essential to suppress the nucleolytic conversion of ssDNA gaps into cytotoxic DSBs.

                Kuno et al. find that afadin’s IDR-dependent condensate formation promotes linear AJ formation and AJC assembly in epithelial cells. They suggest that differential condensate properties of afadin and ZO-1 drive their separation and facilitate the spatial segregation of AJs and TJs within the AJC.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 26 February 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57002-6">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-57002-6</a></p>Human pathogenic-like Th17 cells express the chemokine receptor CCR6, but how CCR6, together with other chemokine receptors, modulate Th17 functions is still unclear. Here the authors show that CCR2 is coexpressed with CCR6 on these cells, and specifically mediates transendothelial migration, while CCR6 and other chemokine receptors induce T cell arrest on activated endothelial cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90211">Dynamic simulations of feeding and respiration of the early Cambrian periderm-bearing cnidarian polyps</a></h4>

              
                Although fossil evidence suggests the existence of an early muscular system in the ancient cnidarian jellyfish from the early Cambrian Kuanchuanpu biota (ca. 535 Ma), south China, the mechanisms underlying the feeding and respiration of the early jellyfish are conjectural. Recently, the polyp inside the periderm of olivooids was demonstrated to be a calyx-like structure, most likely bearing short tentacles and bundles of coronal muscles at the edge of the calyx, thus presumably contributing to feeding and respiration. Here, we simulate the contraction and expansion of the microscopic periderm-bearing olivooid <i>Quadrapyrgites</i> via the fluid-structure interaction computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to investigate their feeding and respiratory activities. The simulations show that the rate of water inhalation by the polyp subumbrella is positively correlated with the rate of contraction and expansion of the coronal muscles, consistent with the previous feeding and respiration hypothesis. The dynamic simulations also show that the frequent inhalation/exhalation of water through the periderm polyp expansion/contraction conducted by the muscular system of <i>Quadrapyrgites</i> most likely represents the ancestral feeding and respiration patterns of Cambrian sedentary medusozoans that predated the rhythmic jet-propelled swimming of the modern jellyfish. Most importantly for these Cambrian microscopic sedentary medusozoans, the increase of body size and stronger capacity of muscle contraction may have been indispensable in the stepwise evolution of active feeding and subsequent swimming in a higher flow (or higher Reynolds number) environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97433">An Intranet of Things approach for adaptable control of behavioral and navigation-based experiments</a></h4>

              
                Investigators conducting behavioral experiments often need precise control over the timing of the delivery of stimuli to subjects and to collect precise times of subsequent behavioral responses. Furthermore, investigators want fine-tuned control over how various multi-modal cues are presented. behaviorMate takes an ‘Intranet of Things’ approach, using a networked system of hardware and software components for achieving these goals. The system outputs a file with integrated timestamp–event pairs that investigators can then format and process using their own analysis pipelines. We present an overview of the electronic components and GUI application that make up behaviorMate as well as mechanical designs for compatible experimental rigs to provide the reader with the ability to set up their own system. A wide variety of paradigms are supported, including goal-oriented learning, random foraging, and context switching. We demonstrate behaviorMate’s utility and reliability with a range of use cases from several published studies and benchmark tests. Finally, we present experimental validation demonstrating different modalities of hippocampal place field studies. Both treadmill with burlap belt and virtual reality with running wheel paradigms were performed to confirm the efficacy and flexibility of the approach. Previous solutions rely on proprietary systems that may have large upfront costs or present frameworks that require customized software to be developed. behaviorMate uses open-source software and a flexible configuration system to mitigate both concerns. behaviorMate has a proven record for head-fixed imaging experiments and could be easily adopted for task control in a variety of experimental situations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98159">Basal ganglia output (entopeduncular nucleus) coding of contextual kinematics and reward in the freely moving mouse</a></h4>

              
                The entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) is often termed as one of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia owing to their highly convergent anatomy. The rodent EPN has been implicated in reward and value coding whereas the primate analog internal Globus Pallidus has been found to be modulated by some movements and in some circumstances. In this study, we sought to understand how the rodent EPN might be coding kinematic, reward, and difficulty parameters, particularly during locomotion. Furthermore, we aimed to understand the level of movement representation: whole-body or specific body parts. To this end, mice were trained in a freely moving two-alternative forced choice task with two periods of displacement (return and go trajectories) and performed electrophysiological recordings together with video-based tracking. We found (1) robust reward coding but not difficulty. (2) Spatio-temporal variables better explain EPN activity during movement compared to kinematic variables, while both types of variables were more robustly represented in reward-related movement. (3) Reward-sensitive units encode kinematics similarly to reward-insensitive ones. (4) Population dynamics that best account for differences between these two periods of movement can be explained by allocentric references like distance to reward port. (5) The representation of paw and licks is not mutually exclusive, discarding a somatotopic muscle-level representation of movement in the EPN. Our data suggest that EPN activity represents movements and reward in a complex way: highly multiplexed, influenced by the objective of the displacement, where trajectories that lead to reward better represent spatial and kinematic variables. Interestingly, there are intertwining representations of whole-body movement kinematics with a single paw and licking variables. Further, reward-sensitive units encode kinematics similarly to reward-insensitive ones, challenging the notion of distinct pathways for reward and movement processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84349">Error prediction determines the coordinate system used for the representation of novel dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Skillful object manipulation requires a representation of the object’s dynamics. Despite extensive research, previous studies have not been able to provide a consistent view of this representation in the motor system, with each study providing evidence favoring an extrinsic coordinate system, an intrinsic coordinate system, an object-based representation, or mixtures of these coordinate systems. In a series of experiments, we show that the motor system combines different representations based on their reliability. Specifically, since noise creates an error between planned and executed force production which depends on the arm state, the motor system will rely more on the representation for which the plan is less affected. In addition, we show that the same mechanism predicts the different results made about dynamics representation and thus explains the discrepancies between influential past studies. Overall, we are able to reconcile all of the apparently disparate findings under a single cohesive model of dynamics representation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91400">Omissions of threat trigger subjective relief and prediction error-like signaling in the human reward and salience systems</a></h4>

              
                The unexpected absence of danger constitutes a pleasurable event that is critical for the learning of safety. Accumulating evidence points to similarities between the processing of absent threat and the well-established reward prediction error (PE). However, clear-cut evidence for this analogy in humans is scarce. In line with recent animal data, we showed that the unexpected omission of (painful) electrical stimulation triggers activations within key regions of the reward and salience pathways and that these activations correlate with the pleasantness of the reported relief. Furthermore, by parametrically violating participants’ probability and intensity related expectations of the upcoming stimulation, we showed for the first time in humans that omission-related activations in the VTA/SN were stronger following omissions of more probable and intense stimulations, like a positive reward PE signal. Together, our findings provide additional support for an overlap in the neural processing of absent danger and rewards in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94754">Control of ciliary transcriptional programs during spermatogenesis by antagonistic transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Existence of cilia in the last eukaryotic common ancestor raises a fundamental question in biology: how the transcriptional regulation of ciliogenesis has evolved? One conceptual answer to this question is by an ancient transcription factor regulating ciliary gene expression in both uni- and multicellular organisms, but examples of such transcription factors in eukaryotes are lacking. Previously, we showed that an ancient transcription factor X chromosome-associated protein 5 (Xap5) is required for flagellar assembly in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. Here, we show that Xap5 and Xap5-like (Xap5l) are two conserved pairs of antagonistic transcription regulators that control ciliary transcriptional programs during spermatogenesis. Male mice lacking either Xap5 or Xap5l display infertility, as a result of meiotic prophase arrest and sperm flagella malformation, respectively. Mechanistically, Xap5 positively regulates the ciliary gene expression by activating the key regulators including Foxj1 and Rfx families during the early stage of spermatogenesis. In contrast, Xap5l negatively regulates the expression of ciliary genes via repressing these ciliary transcription factors during the spermiogenesis stage. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which temporal and spatial transcription regulators are coordinated to control ciliary transcriptional programs during spermatogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100705">Multi-omics analyses and machine learning prediction of oviductal responses in the presence of gametes and embryos</a></h4>

              
                The oviduct is the site of fertilization and preimplantation embryo development in mammals. Evidence suggests that gametes alter oviductal gene expression. To delineate the adaptive interactions between the oviduct and gamete/embryo, we performed a multi-omics characterization of oviductal tissues utilizing bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and proteomics collected from distal and proximal at various stages after mating in mice. We observed robust region-specific transcriptional signatures. Specifically, the presence of sperm induces genes involved in pro-inflammatory responses in the proximal region at 0.5 days post-coitus (dpc). Genes involved in inflammatory responses were produced specifically by secretory epithelial cells in the oviduct. At 1.5 and 2.5 dpc, genes involved in pyruvate and glycolysis were enriched in the proximal region, potentially providing metabolic support for developing embryos. Abundant proteins in the oviductal fluid were differentially observed between naturally fertilized and superovulated samples. RNA-seq data were used to identify transcription factors predicted to influence protein abundance in the proteomic data via a novel machine learning model based on transformers of integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data. The transformers identified influential transcription factors and correlated predictive protein expressions in alignment with the in vivo-derived data. Lastly, we found some differences between inflammatory responses in sperm-exposed mouse oviducts compared to hydrosalpinx Fallopian tubes from patients. In conclusion, our multi-omics characterization and subsequent in vivo confirmation of proteins/RNAs indicate that the oviduct is adaptive and responsive to the presence of sperm and embryos in a spatiotemporal manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98304">Neural mechanisms of learned suppression uncovered by probing the hidden attentional priority map</a></h4>

              
                Attentional capture by an irrelevant salient distractor is attenuated when the distractor appears more frequently in one location, suggesting learned suppression of that location. However, it remains unclear whether suppression is proactive (before attention is directed) or reactive (after attention is allocated). Here, we investigated this using a ‘pinging’ technique to probe the attentional distribution before search onset. In an EEG experiment, participants searched for a shape singleton while ignoring a color singleton distractor at a high-probability location. To reveal the hidden attentional priority map, participants also performed a continuous recall spatial memory task, with a neutral placeholder display presented before search onset. Behaviorally, search was more efficient when the distractor appeared at the high-probability location. Inverted encoding analysis of EEG data showed tuning profiles that decayed during memory maintenance but were revived by the placeholder display. Notably, tuning was most pronounced at the to-be-suppressed location, suggesting initial spatial selection followed by suppression. These findings suggest that learned distractor suppression is a reactive process, providing new insights into learned spatial distractor suppression mechanisms.

">Activation of KCC2 during development alleviates cognitive, behavioral, and neural excitability in adult CDKL5-deficient mice</a></h4>

              
                Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) characterized by severe drug-resistant epileptic disorders beginning in early childhood, along with cognitive and social impairments in later childhood and adulthood. Existing pharmacological therapies for CDD primarily focus on anti-seizure medications, which often have associated sedative side effects. In addition, there are currently no effective treatments for cognitive or behavioral impairments associated with this disorder. Postnatal development expression of CDKL5 has a similar timeline as the developmental activity of the potassium chloride co-transporter (KCC2), the maturation of which is a prerequisite for the developmental switch to fast synaptic hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by g-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAAR). This developmental GABA switch is determined by changes in the phosphorylation of multiple residues in KCC2. During this initial postnatal period, dramatic changes occur as major neuronal circuits are formed, laying down the initial pathways important for memory consolidation and behavioral processing. Currently, a knowledge gap exists in understanding KCC2 dysfunction in CDD. In adult Cdkl5 KO mice we found aberrant KCC2 phosphorylation and expression, such that KCC2 phosphorylation profile appeared immature. We examined the developmental changes in KCC2 and observed significant alterations in the phosphorylation of key residues and decreased KCC2 expression from p14 to p21. Because KCC2 loss-of-function has been strongly correlated with excessive neuronal excitation, cognitive and behavioral impairments, we examined seizure susceptibility, spatial memory, and social interaction in adult Cdkl5 KO mice following once daily administration of the KCC2 activator (OV350), or vehicle, to infant Cdkl5 KO mice. We found that adult Cdkl5 KO mice are more susceptible to kainate-induced seizures, show poor sociability and deficits in spatial learning and memory compared to WT mice. Twelve days of OV350 treatment as infants (p10 to p21) prevented the development of benzodiazepine-resistant seizures and alleviated cognitive and behavioral deficits in adult Cdkl5 KO mice. In contrast, 12 days of OV350 treatment in adult Cdkl5 KO mice had limited ability to alleviate cognitive and behavioral deficits. In summary, this study demonstrates that enhancing KCC2 function may be a potential therapeutic target for CDD and other DEEs. However, early intervention during critical developmental windows is crucial for optimal outcomes.

">Most ventral pallidal cholinergic neurons are cortically projecting bursting basal forebrain cholinergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                The ventral pallidum (VP) lies at the intersection of basal ganglia and basal forebrain circuitry, possessing attributes of both major subcortical systems. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are rapidly recruited by reinforcement feedback and project to cortical and subcortical forebrain targets; in contrast, striatal cholinergic cells are local interneurons exhibiting classical 'pause-burst' responses to rewards. However, VP cholinergic neurons (VPCNs) are less characterized, and it is unclear whether basal forebrain and striatal type cholinergic neurons mix in the VP. Therefore, we performed anterograde and mono-transsynaptic retrograde labeling, in vitro acute slice recordings and bulk calcium recordings of VPCNs. We found that VPCNs broadly interact with the affective circuitry that processes rewards and punishments, targeting the basolateral amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, the medial prefrontal cortex and the lateral habenula, while receiving inputs from the nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, central amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and the ventral tegmental area. Bulk calcium recordings revealed VPCN responses to rewards, punishments and reward-predicting cues, like those of the horizontal diagonal band of Broca of the basal forebrain. Acute slice recordings showed that most VPCNs resembled the bursting type of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), while a few of them were of the regular rhythmic type, which sharply differentiated most VPCNs from striatal cholinergic interneurons. These results were confirmed by in vivo electrophysiological recordings of putative VPCNs largely resembling bursting BFCNs. We conclude that most VPCNs are BFCNs with specialized connectivity to relay aversive and appetitive stimuli to the reinforcement circuitry, possibly implicated in mood disorders and addiction.

">Layer V Neocortical Neurons From Individuals With Drug-Resistant Epilepsy Show Multiple Synaptic Alterations but Lack Somatic Hyperexcitability</a></h4>

              
                Although neuronal hyperexcitability is the primary mechanism underlying seizure activity in epilepsy, little is known about how different neuronal mechanisms at different organizational levels contribute to network hyperexcitability in the human epileptic brain. In this study, we determined a series of cellular and synaptic properties of layer V pyramidal neurons from neocortical tissue of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy that may contribute the hyperexcitable state associated with epilepsy. Using the whole cell, patch-clamp technique, and extracellular recordings, we determined the passive and active electrophysiological properties of layer V pyramidal neurons with regular spiking phenotypes from temporal, parietal, and frontal neocortices surgically resected from individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy. Also, the glutamatergic strength, the synchronicity between presynaptic volleys and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and short-term, frequency-dependent plasticity were determined at the synaptic level. Lastly, biocytin-filled pyramidal neurons were used to perform post hoc digital reconstructions and morphometric analyses. The collected data revealed that pyramidal neurons exhibit minimal spontaneous activity, similar resting membrane potentials, and input resistance values among the temporal, parietal, and frontal neocortices. Although frontal neurons were more hyperexcitable than temporal and parietal neurons, the firing output was comparable to that previously observed in non-pathological human tissue. The digital reconstructions confirmed the identity of pyramidal neurons and revealed alterations in dendritic complexity. In contrast, the analyses of the extracellular recordings uncovered significant desynchronization between presynaptic excitability and postsynaptic activity and loss of short-term depression in response to repetitive stimulation within the gamma range (30 Hz). Our data suggest that neocortical layer V pyramidal neurons from individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy are not necessarily hyperexcitable at the somatic level. Instead, synaptic alterations, such as synaptic desynchronization and a loss of frequency-dependent short-term depression may significantly contribute to the hyperexcitable state observed during seizure activity.

">Reorganization of motor functions within visuomotor networks subsequent to somatosensory cortical damage</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory inputs are critical to motor control. Animal studies have shown that primary somatosensory lesions cause sensorimotor deficits along with disrupted organization in primary motor cortex (M1). How does damage in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) influence motor networks in humans? Using fMRI, we examined two individuals with extensive damage to left somatosensory cortex, but primarily intact motor cortex and preserved motor abilities. Given left S1 damage, tactile detection and localization were impaired for the contralesional hand in both individuals. When moving the contralesional hand, LS, with near complete damage to the S1 hand area, showed increased activation in ipsilesional putamen and deactivation in contralesional cerebellum relative to age-matched controls. These findings demonstrate influences of S1 damage to subcortical sensorimotor areas that are distant from the lesion site, and a potential reweighting of the motor network with increased action selection in putamen and inhibition of sensory prediction in cerebellum in the face of sensory loss. In contrast, RF, who had a small island of spared S1 in the hand area, showed greater activation in contralesional S1 for movement versus rest. This same region was also activated by pure somatosensory stimulation in a second experiment, suggesting that the spared S1 area in RF still subserves sensorimotor processing. Finally, the right middle occipital gyrus was more strongly activated in both individuals compared with controls, suggesting a potential reliance on visual imagery in the face of degraded sensory feedback.

">Esr1-Dependent Signaling and Transcriptional Maturation in the Medial Preoptic Area of the Hypothalamus Shapes the Development of Mating Behavior during Adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Mating and other behaviors emerge during adolescence through the coordinated actions of steroid hormone signaling throughout the nervous system and periphery. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional dynamics of the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a critical region for reproductive behavior, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and in situ hybridization techniques in male and female mice throughout adolescence development. Our findings reveal that estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional maturation of GABAergic neurons within the MPOA during adolescence. Deletion of the estrogen receptor gene, Esr1, in GABAergic neurons (Vgat+) disrupted the developmental progression of mating behaviors in both sexes, while its deletion in glutamatergic neurons (Vglut2+) had no observable effect. In males and females, these neurons displayed distinct transcriptional trajectories, with hormone-dependent gene expression patterns emerging throughout adolescence and regulated by Esr1. Esr1 deletion in MPOA GABAergic neurons, prior to adolescence, arrested adolescent transcriptional progression of these cells and uncovered sex-specific gene-regulatory networks associated with Esr1 signaling. Our results underscore the critical role of Esr1 in orchestrating sex-specific transcriptional dynamics during adolescence, revealing gene regulatory networks implicated in the development of hypothalamic controlled reproductive behaviors.

">Extracellular vesicles aid in the transfer of long-term associative memory between Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation is necessary for the survival of animals across phyla. Here, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the formation of long-term associative memory (LTAM) formed by treating Caenorhabditis elegans with a volatile chemoattractant and heat. Previous work has shown that training animals with a paradigm involving heat and isoamyl alcohol (IAA) simultaneously, causes C. elegans to lose their attraction to IAA. In this study, we elaborate on the mechanism behind this LTAM formation and suggest that during training with heat and IAA, C. elegans release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that upon being taken up by the same trained animals or their untrained counterparts causes the organism to lose attraction to IAA. Our data suggests that the vesicles are highly specific to the training paradigms used and differ with differing cues. Finally, we show that this mechanism of transfer of LTAM appears to be conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae allowing for both intra and interspecies transfer of memory.

">Mature neutrophils promote long-term functional recovery after spinal cord injury in a sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Following spinal cord injury (SCI), neutrophils are the first peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the injured spinal cord in large numbers. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating sex differences in neutrophil function, however, the role of sex as a biological variable in neutrophil response following SCI remain unclear. Additionally, while divergent roles for mature and immature neutrophil subsets have been observed, subset-specific contributions of neutrophils to functional recovery following SCI have not been fully characterized. Here, we provide novel evidence that systemic and localized neutrophil responses differ by sex following SCI. Antibody- mediated depletion of neutrophils following SCI revealed a previously unidentified role for mature neutrophils in promoting long-term functional recovery in a sex-dependent manner. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis using publicly available datasets and discovered dramatic shifts in the phenotype of intraspinal neutrophils across time following SCI. We identified that mature neutrophils in the acutely injured spinal cord upregulate genes associated with resolution of inflammation. Furthermore, we found that depletion of mature neutrophils exacerbates long-term macrophage accumulation following SCI in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, we show that the beneficial properties of neutrophils in the injured spinal cord are temporally specific. Collectively, these data provide a first account of sex differences in the response of neutrophils to SCI. Our findings elucidate a novel and sex-dependent role for mature neutrophils in promoting resolution of inflammation and long-term recovery following SCI.

">Neural variability reliably and selectively encodes pain discriminability</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity varies dramatically across time. While such variability has been associated with cognition, its relationship with pain remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically investigated the relationship between neural variability and pain, particularly pain discriminability, in five large electroencephalography (EEG) datasets (total N = 489), collected from healthy individuals (Datasets 1-4) and patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN; Dataset 5) who had received painful or nonpainful sensory stimuli. We found robust correlations between neural variability and interindividual pain discriminability. These correlations were (1) replicable in multiple datasets, (2) pain selective, as no significant correlations were observed in nonpain modalities, and (3) clinically relevant, as they were partly disrupted in patients with PHN. Importantly, variability and amplitude of EEG signals were mutually independent and had distinct temporal and oscillatory profiles in encoding pain discriminability. These findings demonstrate that neural variability is a replicable and selective indicator of pain discriminability above and beyond amplitude, thereby enhancing the understanding of neural encoding of pain discriminability and underscoring the value of neural variability in pain studies.

">Executive Functions in relation to Autonomic Control: An Overview of Neuropsychological Evaluation Methods</a></h4>

              
                Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes essential for cognitive control and coordination, enabling the achievement of objectives. These functions include mental exploration of ideas, reasoning, logical conclusion drawing, discipline, decision making, thoughtful consideration before action, tackling unforeseen challenges, resisting temptations, and maintaining focus. Numerous neuropsychological tests assess executive functions in relation to different autonomic control pathways that regulate involuntary physiological processes. The complexity of the autonomic nervous system and the challenges in measuring it alongside cognitive assessments are significant. Issues such as subject movement, environmental changes, and time-consuming protocols further complicate this measurement. There is a notable lack of research on suitable neuropsychological tests for assessing executive functions across diverse autonomic regulatory states. This paper presents the most frequently used neuropsychological instruments in this context, aiming to guide the research community towards optimal tasks and administration protocols for concurrent autonomic nervous system measurement. The diversity of current executive function tests presents both opportunities and challenges. Some tests are better suited for simultaneous neurophysiological measurements due to their design, duration, and cognitive load, while others may interfere with or be influenced by such monitoring. This variability can lead to inconsistencies in findings and complicate result interpretation and comparison across studies of brain disorders. A significant drawback of using different tasks is the difficulty in comparing outcomes and conducting meta-analyses. Standardizing a smaller selection of tasks with consistent protocols would enhance research reliability, facilitate robust comparisons, and improve the overall quality of meta-analyses. To achieve this standardization, it is essential to first survey and describe the current landscape of executive function assessments in conjunction with autonomic nervous system measurements. Objective This paper aims to comprehensively analyze current instruments utilized in the assessment of executive functions, elucidating their advantages, limitations, and implications for future standardization initiatives. By systematically examining the most prevalent tools for evaluating executive functions in conjunction with autonomic nervous system measurements within clinical and experimental research settings, this review seeks to provide valuable insights for enhancing methodological consistency and advancing research in this area. Methods We searched for articles published using the PubMed database with the following terms: (neuropsychological test OR neuropsychological evaluation OR neuropsychological measure*) AND (executive functions OR EF OR executive function) AND (autonomic OR ANS OR parasympathetic OR PNS OR vagal OR "heart rate variability" OR HRV OR sympathetic OR HPA OR electrodermal OR RSA) Only the healthy population was chosen. There was no language restriction. Results 62 articles fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. The 5 neuropsychological tests most frequently used to evaluate executive functions in relation to autonomic regulation were: 1. Trail Making Test (TMT) B 2. The n-back Task including 2-back Task 3. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test 4. Stroop Test and its variants 5. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-Working Memory Composite The domains of executive functions most frequently assessed are: cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control/selective attention. Conclusion These findings offer valuable insights for future research directions and the development of standardized assessment protocols for executive functions, tailored to diverse socio-demographic profiles.

">Effects of Social Housing on Electrically Stimulated Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens Core and Shell in Female and Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that is important in the reward system and increased DA release is associated with rewarding properties of drugs. Highly addictive stimulants like methamphetamine (METH) increase DA release and block reuptake, causing the DA to stay in the synapse longer, enhancing its effects. Because the misuse of METH is increasing in the United States, it is important to investigate ways to protect against this highly addictive stimulant. Recent studies have shown that social support can be a protective factor against METH self-administration in females, but not males. Other studies using microdialysis have shown that socially housed females have lower DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) compared to single housed females after treatment with METH. Additionally, researchers have shown that there are sex differences in stimulated DA release. The present study investigates whether social housing affects stimulated DA release after METH treatment. DA release in the NAc core and shell of socially housed and individually housed rats was measured using fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with a chronic 16-channel carbon fiber electrode in the NAc. A stimulating electrode was aimed at the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to induce DA release in the NAc. The results showed that social housing enhances electrically stimulated DA release in males and that there was greater DA release in NAc core than shell in single males, but no difference in socially housed males. In females, social housing also enhanced ES DA release. In single females there was greater ES DA release in shell than in core. Additionally, in single housed females there was greater ES DA release over time, while the socially housed females had high ES DA release that remained stable over time. These results suggest that social housing protects females from sensitization, making single females more vulnerable to the addictive properties of METH.

However, over the past decade, significant efforts have been made to develop IESS animal models to provide much-needed mechanistic information for therapy development. Our laboratory has focused on the TTX model, in which tetrodotoxin (TTX) is infused into the neocortex of infant rats, producing a lesion at the infusion site and mimicking IESS resulting from acquired structural brain abnormalities. Subsequent electrophysiological studies showed that the epileptic spasms originate from neocortical layer V pyramidal cells. Importantly, experimental maneuvers that increase the excitability of these cells produce focal seizures in non-epileptic control animals but never produce them in TTX-infused epileptic rats; instead, epileptic spasms are produced in epileptic rats, indicating a significant transformation in the operations of neocortical networks. At the molecular level, studies showed that the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 was markedly reduced in the cortex and this corresponded with a loss of presynaptic GABAergic nerve terminals. Very similar observations were made in surgically resected tissue from IESS patients with a history of perinatal strokes. Other experiments in conditional knockout mice indicated that IGF-1 plays a critical role in the maturation of neocortical inhibitory connectivity. This finding led to our hypothesis that the loss of IGF-1 in epileptic animals impairs inhibitory interneuron synaptogenesis and is responsible for spasms. To test this idea, we treated epileptic rats with the IGF-1-derived tripeptide (1-3)IGF-1, which was shown to act through IGF-1s receptor. (1-3)IGF-1 rescued inhibitory interneuron connectivity, restored IGF-1 levels, and abolished spasms. Thus (1-3)IGF-1 or its analogues are potential novel treatments for IESS following perinatal brain injury. We conclude by discussing our findings in the broader context of the often-debated final common pathway hypothesis for IESS.

">Derivation and analysis of human somatic sensory neuron subtypes facilitated through fluorescent hPSC reporters</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) is associated with several devastating neurological conditions, yet effective strategies to prevent or alleviate the consequences of PSN are nearly non-existent. A major challenge in the development of better therapeutic interventions is the lack of appropriate human model systems. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived somatosensory neurons present a promising strategy to overcome this issue but remain of limited translational utility, in part due to the low efficiency and lack of sensory subtype selectivity of the existing sensory neuron derivation protocols. To improve upon iPSC-based somatosensory disease models, we here describe the generation and validation of a genetic toolset to fluorescently label all or distinct (nociceptor, low threshold mechanoreceptor, and proprioceptor) somatosensory subtypes. These new resources will be transformative for hPSC-based approaches in PSN disease modeling - a critical step towards translating new findings into clinically relevant therapeutic strategies.

">Le Petit Prince (LPP) Multi-talker: Naturalistic 7T fMRI and EEG Dataset</a></h4>

              
                Prior neuroimaging datasets using naturalistic listening paradigms have predominantly focused on single-talker scenarios. While these studies have been invaluable for advancing our understanding of speech and language processing in the brain, they do not capture the complexities of real-world multi-talker environments. Here, we introduce the "Le Petit Prince (LPP) Multi-talker Dataset", a high-quality, naturalistic neuroimaging dataset featuring 40 minutes of electroencephalogram (EEG) and 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings from 26 native Mandarin Chinese speakers as they listened to both single-talker and multi-talker speech streams. Validation analyses conducted on both EEG and fMRI data demonstrate the dataset's high quality and robustness. Additionally, the dataset includes detailed transcriptions and prosodic and linguistic annotations of the speech stimuli, enabling fine-grained analyses of neural responses to specific linguistic and acoustic features. The LPP Multi-talker Dataset is well-suited for addressing a wide range of research questions in cognitive neuroscience, including selective attention, auditory stream segregation, and working memory processes in naturalistic listening contexts.

">Relationships between GABA+ and Glx concentrations with age and inhibition in healthy older adults</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition represents a core executive function which underlies the ability to suppress interfering and/or distracting stimuli, thereby building resistance against task-irrelevant information. However, the impact of ageing on inhibitory functioning and the potential role of neuroplasticity, largely driven by predominant excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurochemicals, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated age relationships with neurochemical concentrations (GABA+ and Glx) and examined the associations between these neurochemicals and inhibitory sub-components in the context of healthy ageing. To this end, participants completed three inhibition tasks (i.e., flanker, Stroop and go/no-go), each measuring a different sub-component process, via the PsyToolkit platform. MRS data was acquired in the sensorimotor (SM1; n=71, mean age (SD) = 68.3 (9.7) years, 39 females) and prefrontal (PFC; n=58, mean age (SD) = 67.6 (9.6) years, 30 females) regions using a HERMES sequence and analysed using the OSPREY pipeline. After correcting for gender and education, semi-partial correlations (rho) revealed no significant relationships between age and GABA+ or Glx concentrations in either the SM1 or PFC regions. Furthermore, through partial correlations (rho), after correcting for age, gender and education, we identified a significant negative relationship between SM1 Glx concentrations and go/no-go error rates, such that greater concentrations of Glx in the SM1 region were associated with greater accuracy on the go/no-go task. The null age-neurochemical results suggest that GABA+ and Glx may not uniformly decline during healthy ageing. This finding suggests that the relationship between older age and neurochemistry may be more nuanced than previously reported. In addition, our neurochemical-behavioural findings provide neurochemically-and-spatially specific evidence that SM1 Glx concentrations may be important for response inhibition. This result indicates a role for the glutamatergic system in supporting inhibition over the normal course of ageing.

">Interpersonal synchronization as an objective measure of listening engagement</a></h4>

              
                Listening engagement has received increasing attention for its role in effective communication and knowledge transfer. It encompasses a state of deep listening in which a person not only pays attention to a stimulus but is fully absorbed in it. Behavioral measures have been used to assess listening engagement; however, they have limitations and do not fully capture this multidimensional state. Measuring listening engagement objectively using brain and body signals is a compelling alternative. In particular, interpersonal synchronization-observed through synchronized physiological responses among listeners-offers a promising objective measure of this phenomenon. We measured brain, heart rate, and electrodermal activity synchronization between people who listened to engaging and non-engaging stories. As a ground truth, we also measured subjective listening engagement through a questionnaire. Results showed higher synchronization when participants listened to an engaging stimulus compared to a non-engaging one across different modalities of objective response. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between synchronization measures and subjective engagement ratings. These results confirm that synchronization may serve as a reliable measure of listening engagement.

">Endogenously generated Dutch-type Aβ nonfibrillar aggregates dysregulate presynaptic neurotransmission in the absence of detectable inflammation</a></h4>

              
                APPE693Q transgenic mice develop aging-related learning deficits and accumulate endogenously generated nonfibrillar aggregates of A{beta} (NFA-A{beta}) and APP -carboxy terminal fragments. The APPE693Q mutation disrupts amyloid fibril formation, and no plaques develop in these mice. In the current study, the aging-related accumulation of NFA-A{beta} in APPE693Q mice was revealed by A11 immunohistochemistry and NFA-A{beta}-detecting cyclic D,L--peptide-FITC microscopy. The presynaptic termini of APPE693Q mice developed aging-related physiological abnormalities in post-tetanic potentiation, synaptic fatigue, and synaptic vesicle replenishment. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that excitatory neurons exhibited the most altered transcriptomic profile, especially involving ''protein translation'' and ''oxidative phosphorylation''. Direct measurements of electron transport chain catalysis revealed reduction in mitochondrial complex I activity in Dutch mice. Microglial transcript analysis revealed no evidence of inflammation. The incomplete clinical response to fibrillar A{beta} immunodepletion in human patients may be attributable to residual NFA-A{beta} that are undetectable by currently available biofluid analysis or neuroimaging of biomarkers. The depletion or neutralization of both fibrillar and NFA-A{beta} may be needed for complete elimination of A{beta} toxicity.

">Reproducible Brain Charts: An open data resource for mapping brain development and its associations with mental health</a></h4>

              
                Major mental disorders are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development. Large and heterogeneous samples are required to define generalizable links between brain development and psychopathology. To this end, we introduce the Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC), an open data resource that integrates data from 5 large studies of brain development in youth from three continents (N=6,346; 45% Female). Confirmatory bifactor models were used to create harmonized psychiatric phenotypes that capture major dimensions of psychopathology. Following rigorous quality assurance, neuroimaging data were carefully curated and processed using consistent pipelines in a reproducible manner with DataLad, the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC), and FreeSurfer. Initial analyses of RBC data emphasize the benefit of careful quality assurance and data harmonization in delineating developmental effects and associations with psychopathology. Critically, all RBC data - including harmonized psychiatric phenotypes, unprocessed images, and fully processed imaging derivatives - are openly shared without a data use agreement via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative. Together, RBC facilitates large-scale, reproducible, and generalizable research in developmental and psychiatric neuroscience.

">Targeting anterior cingulate cortex with tDCS: an overview and analysis of electric field magnitude</a></h4>

              
                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a brain region with a key role in various cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes. Given its extensive functional repertoire, modulating ACC activity to enhance cognitive functioning and alleviate symptoms of certain clinical conditions holds great potential. Over the past decades, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has gained popularity due to its ability to non-invasively affect the cortical excitability. Nevertheless, using tDCS to target regions located beneath superficial cortical areas, such as the ACC, could pose a challenge due to the unpredictable distribution of the electric field (E-field). To systematize the current state of evidence regarding the use of tDCS to modulate ACC activity, we conducted a systematic review focusing on analyzing the E-field distribution across the brain and its magnitude within the ACC as the region of interest. Our goal was to review the stimulation parameters used thus far and examine whether the E-field characteristics are linked to the observed effects. After the literature search and study selection, 14 studies were included in the review. Most of the studies were sham-controlled single-session experiments aiming to modulate specific cognitive processes in healthy adults. The most prominent process of interest was cognitive control, and most of the included studies observed behavioural effects. Our results show that cathodal stimulation led to significant results more frequently, regardless of E-field magnitude in ACC or specificity of E-field distribution throughout the brain. When it comes to anodal tDCS, more focal stimulation of the ACC was associated with a higher frequency of significant effects. We discuss these findings considering diverse methodological designs, the (un)specificity of ACC targeting, and other factors that could contribute to the variability of tDCS effects across studies.
