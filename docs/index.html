              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A study protocol to prepare an RBD protein for vaccine against COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global threat to humans and the world’s economy. Effective and safe vaccines against this virus are essential to control and eradicate the pandemic. The currently applied vaccines carry SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein mRNA/cDNA. These vaccines go through several cellular processes in the recipients for producing antigens. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain)-protein is an antigen. It will directly stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we propose to produce SARS-CoV-2 RBD-protein as a fast acting, effective and safe vaccine.  Methods: We propose to reconstruct a plasmid carrying three types of  DNA sequences: RBD cDNA, FP (fusion peptide) DNA and sfGFP(superfolder green fluorescent protein), cDNA creating the RBD-FP-sfGFP DNA within an orf (open reading frame). Escherichia coli, C2566H, transformed with the reconstructed plasmid will express RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein producing green fluorescent cfu (colony forming unit). The RBD-protein will be separated from the sfGFP using an FP specific enterokinase, and eluted by HIC (hydrophobic interaction chromatography), detected with a BioVision Elisa kit, and quantified by spectrophotometry at UV280nm.  Results: The plasmid reconstruct will carry ampr (ampicillin-resistant) gene as a selective marker and a T7 promoter controlling the expression of RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The transformed Escherichia coli will efficiently express the RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The highly efficient sfGFP fused within the RBD-FP-sfGFP will produce green fluorescent cfu. The RBD-FP-sfGFP protein extract from the green cfu, digested by enterokinase and separated by the HIC will produce pure RBD protein.  Conclusion: A positive BioVision ELISA test detects <10 pg RBD protein/ml of the sample. A larger sample of the purified RBD protein can be used as a vaccine following a standard formulation and safety protocols. Once administered, the RBD protein will stimulate antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The RBD protein has no potential to recombine with human genome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Short-term assessment of subfoveal injection of AAV2-hCHM gene augmentation in choroideremia using adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy</a></h4>

              
                Subretinal injection for gene augmentation in retinal degenerations forcefully detaches the neural retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), potentially damaging photoreceptors and/or RPE cells. Here, we use adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to assess the short-term integrity of the cone mosaic following subretinal injections of AAV2-hCHM gene augmentation in subjects with choroideremia (CHM). Nine adult CHM patients received uniocular subfoveal injections of low dose (5x10^10 vector genome (vg) per eye, n=5) or high dose (1x10^11 vg per eye, n=4) AAV2-hCHM. The macular regions of both eyes were imaged pre- and one-month post-injection using a custom-built, multimodal AOSLO. Post-injection cone inner segment mosaics were compared to pre-injection mosaics at multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Post-injection AOSLO images showed preservation of the cone mosaic in all 9 AAV2-hCHM injected eyes. Mosaics appeared intact and contiguous one-month post-injection, with the exception of foveal disruption in one patient. Co-localized optical coherence tomography showed foveal cone outer segment (COS) shortening post-injection (significant, n=4; non-significant, n=4; unchanged, n=1). Integrity of the cone mosaic is maintained following subretinal delivery of AAV2-hCHM, providing strong evidence in support of the safety of the injections. Minor foveal thinning observed following surgery corresponds with short-term COS shortening rather than cone cell loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-dependent modulation of NMDA receptors by endogenous zinc shapes dendritic function in cortical neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) has been proposed to be a key component of single neuron computations in vivo. However is unknown if specific mechanisms control the function of such receptors and modulate input-output transformations performed by cortical neurons under in vivo-like conditions. Here we found that in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (L2/3 PNs), repeated synaptic stimulation results in an activity-dependent decrease in NMDARs activity by vesicular zinc. Such a mechanism shifted the threshold for dendritic non-linearities and strongly reduced LTP induction. Modulation of NMDARs was cell- and pathway-specific, being present selectively in L2/3-L2/3 connections but absent in ascending bottom-up inputs originating from L4 neurons. Numerical simulations highlighted that activity-dependent modulation of NMDARs has an important influence in dendritic computations endowing L2/3 PN dendrites with the ability to sustain dendritic non-linear integrations constant across different regimes of synaptic activity like those found in vivo. The present results therefore provide a new perspective on the action of vesicular zinc in cortical circuits by highlighting the role of this endogenous ion in normalizing dendritic integration of PNs during a constantly changing synaptic input pattern.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Serotype-based evaluation of an optogenetic construct in rat cortical astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetics is a modern technique which has been recently expanded to non-neuronal cell types, e.g., astrocytes, and involves targeted gene delivery of light-sensitive ion channels like Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Optogenetic regulation of astrocytic activity can be used for therapeutic intervention of several neurological disorders. Astrocytic gene delivery, viz adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, have proven to be robust, time-, and cost-efficient contrary to the generation of transgenic animal models. When transducing astrocytes with an AAV vector, it is imperative to perform a serotype evaluation of the AAV vector due to variability in serotype transduction efficiency depending on species, target region and construct length. Rats have been a very successful animal model for studying a variety of brain disorders, from which ChR2-based intervention of astrocytes will benefit. However, the most efficient AAV capsid serotype targeting astrocytes for ChR2 expression in the in vivo rat brain cortex has not been characterized. To address this, we have evaluated AAV serotypes 1, 5, and 8 of the vector AAV-GFAP-hChR2(H134)-mCherry targeting astrocytes in the rat brain neocortex. Results show that serotype 8 exhibits promising transduction patterns, as it has demonstrated the highest tangential and radial viral spread in the rat brain. Our research will facilitate translational research for future applications of optogenetics involving the transduction of rat brain cortical astrocytes.

                Kim et al. find that critical COVID-19 is associated with enhanced eosinophil-mediated inflammation when compared to non-critical cases. Increased Th2-biased immune responses, accompanying overt complement activation, are seen in the critical group. These findings suggest that enhanced eosinophil-mediated inflammation and dysregulated humoral responses might be drivers of severe COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RECIPROCALLY INHIBITORY CIRCUITS OPERATING WITH DISTINCT MECHANISMS ARE DIFFERENTLY ROBUST TO PERTURBATION AND MODULATION</a></h4>

              
                What features are important for circuit robustness? Reciprocal inhibition is a building block in many circuits. We used dynamic clamp to create reciprocally inhibitory circuits from GM neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion by injecting artificial synaptic and hyperpolarization-activated inward (H) currents. In "release", the active neuron controls the off/on transitions. In "escape", the inhibited neuron controls the transitions. We characterized the robustness of escape and release circuits to alterations in circuit parameters, temperature, and neuromodulation. Escape circuits rely on tight correlations between synaptic and H conductances to generate bursting but are resilient to temperature increase. Release circuits are robust to variations in synaptic and H conductances but fragile to temperature increase. The modulatory current (IMI) restores oscillations in release circuits but has little effect in escape. Thus, the same perturbation can have dramatically different effects depending on the circuits' mechanism of operation that may not be observable from circuit output.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synchronous spiking of cerebellar Purkinje cells during control of movements</a></h4>

              
                The information that the brain transmits from one region to another is often viewed through the lens of firing rates. However, if the output neurons could vary the timing of their spikes with respect to each other, then through synchronization they could highlight information that may be critical for control of behavior. In the cerebellum, the computations that are performed by the cerebellar cortex are conveyed to the nuclei via inhibition. Yet, synchronous activity entrains nucleus neurons, making them fire. Does the cerebellar cortex rely on spike synchrony within populations of Purkinje cells (P-cells) to convey information to the nucleus? We recorded from multiple P-cells while marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and organized them into populations that shared a complex spike response to error. Before movement onset, P-cells transmitted information via a rate code: the simple spike firing rates predicted the direction and velocity of the impending saccade. However, during the saccade, the spikes became temporally aligned within the population, signaling when to stop the movement. Thus, the cerebellar cortex relies on spike synchronization within a population of P-cells, not individual firing rates, to convey to the nucleus when to stop a movement.

                The global consumption of highly processed, calorie-dense foods has contributed to an epidemic of overweight and obesity, along with negative consequences for metabolic dysfunction and disease susceptibility. As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral prioritization enhances working memory precision and neural population gain</a></h4>

              
                Humans allocate visual working memory (WM) resource according to behavioral relevance, resulting in more precise memories for more important items. Theoretically, items may be maintained by feature-tuned neural populations, where the relative gain of the populations encoding each item determines precision. To test this hypothesis, we compared the amplitudes of delay-period activity in the different parts of retinotopic maps representing each of several WM items, predicting amplitude would track with behavioral priority. Using fMRI, we scanned participants while they remembered the location of multiple items over a WM delay, then reported the location of one probed item using a memory-guided saccade. Importantly, items were not equally probable to be probed (0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0), which was indicated with a pre-cue. We analyzed fMRI activity in ten visual field maps in occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex known to be important for visual WM. In early visual cortex, but not association cortex, the amplitude of BOLD activation within voxels corresponding to the retinotopic location of visual WM items increased with the priority of the item. Interestingly, these results were contrasted with a common finding that higher-level brain regions had greater delay-period activity, demonstrating a dissociation between the absolute amount of activity in a brain area, and the activity of different spatially-selective populations within it. These results suggest that the distribution of WM resources according to priority sculpts the relative gains of neural populations that encode items, offering a neural mechanism for how prioritization impacts memory precision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal filters in response to presynaptic spike trains: Interplay of cellular, synaptic and short-term plasticity time scales</a></h4>

              
                Temporal filters, the ability of postsynaptic neurons to preferentially select certain presynaptic input patterns, have been shown to be associated with the notion of information filtering and coding of sensory inputs. Their properties can be dynamically characterized as the transient responses to periodic presynaptic inputs. Short-term plasticity (STP) has been proposed to be an important player in the generation of temporal filters, but the response of postsynaptic neurons to presynaptic inputs depends on a collection of time scales in addition to STP's, which conspire to create temporal filters: the postsynaptic time scales generated by the cellular intrinsic currents and the presynaptic time scales captured by the ISI distribution patterns. The mechanisms by which these time scales and the processes giving rise to them interact to produce temporal filters in response to presynaptic input spike trains are not well understood. We carry out a systematic modeling and computational analysis to understand how the postsynaptic low-, high- and band-pass temporal filters are generated in response to periodic presynaptic spike trains in the presence STP, and how the dynamic properties of these filters depend on the interplay of a hierarchy of processes: arrival of the presynaptic spikes, the activation of STP and its effect on the synaptic connection efficacy, and the response of the postsynaptic cell. The time scales associated with each of these processes operate at the short-term, single-event level (they are activated at the arrival of each presynaptic spike) and collectively produce the long-term time scales that determine the shape and properties of the filters. We develop a series of mathematical tools to address these issues for a relatively simple model where depression and facilitation interact only at the level of the synaptic efficacy change as time progresses and we extend our results and tools to account for more complex models that involve interactions at the STP level and multiple STP time scales. We use these tools to understand the mechanisms of generation of temporal filters in the postsynaptic cells in terms of the properties and dynamics of the interacting building blocks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-functional feedforward inhibitory circuits for cortical odor processing</a></h4>

              
                Feedforward inhibitory circuits are key contributors to the complex interplay between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Little is known about the function of feedforward inhibition in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Using in vivo two-photon targeted patch clamping and calcium imaging in mice, we find that odors evoke strong excitation in two classes of interneurons - neurogliaform (NG) cells and horizontal (HZ) cells - that provide feedforward inhibition in layer 1 of the piriform cortex. NG cells fire much earlier than HZ cells following odor onset, a difference that can be attributed to the faster odor-driven excitatory synaptic drive that NG cells receive from the olfactory bulb. As a consequence, NG cells strongly but transiently inhibit odor-evoked excitation in layer 2 principal cells, whereas HZ cells provide more diffuse and prolonged feedforward inhibition. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in the operation of inhibition in the piriform cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epilepsy-causing KCNT1 variants increase KNa1.1 channel activity by disrupting the activation gate.</a></h4>

              
                Gain-of-function pathogenic missense KCNT1 variants are associated with several developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). With few exceptions, patients are heterozygous and there is a paucity of mechanistic information about how pathogenic variants increase KNa1.1 channel activity and the behaviour of heterotetrameric channels comprising both wild-type (WT) and variant subunits. To better understand these, we selected a range of variants across the DEE spectrum, involving mutations in different protein domains and studied their functional properties. Whole-cell electrophysiology was used to characterise homomeric and heteromeric KNa1.1 channel assemblies carrying DEE-causing variants in the presence and absence of 10 mM intracellular sodium. Voltage-dependent activation of homomeric variant KNa1.1 assemblies were more hyperpolarised than WT KNa1.1 and, unlike WT KNa1.1, exhibited voltage-dependent activation in the absence of intracellular sodium. Heteromeric channels formed by co-expression of WT and variant KNa1.1 had activation kinetics intermediate of homomeric WT and variant KNa1.1 channels, with residual sodium-independent activity. In general, WT and variant KNa1.1 activation followed a single exponential, with time constants unaffected by voltage or sodium. Mutating the threonine in the KNa1.1 selectivity filter disrupted voltage-dependent activation, but sodium-dependence remained intact. Our findings suggest that KNa1.1 gating involves a sodium-dependent activation gate that modulates a voltage-dependent selectivity filter gate. Collectively, all DEE-associated KNa1.1 mutations lowered the energetic barrier for sodium-dependent activation, but some also had direct effects on selectivity filter gating. Destabilisation of the inactivated unliganded channel conformation can explain how DEE-causing amino acid substitutions in diverse regions of the channel structure all cause gain-of-function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial working memory representations in human cortex are robust to a task-irrelevant interrupting stimulus</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance and manipulation of information no longer accessible in the visual world. Previous research has identified spatial WM representations in activation patterns in visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. In natural vision, the period between the encoding of information into WM and the time when it is used to guide behavior (the delay period) is rarely "empty", as is the case in most of the above laboratory experiments. In naturalistic conditions, eye movements, movement of the individual, and events in the environment result in visual signals which may overwrite or impair the fidelity of WM representations, especially in early sensory cortices. Here, we evaluated the extent to which a brief, irrelevant interrupting visual stimulus presented during a spatial WM delay period impaired behavioral performance and WM representation fidelity assayed using an image reconstruction technique (inverted encoding model). On each trial, participants (both sexes) viewed two target dots and were immediately post-cued to remember the precise spatial position of one dot. On 50% of trials, a brief interrupter stimulus appeared. While we observed strong transient univariate visual responses to the distracter stimulus, we saw no change in reconstructed neural WM representations under distraction, nor a change in behavioral performance on a continuous recall task. This suggests that spatial WM representations may be particularly robust to interference from incoming task-irrelevant visual information, perhaps related to their role in guiding movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust effects of working memory demand during naturalistic language comprehension in language-selective cortex</a></h4>

              
                A standard view of human language processing is that comprehenders build richly structured mental representations of natural language utterances, word by word, using computationally costly memory operations supported by domain-general working memory resources. However, three core claims of this view have been questioned, with some prior work arguing that (1) rich word-by-word structure building is not a core function of the language comprehension system, (2) apparent working memory costs are underlyingly driven by word predictability (surprisal), and/or (3) language comprehension relies primarily on domain-general rather than domain-specific working memory resources. In this work, we simultaneously evaluate all three of these claims using naturalistic comprehension in fMRI. In each participant, we functionally localize (a) a language-selective network and (b) a 'multiple-demand' network that supports working memory across domains, and we analyze the responses in these two networks of interest during naturalistic story listening with respect to a range of theory-driven predictors of working memory demand under rigorous surprisal controls. Results show robust surprisal-independent effects of word-by-word memory demand in the language network and no effect of working memory demand in the multiple demand network. Our findings thus support the view that language comprehension (1) entails word-by-word structure building using (2) computationally intensive memory operations that are not explained by surprisal. However, these results challenge (3) the domain-generality of the resources that support these operations, instead indicating that working memory operations for language comprehension are carried out by the same neural resources that store linguistic knowledge.

	<p>This study aims to investigate possible different outcomes in the inpatient treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) related to different timings of psychopharmacological and nutritional interventions. A retrospective observational study was conducted, involving young patients hospitalized for AN, treated with naso-gastric tube feeding (NGT). Participants were divided into five groups according to early (0–7 days) or late (8+ days) introduction of atypical antipsychotics (AAP) and NGT: early AAP-early NGT (EE), early AAP-late NGT (EL), late AAP-early NGT (LE), late AAP-late NGT (LL) and a control group treated with NGT only (NGT). Concurrent clinical and treatment variables were analyzed. AN psychopathology was measured with the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) EDRC score. Outcomes were assessed as admission-discharge body-mass index (BMI) improvement and length of hospital stay (LOS). Contributions of variables related to outcomes were assessed with multifactorial-analyses of variance (MANOVA). Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the study. LOS was different among treatment groups (F (4, 75) = 5.993, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and EE patients showed lower LOS than LE (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and LL (p = 0.025) patients. BMI improvement was not significantly different among treatment groups but correlated negatively with age (F (1, 72) = 10.130, p = 0.002), and admission BMI (F (1, 72) = 14.681, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, patients treated with early AAP and early NGT showed lower LOS than those treated with late AAP. Prognostic treatment variables should be investigated in wider samples.</p>

	<p>Background: Conventional L5 corpectomy requires a large incision and an extended period of intraoperative fluoroscopy. We describe herein a new L5 corpectomy technique. Methods: A 79-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for leg pain and lower back pain due to an L5 vertebral fracture. Her daily life had been affected by severe lower back pain and sciatica for more than 2 months. We initially performed simple decompression surgery, but this proved effective for only 10 months. Results: For revision surgery, the patient underwent minimally invasive L5 corpectomy with a navigated expandable cage without fluoroscopy. The second surgery took 215 min, and estimated blood loss was 750 milliliters. The revision surgery proved successful, and the patient could then walk using a cane. In terms of clinical outcomes, the Oswestry Disability Index improved from 66% to 24%, and the visual analog scale score for lower back pain improved from 84 to 31 mm at the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: Minimally invasive L5 corpectomy with a navigated expandable vertebral cage is effective for reducing cage misplacement and surgical invasiveness. With this new technique, surgeons and operating room staff can avoid the risk of adverse events due to intraoperative radiation exposure.</p>

	<p>High doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, have been shown to have anxiogenic effects. Additionally, THC effects have been shown to be modulated by genotype, including the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1130233 at the protein kinase AKT1 gene, a key component of the dopamine signalling cascade. As such, it is likely that epigenetic methylation around this SNP may affect AKT gene expression, which may in turn impact on the acute effects of THC on brain function. We investigated the genetic (AKT1 rs1130233) and epigenetic modulation of brain function during fear processing in a 2-session, double-blind, cross-over, randomized placebo-controlled THC administration, in 36 healthy males. Fear processing was assessed using an emotion (fear processing) paradigm, under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Complete genetic and fMRI data were available for 34 participants. THC caused an increase in anxiety and transient psychotomimetic symptoms and para-hippocampal gyrus/ amygdala activation. Number of A alleles at the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP, and percentage methylation at the CpG11–12 site, were independently associated with a greater effect of THC on activation in a network of brain regions including left and right parahippocampal gyri, respectively. AKT1 rs1130233 moderation of the THC effect on left parahippocampal activation persisted after covarying for methylation percentage, and was partially mediated in sections of the left parahippocampal gyrus/ hippocampus by methylation percentage. These results may offer an example of how genetic and epigenetic variations influence the psychotomimetic and neurofunctional effects of THC.</p>

	<p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are part of the same pathophysiological spectrum and have common genetic and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Our aim here was to identify causative gene variants in a cohort of Greek patients with FTD, ALS and FTD-ALS, to measure levels of CSF biomarkers and to investigate genotype-phenotype/CSF biomarker associations. In this cohort of 130 patients (56 FTD, 58 ALS and 16 FTD-ALS), we performed C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion analysis, whole exome sequencing and measurement of “classical” (Aβ42, total tau and phospho-tau) and novel (TDP-43) CSF biomarkers and plasma progranulin. Through these analyses, we identified 14 patients with C9orf72 repeat expansion and 11 patients with causative variants in other genes (three in TARDBP, three in GRN, three in VCP, one in FUS, one in SOD1). In ALS patients, we found that levels of phospho-tau were lower in C9orf72 repeat expansion and MAPT c.855C&amp;amp;gt;T (p.Asp285Asp) carriers compared to non-carriers. Additionally, carriers of rare C9orf72 and APP variants had lower levels of total tau and Aβ42, respectively. Plasma progranulin levels were decreased in patients carrying GRN pathogenic variants. This study expands the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FTD/ALS and offers insights in possible genotypic/CSF biomarker associations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Relation of Pre‐stroke Aspirin Use With Cerebral Infarct Volume and Functional Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated a) the associations between pre-stroke aspirin use and thrombus burden, infarct volume, hemorrhagic transformation, early neurological deterioration (END), and functional outcome, and b) whether stroke subtypes modify these associations in first-ever ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter MRI-based study included 5,700 consecutive patients with acute first-ever ischemic stroke, who did not undergo intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy, from May-2011 through February-2014. Propensity score-based augmented inverse probability weighting was performed to estimate adjusted effects of pre-stroke aspirin use.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The mean age was 67 years (41% women), and 15.9% (n = 907) were taking aspirin before stroke. Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs non-use) was significantly related to a reduced infarct volume (by 30%), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (by 45%). In cardioembolic stroke, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with a ~ 50% lower incidence of END (adjusted difference [95% CI], −5.4% [−8.9 to −1.9]). Thus, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with ~30% higher likelihood of favorable outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale score &lt; 3), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke and cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference [95% CI], 7.2% [1.8 to 12.5] and 6.4% [1.7 to 11.1], respectively). Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs non-use) was associated with 85% less frequent cerebral thrombus-related susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (adjusted difference [95% CI], −1.4% [−2.1 to −0.8], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and was associated with ~40% lower SVS-volumes, particularly in cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference [95% CI], −0.16 cm<sup>3</sup> [−0.29 to −0.02], <i>p</i> = 0.03). Moreover, pre-stroke aspirin use was not significantly associated with hemorrhagic transformation (adjusted difference, −1.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pre-stroke aspirin use associates with improved functional independence in patients with first-ever ischemic large arterial stroke by reducing infarct volume and/or END, likely by decreasing thrombus burden, without increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>On behalf of the German Neurological Society (DGN), a study was conducted into how far former chairmen, honorary chairmen, and honorary members could be regarded as incriminated from the National Socialist period. While an online supplement of this journal presents seven individual biographies (in six papers) by way of example, this paper offers an overview summarizing the project results and introducing the biographies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The first part and the methodological section discuss the difficulties of retrospectively identifying neurologists involved in the Nazi movement. Formal characteristics (eg, membership of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) or other Nazi organizations or participation in Nazi crimes) and content-related clues (eg, statements reflecting Nazi ideology, personal contacts with Nazi officials or active support of the system) can be helpful.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The second part summarizes the principal results of a study of 28 German and Austrian neuroscientists with regard to their involvement and their post-war careers. Six of the seven “founding fathers” of the DGN were former NSDAP members; 10 of the 13 presidents in office until 1976 had belonged to Nazi organizations—the NSDAP, the SA (“Brownshirts”) or the SS (“Blackshirts”). Moreover, seven out of 10 honorary presidents had formal or substantive links to National Socialism. Of the German and Austrian honorary members appointed up to 1985, two-thirds had leanings to Nazi ideology or the National Socialist system.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This paper concludes by outlining how the DGN and its members are currently addressing this historical legacy in order to establish a responsible culture of remembrance. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two common and distinct forms of variation in human functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The cortex has a characteristic layout with specialized functional areas forming distributed large-scale networks. However, substantial work shows striking variation in this organization across people, which relates to differences in behavior. While a dominant assumption is that cortical 'variants' represent boundary shifts in the borders between regions, here we show that variants can also occur at a distance from their typical position, forming ectopic intrusions. Both forms of variants are common across individuals, but the forms differ in their location, network linkages, and activations during tasks. Sub-groups of individuals share similar variant properties, but sub-grouping on the two variant forms appears independent. This work argues that individual differences in brain organization commonly occur in two dissociable forms, border shifts and ectopic intrusions, that must be separately accounted for in the analysis of cortical systems across people. This work expands our knowledge of cortical variation in humans and helps reconceptualize the discussion of how cortical systems variability arises and links to individual differences in behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CUX2 mutations in temporal lobe epilepsy; increased kainate susceptibility and excitatory input to hippocampus in deficient mice</a></h4>

              
                CUX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that controls neuronal proliferation, dendrite branching and synapse formation, locating at the epilepsy-associated chromosomal region 12q24 that we previously identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Japanese population. A CUX2 recurrent de novo variant p.E590K has been described in patients with rare epileptic encephalopathies and the gene is a candidate for the locus, however the mutation may not be enough to generate the genome-wide significance in the GWAS and whether CUX2 variants appear in other types of epilepsies and physiopathological mechanisms are remained to be investigated. Here in this study, we conducted targeted sequencings of CUX2, a paralog CUX1 and its short isoform CASP harboring a unique C-terminus on 271 Japanese patients with a variety of epilepsies, and found that multiple CUX2 missense variants, other than the p.E590K, and some CASP variants including a deletion, predominantly appeared in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Human cell culture and fly dendritic arborization analyses revealed loss-of- function properties for the CUX2 variants. Cux2- and Casp-specific knockout mice both showed high susceptibility to kainate, increased excitatory cell number in the entorhinal cortex, and significant enhancement in glutamatergic synaptic transmission to the hippocampus. CASP and CUX2 proteins physiologically bound to each other and co-expressed in excitatory neurons in brain regions including the entorhinal cortex. These results suggest that CUX2 and CASP variants contribute to the TLE pathology through a facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission from entorhinal cortex to hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetically engineered microglia-like cells have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disease</a></h4>

              
                Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell gene therapy (HSPC-GT) results in the engraftment of genetically modified microglia-like cells (MLCs) in the brain. While HSPC-GT has shown a clear neurological benefit in the clinic for specific rare diseases, the nature of MLC engraftment in the brain and the functional characteristics of MLCs remain contentious. Here we comprehensively characterized how different routes of administration affect the engraftment and biodistribution of genetically engineered HSPC-derivatives in mice. Using high-throughput single-cell profiling, we show that MLCs bear a transcriptional signature similar to resident microglia rather than invading macrophages. However, MLCs could clearly be distinguished from resident microglia by expression of a specific set of genes. Finally, in murine models of Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia, we demonstrate that MLCs can provide therapeutically relevant levels of protein to the brain, thereby potentially opening avenues of HSPC-GT to address the underlying disease etiology of these and other similar disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional and translational regulation of pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease model mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Defining the cellular mechanisms that drive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and progression will be aided by studies defining how gene expression patterns change during pre-symptomatic AD and the ensuing periods of steadily declining cognition. Previous studies have emphasized changes in transcriptional regulation, but not translational regulation, leaving the ultimate results of gene expression alterations relatively unexplored in the context of AD. Objective: To identify genes whose expression might be regulated at the transcriptional, and especially at the translational levels in AD, we analyzed gene expression in cerebral cortex of two AD model mouse strains, CVN (APPSwDI;NOS2-/-) and Tg2576 (APPSw), and their companion wild type (WT) strains at 6 months of age by tandem RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq (ribosome profiling). Methods: Identical starting pools of bulk RNA were used for RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Differential gene expression analysis was performed at the transcriptional and translational levels separately, and also at the translational efficiency level. Regulated genes were functionally evaluated by gene ontology tools. Results: Compared to WT mice, AD model mice had similar levels of transcriptional regulation, but displayed differences in translational regulation. A specific microglial signature associated with early stages of A{beta} accumulation was up-regulated at both transcriptome and translatome levels in CVN mice. Although the two mice strains did not share many regulated genes, they showed common regulated pathways related to APP metabolism associated with neurotoxicity and neuroprotection. Conclusion: This work represents the first genome-wide study of brain translational regulation in animal models of AD, and provides evidence of a tight and early translational regulation of gene expression controlling the balance between neuroprotective and neurodegenerative processes in brain.

                Batten disease is unique among lysosomal storage disorders for the early and profound manifestation in the central nervous system, but little is known regarding potential neuron-specific roles for the disease-associated proteins. We demonstrate substantial overlap in the protein interactomes of three transmembrane Batten proteins (CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8), and that their absence leads to synaptic depletion of key partners (i.e. SNAREs and tethers) and aberrant synaptic SNARE dynamics in vivo, demonstrating a novel shared etiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A CLN6-CRMP2-KLC4 complex regulates anterograde ER-derived vesicle trafficking in cortical neurites</a></h4>

              
                As neurons establish extensive connections throughout the central nervous system, the transport of cargo along the microtubule network of the axon is crucial for differentiation and homeostasis. Specifically, building blocks such as membrane and cytoskeletal components, organelles, transmembrane receptors, adhesion molecules, and peptide neurotransmitters all require proper transport to the presynaptic compartment. Here, we identify a novel complex regulating vesicular endoplasmic reticulum transport in neurites, composed of CLN6: an ER-associated protein of relatively unknown function implicated in CLN6-Batten disease; CRMP2: a tubulin binding protein important in regulating neurite microtubule dynamics; and KLC4: a classic transport motor protein. We show that this 'CCK' complex allows ER-derived vesicles to migrate to the distal end of the axon, aiding in proper neurite outgrowth and arborization. In the absence of CLN6, the CCK complex does not function effectively, leading to reduced vesicular transport, stunted neurite outgrowth, and deficits in CRMP2 binding to other protein partners. Treatment with a CRMP2 modulating compound, lanthionine ketimine ester, partially restores these deficits in CLN6-deficient mouse neurons, indicating that stabilization of CRMP2 interacting partners may prove beneficial in lieu of complete restoration of the CCK complex. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of ER-derived vesicle transport in the axon and provide new insights into therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease.

                Laughter is a contagious prosocial signal that conveys bonding motivation; adult crying conversely communicates desire for social proximity by signalling distress. Endogenous mu-opioid receptors (MORs) modulate sociability in humans and non-human primates. In this combined PET-fMRI study (n=17) we tested whether central MOR tone is associated with regional brain responses to social signals of laughter and crying sounds. MOR availability was measured with positron emission tomography using high-affinity agonist radioligand [11C]carfentanil. Haemodynamic responses to social laughter and crying sounds were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Social laughter evoked activation in the auditory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, amygdala, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortex; crying sounds led to more restricted activation in auditory cortex and nearby areas. MOR availability was negatively correlated with the haemodynamic responses to social laughter in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortex, posterior insula, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, cuneus, temporal gyri, and lingual gyrus. For crying-evoked activations, MOR availability was negatively correlated with medial and lateral prefrontal haemodynamic responses. Altogether our findings highlight the role of MOR system in modulating acute brain responses to both positive and negative social signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adropin confers neuroprotection and promotes functional recovery from ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Adropin is a highly-conserved peptide that has been shown to preserve endothelial barrier function. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a key pathological event in cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of adropin on ischemic stroke outcomes remain unexplored. Hypothesizing that adropin exerts neuroprotective effects by maintaining BBB integrity, we investigated the role of adropin in stroke pathology utilizing loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches combined with pharmacological treatment with synthetic adropin peptide. Stroke decreased endogenous adropin levels in the brain and plasma. Adropin treatment or transgenic adropin overexpression robustly reduced brain injury and improved long-term sensorimotor and cognitive function in young and aged mice subjected to ischemic stroke. In contrast, genetic deletion of adropin exacerbated ischemic brain injury. Mechanistically, adropin neuroprotection depends on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and is associated with reduced BBB permeability and neuroinflammation. We identify adropin as a novel neuroprotective peptide with the potential to improve stroke outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-species comparison of the orientation algorithm directing larval chemotaxis in the genus Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Animals differ in their appearances and behaviors. While many genetic studies have addressed the origins of phenotypic differences between fly species, we are still lacking a quantitative assessment of the variability in the way different fly species behave. We tackled this question in one of the most robust behaviors displayed by Drosophila: chemotaxis. At the larval stage, Drosophila melanogaster navigate odor gradients by combining four sensorimotor routines in a multilayered algorithm: a modulation of the overall locomotor speed and turn rate; a bias in turning during down-gradient motion; a bias in turning toward the gradient; the local curl of trajectories toward the gradient ("weathervaning"). Using high-resolution tracking and behavioral quantification, we characterized the olfactory behavior of eight closely related species of the Drosophila group in response to 19 ecologically-relevant odors. Significant changes are observed in the receptive field of each species, which is consistent with the rapid evolution of the peripheral olfactory system. Our results reveal substantial inter-species variability in the algorithms directing larval chemotaxis. While the basic sensorimotor routines are shared, their parametric arrangements can vary dramatically across species. The present analysis sets the stage for deciphering the evolutionary relationships between the structure and function of neural circuits directing orientation behaviors in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual regulation of spine-specific and synapse-to-nucleus signaling by PKCδ during plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The activity-dependent plasticity of synapses is believed to be the cellular basis of learning. These synaptic changes are mediated through the coordination of local biochemical reactions in synapses and changes in gene transcription in the nucleus to modulate neuronal circuits and behavior. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of isozymes has long been established as critical for synaptic plasticity. However, due to a lack of suitable isozyme-specific tools, the role of the novel subfamily of PKC isozymes is largely unknown. Here, through the development of FLIM-FRET activity sensors, we investigate novel PKC isozymes in synaptic plasticity in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that PKC{delta} is activated downstream of TrkB and that the spatiotemporal nature of its activation depends on the plasticity stimulation. In response to single spine plasticity, PKC{delta} is activated primarily in the stimulated spine and is required for local expression of plasticity. However, in response to multi-spine stimulation, a long-lasting and spreading activation of PKC{delta} scales with the number of spines stimulated and, by regulating CREB activity, couples spine plasticity to transcription in the nucleus. Thus, PKC{delta} plays a dual functional role in facilitating synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of infants' neural speech processing and its relation to later language skills: an MEG study</a></h4>

              
                The 'sensitive period' for phonetic learning (~6-12 months) is one of the earliest milestones in language acquisition where infants start to become specialized in processing speech sounds in their native language. In the last decade, advancements in neuroimaging technologies for infants are starting to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms supporting this important learning period. The current study reports on the largest longitudinal dataset to date with the aim to replicate and extend on two important questions: 1) what are the developmental changes during the 'sensitive period' for native and nonnative speech processing? 2) how does native and nonnative speech processing in infants predict later language outcomes? Fifty-four infants were recruited at 7 months of age and their neural processing of speech was measured using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Specifically, the neural sensitivity to a native and a nonnative speech contrast was indexed by the mismatch response (MMR). They repeated the measurement again at 11 months of age and their language development was further tracked from 12 months to 30 months of age using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI). Using an a prior Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach, we observed significant increases for the Native MMR in the left inferior frontal region (IF) and superior temporal region (ST) from 7 to 11 months, but not for the Nonnative MMR. Complementary whole brain comparison revealed more widespread developmental changes for both contrasts. However, only individual differences in the left IF and ST for the Nonnative MMR at 11 months of age were significant predictors of individual vocabulary growth up to 30 months of age. An exploratory machine-learning based analysis further revealed that whole brain MMR for both Native and Nonnative contrasts can robustly predict later outcomes, but with very different underlying spatial-temporal patterns. The current study extends our current knowledge and suggests that native and nonnative speech processing may follow different developmental trajectories and utilize different mechanisms that are relevant for later language skills.

	<p>Introduction: This paper describes a case of bi-frontal vasogenic oedema associated with bilateral frontal lobe and left parietal lobe white matter lesions where extensive investigations, including brain biopsy, failed to establish a diagnosis. Case Report: A 67-year-old female presented with three weeks’ history of memory loss, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and occasional dysphasia. Physical examination was unremarkable, yet cerebral CT and MRI showed bilateral frontal lobe vasogenic oedema. Extensive investigations, including: biochemical; radiological; immunological; microbiological; haematological; histopathological; and cytological, failed to establish a confirmed diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team could not achieve a consensus for this atypical presentation. Brain biopsy was unusual, showing destructive inflammatory and subtly granulomatous disease, but an exhaustive list of auxiliary tests could not confirm a cause, and consensus favoured glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmune encephalopathy. Discussion: A definitive diagnosis could not be established for this patient despite a gamut of investigations. Although some of the presenting features were consistent with GFAP astrocytopathy, initial staining of the patient’s CSF for neuronal antibodies was negative. Her symptoms and radiological changes of brain imaging improved without any corticosteroid therapy. Conclusions: Through this case report, the aim is to add to the repository of neurological sciences in the hope that future similar presentations could potentially lead to discovery of a new aetiology or contribute towards better understanding of an existing disease process.</p>

	<p>Although fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms of MS, its pathogenesis is not well understood yet. This study aims to introduce a new holistic approach to measure fatigue and its influencing factors via a mobile app. Fatigue is measured with different patient-reported outcome measures (Visual Analog Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale) and tests (Symbol Digit Modalities Test). The influencing vital and environmental factors are captured with a smartwatch and phone sensors. Patients can track these factors within the app. To individually counteract their fatigue, a fatigue course, based on the current treatment guidelines, was implemented. The course implies knowledge about fatigue and MS, exercises, energy-conservation management, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, the design of the Fimo health app follows the ten strategies of the process of change, which is a proven approach to designing health intervention programs. By monitoring fatigue and individual influencing factors, patients can better understand and manage their fatigue. They can share their data and insights about fatigue and its influencing factors with their doctors. Thus, they can receive individualized therapies and drug plans.</p>

	<p>Since ancient times, animal models have provided fundamental information in medical knowledge. This also applies for discoveries in the field of inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs), where they have been instrumental for our understanding of nerve development, pathogenesis of neuropathy, molecules and pathways involved and to design potential therapies. In this review, we briefly describe how animal models have been used in ancient medicine until the use of rodents as the prevalent model in present times. We then travel along different examples of how rodents have been used to improve our understanding of IPNs. We do not intend to describe all discoveries and animal models developed for IPNs, but just to touch on a few arbitrary and paradigmatic examples, taken from our direct experience or from literature. The idea is to show how strategies have been developed to finally arrive to possible treatments for IPNs.</p>

	<p>This is a study of the collocation of Chinese verbs with different lexical aspects and aspect markers. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we explored the processing of aspect violation sentences. In the experiment, we combined verbs of various lexical aspect types with the progressive aspect marker zhe, and the combination of the achievement verbs and the progressive aspect marker zhe constituted the sentence’s aspect violation. The participants needed to judge whether a sentence was correct after it was presented. Finally, we observed and analyzed the components of ERPs. The results suggest that when the collocation of aspect markers and lexical aspect is ungrammatical, the N400-like and P600 are elicited on aspect markers, while the late AN is elicited by the word after the aspect marker. P600 and N400-like show that the collocation of Chinese verbs with various lexical aspects and aspect markers involve not only syntactic processing, but also the semantic processing; and the late AN may have been due to the syntax revision and the conclusion at the end of sentences.</p>

	<p>The secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are distress triggers and risk factors for mental health. Conversely, self-compassion skills and compassionate thoughts/behaviors towards suffering may contribute to their alleviation. Both psychological constructs are interrelated in life-threatening diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The Teruel Study retrospectively evaluated the impact of strict confinement on the 44 people with MS of this Spanish province and 24 caregivers, specifically assessing (1) fears and perceptions; (2) self-compassion (people with MS) and compassion (caregivers); (3) physical and mental health, and fatigue. Despite better housing conditions, people with MS considered confinement very difficult to handle, more than their caregivers, but they were less afraid of COVID-19 and worsening of MS. Still, they recognized worse health than before confinement. Reclusion and lack of walks were the worst of confinement. Caregivers also referred to lack of leisure and uncertainty–fear. All agreed the best was staying with the family, but some found ‘nothing’ positive. Self-compassion remained moderate–high and strongly correlated with their moderate levels of social function, vitality, physical role, and global health. Physical and cognitive fatigue scores were high, and self-compassion negatively correlated with them, explaining a 19% variance in global health. The high compassion of the caregivers did not correlate with any variable.</p>

	<p>Background. Motor imagery engages much of the same neural circuits as an overt movement. Therefore, the mental rehearsal of movements is often used to supplement physical training and might aid motor neurorehabilitation after stroke. One attempt to capture the brain’s involvement in imagery involves the use, as a marker, of the depression or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of thalamocortical sensorimotor rhythms found in a human electroencephalogram (EEG). Using fast real-time processing, it is possible to make the subject aware of their own brain reactions or—even better—to turn them into actions through a technology called the brain–computer interface (BCI). However, it remains unclear whether BCI-enabled imagery facilitates a stronger or qualitatively different brain response compared to the open-loop training. Methods. Seven healthy volunteers who were experienced in both closed and open-loop motor imagery took part in six experimental sessions over a period of 4.5 months, in which they performed kinesthetic imagery of a previously known set of finger and arm movements with simultaneous 30-channel EEG acquisition. The first and the last session mostly consisted of feedback trials in which the subjects were presented with the classification results of the EEG patterns in real time; during the other sessions, no feedback was provided. Spatiotemporal and amplitude features of the ERD patterns concomitant with imagery were compared across experimental days and between feedback conditions using linear mixed-effects modeling. Results. The main spatial sources of ERD appeared to be highly stable across the six experimental days, remaining nearly identical in five of seven subjects (Pearson’s ρ &amp;amp;gt; 0.94). Only in one subject did the spatial pattern of activation statistically significantly differ (p = 0.009) between the feedback and no-feedback conditions. Real-time visual feedback delivered through the BCI did not significantly increase the ERD strength. Conclusion. The results imply that the potential benefits of MI could be yielded by well-habituated subjects with a simplified open-loop setup, e.g., through at-home self-practice.</p>

	<p>A substantial amount of amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulates in the occipital cortices; however, it draws less attention. We investigated the clinical implications of Aβ accumulation in the occipital lobes in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum. [18F]-Florbetaben amyloid PET scans were performed in a total of 121 AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. Of the 121 patients, 74 Aβ positive patients were divided into occipital Aβ positive (OCC+) and occipital Aβ negative (OCC−) groups based on Aβ accumulation in the bilateral occipital lobes. The OCC+ group (41/74, 55.4%) was younger and had a younger age at onset than the OCC− group. The OCC+ group also had an increased standard uptake value ratio in the occipital lobes and greater cortical thinning in relevant areas. The OCC+ group had a higher global deterioration scale, lower performance for the copy, immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition in Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure tests than the OCC- group, although both groups had similar disease durations. AD or aMCI patients in the OCC+ group exhibited features noted in early onset AD with relevant neuropsychological and image findings. Occipital Aβ positivity in amyloid PET scans need to be considered as an underestimated marker of early onset AD continuum.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurological disease defined by progressive movement incoordination. We undertook a comprehensive characterization of the spatial profile and progressive evolution of structural brain abnormalities in people with FRDA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A coordinated international analysis of regional brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging data charted the whole-brain profile, interindividual variability, and temporal staging of structural brain differences in 248 individuals with FRDA and 262 healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The brainstem, dentate nucleus region, and superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles showed the greatest reductions in volume relative to controls (Cohen <i>d</i> = 1.5–2.6). Cerebellar gray matter alterations were most pronounced in lobules I–VI (<i>d</i> = 0.8), whereas cerebral differences occurred most prominently in precentral gyri (<i>d</i> = 0.6) and corticospinal tracts (<i>d</i> = 1.4). Earlier onset age predicted less volume in the motor cerebellum (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.35) and peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.36). Disease duration and severity correlated with volume deficits in the dentate nucleus region, brainstem, and superior/inferior cerebellar peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = −0.49); subgrouping showed these to be robust and early features of FRDA, and strong candidates for further biomarker validation. Cerebral white matter abnormalities, particularly in corticospinal pathways, emerge as intermediate disease features. Cerebellar and cerebral gray matter loss, principally targeting motor and sensory systems, preferentially manifests later in the disease course.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FRDA is defined by an evolving spatial profile of neuroanatomical changes beyond primary pathology in the cerebellum and spinal cord, in line with its progressive clinical course. The design, interpretation, and generalization of research studies and clinical trials must consider neuroanatomical staging and associated interindividual variability in brain measures.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in motor dysfunction, non-motor symptoms, and eventual dementia (PDD). Neuropathological hallmarks include nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, Lewy body (LB) pathology, and neuroinflammation. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a primary component of LBs, is implicated in PD pathogenesis, accumulating, and aggregating in both familial and sporadic PD. However, as α-syn pathology is often comorbid with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles in PDD, it is still unclear whether α-syn is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in sporadic PDD. We aimed to determine how the absence of α-syn would affect PDD manifestation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IFN-β knockout (<i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>) mice spontaneously develop progressive behavior abnormalities and neuropathology resembling PDD, notably with α-syn<sup>+</sup> LBs. We generated <i>Ifnb/Snca</i> double knockout (DKO) mice and evaluated their behavior and neuropathology compared with wild-type (Wt), <i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>, and <i>Snca</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> mice using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, immunoblots, qPCR, and modification of neuronal signaling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>Ifnb/Snca</i> DKO mice developed all clinical PDD-like behavioral manifestations induced by IFN-β loss. Independently of α-syn expression, lack of IFN-β alone induced Aβ plaques, pTau tangles, and LB-like Aβ<sup>+</sup>/pTau<sup>+</sup> inclusion bodies and neuroinflammation. IFN-β loss caused significant elevated glial and neuronal TNF-α and neuronal TNFR1, associated with neurodegeneration. Restoring neuronal IFN-β signaling or blocking TNFR1 rescued caspase 3/t-BID-mediated neuronal-death through upregulation of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub> and lowered intraneuronal Aβ and pTau accumulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings increase our understanding of PD pathology and suggest that targeting α-syn alone is not sufficient to mitigate disease. Targeting specific aspects of neuroinflammation, such as aberrant neuronal TNF-α/TNFR1 or IFN-β/IFNAR signaling, may attenuate disease. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Hypercoagulation is a hallmark of both the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It increases the risk for vascular thrombosis, including peripheral artery diseases. Among others, acute limb ischemia (ALI) is one of most common complications that requires immediate and prompt treatments to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the complex interplay between COVID-19, T2DM and its complications (e.g., diabetic nephropathy), and ALI creates a great challenge in the management of the disease. Here, we present a case of a 59-year-old diabetic female with progressive pain in her left leg in the last five years, which was significantly intensified following COVID-19 diagnosis. Bluish coloration, numbness and functional impairments were observed during examinations with no palpable pulsation on left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The patient also had diabetic nephropathy (stage III), hypoalbuminemia, anemia and a urinary tract infection that complicated the management of the disease. Due to the excruciating pain and the worsening of the limb conditions, right leg revascularization and left leg amputation were performed at day 14 after admission. Following the surgeries, no more pain was observed and patient was discharged for further follow-up at the outpatient clinic.

                <p>by Hidenori Tanaka, Jason F. Kreisberg, Trey Ideker</p>

Despite the growing constellation of genetic loci linked to common traits, these loci have yet to account for most heritable variation, and most act through poorly understood mechanisms. Recent machine learning (ML) systems have used hierarchical biological knowledge to associate genetic mutations with phenotypic outcomes, yielding substantial predictive power and mechanistic insight. Here, we use an ontology-guided ML system to map single nucleotide variants (SNVs) focusing on 6 classic phenotypic traits in natural yeast populations. The 29 identified loci are largely novel and account for ~17% of the phenotypic variance, versus <3% for standard genetic analysis. Representative results show that sensitivity to hydroxyurea is linked to SNVs in two alternative purine biosynthesis pathways, and that sensitivity to copper arises through failure to detoxify reactive oxygen species in fatty acid metabolism. This work demonstrates a knowledge-based approach to amplifying and interpreting signals in population genetic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inactivation mode of sodium channels defines the different maximal firing rates of conventional versus atypical midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher J. Knowlton, Tabea Ines Ziouziou, Niklas Hammer, Jochen Roeper, Carmen C. Canavier</p>

Two subpopulations of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are known to have different dynamic firing ranges <i>in vitro</i> that correspond to distinct projection targets: the originally identified conventional DA neurons project to the dorsal striatum and the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens, whereas an atypical DA population with higher maximum firing frequencies projects to prefrontal regions and other limbic regions including the medial shell of nucleus accumbens. Using a computational model, we show that previously identified differences in biophysical properties do not fully account for the larger dynamic range of the atypical population and predict that the major difference is that originally identified conventional cells have larger occupancy of voltage-gated sodium channels in a long-term inactivated state that recovers slowly; stronger sodium and potassium conductances during action potential firing are also predicted for the conventional compared to the atypical DA population. These differences in sodium channel gating imply that longer intervals between spikes are required in the conventional population for full recovery from long-term inactivation induced by the preceding spike, hence the lower maximum frequency. These same differences can also change the bifurcation structure to account for distinct modes of entry into depolarization block: abrupt versus gradual. The model predicted that in cells that have entered depolarization block, it is much more likely that an additional depolarization can evoke an action potential in conventional DA population. New experiments comparing lateral to medial shell projecting neurons confirmed this model prediction, with implications for differential synaptic integration in the two populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Envelope reconstruction of speech and music highlights stronger tracking of speech at low frequencies</a></h4>

The human brain tracks amplitude fluctuations of both speech and music, which reflects acoustic processing in addition to the encoding of higher-order features and one’s cognitive state. Comparing neural tracking of speech and music envelopes can elucidate stimulus-general mechanisms, but direct comparisons are confounded by differences in their envelope spectra. Here, we use a novel method of frequency-constrained reconstruction of stimulus envelopes using EEG recorded during passive listening. We expected to see music reconstruction match speech in a narrow range of frequencies, but instead we found that speech was reconstructed better than music for all frequencies we examined. Additionally, models trained on all stimulus types performed as well or better than the stimulus-specific models at higher modulation frequencies, suggesting a common neural mechanism for tracking speech and music. However, speech envelope tracking at low frequencies, below 1 Hz, was associated with increased weighting over parietal channels, which was not present for the other stimuli. Our results highlight the importance of low-frequency speech tracking and suggest an origin from speech-specific processing in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of COVID-19 exit strategies in an individual-based transmission model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Federica Gugole, Luc E. Coffeng, Wouter Edeling, Benjamin Sanderse, Sake J. de Vlas, Daan Crommelin</p>

Many countries are currently dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic and are searching for an exit strategy such that life in society can return to normal. To support this search, computational models are used to predict the spread of the virus and to assess the efficacy of policy measures before actual implementation. The model output has to be interpreted carefully though, as computational models are subject to uncertainties. These can stem from, e.g., limited knowledge about input parameters values or from the intrinsic stochastic nature of some computational models. They lead to uncertainties in the model predictions, raising the question what distribution of values the model produces for key indicators of the severity of the epidemic. Here we show how to tackle this question using techniques for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. We assess the uncertainties and sensitivities of four exit strategies implemented in an agent-based transmission model with geographical stratification. The exit strategies are termed Flattening the Curve, Contact Tracing, Intermittent Lockdown and Phased Opening. We consider two key indicators of the ability of exit strategies to avoid catastrophic health care overload: the maximum number of prevalent cases in intensive care (IC), and the total number of IC patient-days in excess of IC bed capacity. Our results show that uncertainties not directly related to the exit strategies are secondary, although they should still be considered in comprehensive analysis intended to inform policy makers. The sensitivity analysis discloses the crucial role of the intervention uptake by the population and of the capability to trace infected individuals. Finally, we explore the existence of a safe operating space. For Intermittent Lockdown we find only a small region in the model parameter space where the key indicators of the model stay within safe bounds, whereas this region is larger for the other exit strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">STDP and the distribution of preferred phases in the whisker system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nimrod Sherf, Maoz Shamir</p>

Rats and mice use their whiskers to probe the environment. By rhythmically swiping their whiskers back and forth they can detect the existence of an object, locate it, and identify its texture. Localization can be accomplished by inferring the whisker’s position. Rhythmic neurons that track the phase of the whisking cycle encode information about the azimuthal location of the whisker. These neurons are characterized by preferred phases of firing that are narrowly distributed. Consequently, pooling the rhythmic signal from several upstream neurons is expected to result in a much narrower distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population, which however has not been observed empirically. Here, we show how spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can provide a solution to this conundrum. We investigated the effect of STDP on the utility of a neural population to transmit rhythmic information downstream using the framework of a modeling study. We found that under a wide range of parameters, STDP facilitated the transfer of rhythmic information despite the fact that all the synaptic weights remained dynamic. As a result, the preferred phase of the downstream neuron was not fixed, but rather drifted in time at a drift velocity that depended on the preferred phase, thus inducing a distribution of preferred phases. We further analyzed how the STDP rule governs the distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population. This link between the STDP rule and the distribution of preferred phases constitutes a natural test for our theory.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hierarchy and control of ageing-related methylation networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gergely Palla, Péter Pollner, Judit Börcsök, András Major, Béla Molnár, István Csabai</p>

DNA methylation provides one of the most widely studied biomarkers of ageing. Since the methylation of CpG dinucleotides function as switches in cellular mechanisms, it is plausible to assume that by proper adjustment of these switches age may be tuned. Though, adjusting hundreds of CpG methylation levels coherently may never be feasible and changing just a few positions may lead to biologically unstable state.
A prominent example of methylation-based age estimators is provided by Horvath’s clock, based on 353 CpG dinucleotides, showing a high correlation (not necessarily causation) with chronological age across multiple tissue types. On this small subset of CpG dinucleotides we demonstrate how the adjustment of one methylation level leads to a cascade of changes at other sites. Among the studied subset, we locate the most important CpGs (and related genes) that may have a large influence on the rest of the sub-system. According to our analysis, the structure of this network is way more hierarchical compared to what one would expect based on ensembles of uncorrelated connections. Therefore, only a handful of CpGs is enough to modify the system towards a desired state.
When propagation of the change over the network is taken into account, the resulting modification in the predicted age can be significantly larger compared to the effect of isolated CpG perturbations. By adjusting the most influential single CpG site and following the propagation of methylation level changes we can reach up to 5.74 years in virtual age reduction, significantly larger than without taking into account of the network control. Extending our approach to the whole methylation network may identify key nodes that have controller role in the ageing process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptomic entropy benchmarks stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte maturation against endogenous tissue at single cell level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suraj Kannan, Michael Farid, Brian L. Lin, Matthew Miyamoto, Chulan Kwon</p>

The immaturity of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived tissues has emerged as a universal problem for their biomedical applications. While efforts have been made to generate adult-like cells from PSCs, direct benchmarking of PSC-derived tissues against <i>in vivo</i> development has not been established. Thus, maturation status is often assessed on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a promising solution, though cross-study comparison is limited by dataset-specific batch effects. Here, we developed a novel approach to quantify PSC-derived cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation through transcriptomic entropy. Transcriptomic entropy is robust across datasets regardless of differences in isolation protocols, library preparation, and other potential batch effects. With this new model, we analyzed over 45 scRNA-seq datasets and over 52,000 CMs, and established a cross-study, cross-species CM maturation reference. This reference enabled us to directly compare PSC-CMs with the <i>in vivo</i> developmental trajectory and thereby to quantify PSC-CM maturation status. We further found that our entropy-based approach can be used for other cell types, including pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes. Our study presents a biologically relevant and interpretable metric for quantifying PSC-derived tissue maturation, and is extensible to numerous tissue engineering contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptation supports short-term memory in a visual change detection task</a></h4>

The maintenance of short-term memories is critical for survival in a dynamically changing world. Previous studies suggest that this memory can be stored in the form of persistent neural activity or using a synaptic mechanism, such as with short-term plasticity. Here, we compare the predictions of these two mechanisms to neural and behavioral measurements in a visual change detection task. Mice were trained to respond to changes in a repeated sequence of natural images while neural activity was recorded using two-photon calcium imaging. We also trained two types of artificial neural networks on the same change detection task as the mice. Following fixed pre-processing using a pretrained convolutional neural network, either a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a feedforward neural network with short-term synaptic depression (STPNet) was trained to the same level of performance as the mice. While both networks are able to learn the task, the STPNet model contains units whose activity are more similar to the <i>in vivo</i> data and produces errors which are more similar to the mice. When images are omitted, an unexpected perturbation which was absent during training, mice often do not respond to the omission but are more likely to respond to the subsequent image. Unlike the RNN model, STPNet produces a similar pattern of behavior. These results suggest that simple neural adaptation mechanisms may serve as an important bottom-up memory signal in this task, which can be used by downstream areas in the decision-making process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Salivary biomarkers associated with the progression of disease in people living with HIV: A scoping review protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biomarkers are measurable indicators of normal biological processes, which provide an objective assessment of the physiologic state of living systems. Saliva contains several biomarkers that serve as a diagnostic tool in health and disease. Evaluation of a multitude of salivary components could potentially predict the clinical outcome. This is especially critical in a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Scrupulous evaluation of relevant biomarkers could facilitate the early detection of HIV, determine the stage of infection and monitor the disease progression. Currently, there is a paucity of validated biomarkers in saliva predicting the disease progression in people living with HIV. In this scoping review, we aim to provide an overview of the available evidence on salivary markers associated with the progression of disease in people living with HIV. Methods: The authors shall develop a tailored search strategy for each database using relevant keywords. We will search for eligible studies indexed in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and gray literature. We will restrict the search to studies published in the English language. Following deduplication, all search results will be exported to the EPPI reviewer web, where two independent reviewers using a data extraction tool developed and pretested by the review authors will screen eligible studies. The result of this review will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and reporting guidelines. Discussion: The proposed scoping review protocol will enable the identification and assessment of salivary biomarkers, which can predict disease progression in patients with HIV infection. The synthesis of evidence from this review will assist in improving our current understanding of biomarkers used to evaluate the progression of HIV infection.

                Background: Occupational contact with dust particles is a well-known phenomenon, particularly in developing countries of the world. Crystalline silica present in marble dust is the main etiology of a rising prevalence of obstructive lung diseases in marble stone workers, who are in direct contact with marble dust in the surrounding environment during their regular work.  The purpose of this study was to compare the pulmonary function parameters of workers in marble workshops and age matched healthy individuals in the Lahore District of Pakistan. Methods: The study included 164 male individuals, 82 individuals working in marble workshops and 82 healthy individuals from the same community. Data were collected through in-person interviews using a structured questionnaire after obtaining written consent. A Spiro Lab spirometry for pulmonary function tests was used to identify any change in the lung function parameters. FVC% (forced vital capacity), FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in first second) and FEV1 / FVC ratio were evaluated. Results: Mean age in the exposed group (marble workers) and non-exposed group (healthy individuals) were 29.92 ± 6.19 and 30.58 ± 6.37 years, respectively. The mean years of work experience of the exposed group was 11.92 ± 5.67 years. A statistically insignificant difference was observed between marble exposed workers & healthy individuals from the demographic variables. Lung function parameters in marble workers exhibited a highly significant (P < 0.001) decrease in FVC%, FEV1 & FEV1 / FVC ratio when compared to healthy individuals. Seventy-one percent of marble workers had abnormal pulmonary parameters whereas 34% of workers had restrictive pulmonary impairment. Marble workers who had worked for more than 15 years had a highly significant risk of developing abnormal pulmonary function (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Continuous exposure to marble dust deteriorates the lung function of marble workers.

                Background: A recommender system captures the user preferences and behaviour to provide a relevant recommendation to the user. In a hybrid model-based recommender system, it requires a pre-trained data model to generate recommendations for a user. Ontology helps to represent the semantic information and relationships to model the expressivity and linkage among the data. Methods: We enhanced the matrix factorization model accuracy by utilizing ontology to enrich the information of the user-item matrix by integrating the item-based and user-based collaborative filtering techniques. In particular, the combination of enriched data, which consists of semantic similarity together with rating pattern, will help to reduce the cold start problem in the model-based recommender system. When the new user or item first coming into the system, we have the user demographic or item profile that linked to our ontology. Thus, semantic similarity can be calculated during the item-based and user-based collaborating filtering process. The item-based and user-based filtering process are used to predict the unknown rating of the original matrix. Results: Experimental evaluations have been carried out on the MovieLens 100k dataset to demonstrate the accuracy rate of our proposed approach as compared to the baseline method using (i) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and (ii) combination of item-based collaborative filtering technique with SVD. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method has reduced the data sparsity from 0.9542% to 0.8435%. In addition, it also indicated that our proposed method has achieved better accuracy with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9298, as compared to the baseline method (RMSE: 0.9642) and the existing method (RMSE: 0.9492). Conclusions: Our proposed method enhanced the dataset information by integrating user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques. The experiment results shows that our system has reduced the data sparsity and has better accuracy as compared to baseline method and existing method.

                Despite the intervention of WHO on vaccination for reducing the spread of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), there are records of the high prevalence of HBV in some regions. In this paper, a mathematical model was formulated to analyze the acquisition and transmission process of the virus with the view of identifying the possible way of reducing the menace and mitigating the risk of the virus. The models' positivity and boundedness were demonstrated using well-known theorems. Equating the differential equations to zero demonstrates the equilibria of the solutions i.e., the disease-free and endemic equilibrium. The next Generation Matrix method was used to compute the basic reproduction number for the models. Local and global stabilities of the models were shown via linearization and Lyapunov function methods respectively. The importance of testing and treatment on the dynamics of HBV were fully discussed in this paper. It was discovered that testing at the acute stage of the virus and chronic unaware state helps in better management of the virus.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between maternal antenatal care visits and newborn low birth weight in Bangladesh: a national representative survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low Birth Weight (LBW) is a global health concern for childhood mortality and morbidity. The objectives of this study were to assess the association between the number of Antenatal Care Visits (ANC) and LBW among Bangladeshi newborns, and to identify the demographic and socio-economic predictors of LBW.   Methods: Our present cross-sectional study is based on the secondary data of the Bangladesh Demography and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014. Complete data of 4,235 (weighted) mother-child pairs were included in the analysis.   Results: The overall prevalence of LBW among newborns were found to be 19.3% (95% CI: 17.8-20.9). Among the mothers who received antenatal care services 1-3 times during pregnancy, 35% had less possibility of having LBW babies [COR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85]. The association remained significant after adjusting the analysis with the sex of the newborn, administrative regions (division), maternal educational status, mother’s weight status and fathers’ occupation [AOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99]. Additionally, the sex of the newborn, division, maternal education, maternal weight status, and fathers’ occupational status were found to be significantly associated with LBW.   Conclusion: Increasing the coverage of antenatal services and enabling mothers to receive quality antenatal services may substantially contribute to reducing the prevalence of LBW in Bangladesh.

                Little is known about how dopamine outside of the prefrontal cortex affects working memory. Froudist-Walsh et al. identify a gradient of dopamine receptors in the macaque cortex and use this to build a large-scale computational cortex model. A gradient of cortical dopamine modulation provides a parsimonious explanation for diverse findings in the literature.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PARROT is a flexible recurrent neural network framework for analysis of large protein datasets</a></h4>

              
                The rise of high-throughput experiments has transformed how scientists approach biological questions. The ubiquity of large-scale assays that can test thousands of samples in a day has necessitated the development of new computational approaches to interpret this data. Among these tools, machine learning approaches are increasingly being utilized due to their ability to infer complex nonlinear patterns from high-dimensional data. Despite their effectiveness, machine learning (and in particular deep learning) approaches are not always accessible or easy to implement for those with limited computational expertise. Here we present PARROT, a general framework for training and applying deep learning-based predictors on large protein datasets. Using an internal recurrent neural network architecture, PARROT is capable of tackling both classification and regression tasks while only requiring raw protein sequences as input. We showcase the potential uses of PARROT on three diverse machine learning tasks: predicting phosphorylation sites, predicting transcriptional activation function of peptides generated by high-throughput reporter assays, and predicting the fibrillization propensity of amyloid beta with data generated by deep mutational scanning. Through these examples, we demonstrate that PARROT is easy to use, performs comparably to state-of-the-art computational tools, and is applicable for a wide array of biological problems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural characterization of NrnC identifies unifying features of dinucleotidases</a></h4>

              
                RNA degradation is fundamental for cellular homeostasis. The process is carried out by various classes of endolytic and exolytic enzymes that together degrade an RNA polymer to mono-ribonucleotides. Within the exoribonucleases, nano-RNases play a unique role as they act on the smallest breakdown products and hence catalyze the final steps in the process. We recently showed that oligoribonuclease (Orn) acts as a dedicated diribonucleotidase, defining the ultimate step in RNA degradation that is crucial for cellular fitness (Kim et al., 2019). Whether such a specific activity exists in organisms that lack Orn-type exoribonucleases remained unclear. Through quantitative structure-function analyses we show here that NrnC-type RNases share this narrow substrate length preference with Orn. Although NrnC employs similar structural features that distinguish these two classes as dinucleotidases from other exonucleases, the key determinants for dinucleotidase activity are realized through distinct structural scaffolds. The structures together with comparative genomic analyses of the phylogeny of DEDD-type exoribonucleases indicates convergent evolution as the mechanism of how dinucleotidase activity emerged repeatedly in various organisms. The evolutionary pressure to maintain dinucleotidase activity further underlines the important role these analogous proteins play for cell growth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterizing human mobility patterns in rural settings of sub-Saharan Africa</a></h4>

              
                Human mobility is a core component of human behavior and its quantification is critical for understanding its impact on infectious disease transmission, traffic forecasting, access to resources and care, intervention strategies, and migratory flows. When mobility data are limited, spatial interaction models have been widely used to estimate human travel, but have not been extensively validated in low- and middle-income settings. Geographic, sociodemographic, and infrastructure differences may impact the ability for models to capture these patterns, particularly in rural settings. Here, we analyzed mobility patterns inferred from mobile phone data in four Sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the ability for variants on gravity and radiation models to estimate travel. Adjusting the gravity model such that parameters were fit to different trip types, including travel between more or less populated areas and/or different regions, improved model fit in all four countries. This suggests that alternative models may be more useful in these settings and better able to capture the range of mobility patterns observed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Monocyte-derived transcriptome signature indicates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis as a potential mechanism of vaccine-induced protection against HIV-1</a></h4>

              
                A gene signature previously correlated with mosaic adenovirus 26 vaccine protection in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and SHIV challenge models in non-human primates (NHP). In this report we investigated presence of this signature as a correlate of reduced risk in human clinical trials and potential mechanisms of protection. The absence of this gene signature in the DNA/rAd5 human vaccine trial, which did not show efficacy, strengthens our hypothesis that this signature is only enriched in studies that demonstrated protection. This gene signature was enriched in the partially effective RV144 human trial that administered the ALVAC/protein vaccine, and we find that the signature associates with both decreased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and increased vaccine efficacy. Total RNA-seq in a clinical trial that used the same vaccine regimen as the RV144 HIV vaccine implicated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) as a potential mechanism of vaccine protection. CITE-seq profiling of 53 surface markers and transcriptomes of 53,777 single cells from the same trial showed that genes in this signature were primarily expressed in cells belonging to the myeloid lineage, including monocytes, which are major effector cells for ADCP. The consistent association of this transcriptome signature with vaccine efficacy represents a tool both to identify potential mechanisms, as with ADCP here, and to screen novel approaches to accelerate development of new vaccine candidates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gamete expression of TALE class HD genes activates the diploid sporophyte program in Marchantia polymorpha</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic life cycles alternate between haploid and diploid phases and in phylogenetically diverse unicellular eukaryotes, expression of paralogous homeodomain genes in gametes primes the haploid-to-diploid transition. In the unicellular Chlorophyte alga <i>Chlamydomonas</i> KNOX and BELL TALE-homeodomain genes mediate this transition. We demonstrate that in the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> paternal (sperm) expression of three of five phylogenetically diverse BELL genes, Mp<i>BELL234</i>, and maternal (egg) expression of both Mp<i>KNOX1</i> and Mp<i>BELL34 </i>mediate the haploid-to-diploid transition. Loss-of-function alleles of Mp<i>KNOX1</i> result in zygotic arrest, whereas loss of either maternal or paternal Mp<i>BELL234</i> results in variable zygotic and early embryonic arrest. Expression of Mp<i>KNOX1</i> and Mp<i>BELL34</i> during diploid sporophyte development is consistent with a later role for these genes in patterning the sporophyte. These results indicate that the ancestral mechanism to activate diploid gene expression was retained in early diverging land plants and subsequently co-opted during evolution of the diploid sporophyte body.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ectocytosis prevents accumulation of ciliary cargo in C. elegans sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Cilia are sensory organelles protruding from cell surfaces. Release of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from cilia was previously observed in mammals, Chlamydomonas, and in male <i>C. elegans</i>. Using the EV marker TSP-6 (an ortholog of mammalian CD9) and other ciliary receptors, we show that EVs are formed from ciliated sensory neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> hermaphrodites. Release of EVs is observed from two ciliary locations: the cilia tip and/or Periciliary Membrane Compartment (PCMC). Outward budding of EVs from the cilia tip leads to their release into the environment. EVs budding from the PCMC are concomitantly phagocytosed by the associated glial cells. To maintain cilia composition, a tight regulation of cargo import and removal is achieved by the action of Intra-Flagellar Transport (IFT). Unbalanced IFT due to cargo overexpression or mutations in the IFT machinery leads to local accumulation of ciliary proteins. Disposal of excess ciliary proteins via EVs reduces their local accumulation and exports them to the environment and/or to the glia associated to these ciliated neurons. We suggest that EV budding from cilia subcompartments acts as a safeguard mechanism to remove deleterious excess of ciliary material.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">'Fearful-place' coding in the amygdala-hippocampal network</a></h4>

              
                Animals seeking survival needs must be able to assess different locations of threats in their habitat. However, the neural integration of spatial and risk information essential for guiding goal-directed behavior remains poorly understood. Thus, we investigated simultaneous activities of fear-responsive basal amygdala (BA) and place-responsive dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) neurons as rats left the safe nest to search for food in an exposed space and encountered a simulated 'predator'. In this realistic situation, BA cells increased their firing rates and dHPC place cells decreased their spatial stability near the threat. Importantly, only those dHPC cells synchronized with the predator-responsive BA cells remapped significantly as a function of escalating risk location. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of BA neurons was sufficient to cause spatial avoidance behavior and disrupt place fields. These results suggest a dynamic interaction of BA's fear signalling cells and dHPC's spatial coding cells as animals traverse safe-danger areas of their environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transformation of Primary Sensory Cortical Representations from Layer 4 to Layer 2</a></h4>

              
                Sensory input arrives from thalamus in cortical layer (L) 4, from which it flows predominantly to superficial layers, so that L4 to L2 constitutes one of the earliest cortical feedforward networks. Despite extensive study, the transformation performed by this network remains poorly understood. We use two-photon calcium imaging in L2-4 of primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1) to record neural activity as mice perform an object localization task with two whiskers. We find that touch responses sparsen but become more reliable from L4 to L2, with superficial neurons responding to a broader range of touches. Decoding of sensory features either improves from L4 to L2 or remains unchanged. Pairwise correlations increase superficially, with L2/3 containing ensembles of mostly broadly tuned neurons responding robustly to touch. Thus, from L4 to L2, cortex transitions from a dense probabilistic code to a sparse and robust ensemble-based code that improves stimulus decoding, facilitating perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping Pontocerebellar Connectivity with Diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum's involvement in cognitive, affective and motor functions is mediated by connections to different regions of the cerebral cortex. A distinctive feature of cortico-cerebellar loops that has been demonstrated in the animal work is a topographic organization that is preserved across its different components. Here we used diffusion imaging tractography to characterize the connections between the pons and the individual lobules of the cerebellum, and generate a classification of the pons based on its pattern of connectivity. We identified a rostral to caudal gradient in the pons, similar to that observed in the animal work, such that rostral regions were preferentially connected to cerebellar lobules involved in non-motor, and caudal regions with motor regions. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of the cerebellum, and the classifications we generated provide context for future research into the pontocerebellar tract's involvement in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term Motor Learning in the Wild with High Volume Video Game Data</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning occurs over long periods of practice during which motor acuity (the ability to execute actions more accurately, precisely, and within a shorter amount of time) improves. Laboratory-based motor learning studies are typically limited to a small number of participants and a time frame of minutes to several hours per participant. Thus, there is a need to assess the generalizability of theories and findings from lab-based motor learning studies on much larger samples across longer time scales. In addition, laboratory-based studies of motor learning use relatively simple motor tasks which participants are unlikely to be intrinsically motivated to learn, limiting the interpretation of their findings in more ecologically valid settings. We studied the acquisition and longitudinal refinement of a complex sensorimotor skill embodied in a first-person shooter video game scenario, with a large sample size (N = 7174 participants, 682,564 repeats of the 60 sec game) over a period of months. Participants voluntarily practiced the gaming scenario for as much as several hours per day up to 100 days. We found improvement in performance accuracy (quantified as hit rate) was modest over time but motor acuity (quantified as hits per second) improved considerably, with 40-60% retention from one day to the next. We observed steady improvements in motor acuity across multiple days of video game practice, unlike most motor learning tasks studied in the lab that hit a performance ceiling rather quickly. Learning rate was a nonlinear function of baseline performance level, amount of daily practice, and to a lesser extent, number of days between practice sessions. In addition, we found that the benefit of additional practice on any given day was non-monotonic; the greatest improvements in motor acuity were evident with about an hour of practice and 90% of the learning benefit was achieved by practicing 30 minutes per day. Taken together, these results provide a proof-of-concept in studying motor skill acquisition outside the confines of the traditional laboratory and provide new insights into how a complex motor skill is acquired in an ecologically valid setting and refined across much longer time scales than typically explored.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An EEG study on the effect of being overweight on anticipatory and consummatory reward in response to pleasant taste stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Two-thirds of adults in the United Kingdom currently suffer from overweight or obesity, making it one of the biggest contributors to health problems. Within the framework of the incentive sensitisation theory, it has been hypothesised that overweight people experience heightened reward anticipation when encountering cues that signal food, such as pictures and smells of food, but that they experience less reward from consuming food compared to normal-weight people. There is, however, little evidence for this prediction. Few studies test both anticipation and consumption in the same study, and even fewer with electroencephalography (EEG). This study sought to address this gap in the literature by measuring scalp activity when overweight and normal-weight people encountered cues signalling the imminent arrival of pleasant and neutral taste stimuli, and when they received these stimuli. The behavioural data showed that there was a smaller difference in valence ratings between the pleasant and neutral taste in the overweight than normal-weight group, in accordance with our hypothesis. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the groups did not differ in their electrophysiological response to taste stimuli. Instead, there was a reduction in N1 amplitude to both taste and picture cues in overweight relative to normal-weight participants. This suggests that reduced attention to cues may be a crucial factor in risk of overweight.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased temporal discounting and reduced model-based control in problem gambling are not substantially modulated by exposure to virtual gambling environments.</a></h4>

              
                High-performance virtual reality (VR) technology has opened new possibilities for the examination of the reactivity towards addiction-related cues (cue-reactivity) in addiction. In this preregistered study (https://osf.io/4mrta), we investigated the subjective, physiological, and behavioral effects of gambling-related VR environment exposure in participants reporting frequent or pathological gambling (n=31) as well as non-gambling controls (n=29). On two separate days, participants explored two rich and navigable VR-environments (neutral: cafe vs. gambling-related: casino/sports-betting facility), while electrodermal activity and heart rate were continuously measured using remote sensors. Within VR, participants performed a temporal discounting task and a sequential decision-making task designed to assess model-based and model-free contributions to behavior. Replicating previous findings, we found strong evidence for increased temporal discounting and reduced model-based control in participants reporting frequent or pathological gambling. Although VR gambling environment exposure increased subjective craving, there was if anything inconclusive evidence for further behavioral or physiological effects. Instead, VR exposure substantially increased physiological arousal (electrodermal activity), across groups and conditions. VR is a promising tool for the investigation of context effects in addiction, but some caution is warranted since effects of real gambling environments might not generally replicate in VR. Future studies should delineate how factors such as cognitive load and ecological validity could be balanced to create a more naturalistic VR experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DYNAMICS OF NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION REPRODUCED BY CALCIUM-DEPENDENT SERIAL TRANSITIONS IN THE VESICLE FUSION COMPLEX</a></h4>

              
                Neuromuscular transmission, from spontaneous release to facilitation and depression was accurately reproduced by a mechanistic kinetic model of sequential maturation transitions in the molecular fusion complex. The model incorporates three predictions. First, sequential calcium-dependent forward transitions take vesicles from docked to pre-primed to primed states, followed by fusion. Second, pre-priming and priming are reversible. Third, fusion and recycling are unidirectional. The model was fed with experimental data from previous studies while the backward ({beta}) and recycling ({rho}) rate constant values were fitted. Classical experiments were successfully reproduced when every forward () rate constant had the same value, and both backward rate constants were 50-100 times larger. Such disproportion originated an abruptly decreasing gradient of resting vesicles from docked to primed states. Simulations also predict that: i. Spontaneous release reflects primed to fusion spontaneous transitions. ii. Calcium elevations synchronize the series of forward transitions that lead to fusion. iii Facilitation reflects a transient increase of priming following calcium-dependent transitions. iv. Backward transitions and recycling restore the resting state. v. Depression reflects backward transitions and slow recycling after intense release. Such finely-tuned kinetics offers a mechanism for collective non-linear transitional adaptations of a homogeneous vesicle pool to an ever-changing pattern of electrical activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circuit contributions to sensory-driven glutamatergic drive of olfactory bulb mitral and tufted cells during odorant inhalation</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), mitral/tufted (MT) cells respond to odorant inhalation with diverse temporal patterns that are thought to encode odor information. Much of this diversity is already apparent at the level of glutamatergic input to MT cells, which receive direct, monosynaptic excitatory input from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as well as multisynaptic excitatory drive via glutamatergic interneurons. Both pathways are also subject to modulation by inhibitory circuits in the glomerular layer of the OB. To understand the role of direct OSN input versus postsynaptic OB circuit mechanisms in shaping diverse dynamics of glutamatergic drive to MT cells, we imaged glutamate signaling onto MT cell dendrites in anesthetized mice while blocking multisynaptic excitatory drive with ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and blocking presynaptic modulation of glutamate release from OSNs with GABAB receptor antagonists. GABAB receptor blockade increased the magnitude of inhalation-linked glutamate transients onto MT cell apical dendrites without altering their inhalation-linked dynamics, confirming that presynaptic inhibition impacts the gain of OSN inputs to the OB. Surprisingly, blockade of multisynaptic excitation only modestly impacted glutamatergic input to MT cells, causing a slight reduction in the amplitude of inhalation-linked glutamate transients in response to low odorant concentrations and no change in the dynamics of each transient. Postsynaptic blockade also modestly impacted glutamate dynamics over a slower timescale, mainly by reducing adaptation of the glutamate response across multiple inhalations of odorant. These results suggest that direct glutamatergic input from OSNs provides the bulk of excitatory drive to MT cells, and that diversity in the dynamics of this input may be a primary determinant of the temporal diversity in MT cell responses that underlies odor representations at this stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal components of sustained functional hyperemia are differentially modulated by locomotion and silenced with vascular chemogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity underlying sensation, movement or cognition drives regional blood flow enhancement (termed functional hyperemia) to increase the oxygen supply to respiring cells for as long as needed to meet energy demands. However, functional hyperemia is often studied under anesthesia which typically yields response profiles that appear temporally and spatially homogenous. We have insufficient understanding of the underlying kinetics of oxygen delivery in awake animals, especially during specific behaviours that may influence neurally-driven enhancements in cerebral blood flow. Using widefield intrinsic optical signal imaging in awake, head-fixed but active mice, we demonstrated distinct early and late components to changes in intravascular oxygenation in response to sustained (30s) whisker stimulation. We found that the late component (20-30s), but not the early component (1-5s), was strongly influenced by level of whisking/locomotion in the region of highest response and in surrounding regions. Optical flow analyses revealed complex yet stereotyped spatial properties of the early and late components that were related to location within the optical window and the initial state of the cerebral vasculature. In attempt to control these complex response characteristics, we drove a canonical microvasculature constriction pathway using mural cell Gq-chemogenetic mice. A low-dose of systemic C21 strongly limited both the magnitude and spatial extent of the sensory-evoked hemodynamic response, showing that functional hyperemia can be severely limited by direct mural cell activation. These data provide new insights into the cerebral microcirculation in the awake state and may have implications for interpreting functional imaging data.

                White matter supports critical brain functions such as learning and memory, modulates the distribution of action potentials, and acts as a relay of neural communication between different brain regions. Interestingly, neuronal cell bodies exist in deeper white matter tissue, neurotransmitter vesicles are released directly in white matter, and white matter blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals are detectable across a range of different tasks -- all appearing to reflect intrinsic electrical signals in white matter. Yet, such signals within white matter have largely been ignored. Here, we elucidate the properties of white matter signals using intracranial EEG. We show that such signals capture the communication between brain regions and differentiate pathophysiologies of epilepsy. In direct contradiction to past assumptions about white matter inactivity, we show that white matter recordings can elucidate brain function and pathophysiology not apparent in gray matter. Broadly, white matter functional recordings acquired through implantable devices may provide a wealth of currently untapped knowledge about the neurobiology of disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampus maintains a flexible and coherent map under reward flavor-landmark cue conflict.</a></h4>

              
                Animals predominantly use salient visual cues (landmarks) for efficient navigation over other sensory modalities. When the relative position of the visual cues is altered, the hippocampal population exhibits heterogeneous responses and constructs context-specific spatial maps. Another critical factor that can strongly modulate spatial representation is the presence of reward. Reward features can drive behavior and are known to bias spatial attention. However, it is unclear whether reward flavors are used for spatial reference in the presence of distal cues and how the hippocampus population dynamics changes when the association between reward flavors and distal cues is altered. We investigated these questions by recording place cells from the CA1 while the rats ran in an environment with the conflicting association between reward flavors and distal cues. We report that the hippocampal place cells coherently and dynamically bind to reward flavors or distal cues across sessions, but not simultaneously suggesting the use of a single spatial map. We found that place cells maintained their spatial offset in the cue conflict conditions, thus showing a robust spatial coupling featuring an attractor-like property in the CA1. When the textures were added on the track, the coherency of the CA1 is degraded, as the hippocampus showed a heterogeneous response and weak spatial coupling of co-recorded cells suggesting a break away from the attractor network. These results indicate that reward flavors alone may be used for spatial reference but may not cause sufficient input difference to create context-specific spatial maps in the CA1.

                Under physiological conditions in vivo astrocytes internalize and degrade neuronal mitochondria in a process called transmitophagy. Mitophagy is widely reported to be impaired in neurodegeneration but it is unknown whether and how transmitophagy is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that the internalization and degradation of neuronal mitochondria are significantly increased in astrocytes isolated from aged AD mouse brains. We also demonstrate for the first time a similar phenomenon between human neurons and AD astrocytes, and in murine hippocampi in vivo. The results suggest the involvement of S100a4 in impaired mitochondrial transfer between neurons and aged AD astrocytes. Significant increases in the mitophagy regulator Ambra1 were observed in the aged AD astrocytes. These findings demonstrate altered neuron-supporting functions of aged AD astrocytes and provide a starting point for studying the molecular mechanisms of transmitophagy in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ppGpp Is Present in, and Regulates Sleep of, Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Discovery of molecules in living systems and demonstration of their functional roles are pivotal in furthering our understanding of the molecular basis of biology. ppGpp (guanosine-5-diphosphate, 3-diphosphate) has been detected in prokaryotes for more than five decades. Here we report that a genetic screen followed by chemical analysis revealed the presence of ppGpp in Drosophila.It can be detected in germ-free Drosophila and its level is controlled by an enzyme encoded by the mesh1 gene in Drosophila. Loss of function mutations in mesh1, which encoded the ppGpp degrading enzyme led to longer sleep latency and less total sleep. These phenotypes could be rescued by wild type mesh1, but not by the enzymatically defective mutant Mesh1E66A, functionally implicating ppGpp. Ectopic expression of RelA, the E. colisynthetase for ppGpp, phenocopied mesh1 knockout mutants, whereas overexpression of mesh1 resulted in the opposite phenotypes, supporting that ppGpp is both necessary and sufficient in sleep regulation. mesh1 is expressed in a specific population of neurons, and a chemoconnectomic screen followed by genetic intersection experiments implicate the pars intercerebralis (PI) as the site of ppGpp function. Our results have thus revealed that ppGpp is present in animals after long lag since its discovery in bacteria. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ppGpp in a specific subset of neurons plays a physiological role in regulating sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correlated variability in primate superior colliculus depends on functional class</a></h4>

              
                Correlated variability (spike count correlations, rSC) in a population of neurons can constrain how information is read out, depending on behavioral task and neuronal tuning. Here we tested whether rSC also depends on neuronal functional class. We recorded from populations of neurons in macaque superior colliculus (SC), a structure that contains well-defined functional classes. We found that during a guided saccade task, different classes of neurons exhibited differing degrees of rSC. "Delay class" neurons displayed the highest rSC, especially during the delay epoch of saccade tasks that relied on working memory. This was only present among Delay class neurons within the same hemisphere. The dependence of rSC on functional class indicates that subpopulations of SC neurons occupy distinct circuit niches with distinct inputs. Such subpopulations should be accounted for differentially when attempting to model or infer population coding principles in the SC, or elsewhere in the primate brain.

                Despite disagreement about how anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) supports decision making, a recent hypothesis suggests that activity in this region is best understood in the context of a task or series of tasks. One important task-level variable is average reward because it is both a known driver of effortful behaviour and an important determiner of the tasks in which we choose to engage. Here we asked how average task value affects reward-related ACC activity. To answer this question, we measured a reward-related signal said to be generated in ACC called the reward positivity (RewP) while participants gambled in three tasks of differing average value. The RewP was reduced in the high-value task, an effect that was not explainable by either reward magnitude or outcome expectancy. Average task value also affected cue-locked frontal midline theta (FMT), an ACC signal linked to cognitive control: FMT was enhanced for low-value cues relative to high-value cues. This effect was related to behaviour, as the more FMT a participant exhibited, the better they performed. These results suggest that ACC does not evaluate outcomes and cues in isolation, but in the context of the value of the current task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deletion or inhibition of astrocytic transglutaminase 2 promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Following CNS injury astrocytes become reactive and exhibit pro-regenerative or harmful properties. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause astrocytes to adopt either phenotype are not well understood. Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a key role in regulating the response of astrocytes to insults. Here we used mice in which TG2 was specifically deleted in astrocytes (Gfap-Cre+/- TG2fl/fl, referred to here as TG2-A-cKO) in a spinal cord contusion injury (SCI) model. Deletion of TG2 from astrocytes resulted in a significant improvement in motor function following SCI. GFAP and NG2 immunoreactivity, as well as number of SOX9 positive cells, were significantly reduced in TG2-A-cKO mice. RNA-seq analysis of spinal cords from TG2-A-cKO and control mice 3 days postinjury identified thirty-seven differentially expressed genes, all of which were increased in TG2-A-cKO mice. Pathway analysis reveals a prevalence for fatty acid metabolism, lipid storage and energy pathways, which play essential roles in neuron-astrocyte metabolic coupling. Excitingly, treatment of wild type mice with the selective TG2 inhibitor VA4 significantly improved functional recovery after SCI, similar to what was observed using the genetic model. These findings indicate the use of TG2 inhibitors as a novel strategy for the treatment of SCI and other CNS injuries.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Episodic memory precision and reality monitoring following stimulation of angular gyrus</a></h4>

              
                The qualities of remembered experiences are often used to inform 'reality monitoring' judgments, our ability to distinguish real and imagined events (Johnson & Raye, 1981). Previous experiments have tended to investigate only whether reality monitoring decisions are accurate or not, providing little insight into the extent to which reality monitoring may be affected by qualities of the underlying mnemonic representations. We used a continuous-response memory precision task to measure the quality of remembered experiences that underlie two different types of reality monitoring decisions: agency decisions that distinguish actions performed by participants and the experimenter, and perceptual decisions that distinguish perceived and imagined experiences. The data revealed memory precision to be associated with higher accuracy in both agency and perceptual reality monitoring decisions, with reduced precision linked with a tendency to misattribute self-generated experiences to external sources. We then sought to investigate the possible neurocognitive basis of these observed associations by applying brain stimulation to a region that has been implicated in precise recollection of personal events, left angular gyrus. Stimulation of angular gyrus selectively reduced the association between memory precision and self-referential reality monitoring decisions, relative to control site stimulation. Angular gyrus may, therefore, be important for the ability to imbue remembered experiences with a sense of self-agency, a key component of 'autonoetic consciousness' that characterises episodic memory (Tulving, 1985).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating an internet-delivered fear conditioning and extinction protocol using response times and affective ratings.</a></h4>

              
                Pavlovian fear conditioning is widely used to study mechanisms of fear learning, but high-throughput studies are hampered by the labor-intensive nature of examining participants in the lab. To circumvent this bottle-neck, fear conditioning tasks have been developed for remote delivery. Previous studies have examined remotely delivered fear conditioning protocols using expectancy ratings and affective ratings. Here we replicate and extend these findings using an internet-delivered version of the Screaming Lady paradigm, evaluating the effects on negative affective ratings and response time to an auditory probe during stimulus presentations. In a sample of 80 adults, we observed clear evidence of both fear acquisition and extinction using affective ratings. Response times were faster when probed early, but not later, during presentation of stimuli paired with an aversive scream. The response time findings are at odds with previous lab-based studies showing slower responses to threat-predicting cues. The findings underscore the feasibility of employing remotely delivered fear conditioning paradigms with affective ratings as outcome, and highlights the need for further research examining optimal parameters for concurrent response time measures or alternate modes of non-verbal estimation of conditioned responses in Pavlovian conditioning protocols.

                Regular musical activity as a highly-stimulating lifestyle activity is proposed to be protective against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated associations between lifelong regular musical instrument playing, late-life cognitive abilities and brain morphology in older adults. We show that musical activity over the life course is associated with better global cognition, working memory, executive functions, language, and visuospatial abilities accounting for reserve proxies. Playing music is not significantly associated with gray matter volume in regions most affected by aging and AD. Selectively in the musically active participants, multi-domain cognitive abilities were enhanced with preserved gray matter volume in frontal and temporal regions. Our correlational findings suggest that playing a musical instrument may improve the recruitment of existing brain resources to facilitate late-life cognitive capacities. We propose that engaging in regular musical activity could serve as a low-threshold multimodal enrichment strategy that may promote cognitive resilience in advanced age.

                Background The impact of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on cortical neurons is currently hard to predict based on a priori biophysical and anatomical knowledge alone. This problem can hamper the reliability and reproducibility of protocols aimed at measuring electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to TMS. New Method We introduce and release a novel software tool to facilitate and standardize the acquisition of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). The tool, rt-TEP (real-time TEP), interfaces with different EEG amplifiers and offers a series of informative visualization modes to assess in real time the immediate impact of TMS on the underlying neuronal circuits. Results We show that rt-TEP can be used to abolish or minimize magnetic and muscle artifacts contaminating the post-stimulus period thus affording a clear visualization and quantification of the amplitude of the early (<50 ms) EEG response after averaging a limited number of trials. This real-time readout can then be used to adjust TMS parameters (e.g. site, orientation, intensity) and experimental settings (e.g. loudness and/or spectral features of the noise masking) to ultimately maximize direct cortical effects over the undesired sensory effects of the coil's discharge. Comparison with Existing Methods The ensemble of real-time visualization modes of rt-TEP are not implemented in any current commercial software and provide a key readout to titrate TMS parameters beyond the a priori information provided by anatomical models. Conclusions Real-time optimization of stimulation parameters with rt-TEP can facilitate the acquisition of reliable TEPs with a high signal-to-noise ratio and improve the standardization and reproducibility of data collection across laboratories.

                Our everyday memories can vary in terms of accuracy and phenomenology. One theoretical account that can help understand how to categorize these differences delineates between memories that are remembered versus familiar. This difference largely hinges on whether the memories contain information about both an item itself as well as associated details (Remember) versus those that are devoid of these associated contextual details (Familiar). This distinction has been supported by computational modeling of behavior, studies in patients, and neuroimaging work including differences both in electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Yet, compelling convergent evidence directly linking individual differences in estimates of Recollection and Familiarity, the mathematical estimates of differences in Remember versus Familiar judgments, with their concomitant electrophysiological signatures is lacking. The present study measured memory responses to a recognition memory task while participants underwent simultaneous electrophysiological recordings of brain activity. Non-parametric cluster-based permutation analyses revealed selective associations between electrophysiological signatures ofFamiliarity and Recollection with their respective behavioral estimates. These results support the idea that Recollection and Familiarity are distinct phenomena and is the first to relate individual differences in both Recollection and Familiarity to electrophysiological signatures.

                Substance use disorder is a difficult disease to treat due to its relapsing nature. In the last decade, opioid use disorder has been a threat to public health, being declared an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a tragic situation, considering there are currently effective, yet not ideal, treatments to prevent relapse. Recent research has shown that hormones that modulate hunger and satiety also can modulate motivated behavior for drugs of abuse. For example, the short-acting analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that regulates homeostatic feeding, has been shown to reduce responding for rewarding stimuli such as food, cocaine, heroin and nicotine. Here, we tested the acute effects of the long-acting GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, on heroin seeking. We found that, in rats with heroin self-administration experience, subcutaneous (sc) administration of an acute dose of 0.3 mg/kg liraglutide was effective in preventing relapse after exposure to three major precipitators: drug-associated cues, stress, and the drug itself. However, the effects of the drug were contingent upon the pretreatment time, with the drug being fully effective when administered using a 6 h, rather than a 4 h pretreatment time. Finally, we confirmed that the reduction in drug seeking is not due to a locomotor impairment, as liraglutide did not significantly alter performance in a rotarod test. As such, this acute non-opioid treatment may serve as a new and effective bridge to treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Principles governing the topological organization of object selectivities in ventral temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                To achieve the computational goal of rapidly recognizing miscellaneous objects in the environment despite large variations in their appearance, our mind represents objects in a high-dimensional object space to provide separable category information and enable the extraction of different kinds of information necessary for various levels of the visual processing. To implement this abstract and complex object space, the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) develops different object-selective regions with a certain topological organization as the physical substrate. However, the principle that governs the topological organization of object selectivities in the VTC remains unclear. Here, equipped with the wiring cost minimization principle constrained by the wiring length of neurons in the human temporal lobe, we constructed a hybrid self-organizing map (SOM) model as an artificial VTC (VTC-SOM) to explain how the abstract and complex object space is faithfully implemented in the brain. In two in silico experiments with the empirical brain imaging and single-unit data, our VTC-SOM predicted the topological structure of fine-scale functional regions (face-, object-, body-, and place-selective regions) and the boundary (i.e., middle Fusiform Sulcus) in large-scale abstract functional maps (animate vs. inanimate, real-word large-size vs. small-size, central vs. peripheral), with no significant loss in functionality (e.g., categorical selectivity, a hierarchy of view-invariant representations). These findings illustrated that the simple principle utilized in our model, rather than multiple hypotheses such as temporal associations, conceptual knowledge, and computational demands together, was apparently sufficient to determine the topological organization of object-selectivities in the VTC. In this way, the high-dimensional object space is implemented in a two-dimensional cortical surface of the brain faithfully.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Detection of Dopamine by Sniffer Cells Expressing Genetically Encoded Fluorescence Sensors</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine serves an important role in supporting both locomotor control and higher brain functions such as motivation and learning. Dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated in an equally multidimensional spectrum of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Extracellular dopamine levels are known to be tightly controlled by presynaptic dopamine transporters (DAT), which is also a main target of psychostimulants. Still, detailed data on dopamine dynamics in space and time is needed to fully understand how dopamine signals are encoded and translated into cellular and behavioral responses, and to uncover the pathological effects of dopamine-related diseases. The recently developed genetically encoded fluorescent dopamine sensors enable unprecedented monitoring of dopamine dynamics and have changed the field of in vivo dopamine recording. However, the potential of these sensors to be used for in vitro and ex vivo assays remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a generalizable blueprint for making dopamine 'sniffer' cells for multimodal detection of dopamine in vitro and ex vivo. We generated sniffer cell lines with inducible expression of six different dopamine sensors and performed a head-to-head comparison of sensor properties to guide users in sensor selection. In proof-of-principle experiments, we show how the sniffer cells can be applied to measure release of endogenous dopamine from cultured neurons and striatal slices, and for determining total dopamine content in striatal tissue. Furthermore, we use the sniffer cells to quantify DAT-mediated dopamine uptake, and AMPH-induced and constitutive dopamine efflux as a radiotracer free, high-throughput alternative to electrochemical- and radiotracer-based assays. Importantly, the sniffer cells framework can readily be applied to other transmitter systems for which the list of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors is rapidly growing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-order functional interactions in ageing explained via alterations in the connectome in a whole-brain model</a></h4>

              
                The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatio-temporal activity patterns, which support a wide variety of motor and cognitive functions. These patterns of activity change with age in a multi-factorial manner. One of these factors is the variations in the brain's connectomics that occurs along the lifespan. However, the precise relationship between high-order functional interactions and connnectomics, as well as their variations with age are largely unknown, in part due to the absence of mechanistic models that can efficiently map brain connnectomics to functional connectivity in aging. To investigate this issue, we have built a neurobiologically-realistic whole-brain computational model using both anatomical and functional MRI data from 161 participants ranging from 10 to 80 years old. We show that the age differences in high-order functional interactions can be largely explained by variations in the connectome. Based on this finding, we propose a simple neurodegeneration model that is representative of normal physiological aging. As such, when applied to connectomes of young participant it reproduces the age-variations that occur in the high-order structure of the functional data. Overall, these results begin to disentangle the mechanisms by which structural changes in the connectome lead to functional differences in the ageing brain. Our model can also serve as a starting point for modelling more complex forms of pathological ageing or cognitive deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term meditation training is associated with enhanced attention and stronger posterior cingulate - rostrolateral prefrontal cortex resting connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is thought to reflect improvements in attention to the present moment. However, prior research in long-term meditation practitioners lacked quantitative measures of attention that would provide a more direct behavioral correlate and interpretational anchor for PCC- DLPFC connectivity and was inherently limited by small sample sizes. Moreover, whether mindfulness meditation primarily impacts brain function locally, or impacts the dynamics of large-scale brain networks, remained unclear. Here, we sought to replicate and extend prior findings of increased PCC- DLPFC rsFC in a sample of 40 long-term meditators (average practice= 3759 hours) who also completed a behavioral assay of attention. In addition, we tested a network-based framework of changes in inter-regional connectivity by examining network-level connectivity. We found that meditators had stronger PCC-rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) rsFC, lower connector hub strength across the default mode network (DMN) relative to other functional networks, and better attention to task, compared to 124 meditation-naive controls. Orienting attention positively correlated with PCC- rostrolateral PFC connectivity, and negatively correlated with DMN connector hub strength. These findings provide novel evidence that posterior cingulate- rostrolateral PFC rsFC may support attention orienting, consistent with a role for rostrolateral PFC in meta-cognitive background awareness that is a core component of mindfulness meditation training. Our results further demonstrate that long-term mindfulness meditation may improve attention and strengthen the underlying brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of a new militarily-relevant whole-body low-intensity blast model for mild and subconcussive traumatic brain injury: Examination of acute neurological and multi-organ pathological outcomes</a></h4>

              
                This work describes a newly developed experimental mouse model reproducing features of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT), induced in operationally relevant manner using a compressed air-driven shock tube. Mild BINT (smBINT) was induced by one exposure to a low-intensity blast (LIB), whereas subconcussive BINT (rscBINT) was caused by repeated exposures to LIB. To mimic an operational scenario when a soldier is standing when exposed to blast using a quadruped experimental animal (mouse), a whole-body holder was developed to position mice in a bipedal stance, face-on toward the pressure wave generated in a shock tube. This restraint avoids bobble head movement, thus prevents tertiary blast effects, and allows administration of fast-acting inhaled anesthetics via nose cone. Using this model, we established and validated paradigms for primary blast-induced mild and repetitive traumatic brain injuries Our results showed that a single exposure to 69 kPa (10 psi) was capable of inducing smBINT, whereas three-rounds of exposure to 41 kPa (6 psi) caused rscBINT. Mice recovered rapidly from both types of BINT without prolonged neurological dysfunction. Mild superficial pathology was found predominantly in the lungs 24h after injury, with equivalent pathology after smBINT or repetitive rscBINT. The Purkinje layer of the cerebellum exhibited neuronal damage persisting up to 7d. Similar to some other models as well as clinical findings, this model reproduces blast-induced cerebellar pathology. In conclusion, this model positioning mice in a bipedal stance and facing front-on toward the shockwave provides realistic representation of operational scenarios and reproduces militarily-relevant smBINT and rscBINT in the laboratory.

                Dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions forming the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses, undergo activity-dependent molecular and structural remodeling. Activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors - mGluR1 and mGluR5 - by synaptic or pharmacological stimulation, induces LTD but whether this is accompanied with spine elimination remains unresolved. A subset of telencephalic mushroom spines contains the spine apparatus (SA), an enigmatic organelle composed of stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whose formation depends on the expression of the actin-bundling protein Synaptopodin. Allocation of Synaptopodin to spines appears governed by cell-intrinsic mechanisms as the relative frequency of spines harboring Synaptopodin is conserved in vivo and in vitro. Here we show that expression of Synaptopodin/SA in spines is required for induction of mGluR-LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Post-mGluR-LTD, mushroom spines lacking Synaptopodin/SA are selectively lost whereas spines harboring it are preserved, a process dependent on activation of mGluR1 but not mGluR5. Mechanistically, we find that mGluR1 supports physical retention of Synaptopodin within excitatory spine synapses during LTD while triggering lysosome-dependent degradation of the protein residing in dendritic shafts. Together, these results reveal a cellular mechanism, dependent on mGluR1, which enables selective preservation of stronger spines containing Synaptopodin/SA while eliminating weaker ones and potentially countering spurious strengthening by de novo recruitment of Synaptopodin. Overall our results identify spines with Synaptopodin/SA as the locus of mGluR-LTD and underscore the importance of the molecular microanatomy of spines in synaptic plasticity.

	<p>The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health are now well documented, however, few studies have been focused on the role of coping strategies and resilience in counterbalancing these detrimental effects. Data are derived from the COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET), a national multicentric trial carried out in the Italian general population. The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants, 53.1% (n = 11,000) of the sample reported low levels of resilience. Adaptive coping strategies and resilience levels did not have any significant protective impact on the levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Only self-distraction was a risk factor for poor mental health (Beta Coefficient, B = 0.1, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.003 to 0.267 for stress symptoms; B = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.077 to 0.324 for anxiety symptoms and B = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.105 to 0.382 for depressive symptoms). High levels of resilience were predicted by adaptive coping strategies, such as acceptance (B = 1.8, CI 95% = 1.4–2.7). Exposure to the different weeks of lockdown, being infected by COVID-19, and being a healthcare professional did not influence the levels of resilience. Our findings should be carefully considered, since the low levels of resilience may represent the missing link between the pandemic and the current increase in mental health problems.</p>

	<p>Media news during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic often entail complex numerical concepts such as exponential increase or reproduction number. This study investigated whether people have difficulties in understanding such information and whether these difficulties are related to numerical competence, reflective thinking, and risk proneness. One hundred sixty-three participants provided answers to a numeracy scale focusing on complex numerical concepts relevant to COVID-19 (COV Numeracy Scale). They also provided responses to well-established objective and subjective scales, questions about affective states, and questions about the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher scores on the COV Numeracy Scale correlated with higher scores on the Health Numeracy Scale, in the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and in self-assessments of verbal comprehension, mathematical intelligence, and subjective numeracy. Interestingly, scores on the COV Numeracy Scale also positively correlated with the number of consulted information sources about COVID-19. Accuracy in the CRT emerged as a significant predictor, explaining ca. 14% of variance on the COV Numeracy Scale. The results suggest that people with lower reflective thinking skills and lower subjective and objective numerical competence can be more at disadvantage when confronted with COVID-related numerical information in everyday life. These findings advise caution in the communication of relevant public health information that entails complex numerical concepts.</p>

	<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders are frequently associated with sleep disturbances. One class of neurodevelopmental disorders, the genetic synaptopathies, is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins found at the synapse. Mutations in these genes cause derangement of synapse development and function. We utilized a validated sleep instrument, Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) to examine the nature of sleep abnormalities occurring in individuals with two synaptopathies—Phelan–McDermid syndrome (PMD) (N = 47, male = 23, female = 24, age 1–46 years) and SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) (N = 64, male = 31, female = 33, age 1–64 years), when compared with unaffected siblings (N = 61, male = 25, female = 36, age 1–17 years). We found that both PMD and SYNGAP1-ID have significant sleep abnormalities with SYNGAP1-ID having greater severity of sleep disturbance than PMD. In addition, sleep disturbances were more severe for PMD in individuals 11 years and older compared with those less than 11 years old. Individuals with either disorder were more likely to use sleep aids than unaffected siblings. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are a significant phenotype in the synaptopathies PMD and SYNGAP1-ID. Improved sleep is a viable endpoint for future clinical trials for these neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

	<p>The ability to rapidly stop or change a planned action is a critical cognitive process that is impaired in schizophrenia. The current study aimed to examine whether this impairment reflects familial vulnerability to schizophrenia across two experiments comparing unaffected first-degree relatives to healthy controls. First, we examined performance on a saccadic stop-signal task that required rapid inhibition of an eye movement. Then, in a different sample, we investigated behavioral and neural responses (using fMRI) during a stop-signal task variant that required rapid modification of a prepared eye movement. Here, we examined differences between relatives and healthy controls in terms of activation and effective connectivity within an oculomotor control network during task performance. Like individuals with schizophrenia, the unaffected relatives showed behavioral evidence for more inefficient inhibitory processes. Unlike previous findings in individuals with schizophrenia, however, the relatives showed evidence for a compensatory waiting strategy. Behavioral differences were accompanied by more activation among the relatives in task-relevant regions across conditions and group differences in effective connectivity across the task that were modulated differently by the instruction to exert control over a planned saccade. Effective connectivity parameters were related to behavioral measures of inhibition efficiency. The results suggest that individuals at familial risk for schizophrenia were engaging an oculomotor control network differently than controls and in a way that compromises inhibition efficiency.</p>

	<p>Oxytocin (OXT) is known to affect various social processes, including social comparisons and intergroup competition. In this study, we examined whether social comparisons in intergroup situations can be modulated by OXT and, if so, how this modulation manifests. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, we randomly assigned male participants to either OXT or placebo treatment and then asked them to play a card game with either an in-group or an out-group member. The OXT-treated participants showed a greater social comparison effect in the games with an out-group member than in games with an in-group member. Specifically, the participants in the OXT treatment condition showed a greater acceptance rate for relative gain (downward comparison) and a lower acceptance rate for relative loss (upward comparison) while playing with an out-group member rather than an in-group member. In contrast, no such effect was observed among placebo-treated participants. These findings demonstrate that OXT facilitates intergroup social comparisons with out-group versus in-group members.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Convincing evidence of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) alterations has been demonstrated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and barrier repair is imperative to prevent motor neuron dysfunction. We showed benefits of human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells (hBM34+) and endothelial progenitor cells (hBM-EPCs) intravenous transplantation into symptomatic G93A SOD1 mutant mice on barrier reparative processes. These gains likely occurred by replacement of damaged endothelial cells, prolonging motor neuron survival. However, additional investigations are needed to confirm the effects of administered cells on integrity of the microvascular endothelium. The aim of this study was to determine tight junction protein levels, capillary pericyte coverage, microvascular basement membrane, and endothelial filamentous actin (F-actin) status in spinal cord capillaries of G93A SOD1 mutant mice treated with human bone marrow-derived stem cells. Tight junction proteins were detected in the spinal cords of cell-treated versus non-treated mice via Western blotting at four weeks after transplant. Capillary pericyte, basement membrane laminin, and endothelial F-actin magnitudes were determined in cervical/lumbar spinal cord tissues in ALS mice, including controls, by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent staining. Results showed that cell-treated versus media-treated ALS mice substantially increased tight junction protein levels, capillary pericyte coverage, basement membrane laminin immunoexpressions, and endothelial cytoskeletal F-actin fluorescent expressions. The greatest benefits were detected in mice receiving hBM-EPCs versus hBM34+ cells. These study results support treatment with a specific cell type derived from human bone marrow toward BSCB repair in ALS. Thus, hBM-EPCs may be advanced for clinical applications as a cell-specific approach for ALS therapy through restored barrier integrity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Machine learning approach for automatic recognition of tomato-pollinating bees based on their buzzing-sounds</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alison Pereira Ribeiro, Nádia Felix Felipe da Silva, Fernanda Neiva Mesquita, Priscila de Cássia Souza Araújo, Thierson Couto Rosa, José Neiva Mesquita-Neto</p>

Bee-mediated pollination greatly increases the size and weight of tomato fruits. Therefore, distinguishing between the local set of bees–those that are efficient pollinators–is essential to improve the economic returns for farmers. To achieve this, it is important to know the identity of the visiting bees. Nevertheless, the traditional taxonomic identification of bees is not an easy task, requiring the participation of experts and the use of specialized equipment. Due to these limitations, the development and implementation of new technologies for the automatic recognition of bees become relevant. Hence, we aim to verify the capacity of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in recognizing the taxonomic identity of visiting bees to tomato flowers based on the characteristics of their buzzing sounds. We compared the performance of the ML algorithms combined with the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and with classifications based solely on the from fundamental frequency, leading to a direct comparison between the two approaches. In fact, some classifiers powered by the MFCC–especially the SVM–achieved better performance compared to the randomized and sound frequency-based trials. Moreover, the buzzing sounds produced during sonication were more relevant for the taxonomic recognition of bee species than analysis based on flight sounds alone. On the other hand, the ML classifiers performed better in recognizing bees genera based on flight sounds. Despite that, the maximum accuracy obtained here (73.39% by SVM) is still low compared to ML standards. Further studies analyzing larger recording samples, and applying unsupervised learning systems may yield better classification performance. Therefore, ML techniques could be used to automate the taxonomic recognition of flower-visiting bees of the cultivated tomato and other buzz-pollinated crops. This would be an interesting option for farmers and other professionals who have no experience in bee taxonomy but are interested in improving crop yields by increasing pollination.

Here, we used biophysical models to examine how Gamma oscillations may participate to the processing of afferent stimuli. We constructed conductance-based network models of Gamma oscillations, based on different cell types found in cerebral cortex. The models were adjusted to extracellular unit recordings in humans, where Gamma oscillations always coexist with the asynchronous firing mode. We considered three different mechanisms to generate Gamma, first a mechanism based on the interaction between pyramidal neurons and interneurons (PING), second a mechanism in which Gamma is generated by interneuron networks (ING) and third, a mechanism which relies on Gamma oscillations generated by pacemaker <i>chattering</i> neurons (CHING). We find that all three mechanisms generate features consistent with human recordings, but that the ING mechanism is most consistent with the firing rate change inside Gamma bursts seen in the human data. We next evaluated the responsiveness and resonant properties of these networks, contrasting Gamma oscillations with the asynchronous mode. We find that for both slowly-varying stimuli and precisely-timed stimuli, the responsiveness is generally lower during Gamma compared to asynchronous states, while resonant properties are similar around the Gamma band. We could not find conditions where Gamma oscillations were more responsive. We therefore predict that asynchronous states provide the highest responsiveness to external stimuli, while Gamma oscillations tend to overall diminish responsiveness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ISOTOPE: ISOform-guided prediction of epiTOPEs in cancer</a></h4>

Immunotherapies provide effective treatments for previously untreatable tumors and identifying tumor-specific epitopes can help elucidate the molecular determinants of therapy response. Here, we describe a pipeline, ISOTOPE (ISOform-guided prediction of epiTOPEs In Cancer), for the comprehensive identification of tumor-specific splicing-derived epitopes. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry for MHC-I associated proteins, ISOTOPE identified neoepitopes from tumor-specific splicing events that are potentially presented by MHC-I complexes. Analysis of multiple samples indicates that splicing alterations may affect the production of self-epitopes and generate more candidate neoepitopes than somatic mutations. Although there was no difference in the number of splicing-derived neoepitopes between responders and non-responders to immune therapy, higher MHC-I binding affinity was associated with a positive response. Our analyses highlight the diversity of the immunogenic impacts of tumor-specific splicing alterations and the importance of studying splicing alterations to fully characterize tumors in the context of immunotherapies. ISOTOPE is available at https://github.com/comprna/ISOTOPE.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Conventional measures of intrinsic excitability are poor estimators of neuronal activity under realistic synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrienn Szabó, Katalin Schlett, Attila Szücs</p>

Activity-dependent regulation of intrinsic excitability has been shown to greatly contribute to the overall plasticity of neuronal circuits. Such neuroadaptations are commonly investigated in patch clamp experiments using current step stimulation and the resulting input-output functions are analyzed to quantify alterations in intrinsic excitability. However, it is rarely addressed, how such changes translate to the function of neurons when they operate under natural synaptic inputs. Still, it is reasonable to expect that a strong correlation and near proportional relationship exist between static firing responses and those evoked by synaptic drive. We challenge this view by performing a high-yield electrophysiological analysis of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons using both standard protocols and simulated synaptic inputs via dynamic clamp. We find that under these conditions the neurons exhibit vastly different firing responses with surprisingly weak correlation between static and dynamic firing intensities. These contrasting responses are regulated by two intrinsic K-currents mediated by Kv1 and K<sub>ir</sub> channels, respectively. Pharmacological manipulation of the K-currents produces differential regulation of the firing output of neurons. Static firing responses are greatly increased in stuttering type neurons under blocking their Kv1 channels, while the synaptic responses of the same neurons are less affected. Pharmacological blocking of K<sub>ir</sub>-channels in delayed firing type neurons, on the other hand, exhibit the opposite effects. Our subsequent computational model simulations confirm the findings in the electrophysiological experiments and also show that adaptive changes in the kinetic properties of such currents can even produce paradoxical regulation of the firing output.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein structural features predict responsiveness to pharmacological chaperone treatment for three lysosomal storage disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jaie Woodard, Wei Zheng, Yang Zhang</p>

Three-dimensional structures of proteins can provide important clues into the efficacy of personalized treatment. We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted ΔΔG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Eliminating accidental deviations to minimize generalization error and maximize replicability: Applications in connectomics and genomics</a></h4>

Bridgeford, Shangsi Wang, Zeyi Wang, Ting Xu, Cameron Craddock, Jayanta Dey, Gregory Kiar, William Gray-Roncal, Carlo Colantuoni, Christopher Douville, Stephanie Noble, Carey E. Priebe, Brian Caffo, Michael Milham, Xi-Nian Zuo, Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility , Joshua T. Vogelstein</p>

Replicability, the ability to replicate scientific findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis. A key to replicability is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) under fixed experimental constraints are relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics that quantify the relative contributions of accidental deviations—such as measurement error—as compared to systematic deviations—such as individual differences—are critical. We demonstrate that existing replicability statistics, such as intra-class correlation coefficient and fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate between accidental and systematic deviations in very simple settings. We therefore propose a novel statistic, <i>discriminability</i>, which quantifies the degree to which an individual’s samples are relatively similar to one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing discriminability improves performance bounds in subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data <i>discriminability</i> improves performance on all subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and more generally, mitigating accidental measurement error.

                <p>by Milad Ghomlaghi, Guang Yang, Sungyoung Shin, David E. James, Lan K. Nguyen</p>

The PI3K/MTOR signalling network regulates a broad array of critical cellular processes, including cell growth, metabolism and autophagy. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) kinase functions as a core catalytic subunit in two physically and functionally distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, which also share other common components including MLST8 (also known as GβL) and DEPTOR. Despite intensive research, how mTORC1 and 2 assembly and activity are coordinated, and how they are functionally linked remain to be fully characterized. This is due in part to the complex network wiring, featuring multiple feedback loops and intricate post-translational modifications. Here, we integrate predictive network modelling, <i>in vitro</i> experiments and -omics data analysis to elucidate the emergent dynamic behaviour of the PI3K/MTOR network. We construct new mechanistic models that encapsulate critical mechanistic details, including mTORC1/2 coordination by MLST8 (de)ubiquitination and the Akt-to-mTORC2 positive feedback loop. Model simulations validated by experimental studies revealed a previously unknown biphasic, threshold-gated dependence of mTORC1 activity on the key mTORC2 subunit SIN1, which is robust against cell-to-cell variation in protein expression. In addition, our integrative analysis demonstrates that ubiquitination of MLST8, which is reversed by OTUD7B, is regulated by IRS1/2. Our results further support the essential role of MLST8 in enabling both mTORC1 and 2’s activity and suggest MLST8 as a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer. Overall, our study reports a new mechanistic model of PI3K/MTOR signalling incorporating MLST8-mediated mTORC1/2 formation and unveils a novel regulatory linkage between mTORC1 and mTORC2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cerebellar complex spikes multiplex complementary behavioral information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Akshay Markanday, Junya Inoue, Peter W. Dicke, Peter Thier</p>

Purkinje cell (PC) discharge, the only output of cerebellar cortex, involves 2 types of action potentials, high-frequency simple spikes (SSs) and low-frequency complex spikes (CSs). While there is consensus that SSs convey information needed to optimize movement kinematics, the function of CSs, determined by the PC’s climbing fiber input, remains controversial. While initially thought to be specialized in reporting information on motor error for the subsequent amendment of behavior, CSs seem to contribute to other aspects of motor behavior as well. When faced with the bewildering diversity of findings and views unraveled by highly specific tasks, one may wonder if there is just one true function with all the other attributions wrong? Or is the diversity of findings a reflection of distinct pools of PCs, each processing specific streams of information conveyed by climbing fibers? With these questions in mind, we recorded CSs from the monkey oculomotor vermis deploying a repetitive saccade task that entailed sizable motor errors as well as small amplitude saccades, correcting them. We demonstrate that, in addition to carrying error-related information, CSs carry information on the metrics of both primary and small corrective saccades in a time-specific manner, with changes in CS firing probability coupled with changes in CS duration. Furthermore, we also found CS activity that seemed to predict the upcoming events. Hence PCs receive a multiplexed climbing fiber input that merges complementary streams of information on the behavior, separable by the recipient PC because they are staggered in time.

                <p>by Jai Y. Yu, Loren M. Frank</p>

The receptive field of a neuron describes the regions of a stimulus space where the neuron is consistently active. Sparse spiking outside of the receptive field is often considered to be noise, rather than a reflection of information processing. Whether this characterization is accurate remains unclear. We therefore contrasted the sparse, temporally isolated spiking of hippocampal CA1 place cells to the consistent, temporally adjacent spiking seen within their spatial receptive fields (“place fields”). We found that isolated spikes, which occur during locomotion, are strongly phase coupled to hippocampal theta oscillations and transiently express coherent nonlocal spatial representations. Further, prefrontal cortical activity is coordinated with and can predict the occurrence of future isolated spiking events. Rather than local noise within the hippocampus, sparse, isolated place cell spiking reflects a coordinated cortical–hippocampal process consistent with the generation of nonlocal scenario representations during active navigation.

                Background: Evidence-based nursing practice (EBNP) is considered a major and very important global paradigm shift. Unfortunately, most healthcare providers and researchers embrace the concept of evidence-based practice (EBP) without integrating this concept in clinical settings. The current situation of EBP and new practice guidelines utilization in Jordan are scarce. This policy brief aimed to discusses the process of utilizing nursing EBP in clinical settings in Jordan. Methods: The authors adopted an action plan utilizing a systematic approach to develop and implement specific strategies and policies to integrate EBP in clinical settings in Jordanian hospitals. We present an experience of one country in terms of introducing a policy brief to establish an EBP policy accompanied by developing an EBP unit in the hospital's country. Results: A comprehensive description of this policy is provided with reference to the eminent steps of policy analysis and evaluation. In fact, EBP policies and clinical practice guidelines should keep a live document and revise regularly or as needed. Overall, the authors suggest the development of a unit for EBP to deal with issues related to clinical practice guidelines. Conclusions: Expected outcomes for the introduction of the EBP unit and its policy include increase research utilization and accelerated adoption of new evidence, increase the quality of care provided, increase patient, staff, and managers satisfaction, and decrease staff workload by reducing complications associated with medical errors and outdated interventions.

                Background: The Malaysian government reacted to the pandemic’s economic effect with the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to cushion the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) impact on households. The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled “Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,” collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques—Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes—were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance.  Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP. These models can be used to design customised ESPs that can effectively manage the financial burden of low-income households.

                Digital signature schemes (DSS) are ubiquitously used for public authentication in the infrastructure of the internet, in addition to their use as a cryptographic tool to construct even more sophisticated schemes such as those that are identity-based. The security of DSS is analyzed through the existential unforgeability under chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) experiment which promises unforgeability of signatures on new messages even when the attacker has access to an arbitrary set of messages and their corresponding signatures. However, the EUF-CMA model does not account for attacks such as an attacker forging a different signature on an existing message, even though the attack could be devastating in the real world and constitutes a severe breach of the security system. Nonetheless, most of the DSS are not analyzed in this security model, which possibly makes them vulnerable to such an attack. In contrast, a better security notion known as strong EUF-CMA (sEUF-CMA) is designed to be resistant to such attacks. This review aims to identify DSS in the literature that are secure in the sEUF-CMA model. In addition, the article discusses the challenges and future directions of DSS. In our review, we consider the security of existing DSS that fit our criterion in the sEUF-CMA model; our criterion is simple as we only require the DSS to be at least secure against the minimum of existential forgery. Our findings are categorized into two classes: the direct and indirect classes of sEUF-CMA. The former is inherently sEUF-CMA without any modification while the latter requires some transformation. Our comprehensive  review contributes to the security and cryptographic research community by discussing the efficiency and security of DSS that are sEUF-CMA, which aids in selecting robust DSS in future design considerations.

                The Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program integrates biological and neural information to create anatomical and functional maps of the peripheral nervous system. The SPARC Portal hosts a dynamic storage for the datasets, models, and resources to help the researchers find and produce data. Currently, the SPARC Portal provides a primary search tool, which lacks some features to improve the search experience. To purposefully retrieve the required information from the stored datasets and resources, we have developed an Advanced QUery Architecture (AQUA) for the SPARC Portal. Near-real-time auto-completion of the queries, close-matches suggestions, and multiple filters to narrow or sort the results are the major features of AQUA with the goal to enhance the usability of the SPARC search engine. AQUA is available from: https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua

                Background Antioxidants show nephroprotective effect against vancomycin associated nephrotoxicity (VAN) in animals. This study aimed to assess the ascorbic acid nephro-protective role against VAN clinically. Methods Forty-one critically ill patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: intervention group (vancomycin IV plus ascorbic acid, n=21) or control group (vancomycin IV only, n=20). Primary outcomes were the incidence of VAN and the absolute change in creatinine parameters, while mortality rate was the secondary outcome. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (S.cr) by at least 0.5 mg/dL or 50% of baseline for at least two successive measurements. This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03921099), April 2019. Results Mean absolute S.cr increase was significant when compared between both groups, P-value = 0.036, where S.cr increased by 0.05(0.12) and 0.34(0.55) mg/dL in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Mean absolute Cr.cl decline was significant when compared between both groups, P-value = 0.04, where Cr.cl was decreased by 5.9(17.8) and 22.3(30.4) ml/min in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Incidence of VAN was 1/21(4.7%) versus 5/20(25%) in the intervention and control groups, respectively (RR: 0.19; CI: 0.024–1.49; P-value = 0.093). Mortality was higher in the control group; however, it was not statistically significant, P-value = 0.141. Conclusion Co-administration of ascorbic acid with vancomycin preserved renal function and reduced the absolute risk of VAN by 20.3%, however, the reduction in VAN incidence didn’t reach statistical significance level. Further large multicenter prospective trials are recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Any neuron can perform linearly non-separable computations [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Multiple studies have shown how dendrites enable some neurons to perform linearly non-separable computations. These works focus on cells with an extended dendritic arbor where voltage can vary independently, turning dendritic branches into local non-linear subunits. However, these studies leave a large fraction of the nervous system unexplored. Many neurons, e.g. granule cells, have modest dendritic trees and are electrically compact. It is impossible to decompose them into multiple independent subunits. Here, we upgraded the integrate and fire neuron to account for saturating dendrites. This artificial neuron has a unique membrane voltage and can be seen as a single layer. We present a class of linearly non-separable computations and how our neuron can perform them. We thus demonstrate that even a single layer neuron with dendrites has more computational capacity than without. Because any neuron has one or more layer, and all dendrites do saturate, we show that any dendrited neuron can implement linearly non-separable computations.

                Background: Autonomous vehicles are important in smart transportation. Although exciting progress has been made, it remains challenging to design a safety mechanism for autonomous vehicles despite uncertainties and obstacles that occur dynamically on the road. Collision detection and avoidance are indispensable for a reliable decision-making module in autonomous driving. Methods: This study presents a robust approach for forward collision warning using vision data for autonomous vehicles on Malaysian public roads. The proposed architecture combines environment perception and lane localization to define a safe driving region for the ego vehicle. If potential risks are detected in the safe driving region, a warning will be triggered. The early warning is important to help avoid rear-end collision. Besides, an adaptive lane localization method that considers geometrical structure of the road is presented to deal with different road types. Results: Precision scores of mean average precision (mAP) 0.5, mAP 0.95 and recall of 0.14, 0.06979 and 0.6356 were found in this study. Conclusions: Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach under different lighting and environmental conditions.

                Background: Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been identified by the World Health Organization as one among the top ten threats to global public health. There is limited literature regarding VH from developing countries like India. Methods: In this facility based cross-sectional study, 172 mothers of under-five children were assessed regarding VH using the parental attitude towards childhood vaccination questionnaire (PACV). Results: The prevalence of VH was 3.4% (n=6). Only 7.6% (n=13) of the study participants had ever refused vaccination for their child and the most common reason cited for their refusal was that they thought it was not safe (n=6). Government health facilities was the place of routine immunization for 60.5% (n=104) participants. Health care providers (n =79, 46%) were the major source of information regarding vaccines. Conclusions: Our study highlights the presence of very low prevalence of VH in Mangalore compared to similar studies from India and other parts of the world. The limited number of participants had refused vaccination due to concerns related to vaccine safety.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single-cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top 10 genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm</i>, <i>Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk</i>, <i>Snap25</i>, <i>Ckb</i> and <i>Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4</i>, <i>Ptprz1</i>, <i>Pvrl1</i>, <i>Kirrel3</i>, <i>Pvalb</i>, and <i>Asic2</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Single-cell analysis of COVID-19, sepsis, and HIV infection reveals hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive signatures in monocytes</a></h4>

              
                Liu et al. perform integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomes to characterize the inflammatory signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID-19, sepsis, and HIV infection. Analysis of heterogeneity among COVID-19 patients reveals a “three-stage” model, which is related to the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive signatures in monocytes.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Broad cross-reactivity across sarbecoviruses exhibited by a subset of COVID-19 donor-derived neutralizing antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Jette et al. characterize antibodies derived from convalescent COVID-19 donors that broadly recognize sarbecoviruses and neutralize ACE2-tropic strains, including all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Structures reveal binding to a highly conserved RBD epitope using long CDRH3 loops, with an orientation that inhibits ACE2 binding to the RBD and allows IgG avidity.

We report an exact expression for these marginals in the form of a model of interacting binary variables with the explicit form of the interactions depending on the hidden node activation function. We study the properties of these interactions in detail and evaluate how the accuracy with which the RBM approximates distributions over binary variables depends on the hidden node activation function and the number of hidden nodes. When the inferred RBM parameters are weak, an intuitive pattern is found for the expression of the interaction terms, which reduces substantially the differences across activation functions. We show that the weak parameter approximation is a good approximation for different RBMs trained on the MNIST data set. Interestingly, in these cases, the mapping reveals that the inferred models are essentially low order interaction models.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Active inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and action in biological agents in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior) constraints on the generative model, allowing, for example, for a trade-off between robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Second, we interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework. Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the context of ActInf, but also provides a general-purpose approach that can account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint message updates can then be readily combined with other prederived message update rules without the need for custom derivations. The proposed chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for workable models in general and can be used to complement message-passing formulations on generative neural models.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The transformation of synaptic input into action potential in nerve cells is strongly influenced by the morphology of the dendritic arbor as well as the synaptic efficacy map. The multiplicity of dendritic branches strikingly enables a single cell to act as a highly nonlinear processing element. Studies have also found functional synaptic clustering whereby synapses that encode a common sensory feature are spatially clustered together on the branches. Motivated by these findings, here we introduce a multibranch formal model of the neuron that can integrate synaptic inputs nonlinearly through collective action of its dendritic branches and yields synaptic clustering. An analysis in support of its use as a computational building block is offered. Also offered is an accompanying gradient descent–based learning algorithm. The model unit spans a wide spectrum of nonlinearities, including the parity problem, and can outperform the multilayer perceptron in generalizing to unseen data. The occurrence of synaptic clustering boosts the generalization efficiency of the unit, which may also be the answer for the puzzling ubiquity of synaptic clustering in the real neurons. Our theoretical analysis is backed up by simulations. The study could pave the way to new artificial neural networks.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework in neuroscience that offers a unified theory of brain function. It is also proposed as a framework for planning in AI. Unfortunately, the complex mathematics required to create new models can impede application of active inference in neuroscience and AI research. This letter addresses this problem by providing a complete mathematical treatment of the active inference framework in discrete time and state spaces and the derivation of the update equations for any new model. We leverage the theoretical connection between active inference and variational message passing as described by John Winn and Christopher M. Bishop in 2005. Since variational message passing is a well-defined methodology for deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this letter opens the door to advanced generative models for active inference. We show that using a fully factorized variational distribution simplifies the expected free energy, which furnishes priors over policies so that agents seek unambiguous states. Finally, we consider future extensions that support deep tree searches for sequential policy optimization based on structure learning and belief propagation.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Up to now, modern machine learning (ML) has been based on approximating big data sets with high-dimensional functions, taking advantage of huge computational resources. We show that biologically inspired neuron models such as the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron provide novel and efficient ways of information processing. They can be integrated in machine learning models and are a potential target to improve ML performance. Thus, we have derived simple update rules for LIF units to numerically integrate the differential equations. We apply a surrogate gradient approach to train the LIF units via backpropagation. We demonstrate that tuning the leak term of the LIF neurons can be used to run the neurons in different operating modes, such as simple signal integrators or coincidence detectors. Furthermore, we show that the constant surrogate gradient, in combination with tuning the leak term of the LIF units, can be used to achieve the learning dynamics of more complex surrogate gradients.To prove the validity of our method, we applied it to established image data sets (the Oxford 102 flower data set, MNIST), implemented various network architectures, used several input data encodings and demonstrated that the method is suitable to achieve state-of-the-art classification performance.We provide our method as well as further surrogate gradient methods to train spiking neural networks via backpropagation as an open-source KERAS package to make it available to the neuroscience and machine learning community. To increase the interpretability of the underlying effects and thus make a small step toward opening the black box of machine learning, we provide interactive illustrations, with the possibility of systematically monitoring the effects of parameter changes on the learning characteristics.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synapses change on multiple timescales, ranging from milliseconds to minutes, due to a combination of both short- and long-term plasticity. Here we develop an extension of the common generalized linear model to infer both short- and long-term changes in the coupling between a pre- and postsynaptic neuron based on observed spiking activity. We model short-term synaptic plasticity using additive effects that depend on the presynaptic spike timing, and we model long-term changes in both synaptic weight and baseline firing rate using point process adaptive smoothing. Using simulations, we first show that this model can accurately recover time-varying synaptic weights (1) for both depressing and facilitating synapses, (2) with a variety of long-term changes (including realistic changes, such as due to STDP), (3) with a range of pre and postsynaptic firing rates, and (4) for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We then apply our model to two experimentally recorded putative synaptic connections. We find that simultaneously tracking fast changes in synaptic weights, slow changes in synaptic weights, and unexplained variations in baseline firing is essential. Omitting any one of these factors can lead to spurious inferences for the others. Altogether, this model provides a flexible framework for tracking short- and long-term variation in spike transmission.</span>

Efforts to incorporate biological constraints and Dale's principle will help elucidate the neural representations and mechanisms of underlying circuits. We trained an excitatory-inhibitory RNN to learn neural sequences in a supervised manner and studied the representations and dynamic attractors of the trained network. The trained RNN was robust to trigger the sequence in response to various input signals and interpolated a time-warped input for sequence representation. Interestingly, a learned sequence can repeat periodically when the RNN evolved beyond the duration of a single sequence. The eigenspectrum of the learned recurrent connectivity matrix with growing or damping modes, together with the RNN's nonlinearity, were adequate to generate a limit cycle attractor. We further examined the stability of dynamic attractors while training the RNN to learn two sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic and stable brain connectivity during movie watching as revealed by functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Spatially remote brain regions show synchronized activity as typically revealed by correlated functional MRI (fMRI) signals. An emerging line of research has focused on the temporal fluctuations of connectivity, however, its relationships with stable connectivity have not been clearly illustrated. We examined the stable and dynamic connectivity from fMRI data when the participants watched four different movie clips. Using inter-individual correlation, we were able to estimate functionally meaningful dynamic connectivity associated with different movies. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip as well as their differences between clips. A cartoon movie clip showed higher consistent dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip showed higher dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents. In contrast, stable connectivity was highly similar among the movie clips, and showed fewer statistical significant differences. The patterns of dynamic connectivity had higher accuracy for classifications of different movie clips than the stable connectivity and regional activity. These results support the functional significance of dynamic connectivity in reflecting functional brain changes, which could provide more functionally related information than stable connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gli1 regulates the postnatal acquisition of peripheral nerve architecture</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nerves are organized into discrete cellular compartments. Axons, Schwann cells (SCs), and endoneurial fibroblasts (EFs) reside within the endoneurium and are surrounded by the perineurium - a cellular sheath comprised of layers of perineurial glia (PNG). SC secretion of Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) regulates this organization. In Dhh nulls, the perineurium is deficient and the endoneurium is subdivided into small compartments termed minifascicles. Human Dhh mutations cause a peripheral neuropathy with similar defects. Here we examine the role of Gli1, a canonical transcriptional effector of hedgehog signaling, in regulating peripheral nerve organization. We identify PNG, EFs, and pericytes as Gli1-expressing cells by genetic fate mapping. Although expression of Dhh by SCs and Gli1 in target cells is coordinately regulated with myelination, Gli1 expression unexpectedly persists in Dhh null EFs. Thus, Gli1 is expressed in EFs non-canonically i.e., independent of hedgehog signaling. Gli1 and Dhh also have non-redundant activities. In contrast to Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls have a normal perineurium. Like Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls form minifascicles, which we show likely arise from EFs. Thus, Dhh and Gli1 are independent signals: Gli1 is dispensable for perineurial development but functions cooperatively with Dhh to drive normal endoneurial development. During development, Gli1 also regulates endoneurial extracellular matrix production, nerve vascular organization, and has modest, non-autonomous effects on SC sorting and myelination of axons. Finally, in adult nerves, induced deletion of Gli1 is sufficient to drive minifascicle formation. Thus, Gli1 regulates the development and is required to maintain the endoneurial architecture of peripheral nerves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic sodium bromide treatment relieves autistic-like behavioral deficits in three mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose diagnosis relies on deficient social interaction and communication together with repetitive behavior. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved that ameliorates social behavior in patients with ASD. Based on the excitation/inhibition imbalance theory of autism, we hypothesized that bromide ions, long used as an antiepileptic medication, could relieve core symptoms of ASD. We evaluated the effects of chronic sodium bromide (NaBr) administration on autistic-like symptoms in three genetic mouse models of autism: Oprm1-/- , Fmr1-/- and Shank3{Delta}ex13-16-/- mice. We showed that chronic NaBr treatment relieved autistic-like behaviors in these three models. In Oprm1-/- mice, these beneficial effects were superior to those of chronic bumetanide administration. At transcriptional level, chronic NaBr in Oprm1 null mice was associated with increased expression of genes coding for chloride ions transporters, GABAA receptor subunits, oxytocin and mGlu4 receptor. Lastly, we uncovered synergistic alleviating effects of chronic NaBr and a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGlu4 receptor on autistic-like behavior in Oprm1-/- mice. We evidenced in heterologous cells that bromide ions behave as PAMs of mGlu4, providing a molecular mechanism for such synergy. Our data reveal the therapeutic potential of bromide ions, alone or in combination with a PAM of mGlu4 receptor, for the treatment of ASDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 is critical for phasic axonal dopamine release in the striatum and mesencephalon, but is dispensable for basic motor behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, a population of cells that are critical for motor control, motivated behaviors and cognition, release DA via an exocytotic mechanism from both their axonal terminals and their somatodendritic (STD) compartment. In Parkinson's disease (PD), it is striking that motor dysfunctions only become apparent after extensive loss of DA innervation. Although it has been hypothesized that this resilience is due to the ability of many motor behaviors to be sustained through a basal tone of DA and diffuse transmission, experimental evidence for this is limited. Here we conditionally deleted the calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) in DA neurons (cKODA mice) to abrogate most activity-dependent axonal DA release in the striatum and mesencephalon, leaving STD DA release intact. Strikingly, Syt1 cKODA mice showed intact performance in multiple unconditioned DA-dependent motor tasks, suggesting that activity-dependent DA release is dispensable for such basic motor functions. Basal extracellular levels of DA in the striatum were unchanged, suggesting that a basal tone of extracellular DA is sufficient to sustain basic movement. We also found multiple adaptations in the DA system of cKODA mice, similar to those happening at early stages of PD. Taken together, our findings reveal the striking resilience of DA-dependent motor functions in the context of a near-abolition of phasic DA release, shedding new light on why extensive loss of DA innervation is required to reveal motor dysfunctions in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABA and IA Independently Regulate rNST Responses to Afferent Input</a></h4>

              
                Taste responses in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) influence motivated ingestive behavior via ascending pathways, and consummatory reflex behavior via local, brainstem connections. Modifications to the afferent signal within the rNST include changes in gain (the overall rate of neuron activity) and changes in gustatory tuning (the degree to which individual neurons respond to divergent gustatory qualities). These alterations of the sensory signal derive from both synaptic interactions within the nucleus and the constitutive cellular membrane properties of rNST neurons. GABA neurons are well represented within the rNST, as is expression of KV4.3, a channel for a rapidly inactivating outward K+ current (IA). GABAergic synapses suppress rNST responses to afferent input and previous studies showed that this suppression is greater in cells expressing IA, suggesting a possible interaction. Here, we examine the potential interaction between GABAergic inhibition and IA channels in a series of patch clamp experiments. Optogenetic release of GABA suppressed rNST responses to afferent (electrical) stimulation and this effect was greater in cells with IA, confirming an earlier report. We further observed that the composite inhibitory postsynaptic potential was larger in IA positive cells, suggesting one mechanism for the greater afferent suppression. Blocking IA with the channel blocker AmmTX3, enhanced the response to afferent stimulation, suggesting a suppressive role for this channel in regulating afferent input at rest. However, pharmacologic blockade of IA did not suppress GABAergic inhibition, indicating that IA and GABA independently regulate excitatory afferent input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Role for Visual Areas in Physics Simulations</a></h4>

              
                To engage with the world, we must regularly make predictions about the outcomes of physical scenes. How do we make these predictions? Recent evidence points to simulation - the idea that we can introspectively manipulate rich, mental models of the world - as one possible explanation for how such predictions are accomplished. While theories based on simulation are supported by computational models, neuroscientific evidence for simulation is lacking and many important questions remain. For instance, do simulations simply entail a series of abstract computations? Or are they supported by sensory representations of the objects that comprise the scene being simulated? We posit the latter and suggest that the process of simulating a sequence of physical interactions is likely to evoke an imagery-like envisioning of those interactions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that when participants predict how a ball will fall through an obstacle-filled display, motion-sensitive brain regions are activated. We further demonstrate that this activity, which occurs even though no motion is being sensed, resembles activity patterns that arise while participants perceive the ball's motion. This finding suggests that the process of simulating the ball's movement is accompanied by a sensory representation of this movement. These data thus demonstrate that mental simulations recreate sensory depictions of how a physical scene is likely to unfold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Environmental and molecular modulation of motor individuality in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Innate behavioral biases such as human handedness are a ubiquitous form of inter-individual variation that are not strictly hardwired into the genome and are influenced by diverse internal and external cues. Yet, genetic and environmental factors modulating behavioral variation remain poorly understood, especially in vertebrates. To identify genetic and environmental factors that influence behavioral variation, we take advantage of larval zebrafish light-search behavior. During light-search, individuals preferentially turn in leftward or rightward loops, in which directional bias is sustained and non-heritable, and maintained by a habenula-rostral PT circuit. Here we use a medium-throughput recording strategy and unbiased analysis to show that significant individual to individual variation exists in wildtype larval zebrafish turning preference. We classify stable left, right, and unbiased turning types, with most individuals exhibiting a directional preference. Raising larvae at elevated temperature selectively reduces the leftward turning type and impacts rostral PT neurons, specifically. Exposure to conspecifics, variable salinity, environmental enrichment, and physical disturbance does not significantly impact inter-individual turning bias. Pharmacological manipulation of Notch signaling and carrying a mutant allele of a known Notch pathway affecter gene, gsx2, disrupted turn bias individuality in a dose-dependent manner. These results establish that larval zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model for inter-individual variation with sensitivity to specific environmental perturbations and gene dosage.

                The ligand-sensing transcription factor Nurr1 emerges as a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative pathologies but Nurr1 ligands for functional studies and therapeutic validation are lacking. Here we report pronounced Nurr1 modulation by statins for which clinically relevant neuroprotective effects have been demonstrated. Several statins directly affected Nurr1 activity in cellular and cell-free settings with low micromolar to sub-micromolar potencies. Simvastatin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in astrocytes which were abrogated by Nurr1 knockdown. Differential gene expression analysis in native and Nurr1 silenced cells revealed strong proinflammatory effects of Nurr1 knockdown while simvastatin treatment induced several neuroprotective mechanisms via Nurr1, for example, in energy utilization and reduced apoptosis. These findings suggest Nurr1 involvement in the well-documented but mechanistically elusive neuroprotection by statins.

                Microglia has been reported to be able to regulate the proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) by modulating the microenvironment, which results in different consequences of adult neurogenesis. However, whether the microglial activation is beneficial or harmful to NSPCs is still controversial because of the complexity and variability of microglial activation phenotypes. In this study, we detected the expression levels of M1 marker and M2 marker in IFN-{gamma}- and IL-4-induced microglia at different time, respectively. The phenotypic markers of M1 and M2 microglia were stable for 24 h after removal of IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 intervention, but exhibited different change patterns during the next 24 h. Then, the adult NSPCs were treated by the conditioned medium from IFN-{gamma}- and IL-4-activated microglia. The conditioned medium from IFN-{gamma}-activated microglia promoted apoptosis and astroglial differentiation of NSPCs, while suppressed proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSPCs. However, the conditioned medium from IL-4-activated microglia exhibited opposite effects on these physiological processes. In addition, the direct treatment of IFN-{gamma} or IL-4 alone did not significantly affect the proliferation, differentiation and survival of NSPCs. These results suggest that the secretome of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) microglia differently regulated the proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult NSPCs. These findings will help further study the biological mechanism of microglia regulating neurogenesis, and provide a therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases by regulating microglial phenotypes to affect neurogenesis.

                GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells in the olfactory bulb are proposed to mediate an intraglomerular high-pass filter through inhibition targeted onto a glomerulus. With this mechanism, weak stimuli (e.g., an odor with a low affinity for an odorant receptor) mainly produce PG cell-driven inhibition but strong stimuli generate enough excitation to overcome inhibition. PG cells may be particularly susceptible to being activated by weak stimuli due to their intrinsically small size and high input resistance. Here, we used dual-cell patch-clamp recordings and imaging methods in bulb slices obtained from wild-type and transgenic rats with labeled GABAergic cells to test a number of predictions of the high-pass filtering model. We first directly compared the responsiveness of PG cells with that of external tufted cells (eTCs), which are a class of excitatory interneurons that reside in a parallel but opposing position in the glomerular circuitry. PG cells were in fact found to be no more responsive than eTCs at low levels of sensory neuron activity. While PG cells required smaller currents to be excited, this advantage was offset by the fact that a given level of sensory neuron activity produced much smaller synaptic currents. We did however identify other factors that shaped the excitation/inhibition balance in a manner that would support a high-pass filter, including glial glutamate transporters and presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. We conclude that a single glomerulus may act as a high-pass filter to enhance the contrast between different olfactory stimuli through mechanisms that are largely independent cell intrinsic properties.

                Spinal cord, as part of the central nervous system, accounts for the main communication pathway between the brain and the peripheral nervous system. Spinal cord injury is a devastating and largely irreversible neurological trauma, and can result in lifelong disability and paralysis with no available cure. In vivo spinal cord imaging in mouse models without introducing immunological artifacts is critical to understand spinal cord pathology and discover effective treatments. We developed a minimal-invasive intervertebral window by retaining ligamentum flavum to protect the underlying spinal cord. By introducing an optical clearing method, we achieved repeated two-photon fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering imaging at subcellular resolution with up to 16 imaging sessions over 167 days and observed no inflammatory response. Using this optically cleared intervertebral window, we studied the neuron-glia dynamics following laser axotomy and observed strengthened contact of microglia with the nodes of Ranvier during axonal degeneration. By enabling long-term, repetitive, stable, high-resolution and inflammation-free imaging of mouse spinal cord, our method provides a reliable platform in the research aiming at understanding and treatment of spinal cord pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward enhances memory via age-varying online and offline neural mechanisms across development</a></h4>

              
                Reward motivation enhances memory through interactions between mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical systems - both during and after encoding. Developmental changes in these distributed neural circuits may lead to age-related differences in reward-motivated memory and the underlying neural mechanisms. Converging evidence from cross-species studies suggests that subcortical dopamine signaling is increased during adolescence, which may lead to stronger memory representations of rewarding, relative to mundane, events and changes in the contributions of underlying subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms across age. Here, we used fMRI to examine how reward motivation influences the "online" encoding and "offline" post-encoding brain mechanisms that support long-term associative memory from childhood to adulthood. We found that reward motivation led to both age-invariant as well as adolescent-specific enhancements in associative memory after 24 hours. Furthermore, reward-related memory benefits were linked to age-varying neural mechanisms. During encoding, interactions between the prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were associated with better high-reward memory to a greater degree with increasing age. Pre- to post-encoding changes in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and VTA were also associated with better high-reward memory, but more so at younger ages. Our findings suggest that there may be developmental shifts - from offline subcortical to online cortical processes - in the brain mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crocin inhibited amyloid-beta (Aβ) generation via promoting non-amyloidogenic APP processing and suppressed ER stress UPR signaling in N2a/APP cells</a></h4>

              
                Background: Crocin is a major active component of saffron (Crocus sativus) with many beneficial effects. More recently, crocin has been proposed for management of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we demonstrated for the first time that crocin reduced amyloid-beta generation through promoting alpha cleavage of APP processing and inhibited ER stress by attenuating UPR signaling in N2a/APP cells. Methodology: Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stably transfected with the Swedish mutant APP (N2a/APP) was used as a cellular model for AD pathogenesis. Vector transfected cells (N2a/vector) were employed to serve as control. The toxicity of crocin was first evaluated and non-toxic treatment of crocin (>30 micromolar for 24 h) was used for further investigations. Amyloid beta levels were determined by ELISA. Expression levels of UPR signaling proteins were determined by using Western blot. Results: Crocin significantly inhibited the protein expression of total APP in N2a/APP cells and promoted alpha cleavage of APP processing to increase sAPPalpha generation, but only modestly reduced BACE-1 and PS1, suggesting amyloid beta reduction by crocin was mainly associated with the non-amyloidogenic APP processing. Further investigation on ER stress related protein expressions showed that GRP78, CHOP, p-PERK, p-eIF2alpha, p-IREalpha, XBP1, ATF6alpha, and PDI were all significantly elevated in N2a/APP cells compared to N2a/vector. Crocin effectively reduced the levels of GRP78 and CHOP, and significantly inhibited p-PERK/p-eIF2, and AT6, while slightly reduced p-IRE1alpha. Conclusion: The present study showed that crocin was effective at blocking amyloid beta generation and inhibiting ER stress associated overactivation of UPR signaling in AD cell model N2a/APP. The results provided evidence for crocin as useful natural product for the treatment of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divergent encoding of active avoidance behavior in corticostriatal and corticolimbic projections</a></h4>

              
                Active avoidance behavior, in which an animal performs an action to avoid a stressor, is crucial for survival and may provide insight into avoidance behaviors seen in anxiety disorders. Active avoidance requires the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which is thought to regulate avoidance via downstream projections to the striatum and amygdala. However, the endogenous activity of projection-defined dmPFC subpopulations during active avoidance learning remains unexplored. Here we utilized fiber photometry to record from the dmPFC and its downstream projections to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during active avoidance learning in mice. We examined neural activity during conditioned stimulus (CS) presentations, active avoidance, and cued freezing. Both prefrontal projections showed learning-related increases in activity during CS onset throughout active avoidance training. The dmPFC as a whole showed increased activity during avoidance and decreased activity during cued freezing. Finally, dmPFC-DMS and dmPFC-BLA projections showed divergent encoding of active avoidance behavior, with the dmPFC-DMS projection showing increased activity and the dmPFC-BLA showing decreased activity during active avoidance. Our results identify differential prefrontal encoding of active and passive coping behaviors in the same behavioral paradigm and demonstrate divergent encoding of active avoidance in projection-specific dmPFC subpopulations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intact reading ability in spite of a spatially distributed visual word form 'area' in an individual born without the left superior temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                The visual word form area (VWFA) is an experience-dependent brain region in the left ventral temporal cortex of literate adults that responds selectively to visual words. Why does it emerge in this stereotyped location? Past research has shown that the VWFA is preferentially connected to the left-lateralized frontotemporal language network. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of a typical language network and its connections with ventral temporal cortex (VTC) are critical for the VWFA's emergence, and whether alternative functional architectures may support reading ability. We explored these questions in an individual (EG) born without the left superior temporal lobe but exhibiting normal reading ability. Using fMRI, we recorded brain activation to visual words, objects, faces, and scrambled words in EG and neurotypical controls. We did not observe word selectivity either in EG's right homotope of the VWFA (rVWFA)--the most expected location given that EG's language network is right-lateralized--or in her spared left VWFA (lVWFA), in the presence of typical face selectivity in both the right and left fusiform face area (rFFA, lFFA). Interestingly, multivariate pattern analyses revealed voxels in EG's rVWFA and lVWFA that showed 1) higher within- than between- category correlations for words (e.g., Words-Words>Words-Faces), and 2) higher within-category correlations for words than other categories (e.g., Words-Words>Faces-Faces). These results suggest that a typical left-hemisphere language network may be necessary for the emergence of focal word selectivity within ventral temporal cortex, and that orthographic processing may depend on a distributed neural code, which appears capable of supporting reading ability.

	<p>Accurate identification of the prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in adults with Down syndrome (MCI-DS) has been challenging because there are no established diagnostic criteria that can be applied for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities (ID). As such, the sequence of cognitive decline in adults with DS has been difficult to ascertain, and it is possible that domain constructs characterizing cognitive function in neurotypical adults do not generalize to this high-risk population. The present study examined associations among multiple measures of cognitive function in adults with DS, either prior to or during the prodromal stage of AD to determine, through multiple statistical techniques, the measures that reflected the same underlying domains of processing. Participants included 144 adults with DS 40–82 years of age, all enrolled in a larger, multidisciplinary study examining biomarkers of AD in adults with DS. All participants had mild or moderate lifelong intellectual disabilities. Overall AD-related clinical status was rated for each individual during a personalized consensus conference that considered performance as well as health status, with 103 participants considered cognitively stable (CS) and 41 to have MCI-DS. Analyses of 17 variables derived from 10 tests of cognition indicated that performance reflected three underlying factors: language/executive function, memory, and visuomotor. All three domain composite scores significantly predicted MCI-DS status. Based upon path modeling, the language/executive function composite score was the most affected by prodromal AD. However, based upon structural equation modeling, tests assessing the latent construct of memory were the most impacted, followed by those assessing visuomotor, and then those assessing language/executive function. Our study provides clear evidence that cognitive functioning in older adults with DS can be characterized at the cognitive domain level, but the statistical methods selected and the inclusion or exclusion of certain covariates may lead to different conclusions. Best practice requires investigators to understand the internal structure of their variables and to provide evidence that their variables assess their intended constructs.</p>

	<p>Background: The rapid expansion and severity of the COVID-19 contagion has had negative physical and psychological health implications for millions of people around the world, but even more so among children and adolescents. Given the severity of the situation and the small number of studies on the direct influence of viral infection on the cognitive development within adolescents, the present study aims at understanding the consequences of contracting the virus and being hospitalized in relation to cognitive functioning, in particular, for executive functioning, among adolescents. Methods: To all subjects included in the sample, divided into four groups based on the severity of the COVID-19 infection, were administered the WISC-IV in order to evaluate the global cognitive functioning, and subsequently, the subtests Courses and Tower of London (ToL), both part of the BVN 12–18, were administered for the evaluation of executive operation. Results: Our analyses showed that between subjects who did not contract the viral infection and those who contracted it in an asymptomatic form, there are no significant differences in cognitive functioning, but only in executive functioning. Furthermore, in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized subjects, we found lower scores especially for WM skills, while IQ scores are in a medium range. Conclusion: the present study shows that contracting the viral infection and, thus, being hospitalized, caused greater problems and difficulties as compared to those who were not hospitalized, impacting global cognitive (and executive) functioning, especially the WM. We believe that these results could allow an early detection of alterations in cognitive and executive functioning, a fundamental aspect of the interventions that occur in evolutionary phases such as those related to pre-adolescence, allowing, therefore, the activation of functional recovery pathways in a short time.</p>

	<p>Background: The combination of intralabyrinthine schwannoma (ILS) removal and cochlear implantation is the standard of care after surgical resection for audiological rehabilitation. Intracochlear ILS is not only the most frequent tumor in this group of schwannomas, but it is also, to some degree, surgically the most challenging because of its position behind the modiolus. Recent developments in the knowledge of implant position, implant magnet choice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences make an MRI follow-up after surgical removal possible. Thus far, no results are known about the surgical success and residual rate of these kind of tumors. The aim of the present study was to perform an early MRI follow-up for the evaluation of residual or recurrent intracochlear ILS after surgical removal and cochlear implantation. Methods: In a retrospective study, we evaluated seven patients after an intracochlear ILS removal and single-stage cochlear implantation with a mean period of 13.4 months post surgery with a 3T T1 GAD 2 mm sequence for a residual ILS. Patients were operated on using an individualized technique concept. Results: In six out of seven cases, 3 T T1 GAD 2 mm MRI follow-up showed no residual or recurrent tumor. In one case, a T1 signal indicated a tumor of the upper inner auditory canal (IAC) at the MRI follow up. Conclusion: MRI follow-up as a quality control tool after ILS removal and cochlear implantation is highly important to exclude residual tumors. Long-term MRI evaluation results are needed and can be obtained under consideration of implant position, implant magnet, and MRI sequence choice. A preoperative MRI slice thickness less than 2 mm can be recommended to visualize possible modiolar and IAC expansion.</p>
