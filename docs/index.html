              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00466">Rogue Variable Theory: A Quantum-Compatible Cognition Framework with a Rosetta Stone Alignment Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the most consequential dynamics in human cognition occur \emph{before} events become explicit: before decisions are finalized, emotions are labeled, or meanings stabilize into narrative form. These pre-event states are characterized by ambiguity, contextual tension, and competing latent interpretations. Rogue Variable Theory (RVT) formalizes such states as \emph{Rogue Variables}: structured, pre-event cognitive configurations that influence outcomes while remaining unresolved or incompatible with a system's current representational manifold. We present a quantum-consistent information-theoretic implementation of RVT based on a time-indexed \emph{Mirrored Personal Graph} (MPG) embedded into a fixed graph Hilbert space, a normalized \emph{Quantum MPG State} (QMS) constructed from node and edge metrics under context, Hamiltonian dynamics derived from graph couplings, and an error-weighted `rogue operator'' whose principal eigenvectors identify rogue factor directions and candidate Rogue Variable segments. We further introduce a \emph{Rosetta Stone Layer} (RSL) that maps user-specific latent factor coordinates into a shared reference Hilbert space to enable cross-user comparison and aggregation without explicit node alignment. The framework is fully implementable on classical systems and does not assume physical quantum processes; \emph{collapse} is interpreted as informational decoherence under interaction, often human clarification.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23321">Model-Behavior Alignment under Flexible Evaluation: When the Best-Fitting Model Isn't the Right One</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.23321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli. But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5 million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data, overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the right one.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18585">Deep Teleportation: Quantum Simulation of Conscious Report in Attentional Blink</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent quantum models of cognition have successfully simulated several interesting effects in human experimental data, from vision to reasoning and recently even consciousness. The latter case, consciousness has been a quite challenging phenomenon to model, and most efforts have been through abstract mathematical quantum methods, mainly focused on conceptual issues. Classical (non-quantum) models of consciousness-related experiments exist, but they generally fail to align well with human data. We developed a straightforward quantum model to simulate conscious reporting of seeing or missing competing stimuli within the famous attentional blink paradigm. In an attentional blink task, a target stimulus (T2) that appears after a previous one (T1) can be consciously reported if the delay between presenting them is short enough (called lag 1), otherwise it can be rendered invisible during the so-called refractory period of attention (lags 2 to 6 and even longer). For modeling this phenomenon, we employed a three-qubit entanglement ansatz circuit in the form of a deep teleportation channel instead of the well-known EPR channel. While reporting the competing stimuli was supposed to be the classical measurement outcomes, the effect of distractor stimuli (i.e., masks, if any) was encoded simply as random angle rotations. The simulation outcome for different states was measured, and the classical outcome probabilities were further used as inputs to a simple linear neural network. The result revealed a non-linear, alternating state pattern that closely mirrors human responses in conscious stimuli reporting. The main result was a successful simulation of Lag 1 sparing, lag 7 divergence, and masking effect through probabilistic outcome of measurement in different conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04706">Associations between iron and mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter nuclei in aging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.04706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elevated kurtosis values have been observed in subcortical grey matter structures of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Here we tested whether these elevated values are related to iron content, which generate magnetic fields that add to the diffusion encoding gradients. Multi-shell diffusion and multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions were used to derive mean kurtosis and iron measures (R2* and magnetic susceptibility), respectively, in subcortical grey matter nuclei and white matter tracts in a discovery cohort (110 older and 63 younger adults) and replication cohort (72 healthy older adults). Iron-rich grey matter regions exhibited higher mean kurtosis, R2*, and magnetic susceptibility and white matter regions had lower mean kurtosis in the older adult group. In both cohorts, mean kurtosis was significantly correlated with R2* and magnetic susceptibility in iron-rich grey matter nuclei. No association was seen between signal-to-noise ratio and mean kurtosis in any grey matter region, indicating that the increase in mean kurtosis was not due to reduced signal-to-noise. Finally, a phantom experiment found higher mean kurtosis as iron concentrations increased. Our findings indicate that kurtosis is associated with iron-sensitive metrics in iron-rich grey matter structures, suggesting that kurtosis may be sensitive to iron deposits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00020">Personalized Spiking Neural Networks with Ferroelectric Synapses for EEG Signal Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00102">Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy without a matrix</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is a highly effective optimization technique. A primary challenge when applying CMA-ES in high dimensionality is sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with an arbitrary covariance matrix, which involves its decomposition. The cubic complexity of this process is the main obstacle to applying CMA-ES in highdimensional spaces. We introduce a version of CMA-ES that uses no covariance matrix at all. In the proposed matrix-free CMA-ES, an archive stores the vectors of differences between individuals and the midpoint, normalized by the step size. New individuals are generated as the weighted combinations of the vectors from the archive. We prove that the probability distribution of individuals generated by the proposed method is identical to that of the standard CMA-ES. Experimental results show that reducing the archive size to store only a fixed number of the most recent populations is sufficient, without compromising optimization efficiency. The matrix-free and matrix-based CMA-ES achieve comparable results on the quadratic function when the step-size adaptation is turned off. When coupled with the step-size adaptation method, the matrix-free CMA-ES converges faster than the matrix-based, and usually yields the results of a comparable or superior quality, according to the results obtained for the CEC'2017 benchmark suite. Presented approach simplifies the algorithm, offers a novel perspective on covariance matrix adaptation, and serves as a stepping stone toward even more efficient methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00245">Modern Neuromorphic AI: From Intra-Token to Inter-Token Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought novel data processing and generative capabilities but also escalating energy requirements. This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00426">RMAAT: Astrocyte-Inspired Memory Compression and Replay for Efficient Long-Context Transformers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanism presents a significant impediment to applying Transformer models to long sequences. This work explores computational principles derived from astrocytes-glial cells critical for biological memory and synaptic modulation-as a complementary approach to conventional architectural modifications for efficient self-attention. We introduce the Recurrent Memory Augmented Astromorphic Transformer (RMAAT), an architecture integrating abstracted astrocyte functionalities. RMAAT employs a recurrent, segment-based processing strategy where persistent memory tokens propagate contextual information. An adaptive compression mechanism, governed by a novel retention factor derived from simulated astrocyte long-term plasticity (LTP), modulates these tokens. Attention within segments utilizes an efficient, linear-complexity mechanism inspired by astrocyte short-term plasticity (STP). Training is performed using Astrocytic Memory Replay Backpropagation (AMRB), a novel algorithm designed for memory efficiency in recurrent networks. Evaluations on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate RMAAT's competitive accuracy and substantial improvements in computational and memory efficiency, indicating the potential of incorporating astrocyte-inspired dynamics into scalable sequence models.

                arXiv:2601.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-related potential (ERP), a specialized paradigm of electroencephalographic (EEG), reflects neurological responses to external stimuli or events, generally associated with the brain's processing of specific cognitive tasks. ERP plays a critical role in cognitive analysis, the detection of neurological diseases, and the assessment of psychological states. Recent years have seen substantial advances in deep learning-based methods for spontaneous EEG and other non-time-locked task-related EEG signals. However, their effectiveness on ERP data remains underexplored, and many existing ERP studies still rely heavily on manually extracted features. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study that systematically compares traditional manual features (followed by a linear classifier), deep learning models, and pre-trained EEG foundation models for ERP analysis. We establish a unified data preprocessing and training pipeline and evaluate these approaches on two representative tasks, ERP stimulus classification and ERP-based brain disease detection, across 12 publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we investigate various patch-embedding strategies within advanced Transformer architectures to identify embedding designs that better suit ERP data. Our study provides a landmark framework to guide method selection and tailored model design for future ERP analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00668">Three factor delay learning rules for spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are dynamical systems that operate on spatiotemporal data, yet their learnable parameters are often limited to synaptic weights, contributing little to temporal pattern recognition. Learnable parameters that delay spike times can improve classification performance in temporal tasks, but existing methods rely on large networks and offline learning, making them unsuitable for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce synaptic and axonal delays to leaky integrate and fire (LIF)-based feedforward and recurrent SNNs, and propose three-factor learning rules to simultaneously learn delay parameters online. We employ a smooth Gaussian surrogate to approximate spike derivatives exclusively for the eligibility trace calculation, and together with a top-down error signal determine parameter updates. Our experiments show that incorporating delays improves accuracy by up to 20% over a weights-only baseline, and for networks with similar parameter counts, jointly learning weights and delays yields up to 14% higher accuracy. On the SHD speech recognition dataset, our method achieves similar accuracy to offline backpropagation-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it reduces model size by 6.6x and inference latency by 67%, with only a 2.4% drop in classification accuracy. Our findings benefit the design of power and area-constrained neuromorphic processors by enabling on-device learning and lowering memory requirements.

                arXiv:2601.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been emerging as prominent AI models for solving many natural language tasks due to their high performance (e.g., accuracy) and capabilities in generating high-quality responses to the given inputs. However, their large computational cost, huge memory footprints, and high processing power/energy make it challenging for their embedded deployments. Amid several tinyLLMs, recent works have proposed spike-driven language models (SLMs) for significantly reducing the processing power/energy of LLMs. However, their memory footprints still remain too large for low-cost and resource-constrained embedded devices. Manual quantization approach may effectively compress SLM memory footprints, but it requires a huge design time and compute power to find the quantization setting for each network, hence making this approach not-scalable for handling different networks, performance requirements, and memory budgets. To bridge this gap, we propose QSLM, a novel framework that performs automated quantization for compressing pre-trained SLMs, while meeting the performance and memory constraints. To achieve this, QSLM first identifies the hierarchy of the given network architecture and the sensitivity of network layers under quantization, then employs a tiered quantization strategy (e.g., global-, block-, and module-level quantization) while leveraging a multi-objective performance-and-memory trade-off function to select the final quantization setting. Experimental results indicate that our QSLM reduces memory footprint by up to 86.5%, reduces power consumption by up to 20%, maintains high performance across different tasks (i.e., by up to 84.4% accuracy of sentiment classification on the SST-2 dataset and perplexity score of 23.2 for text generation on the WikiText-2 dataset) close to the original non-quantized model while meeting the performance and memory constraints.

                arXiv:2601.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to cost-optimal task scheduling in a production line. The system consists of a set of serial processing tasks, each with a given duration, unit execution cost, and precedence constraints, which must be assigned to an unlimited number of stations subject to a per-station duration bound. The objective is to minimize the total production cost, modeled as a station-wise function of task costs and the duration bound, while strictly satisfying all prerequisite and capacity constraints. Two chromosome encoding strategies are investigated: a station-based representation implemented using the JGAP library with SuperGene validity checks, and a task-based representation in which genes encode station assignments directly. For each encoding, standard GA operators (crossover, mutation, selection, and replacement) are adapted to preserve feasibility and drive the population toward lower-cost schedules. Experimental results on three classes of precedence structures-tightly coupled, loosely coupled, and uncoupled-demonstrate that the task-based encoding yields smoother convergence and more reliable cost minimization than the station-based encoding, particularly when the number of valid schedules is large. The study highlights the advantages of GA over gradient-based and analytical methods for combinatorial scheduling problems, especially in the presence of complex constraints and non-differentiable cost landscapes.

                arXiv:2601.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.

                arXiv:2601.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network-based classifiers are prone to errors when processing adversarial examples (AEs). AEs are minimally perturbed input data undetectable to humans posing significant risks to security-dependent applications. Hence, extensive research has been undertaken to develop defense mechanisms that mitigate their threats. Most existing methods primarily focus on discriminating AEs based on the input sample features, emphasizing AE detection without addressing the correct sample categorization before an attack. While some tasks may only require mere rejection on detected AEs, others necessitate identifying the correct original input category such as traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving. The objective of this study is to propose a method for rectifying AEs to estimate the correct labels of their original inputs. Our method is based on re-attacking AEs to move them beyond the decision boundary for accurate label prediction, effectively addressing the issue of rectifying minimally perceptible AEs created using white-box attack methods. However, challenge remains with respect to effectively rectifying AEs produced by black-box attacks at a distance from the boundary, or those misclassified into low-confidence categories by targeted attacks. By adopting a straightforward approach of only considering AEs as inputs, the proposed method can address diverse attacks while avoiding the requirement of parameter adjustments or preliminary training. Results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits consistent performance in rectifying AEs generated via various attack methods, including targeted and black-box attacks. Moreover, it outperforms conventional rectification and input transformation methods in terms of stability against various attacks.

                arXiv:2601.00271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vehicle production factories, the vehicle painting process employs multiple robotic arms to simultaneously apply paint to car bodies advancing along a conveyor line. Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers.

                arXiv:2601.00339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human biological systems sustain life through extraordinary resilience, continually detecting damage, orchestrating targeted responses, and restoring function through self-healing. Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage. Our results also demonstrated depth of analysis to over come uncertainties and amount of micro-agents invoked to achieve resilience.

                arXiv:2601.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have raised concerns about its increasing energy consumption, while demand for deploying AI in mobile devices and machines at the edge is growing. Binary neural networks (BNNs) have recently gained attention as energy and memory efficient models suitable for resource constrained environments; however, training BNNs exactly is computationally challenging because of its discrete characteristics. Recent work proposing a framework for training BNNs based on quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) and progress in the design of Ising machines for solving QUBO problems suggest a potential path to efficiently optimising discrete neural networks. In this work, we extend existing QUBO models for training BNNs to accommodate arbitrary network topologies and propose two novel methods for regularisation. The first method maximises neuron margins biasing the training process toward parameter configurations that yield larger pre-activation magnitudes. The second method employs a dropout-inspired iterative scheme in which reduced subnetworks are trained and used to adjust linear penalties on network parameters. We apply the proposed QUBO formulation to a small binary image classification problem and conduct computational experiments on a GPU-based Ising machine. The numerical results indicate that the proposed regularisation terms modify training behaviour and yield improvements in classification accuracy on data not present in the training set.

                arXiv:2312.03243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.

                arXiv:2407.15600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that enables researchers to automatically explore vast search spaces and discover efficient neural networks. However, NAS suffers from a critical bottleneck, i.e. the evaluation of numerous architectures during the search process demands substantial computing resources and time. In order to improve the efficiency of NAS, a series of methods have been proposed to reduce the evaluation time of neural architectures. However, they are not efficient enough and still only focus on the accuracy of architectures. Beyond classification accuracy, real-world applications increasingly demand more efficient and compact network architectures that balance multiple performance criteria. To address these challenges, we propose the SMEMNAS, a pairwise comparison relation-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a multi-population mechanism. In the SMEMNAS, a surrogate model is constructed based on pairwise comparison relations to predict the accuracy ranking of architectures, rather than the absolute accuracy. Moreover, two populations cooperate with each other in the search process, i.e. a main population that guides the evolutionary process, while a vice population that enhances search diversity. Our method aims to discover high-performance models that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. With only a single GPU searching for 0.17 days, competitive architectures can be found by SMEMNAS which achieves 78.91% accuracy with the MAdds of 570M on the ImageNet. This work makes a significant advancement in the field of NAS.

Abstract: For reasons such as privacy, there are use cases for language models at the edge. This has given rise to small language models targeted for deployment in resource-constrained devices where energy efficiency is critical. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution due to their energy efficiency, and there are already works on realizing transformer-based models on SNNs. However, key operations like softmax and layer normalization (LN) are difficult to implement on neuromorphic hardware, and many of these early works sidestepped them. To address these challenges, we introduce Sorbet, a transformer-based spiking language model that is more neuromorphic hardware-compatible. Sorbet incorporates a novel shifting-based softmax called PTsoftmax and a Bit Shifting PowerNorm (BSPN), both designed to replace the respective energy-intensive operations. By leveraging knowledge distillation and model quantization, Sorbet achieved a highly compressed binary weight model that maintains competitive performance while achieving $27.16\times$ energy savings compared to BERT. We validate Sorbet through extensive testing on the GLUE benchmark and a series of ablation studies, demonstrating its potential as an energy-efficient solution for language model inference.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast EAs as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.

Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

                Abstract* Introduction One-lung ventilation (OLV) is used to isolate one lung during thoracic surgery, but manipulation and positioning can affect heart-lung interaction. Cardiomegaly may exacerbate these changes, especially in the left lateral decubitus (LLD) position. Objectives To investigate the effect of cardiomegaly on heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. Case presentation A 20-year-old male with recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax was scheduled for right-sided bronchopleural fistula repair via thoracotomy. The patient presented with cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio 75%) and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular and atrial dilation. In the LLD position, OLV led to desaturation when both lungs were ventilated, but oxygenation improved when only the left lung was ventilated. Results Cardiomegaly alters heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. The enlarged heart exerts pressure on the left lung, impairing ventilation. When both lungs are ventilated in this position, ventilation is directed toward the right lung, reducing oxygenation and causing desaturation. However, restricting ventilation to the left lung improved oxygenation due to better lung compliance and less interference from the enlarged heart. Conclusions Cardiomegaly affects heart-lung interaction during OLV in the LLD position. Oxygenation improves when only the left lung is ventilated, likely due to less compression of the left lung. The supine position may further enhance oxygenation even with bilateral ventilation. This case highlights the importance of considering cardiomegaly in OLV management. This section should be written as per the CARE checklist item 3.

">Snipers under stress: mentally simulated motor actions are resistant to acute stress in police officers</a></h4>

              
                Motor imagery (MI) is a sensorimotor process allowing to mentally simulate a motor action and is widely used to enhance performance in domains such as rehabilitation, sport, and professional training. Although MI is increasingly incorporated into stress-management interventions, the reciprocal relationship, that is, the effect of acute stress on MI remain paradoxically poorly understood, particularly in ecologically valid settings. The present study investigated this issue in professional police officers performing physically and mentally a precise handgun manipulation task under graded stress conditions (psychological stress). Fourteen participants was exposed to controlled, work-related stress scenarios designed to closely reflect real operational demands, while stress markers and temporal features of executed and imagined movements were recorded. Our results clearly indicate that motor imagery was preserved despite significant increases in stress levels, as the temporal characteristics of both executed and imagined movements remained stable across experimental conditions. These findings indicate that MI is resilient to acute psychosocial stress and support its relevance as a reliable training and performance-optimization tool in high-demand occupational settings.

">When exploration replaces storage: how eye movements shape visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory (VWM) is traditionally studied while constraining eye movements and limiting access to visual input, yet in natural vision humans constantly explore and resample their environment. Only a few studies have examined VWM utilization when participants were allowed to interact with the environment and found that participants often preferred to resample their environment rather than rely on VWM storage. However, since eye movements were not controlled in these studies, the link between VWM utilization and free visual exploration remained unknown. In two experiments (N = 40), we investigated how visual exploration shapes reliance on VWM versus perceptual input. Participants searched for a common target across two item sets and could either store multiple items for comparison or repeatedly resample the sets by switching between them. Results revealed that when switching was achieved through eye movements, participants consistently relied more on visual resampling and less on VWM; in contrast, when switching required a manual response, they shifted toward greater VWM use. This pattern persisted even when peripheral input was equated, suggesting that natural exploration through eye movements reduces the cognitive cost of acquiring visual information, leading to a strategic reduction in VWM use. Our findings challenge fixation-based approaches to VWM research and highlight the importance of studying cognition under ecological viewing conditions.

">Evaluating and Classifying Gentleness in VR-Based Surgical Simulation: A VR+fNIRS Study</a></h4>

              
                Gentleness, defined as the ability to handle tissues delicately and minimize unnecessary force, is a key indicator of surgical proficiency. Objective and real-time assessment of gentleness in virtual reality (VR)-based training can enhance the understanding of both psychomotor and cognitive aspects of surgical skill. This study evaluates and classifies participants gentleness during VR-based surgical simulations using fNIRS-derived hemodynamic features. We trained and compared several machine learning models to assess performance. Twenty-three volunteers with no prior laparoscopic experience performed a virtual reality-based laparoscopic double-grasper task while hemodynamic activity over frontal and motor cortical areas was recorded using eighteen fNIRS channels. Alongside fNIRS, we collected subjective workload (NASA-TLX), error numbers, and a VR gentleness score. This task involves using two grasper tools simultaneously to perform the tissue like balloon manipulation in a VR environment. We extracted temporal features (slope, RMS, standard deviation) and trained machine learning models to classify performance levels based on cortical activation. Labels were binarized as low vs. high using median splits for the gentleness score. Models were evaluated with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and summarized by accuracy. Results showed stronger right-frontal HbO activity and increased left-motor HbR responses in the low-performance group, suggesting greater cognitive effort and less efficient motor strategies during VR-based laparoscopic manipulation. Across classifiers and feature sets, slope-based features consistently outperformed variability- and amplitude-based metrics. Among the tested models, HbR slope features achieved the best overall classification performance, with the highest accuracy obtained using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifiers (accuracy {approx} 0.89, AUC up to 0.97). These findings demonstrate that fNIRS-derived hemodynamic dynamics can reliably discriminate between high and low VR performance levels, supporting their potential use in automated performance assessment and neuroadaptive feedback frameworks for VR-based surgical training.

">Dopaminergic Modulation of Mushroom Body Output Neurons Mediates Nociception-Induced Escape in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In Drosophila, noxious heat is detected by peripheral nociceptors expressing transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, including Painless and TrpA1, and rapidly triggers escape behavior. Although peripheral transduction has been defined in detail, the central circuits and neuromodulatory mechanisms that translate nociceptor activity into escape decisions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine targeted behavioral perturbations with anatomical tracing to delineate a nociception to escape pathway that engages dopaminergic modulation of mushroom body (MB) output. Kir2.1 mediated silencing across candidate neurotransmitter systems revealed a specific requirement for MB innervating dopaminergic neurons (DANs), particularly subsets within the PPL1 and PAM clusters, for robust nociception induced escape. Anterograde trans Tango tracing from painless and trpA1 expressing nociceptors labeled these MB dopaminergic neurons as direct postsynaptic partners, consistent with convergence of distinct nociceptor inputs onto a shared dopaminergic pathway. Finally, silencing a subset of mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) delayed escape without overtly disrupting baseline locomotion, supporting a model in which dopaminergic signaling recruits MB output to shape defensive action selection. Together, our results define a multi layer circuit motif linking peripheral nociception to MB dependent escape and provide a framework for dissecting how neuromodulation gates rapid defensive behaviors.

">A dedicated brain circuit controls forward walking in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits in the brain control high-level parameters of movement, including the initiation, speed, and direction of locomotion. How specific cell types are organized into circuits to compute these control signals and enable context-appropriate behavior remains unclear. Here, we identify central brain neurons in Drosophila that can initiate walking and exert graded control over walking speed. Connectome analyses position the neurons on top of a layered brain circuit, which recruits a specific population of descending neurons to control forward walking independently of turning and other parameters. As predicted by the connectome, the circuit enforces straight walking when activated unilaterally, and the activity of the central brain neurons represents a high-level walking drive. This drive is suppressed during flight but flexibly integrated with other control signals to enable complex movement sequences during obstacle negotiation. Together, our findings elucidate a dedicated brain circuit that enables efficient computation, selection, and integration of forward-walking signals for context-appropriate motor control.

">Understanding Brain Aging Through Behavioural and Microglial Changes: A Lifespan Approach</a></h4>

              
                Aging is characterized by progressive physiological decline linked to inflammaging, a chronic low-grade inflammatory state. This study investigates age-related behavioural changes and their correlation with microglial function in female Sprague Dawley rats across their lifespan. Using a longitudinal design at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age, we assessed motor performance, mood-related behaviours, and spatial cognition alongside microglial morphometric analysis in key brain regions. Results showed that motor and cognitive performance began to decline significantly at 12 months, with severe impairments and depressive-like behaviours appearing by 24 months. These deficits were paralleled by progressive gliosis in the hippocampus and striatum. Microglial morphometric analysis further indicated a more reactive, region-dependent phenotype, with cells in the striatum adopting a smaller area, reduced perimeter, and fewer intersections. These findings provide compelling evidence for significant age-dependent deterioration in motor performance, mood regulation, and cognitive abilities in female rats. Our data strongly suggest an underlying progression of neurobiological changes, with microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation being central candidates. This research contributes valuable insights into the cellular correlates of behavioural decline across the female lifespan, serving as a reference for the multifaceted changes that occur during normal aging.

">A cell-type-resolved human brain atlas of microRNAs and tRNA fragments</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miRs) and transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) regulate multiple brain processes ranging from neurogenesis and development through diverse neurological disorders. However, the cell-type specificity of brain miRs and tRFs remains poorly characterized, limiting the interpretation of their function. To address this issue, we generated a comprehensive, cell-type-resolved atlas of miRs and tRFs from live human brain tissues. Specifically, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes from neurosurgery-obtained fresh human brain samples and profiled their miR and tRF repertoires using small RNA-sequencing. Our atlas revealed multiple differences in miR and tRF expression between the four cell types and consequently identified novel cell-type markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR cell-type specificity may be regulated by quantitative trait loci located in cell-type-associated enhancer regions. We also report higher levels of 5'-tRNA halves in neurons compared to glia, including a particular neuronal enrichment of 5'-tRNA halves derived from glycine, leucine and lysine tRNAs. These neuronal tRFs were significantly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease postmortem brain samples compared to age-matched controls, possibly reflecting a neuronal response to disease. Our atlas, together with an accompanying statistical tool for miR cell-type enrichment analysis, provides a publicly available resource for delineating small RNA cell-type origin and function in the human brain.

">Neural markers of visual working memory during an upper extremity movement-coupled task: a mobile brain-body imaging (MOBI) study.</a></h4>

              
                Optimal goal directed behavior in everyday life involves the appropriate coupling of cognition and movement. In this study we employed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) system that integrated time-synchronized high-density electroencephalography with three-dimensional motion capture during a touchscreen visual working memory task requiring dynamic upper extremity reach responses. Using this framework we examined how increasing memory load (e.g. from 1-disc to 4-discs) influences behavior and scalp-recorded neural activity when cognitive and motor processes are coupled within a single task, and whether these effects are modulated by handedness. Increasing memory load reliably degraded working memory task performance and slowed motor preparation while core movement execution measures remained largely preserved. Regarding electroencephalography data, parieto-occipital activity increased with load during both the early visual-evoked N1 and the delay period However, load-related modulation reached a plateau at the 3-disc condition during the delay period only. Posterior-frontal engagement also strengthened as load increased, consistent with demands on attentional control memory maintenance and sensorimotor planning. Brain-behavior associations were most robust at a moderate 2-disc level where contralateral delay activity correlated with both cognitive and motor performance measures. Finally, although handedness exerted selective behavioral effects it did not modulate load-related parieto-occipital neural activity Together these findings demonstrate that a multimodal MoBI approach captures integrated cognitive-motor dynamics during working memory guided actions, providing a more comprehensive characterization of behavior and underlying neural signatures than either modality alone This framework offers a translational approach for studying cognitive-motor interactions and their potential disruption in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.

">Catestatin ameliorates tauopathy and amyloidogenesis via adrenergic inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers disease, Corticobasal Degeneration, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy are characterized by Tau aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation and progressive cognitive decline. Although metabolic dysregulation and neuropeptide imbalance have been linked to these disorders, the functional consequences of such imbalance and its potential for therapeutic reversal remain poorly understood. Our previous work identified chromogranin A, which encodes a pro-hormone for several metabolic peptides, as a key regulator of Tau pathology. Here, we investigate Catestatin, a chromogranin A derived peptide that is a potent inhibitor of catecholamine release and has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower peripheral blood pressure. We report significant reductions in CST levels in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, as well as in the frontal cortex of CBD and the basal ganglia of PSP. Supplementing CST in cortical neuronal cultures and organotypic slice cultures decreased Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. In vivo, CST administration in PS19 Tauopathy mice reduced pathological Tau species, attenuated gliosis, and improved cognitive function. CST treatment also lowered amyloid plaque burden and neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice. Mechanistically, CST decreased epinephrine levels in both PS19 and 5XFAD mice and suppressed downstream protein kinase A hyperactivation in PS19 and OTSC. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized neuropeptidergic mechanism linking CST deficiency to elevated adrenergic receptor, epinephrine and PKA stress signaling and Tauopathy driven neurodegeneration, suggesting CST replacement as a promising therapeutic approach.

">Neural representations of visual memory in inferotemporal cortex reveal a generalizable framework for translating between spikes and field potentials</a></h4>

              
                Translating neurophysiological findings requires understanding the relationship between common measures of brain activity in animals (spiking activity) and humans (local field potentials, LFP). Prior work suggests alignment between population spiking and high-gamma activity (HGA, 50-150 Hz) of the LFP; however, this is not always observed and is consequently debated. Here, we show that this alignment and prior failures depend on the underlying coding scheme. First, we examined neural representations of variables related to visual memory in macaque inferotemporal cortex. We found that spikes and HGA were strikingly aligned for variables encoded as population response magnitude (novelty, recency, and memorability). However, a variable encoded as a distributed pattern of activity (category) was misaligned. Next, we showed that these insights generalize across many published studies, accounting for prior alignment successes and failures. These results provide a framework for translating between spikes and LFPs, highlighting the scenarios likely to be fruitful for translation.

">Trait anxiety is associated with idiosyncratic neural event boundaries during naturalistic movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety is associated with altered patterns of attention to images and objects, but how it influences the perception of continuous experiences remains underexplored. Here, we examined how anxiety influences the segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events. Using a large-scale open-access dataset and data-driven methods to detect neural event boundaries, we compared neural event segmentation between healthy adults with high (N=60) and low trait-level anxiety (N=60) as they viewed a short suspenseful film. While the overall temporal event segmentation hierarchy was preserved across groups, higher-anxiety individuals had more idiosyncratic boundaries, exhibiting reduced alignment to both low-anxiety individuals and one another. This divergence was the most pronounced in the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks, suggesting that anxiety-related disruptions in top-down attentional control may contribute to less consistent segmentation. Furthermore, boundary variability in anxious participants was higher during moments rated as more anxiety-provoking by a large language model, controlling for arousal, valence, and low-level visual features. Together, these findings suggest that idiosyncratic event models in anxious individuals result in non-normative organization of continuous experience, leading to more individualized and inconsistent event boundaries. Such variability in segmentation may have downstream consequences for prediction, memory, and social cognition, offering a potential neural mechanism by which anxiety influences the interpretation and recall of everyday experiences. Our findings highlight trait-level variability as a lens through which the brain parses information and offers a neurocomputational framework for investigating individual differences in naturalistic event cognition.

">Single-cell map of the female brain across reproductive transitions</a></h4>

              
                Ovarian hormone shifts enable reproduction and are associated with substantial brain plasticity and disease risks. While imaging studies provide (micro)structural insights into brain changes across the ovarian cycle and pregnancy, the high resolution, single-cell map of the brain across reproductive transitions is missing. Here, we performed multiome (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) analysis of the mouse ventral hippocampus (vHIP) across sex, estrous cycle, and peripartum period at single cell resolution. We identify dynamic changes in vHIP cellular composition across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, including in the neural stem cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), enabling hormone-driven neurogenesis. Major gene expression changes are neuronal function-relevant, cell type-specific, and found in excitatory neurons of CA1, CA3, and DG subfields, across sex and reproductive transitions. In contrast, chromatin accessibility changes are more extensive and found across cell types, likely driven by estrogen level shifts in both within-female and between-sex comparisons. We show that chromatin remodeling during the estrous cycle primes the genome for gene expression changes during pregnancy and is also enriched for brain disease-relevant genes. Finally, we reveal a thyroid hormone transporter (Transthyretin, Ttr) gene as the major candidate gene that drives structural and behavioral changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Our study provides an extensive cellular and molecular view of how reproductive transitions shape the brain and opens the possibility to target downstream targets of estrogen, including thyroid hormone signaling, as a treatment option for hormone-sensitive periods in women.

<p>This paper describes my history of exposure and contributions to behavioral neuroscience, especially to the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory. Through a series of accidents and opportunities, and after priming in the graduate student environment of hippocampus and memory at Dalhousie University in the Department of Psychology, my work on the topic started at the University of Lethbridge, evaluating place navigation in Richard Morris' swimming pool task with Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw. We made a number of experimental and theoretical contributions, most important among these was the evaluation of the deficits caused by hippocampal damage on place learning and memory, recent versus remote memory, configural associations, and extensions to human memory. We describe some missteps and how we picked ourselves up and continued on.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This article is a personal history of the background, ideas, and motivations behind the major discoveries from my lab in the past 27 years. Tracing the main themes back to my training as a graduate student and a postdoc, I discuss how all of our work has been influenced by a desire to use anatomical and computational literature to inspire and constrain the experimental questions we have addressed. The backstory of two fundamental discoveries made in the early days on my independent research program are described: (a) differences between DG, CA3, and CA1 population dynamics in relation to computational theories of pattern separation and pattern completion and (b) differences in the types of information conveyed to the hippocampus from its lateral and medial entorhinal cortex inputs. Also described are how these initial findings set the foundation for numerous subsequent discoveries as we followed the data from one experiment to the next, with the goals of understanding how information is represented and transformed through the hippocampal formation in support of spatial learning and episodic memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78100?af=R">Profiles and Predictors of Neurodevelopmental Outcome at 5–6 Years in Children With a History of Acute Provoked Neonatal Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the neurodevelopment and risk factors for impairment at age 5 to 6 years after acute provoked neonatal seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter study of neonates with acute provoked seizures. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence IV (WPPSI-IV), Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Scales, Behavior Assessment System for Children, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Social Responsiveness Scale, cerebral palsy (CP), and epilepsy were assessed at age 5 to 6 years. Latent class analysis defined outcome profiles. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to determine outcome predictors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We characterized 3 latent classes among 164 children: (1) Typical Development (63%); (2) Behavioral Dysregulation (13%; low likelihood of physical impairment or severely impaired cognition, high likelihood of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]); and (3) Multi-Domain Impairment (24%; high likelihood of epilepsy and impairment across all domains). Among 144 children with standardized testing, mean WPPSI-IV was 91 ± 25 and Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite 90 ± 20. Twenty-nine percent had ADHD or elevated attention/hyperactivity scores; 19% had autism or elevated Social Responsiveness scores; 20% had epilepsy, and 19% had CP. Risk factors for Multi-Domain Impairment were abnormal neonatal neurologic examination (odds ratio [OR] = 3.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.74–8.95), impaired functional development at age 24 months (OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.25–11.66), and CP (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.74–7.90). No neonatal or infant characteristics were significantly associated with Behavioral Dysregulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of 5 to 6-year-old children with provoked neonatal seizures had typical development. Yet, executive and behavioral dysregulation were prevalent, even with preserved cognitive and physical function. These findings can inform outcome discussions and interventions to promote neurodevelopment. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

">Dendritic excitations primarily mediate back-propagation in CA1 pyramidal neurons during behavior</a></h4>

              
                Dendrites integrate synaptic inputs to trigger action potentials, and dendrites carry back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) to synapses where these signals contribute to plasticity. Despite strong evidence for a rich repertoire of nonlinear dendritic excitations, the in vivo roles of these excitations in dendritic integration and back-propagation remain uncertain. Here, we used high-speed voltage imaging through a chronically implanted microprism to map membrane potential dynamics from basal to apical dendrites of CA1 neurons in mice navigating in a virtual reality environment. Despite complex dendritic branch morphology, the dynamics were largely captured by 2 or 3 electrical compartments: basal, soma, and apical. Fast dendritic spikes almost always started from bAPs, indicating that dendritic spikes are primarily a consequence rather than a cause of somatic spiking. These fast spikes sometimes triggered slower apical dendritic plateau depolarizations, which drove complex spikes at the soma. We found that the biophysics of dendritic excitability determined the distribution of simple and complex spikes across a place field. Our results show how CA1 pyramidal neurons convert synaptic inputs to spiking outputs and suggest a primary role of dendritic nonlinearities in mediating activity-dependent plasticity.

">Auditory brainstem-cortical anatomy constrains the magnitude of frequency-following responses (FFRs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) coding speech-in-noise</a></h4>

              
                Speech-evoked brain potentials provide a window into the neural encoding of speech, experience-dependent plasticity, and deficits in central auditory processing from communication disorders. Stronger and faster frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) have been interpreted as reflecting more robust and efficient auditory-sensory processing across brainstem and cortical levels. Importantly, these neural signatures relate to real-world listening skills like speech-in-noise (SIN) perception. Yet, how these speech-evoked FFRs/ERPs relate to underlying auditory anatomical structures is unknown. Using a multimodal imaging approach, we recorded FFRs and ERPs to clean and noise-degraded speech sounds to assess the strength of listeners' neural encoding of speech at brainstem (FFR) and cortical (ERP) levels. MRI volumetrics of midbrain and transverse temporal gyrus (Hesch's gyrus) quantified morphological variation in subcortical and cortical anatomy that underly these EEG potentials. The QuickSIN assessed behavioral SIN abilities. Results showed that larger and thicker right (but not left) Heschl's gyrus was related to listeners' SIN abilities as well as the size of their cortical ERPs. Structural and functional measures interacted at a subcortical level. For listeners with smaller mid-brain volumes, larger speech FFRs were associated with better QuickSIN scores; whereas in individuals with larger midbrain volumes, larger FFRs were related to poorer QuickSIN. Our findings reveal common functional signatures of speech pro-cessing (FFRs, ERPs) are constrained by the anatomy of their underlying generators and suggest a complex interplay between auditory brain structure and function in accounting for perceptual SIN capacity.

">Neural Mechanisms of Mixed Speech and Grasp Representation in Sensorimotor Cortices</a></h4>

              
                Recent brain-machine interface (BMI) studies have challenged traditional views of functional specialization in human motor cortices, suggesting that regions associated with hand control also support speech. The extent of this dual functionality as well as the neural mechanisms underlying it are unclear. We address this by analyzing intracortical neural activity from seven brain regions (spanning motor, premotor, somatosensory and parietal regions) across two participants with tetraplegia. Across all regions, grasp decoding was robust. In addition, we achieved reliable discrete-word decoding during silent reading as well as vocalized speech. Both tasks largely recruited overlapping neural populations within each region, yet these populations reconfigured their functional connectivity between tasks. Additionally, subspace analyses revealed segregated computations for speech and grasping despite mixed selectivity at the unit level. Our findings support multi-functional BMIs capable of decoding speech and grasping from the same implant and highlight ventral premotor area 6r as a novel target.

">The Intermediate Hippocampus Integrates Shock-Observation and Spatial Information during Observational Fear Memory</a></h4>

              
                In the wild, learning about danger, not from one's own direct experience, but by observing the experiences of others is a crucial adaptive strategy for avoiding life-threatening situations. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that rodents can acquire fear vicariously by witnessing conspecifics in distress. The hippocampus, organized in functionally distinct sub-domains along its septotemporal axis, and critical for the formation and consolidation of memories, has recently been shown to be necessary for contextual vicarious fear learning in rodents. However, the neuronal mechanisms by which hippocampal circuits map others' distress onto an observer's own spatial representations remain poorly understood. To address this question, we recorded single-unit activity from the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral hippocampus of observer rats engaged in a vicarious fear-learning task. In this paradigm, animals learn to fear a shock context in which they witness a conspecific receive electrical footshocks, but not a safe context in which the same conspecific was present in a neutral state. We show that: 1) neurons both from the dorsal and intermediate hippocampus conjunctively encode witnessing a shock delivered to a conspecific and the place where it was observed, although shock observation recruited a larger proportion of pyramidal neurons within the intermediate hippocampus, 2) during a subsequent rest, the patterns of spiking activity associated with the shock context were preferentially reactivated, particularly in the intermediate hippocampus and 3) while spatial representations corresponding to both the safe and shock context reorganized in nearly all subregion of the hippocampus following shock observation, we found a relative stabilization of the spatial representation associated with the shock context for pyramidal cells recorded from the intermediate hippocampus. Our results reveal multiple neuronal mechanisms by which hippocampal neurons, particularly within the intermediate subregions, encode and consolidate vicarious fear memories.

">Microglia stabilize sleep homeostasis via adenosine A3 receptor signaling</a></h4>

              
                Sleep homeostasis maintains the sleep-wake balance through sleep pressure, a process orchestrated by the accumulation of extracellular adenosine (eADO). Microglial Ca2+ activity has been implicated in sleep regulation, but the mechanism whereby microglia sense sleep pressure remains unclear. Here we show that microglia regulate sleep homeostasis through brain state-dependent Ca2+ activity driven by adenosine A3 receptor (A3R) signaling. Using miniaturized two-photon microscopy (mTPM) in freely behaving mice, we demonstrate that microglial Ca2+ activity is rapidly altered by brain-state transitions. Pharmacological experiments reveal that microglial Ca2+ dynamics are predominantly mediated by A3R in response to brain state-dependent eADO oscillations. Microglia-specific deletion of A3R attenuates these state-dependent Ca2+ dynamics, impairs microglial morphological plasticity across sleep-wake cycles, and leads to sleep fragmentation by increasing transitions between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Together, these findings establish that microglia regulate sleep homeostasis by stabilizing both wakefulness and NREM sleep, a process critically dependent on eADO-A3R signaling.

">D1R-specific modulation of ACC mitigates chronic neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive plasticity within central pain circuits is a defining feature of chronic neuropathic pain, yet the mechanisms governing these changes remain unclear. This study investigates the role of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway in the neuropathic pain-induced hyperexcitability of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing anterior cingulate cortex (ACCD1R) neurons. We find that infusing D1R agonists in the ACC reverses the mechanical hypersensitivity and negative affective-motivational affect in mice caused by spared-nerve injury (SNI). Although ACC pyramidal neurons are widely presumed to be the principal targets of D1R signaling, ex vivo recordings reveal that D1R agonists suppress the excitability of D1R-expressing pyramidal neurons while enhancing the excitability of D1R-expressing interneurons. Consistently, gene-expression analyses show that D1R-expression is distributed across both excitatory and inhibitory ACC neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excitability of genetically labeled D1R pyramidal neurons is enhanced by SNI, whereas in interneurons, it is reduced. Chemogenetic manipulation demonstrates that activation of D1R neurons produces robust analgesic and anxiolytic effects, whereas inhibition worsens pain- and anxiety-related behaviours, indicating that inhibitory D1R neurons dominate population-level output. Circuit tracing further delineates diverse afferent and efferent connections linking ACCD1R neurons to sensory and affective pain pathways. Together, these results identify dopaminergic regulation of ACCD1R neurons as a critical determinant of cortical dysfunction in chronic pain.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, presenting significant clinical challenges due to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Understanding the metabolic reprogramming that drives this disease is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and improving patient outcomes. We developed a novel computational framework integrating genome-scale metabolic modeling with machine learning to identify metabolic signatures and therapeutic vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer. To address the inherent class imbalance in cancer datasets, we generated synthetic healthy samples using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty, implementing a rigorous three-step biological filtration process to ensure their validity. This approach enabled the creation of a balanced dataset for robust comparison of healthy versus cancerous metabolic states. Our machine learning classifier achieved 94.83% accuracy in distinguishing between these states, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Systems-level analysis revealed three key dysregulated pathways: heparan sulfate degradation, O-glycan metabolism, and heme degradation. We identified impaired lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed association between lysosomal storage disorders and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, nervonic acid transport emerged as the most discriminative reaction between healthy and cancerous states, with gene-level analysis highlighting fatty acid binding proteins, fatty acid transporters, and acyl-CoA synthetases as key molecular drivers of metabolic reprogramming. Our multi-level approach connected genetic drivers to functional metabolic consequences, revealing coordinated upregulation of fatty acid transport and activation processes. These findings enhance our understanding of pancreatic cancer metabolism and present potential therapeutic targets, demonstrating the value of integrated computational approaches in cancer research.

Motivation <p>The interaction between peptides and human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) molecules plays a pivotal role in adaptive immune responses, as HLA-II mediates the recognition of exogenous antigens and initiates T cell activation through peptide presentation. Accurate prediction of peptide-HLA-II binding serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular immune responses, and is essential for guiding the optimization of antibody therapeutics. Researchers have developed several computational approaches to identify peptide-HLA-II interaction and presentation. However, most computational approaches exhibit inconsistent predictive performance, poor generalization ability and limited biological interpretability.</p> Results <p>In this study, we present DSCA-HLAII, a novel predictive framework for peptide-HLA-II interactions and presentation based on a dual-stream cross-attention architecture. The framework proposes a dual-stream cross-attention (DSCA) mechanism to integrate pre-trained semantic embedding ESMC with sequence-level ONE-HOT features. The DSCA mechanism effectively models the interaction dynamics between peptides and HLA-II molecules, enabling the precise identification of key binding sites. Experimental results demonstrate that DSCA-HLAII consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness in predicting peptide-HLA-II interactions and presentation. We further demonstrate the capability of DSCA-HLAII for predicting peptide binding cores and assessing antibody immunogenicity, which is expected to advance artificial intelligence-based peptide drug discovery.</p>

                <p>by Yan Liu, Yu Xia, He Yan, Long-Chen Shen, Yiheng Zhu, Ji-Peng Qiang, Guo Wei</p>

Accurate cell type annotation is fundamental to single-cell analysis, yet remains challenging across heterogeneous datasets and modalities. In particular, transferring labels between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data poses unique difficulties due to discrepancies in sequencing protocols and feature spaces. Existing methods typically handle only a subset of these challenges, often requiring scenario-specific adjustments and offering limited interpretability. Here, we present CellPredX, a structurally unified but adaptively parameterized, semi-supervised cross-modality framework for label transfer across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and cross-protocol datasets. While maintaining a unified model architecture and optimization strategy, CellPredX allows adaptive tuning of loss-weight hyperparameters to account for the varying degree of similarity or discrepancy between different reference–query dataset pairs. CellPredX integrates domain adaptation and deep metric learning to align heterogeneous embeddings, and introduces a sparse center loss with an attention mechanism to enhance discriminative representations while suppressing noise. Moreover, an integrated interpreter module based on gradient attribution enables biological interpretability by identifying key markers and feature dimensions driving model predictions. Through extensive benchmarking across scRNA to scATAC, scATAC to scATAC, and scRNA to scRNA transfers, CellPredX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art annotation methods in both accuracy and robustness. The interpreter module further reveals biologically meaningful marker patterns that are consistent with known cell hierarchies. Together, these results demonstrate that CellPredX provides an interpretable and scalable solution for cross-modality cell type annotation in single-cell multi-omic integration.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The direct pathway from the lateral hypothalamus to the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) includes neurons that express the neuropeptide orexin-A and others that do not. The OB-projecting neurons that do not express orexin-A are located in an area of the lateral hypothalamus known to contain neurons that express the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). We used virally mediated anterograde tract tracing and immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and MCH to demonstrate that the OB is broadly innervated by axon projections from both populations of neurons with expression in each OB layer across the anterior-to-posterior axis and which overlapped with synaptophysin. Both orexin-A and MCH neurons are genetically heterogeneous, with subsets that co-express an isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We used confocal imaging to test whether the projections from orexin-A and MCH neurons to the OB reflect this glutamatergic heterogeneity. The majority of putative orexin-A axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with smaller proportions that co-expressed VGLUT1 or that did not overlap with either VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. In contrast, a smaller proportion of MCH axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with the majority being non-glutamatergic. Therefore, the projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the OB are genetically heterogeneous and include neurons that can release two different neuropeptides. The projections from orexin-A and MCH neuron populations are each genetically heterogeneous, with differing proportions of glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic axon terminals.</p>

                Background Astaxanthin, a red xanthophyll carotenoid, is a powerful antioxidant, anticancer, and glucose and lipid homeostasis regulator. Some pigmented yeasts belonging to the genus Rhodotorula, the well-known yeast for beta-carotene production, have been reported as natural astaxanthin producers. However, the lack of genomic data on astaxanthin-producing strains within these species hinders the identification of biosynthetic routes, molecular characterization of these pathways, and gene editing applications. Methods This study explored the diversity and astaxanthin production capability of cultivable pigmented yeast in flower samples. The astaxanthin production ability was inspected by three consecutive methods, including thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for the preliminary step, followed by quantitative spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for qualitative validation. The draft genome sequence and astaxanthin-producing genes of astaxanthin-producing yeasts were examined. Results Twelve of 23 yeasts from floral samples exhibited natural pigmentation, with colors ranging from pinkish-orange to red, and exhibited the potential for astaxanthin synthesis. These yeasts were Rhodotorula paludigena (three strains) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (nine strains). Among R. mucilaginosa strains, HL26-1 had the greatest astaxanthin content (104.98 ± 0.13 μg/g DCW) and yield (0.9280 ± 0.0012 mg/L). Strain LL69-1 has the greatest astaxanthin content (251.78 ± 0.27 μg/g DCW) and yield (1.8632 ± 0.0023 mg/L) among R. paludigena strains. The 18.78 Mbp R. mucilaginosa HL26-1 genome includes 5,711 protein-coding genes. Conversely, the R. paludigena LL69-1 genome was 20.99 Mbp, encompassing 6,782 predicted genes. A comprehensive investigation of draft genome sequences of these two strains identified CrtE, CrtYB, CrtI, CrtS, and CrtR as potential astaxanthin transcription genes. Conclusion Here, our results highlight the outstanding potential of two naturally pigmented yeasts, R. mucilaginosa HL26-1 and R. paludigena LL69-1, for astaxanthin production. Furthermore, our findings provide information on the whole genome and protein-encoded genes associated with astaxanthin production, which serve as valuable biological resources for various biotechnological applications.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Female urethral adenocarcinoma (FUA) is an exceptionally rare and aggressive malignancy, accounting for less than 0.02% of all cancers in women. Its nonspecific symptoms often lead to delayed diagnosis, with many cases detected at advanced stages. The rarity of FUA, particularly when presenting with a large mass, underscores the challenges in developing standardized treatment protocols. Case Presentation A 65-year-old woman presented with urinary retention. Clinical examination revealed a large mass obstructing the urethral orifice. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a malignant mass involving the entire length of urethra, with no signs of metastasis. Percutaneous cystostomy was performed, and cystoscopy through the cystostomy access revealed tumor infiltration into the anterior bladder wall, approximately 2 cm from the bladder neck. A radical urethrectomy with partial cystectomy and bladder outlet reconstruction was performed via a transurethral approach, with antegrade cystoscopy guidance. The bladder outlet was reconstructed using a segment of the anterior bladder wall to facilitate voiding through the orthotopic site with a Foley catheter. Pathology confirmed pT4 urethral adenocarcinoma with enteric subtype and clear surgical margins. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy was administered. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient was in continuous incontinence status. This condition is expected since the sphincter was also resected during the surgery as the tumor already infiltrated the anterior bladder. But with the use of silicone catheter, we can avoid any leak and patient still can void timely through regularly clamp catheter. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient reported satisfaction with her quality of life and showed no signs of recurrence or metastasis. Conclusion This case highlights the feasibility of bladder-preserving surgical techniques in giant FUA with bladder infiltration. The approach achieved oncological control while maintaining the patient’s quality of life. Bladder outlet reconstruction provided satisfactory functional outcomes and eliminated the need for suprapubic urinary diversion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-1/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Suspected Valentino’s Syndrome mimicking acute appendicitis: a case report and literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Valentino’s Syndrome is a rare affliction caused by the perforation of a peptic ulcer which simulates deviously a picture of acute appendicitis. The diagnosis of this condition is not simple (often intraoperative) and requires a high degree of suspicion. Case presentation A 90-year-old man arrived at the Emergency Room with abdominal pain mainly localized in the right iliac fossa (Blumberg +, McBurney +). The patient had a history of previous perforated peptic ulcer treated with surgery. A diagnosis of suspected perforated acute appendicitis was made based on clinical and radiological findings and the patient underwent urgent surgical intervention. Laparoscopic exploration revealed a picture of diffuse choleperitonitis due to a probable perforation of a duodenal ulcer. Considering the patient’s age and the severity of the clinical and surgical picture, characterized by the presence of indissociable intra-abdominal adhesions, it was decided to forgo further surgical procedures, except drainage of the abdominal cavity and palliative medical treatment, due to a poor prognosis. Conclusion This syndrome, although very rare, should always be suspected in cases of right iliac fossa pain in the presence of certain risk factors for perforated peptic ulcer. Patient’s ethnicity: Italian.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled exoskeleton training on lower-limb functional recovery, psychological outcomes, and neural plasticity in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind pilot trial (ChiCTR2300074503) including 21 patients with SCI. Participants were randomized to a BCI-exoskeleton group (B + E, n = 10) or an exoskeleton-only group (E, n = 11) for lower-limb training. Both groups received conventional rehabilitation plus 30 minutes of training, 6 days per week, for 4 weeks. The primary outcomes were Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI II) scoring. Secondary outcomes included Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III (SCIM III), International Association of Neurorestoratology Spinal Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIFRS), 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Cortical plasticity was assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The B + E group showed a significant improvement in LEMS (<i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas both groups improved in IANR-SCIFRS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The B + E group demonstrated significant within-group gains in walking speed (10MWT, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and endurance (6MWT, <i>p</i> = 0.031), although between-group differences were not significant. Compared with the E group, the B + E group had larger reductions in HADS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.003). EEG analyses revealed stronger μ/β desynchronization and increased network efficiency, whereas MRI showed no structural changes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BCI-controlled exoskeleton training enhanced motor function, walking performance, and depressive symptoms more than exoskeleton training alone, likely through cortical reorganization. Extended training may further consolidate these benefits, supporting BCI-exoskeleton integration as a promising rehabilitation strategy for SCI. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-748/v2?src=rss">Analysis of seasonal changes in vegetation cover in the La Caimanera marsh (Colombia) using remote sensing and satellite sensor imagery [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Mangroves are ecosystems that link freshwater, land, and oceans. They are also home to vast biodiversity of species and provide vital resources to many coastal communities worldwide. However, in various parts of the world, these natural ecosystems have been subjected to anthropogenic actions that compromise their subsistence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse seasonal changes in vegetation cover in the La Caimanera marsh (Colombia) using remote sensing and satellite sensor imagery. Methodologically, machine learning techniques were used, including semi-supervised and supervised learning, using Landsat, Copernicus, and Planet images. The influence of mangrove vegetation cover on pollutants was explored using remote sensing data and in-situ measurements. The results obtained indicated that in 2015 and 2024, the ecosystem showed stability, with slight reductions in mangrove cover and water bodies. In contrast, a slight increase in urbanized areas was also evident. The NDWI, MNDWI, OC3, and QAA spectral indices were used to monitor water dynamics and water quality. The results reflected stability in water conditions between 2010 and 2020, with a slight reduction in 2023. The increase in chlorophyll-a and reduction in turbidity in 2023 showed alterations in water quality. In addition, the predominance of mature mangrove trees, which comprised 83% of the vegetation, is noteworthy, reflecting a healthy and stable ecosystem. The greater density and homogeneity of the mangrove canopy observed in this study suggests a positive ecosystem response and greater resilience to past environmental changes. It is concluded that the changes experienced by the La Caimanera marsh reflect a balance between conservation and development, highlighting the effectiveness of territorial management policies implemented to maintain the ecosystem’s resilience in the face of human pressures.

                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) has had a major impact on neuroscience. In this review I use LTP citations from PubMed and LTP publications from the Web of Science to analyze the fascinating history of research on LTP. Interest gradually grew from a prolonged delay after its discovery, to its meteoric rise and mature growth, and finally to a recent steep decline. While such rise and fall is not unique in science, the sharpness and magnitude of the swings in LTP are unusually dramatic. I discuss factors that contributed to each phase and point to key developments that led to the inflection points, at times using my own work as illustrations. I call attention to several factors that contributed to the decline in interest and conclude that LTP is to a great extent a victim of its own success. Much of the community now accepts that LTP and CaMKII are the cellular and molecular underpinning of memory. However, a broad shift toward “systems neurosciences” has deflected attention away from crucial cellular and molecular issues still unaddressed in LTP. This neglect is regrettable and unwarranted. Neuroscience doesn't have to choose between mechanisms and behavior, and I describe two somewhat overlooked examples where notable progress is being made in combining the two approaches. Countless exciting opportunities exist for further advances along these lines.</p>

                A recent comparative transcriptomics study by Liu et al. highlights that conserved neuronal identity and synaptic gene expression in the superior colliculus of mice, tree shrews, and humans coexist with species-specific differences in primary cilia. These findings indicate that conserved circuit architecture is accompanied with specializations in signaling compartments that modulate circuit function.

                Dereddi, Djannatian, and colleagues show that oligodendrocytes use mechanical cues to measure axon size. The stretch-activated channel TMEM63A converts membrane tension into calcium signals, which calibrate myelin sheath growth via MYO5A-dependent Mbp mRNA transport. Loss of TMEM63A causes mis-sizing of myelin sheaths and hypomyelination linked to transient infantile leukodystrophy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103788">Differential destinations, dynamics, and functions of high- and low-order features in the feedback signal during object processing</a></h4>

              
                Brain is a hierarchical information processing system, in which the feedback signals from high-level to low-level regions are critical. The feedback signals may convey complex high-order features (e.g. category, identity) and simple low-order features (e.g. orientation, spatial frequency) to sensory cortex to interact with the feedforward information, but how these types of feedback information are represented and how they differ in facilitating visual processing remains unclear. The current study used the peripheral object discrimination task, 7T fMRI, and MEG to isolate feedback from feedforward signals in human early visual cortex. The results showed that feedback signals conveyed both low-order features natively encoded in early visual cortex and high-order features generated in high-level regions, but with different spatial and temporal properties. The high-order feedback information targeted both superficial and deep layers, whereas the low-order feedback information reached only deep layers in V1. In addition, MEG results revealed that the feedback information from occipitotemporal to early visual cortex emerged around 200 ms after stimulus onset, and only the representational strength of high-order feedback information was significantly correlated with behavioral performance. These results indicate that the complex and simple components of feedback information play different roles in predictive processing mechanisms to facilitate sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105029">Deletion of the moeA gene in Flavobacterium IR1 drives structural color shift from green to blue and alters polysaccharide metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Structural colors (SC), generated by light interacting with nano-structured materials, are responsible for the brightest and most vivid coloration in nature. Despite being widespread within the tree of life, there is little knowledge of the genes involved. Partial exceptions are some <i>Flavobacteriia</i> in which genes involved in a number of pathways, including gliding motility and polysaccharide metabolism, have been linked to SC. A previous genomic analysis of SC and non-SC bacteria suggested that the pterin pathway is involved in the organization of bacteria to form SC. Here, we focus on <i>moe</i>A, a molybdopterin molybdenum transferase. When this gene was deleted from <i>Flavobacterium</i> IR1, the knock-out mutant showed a strong blue shift in SC of the colony compared to the wild-type. The <i>moe</i>A mutant showed a particularly strong blue shift when grown on kappa-carrageenan and was upregulated for starch degradation. To further analyze the molecular changes, proteomic analysis was performed, showing the upregulation of various polysaccharide utilization loci, which supported the link between <i>moe</i>A and polysaccharide metabolism in SC. Overall, we demonstrated that a targeted approach, modifying a single gene identified by genomics, could change the optical properties of bacteria.

">Building neuroanatomical resources for three-spined sticklebacks: Brain areas important for social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Three-spined stickleback fish are famous for their diversity and charismatic social behavior. However, there are few neuroanatomical resources for studying the neural and brain mechanisms underlying their fascinating behavior. Methods and Results: We identify 11 brain areas important for social behavior by referencing brain atlases for six other teleost fishes. Brain regions were identified via neuroanatomical landmarks and we characterized the presence / absence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key gene product of the dopaminergic system, in those regions. Comparing the neuroanatomical location of these regions in the stickleback brain and the expression of TH therein to that of other fish species highlights similarities and differences and the need for a brain atlas specific to sticklebacks. This resource serves as a map of the location of regions important for social behavior in the stickleback brain. Conclusion: This resource will help guide future studies connecting gene function to social behavior through the brain and will enable future work to understand the evolution of neural mechanisms that contribute to the diversity of social behavior in this emerging model organism.

">Presynaptic NMDA receptors on mouse mossy fiber terminals mediate rapid BDNF release by ketamine and hydroxynorketamine</a></h4>

              
                Enhancement of neuronal plasticity is a key determinant of the onset of antidepressant responses. Because brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent synaptic plasticity is essential for antidepressant efficacy, we examined whether fast-acting antidepressants directly trigger BDNF release. At antidepressant-relevant concentrations, ketamine and its metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) induced BDNF secretion from mossy fiber terminals of granule neurons within minutes of application in rat hippocampal cultures. BDNF release required selective NMDAR signaling, as conditional genetic deletion of presynaptic NMDARs from granule neurons or from postsynaptic NMDARs from CA3 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, abolished BDNF exocytosis in response to both ketamine and HNK or selectively to HNK, respectively. Both compounds produced acute synaptic plasticity, reflected by gains and losses of CA3 dendritic spines without a net change in overall spine density. These findings reveal distinct, drug-specific NMDAR mechanisms at mossy fiber terminal-CA3 synapses that drive rapid BDNF release by fast-acting antidepressants.

">Dlx2 reprograms the transcriptome and laminar position of glia-derivedAscl1-induced interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Direct lineage reprogramming of glial cells into neurons offers a promising strategy to repair diseased brain circuits, but engineering defined neuronal subtypes remains challenging. We found that a phospho-site-deficient Ascl1 variant, Ascl1SA6, but not wildtype Ascl1, induces hallmarks of parvalbumin fast-spiking interneurons, raising the question of how closely these induced neurons resemble canonical cortical interneurons and what transcriptional events underlie this process. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ascl1SA6-induced neurons only partially recapitulated canonical interneuron programs and failed to induce the transcription factor Dlx2 and its downstream targets. Co-expression of Dlx2 with Ascl1SA6 restored a more canonical interneuron-like transcriptome, including genes involved in migration, and resulted in neurons occupying laminar positions more typical of endogenous interneurons. These findings provide molecular insights into how Ascl1 posttranslational modifications regulate its transcriptional activity and demonstrate a strategy to engineer induced cortical interneurons that more closely resemble their native counterparts, offering a framework for layer-specific restoration of inhibitory circuits in neurological diseases.

">A prelimbic molecular clock of protein synthesis for memory persistence</a></h4>

              
                Emotionally salient associative memories can endure for long periods, yet the mechanisms that determine their long-term stability remain unclear. Here we show that the prelimbic (PL) cortex integrates temporally structured translational programs to control both the consolidation and reconsolidation of cued threat memories. Using Pavlovian threat conditioning with in vivo fiber photometry, we found that PL calcium dynamics tightly track memory strength: discrete threat-predictive cues evoked robust activity during recent and single-timepoint remote retrieval, whereas prior retrieval selectively weakened remote expression, independent of contextual influences. Translational profiling of PL Camk2a cells uncovered a biphasic consolidation program, with an early phase characterized by ER stress-linked translational repression and robust oligodendrocyte plasticity, followed by a delayed phase engaging synaptic growth pathways. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches demonstrated that eIF2-regulated, cap-independent translation is essential for recent consolidation and for the enduring stabilization of remote memory, whereas retrieval-induced destabilization engages a mechanistically distinct, eIF4E-dependent translational pathway required for reconsolidation. These findings identify the PL cortex as a dynamic node in which discrete modes of translational control govern the long-term persistence of emotional memories.

">Associations between habitual light exposure-related behaviors and sleep timing and sleep complaints in an international community sample</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is essential for health and light is an important environmental signal influencing its timing, quality, and regulation. Retinal light exposure reflects the interplay between environmental illumination and behavioral choices, yet it remains unclear which habitual light exposure-related behaviors meaningfully impact sleep outcomes. In this preregistered analysis, we examined associations between these behaviors, sleep timing, and sleep complaints in a large, international community sample (N = 774, mean age = 32.6 {+/-} 14.6 years). Participants completed the Light Exposure Behavior Assessment (LEBA), with four behavioral domains included in the analyses. Sleep timing, sleep disturbances and sleep-related daytime impairment were measured using established questionnaires. Bayesian analyses indicated that time spent outdoors and device use in bed were most strongly associated with sleep outcomes. Greater time outdoors was linked to earlier sleep timing and fewer sleep complaints, whereas more frequent device use in bed was associated with greater sleep disturbance and daytime impairment. Morning and daytime lighting practices and evening light control showed no conclusive evidence. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of everyday light exposure-related behaviors for sleep and support behavioral approaches to promoting healthy sleep in real-world contexts.

">Fidelity of Spatiotemporal Patterns of Brain Activity Across Sampling Rate, Scan Duration, and Frequency Content</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic brain activity is characterized by large-scale spatiotemporal patterns that underpin functional connectivity and cognition. Quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) have emerged as reproducible methods for capturing spatiotemporal network interactions in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). However, these methods remain sensitive to methodological factors such as scan duration, repetition time (TR), and frequency band selection. This study systematically evaluates how these parameters influence the stability and reliability of QPP- and cPCA-derived functional connectivity patterns across multiple datasets. Using five independent rs-fMRI datasets, we evaluate the impact of scan length on pattern reliability, explore the effects of TR on spatiotemporal patterns, and compare the sensitivity of different frequency bands (Slow-5, Slow-4, infraslow) in capturing network dynamics. Our findings reveal that while both QPPs and cPCA detect intrinsic network activity, their reliability varies with acquisition parameters. QPPs exhibit greater stability in shorter scans, making them suitable for individual-level analyses, whereas cPCA provides a broader representation of phase-coherent fluctuations but shows greater between-subject variability and benefits more from longer, group-level acquisitions. Additionally, frequency band selection significantly influences the temporal structure of extracted patterns: in our analyses, Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) tended to emphasize more recurrent, synchronized network configurations, whereas Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) more often revealed transitions between connectivity states. These results provide critical insights into optimizing methodological choices for dynamic functional connectivity analysis, enhancing the interpretability of spatiotemporal patterns in both basic and clinical neuroimaging research.

">Elliptical speech reveals the use of broad phonetic categories aids noise-degraded speech perception</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Speech perception requires that listeners classify sensory information into smaller groupings while also coping with noise that often corrupts the speech signal. The strength of categorization and speech-in-noise (SIN) abilities show stark individual differences. Some listeners perceive speech sounds in a gradient fashion, while others categorize in a discrete/binary manner, favoring fine acoustic details vs. a more abstract phonetic code, respectively. Prior work suggests SIN processing is (i) related to more gradient phonetic perception and (ii) varies with musical training. Method: To further probe relations between perceptual gradiency and noise-degraded listening, we measured phoneme categorization, SIN recognition (QuickSIN), and sentence recognition in listeners with varying musical backgrounds. Categorization was measured for vowels and stops using standard labeling tasks. Speech recognition and discrimination were assessed using 'elliptical speech' sentences that use featural substitutions which renders them meaningless under clean conditions but surprisingly improves their recognition under noise degradation. We hypothesized listeners who use broader perceptual equivalency classes in hearing elliptical speech would show better SIN perception, indicative of a more gradient listening strategy. Results: Listeners perceived elliptical sentences as sounding different than their intact counterparts in the clear but as the same under noise degradation. But this elliptical benefit varied with music background. Nonmusicians showed larger susceptibility and noise-related benefit of ellipses than musicians, consistent with the notion they used broader phonetic categories (i.e., more gradient listening). Elliptical speech perception was also associated with QuickSIN performance in both groups but in opposite ways. Conclusions: Use of broader categories was related to better SIN processing in nonmusicians but poorer SIN processing in musicians. Findings suggest listeners can use broader perceptual equivalence classes to deal with degraded listening situations but this depends critically on their auditory demographics. Nonmusicians might use broader phonetic categories to aid SIN perception while musicians might use narrower categories or otherwise similar speech contexts.

">Spatiotemporally distinctive astrocytic and neuronal responses to repetitive intracortical microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as active modulators of neuronal synaptic transmission. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is widely used to manipulate neuronal activity, yet the accompanying astrocytic responses remain poorly characterized. Using dual-color in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor neurons and astrocytes, we show that ICMS elicits astrocytic activation with spatiotemporal features that diverge from those of neurons. Astrocytes were recruited at stimulation intensities as low as 10A, thresholds sufficient to activate neurons, indicating that astrocytes robustly sense electrical perturbation. Unlike neurons, however, astrocytic responses were spatially heterogeneous and temporally variable across trials. At higher stimulation intensities (>=50A), astrocytic responsiveness, i.e., response peak amplitude, and number of responsive trials, progressively attenuated across repeated trials, in contrast to the stable and consistent neuronal responses. Although neuronally driven, astrocytes exhibited a distinct response profile under the same stimulation parameter, revealing a unique component of electrically evoked cortical activity that underscores the importance of incorporating glial physiology into future neuroprosthetic strategies.

">Autistic Children Show Reduced Activity in Left Superior Temporal Cortex in Response to Social-emotional Meaning in Language</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autistic children often exhibit challenges in social interaction, emotional processing, and language communication. While differences among autistic children in processing non-linguistic social-emotional cues compared to non-autistic pears are well-documented, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of social-emotional meaning conveyed through the language content remain unclear. In non-autistic adults, the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) are sensitive to social-emotional semantics. We investigated whether this neural sensitivity is altered in autistic children. Methods: We recruited 78 children (54 autistic and 24 non-autistic; 68 males, 10 females; mean age 10 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while listening to sentences describing either people in emotional situations (social-emotional sentences) or sentences describing non-human objects, events, or concepts (object sentences). Results: Significant activity was found in the left STG and STS in response to social-emotional sentences across both groups, but the activity was reduced in autistic children compared to non-autistic controls. No significant group difference was found during general auditory or object-sentence processing. The neural activity in the left STG and STS during social-emotional sentence processing was significantly predicted by the degree of autistic social-affective characteristics but was not predicted by general linguistic ability. Conclusions: Autistic children show reduced activity in the left STG and STS compared to non-autistic peers during social-emotional sentence processing. This reduced activity, driven by social-affective characteristics rather than general linguistic ability, may contribute to autistic children's social communication challenges.

">Anxiety Selectively Impairs Reward Learning Under Uncertainty, While N3 Sleep Recalibrates It</a></h4>

              
                Adapting to uncertain environments requires distinguishing stochastic variability from genuine environmental change, yet how anxiety and sleep shape this process remains unclear. Using a probabilistic reversal-learning task that simultaneously manipulated stochasticity and volatility, we show that high trait anxiety selectively impairs reward learning in stable but noisy environments, despite preserved sensitivity to true volatility. Computational modeling revealed that anxious individuals misattribute stochastic fluctuations to environmental change, resulting in elevated reward learning rates and impaired evidence accumulation. In a second experiment combining task performance with overnight sleep EEG, greater N3 sleep was associated with reduced learning rates and improved evidence accumulation. These findings identify a selective computational mechanism underlying anxiety-related learning deficits and suggest N3 sleep as a state-dependent pathway for recalibrating adaptive learning under uncertainty.

">Neural representations of beliefs in a multi-dimensional inference task</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior requires maintaining and updating probabilistic beliefs about the world, yet how distributed brain circuits implement such computations remains unknown. We recorded from over 1,400 neurons across six brain regions in monkeys performing a multi-dimensional inference task requiring them to infer hidden rules through trial-and-error learning. Behavior was well-described by models based on Bayesian updating of beliefs over rule features. Neural representations of both observable variables (stimuli, rewards) and latent beliefs (rule preferences, confidence) were broadly distributed across hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, striatum, and inferior temporal cortex. Belief representations were present throughout all task periods but exhibited region- and epoch-specific dynamics. Critically, trial-to-trial changes in population activity reflected Bayesian belief updating: neural responses evolved according to the integration of prior beliefs with new evidence. Additionally, we identified confidence representations that were independent of specific beliefs and showed distinct temporal profiles. These results demonstrate that probabilistic inference emerges from coordinated dynamics across distributed brain systems, with different regions contributing flexibly according to computational demands at different states of learning and decision-making.

">Attention modulates EEG spectral activity across serial positions</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity has been associated with attentional processes such as task-irrelevant stimulus suppression and orienting. The aim of this study was to understand how spectral activity evolves as words are presented in a word list learning task and as multiple components of attention are engaged under multitasking demands. We recorded scalp EEG in a delayed free-recall task in which participants encoded common noun word lists either under full attention (encoding only) or divided attention (simultaneous target detection task). In the target detection task, participants pressed a response button when a word was paired with a target-colored square but not for words paired with a distractor-colored square (cue condition). Activity in the high gamma frequencies (50-100 Hz) decreased while alpha activity (8-12 Hz) increased throughout word list presentation (i.e., across serial positions), consistent with prior work demonstrating effects of cognitive load on EEG spectral power. Divided attention attenuated this change in gamma power across the list. Cue condition modulated alpha activity evenly across serial positions, with consistently lower power during target trials than distractor trials. Our findings suggest that frequency-specific characteristics of processing during list encoding may reflect multiple components of attention that vary over different time scales. Gamma frequencies capture the interactive effects of cognitive load and dual-task demands, while alpha power separately reflects gradual increases in cognitive load and momentary orienting.
