	<p>Objectives: To study the correlation between positive cochlin tomoprotein testing (CTP), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and the auditory and vestibular function amongst patients with sudden hearing loss. Study Design: Prospective case series. Methods: We prospectively examined eight patients who presented with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) with or without vertigo or tinnitus. We performed an ELISA-based CTP detection test using middle ear lavage samples. In addition to the CTP examination, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed using different sequences (T1 and a T1 sequence with a contrast medium (CM), a T2 sequence, 4 h delayed intravenous gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR)). Results: All patients with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) presented a non-specific contrast enhancement in the cochlea and vestibulum on the affected side on delayed 3D-FLAIR MRI. Four patients had a positive CTP test, suggesting a perilymphatic fistula (PLF). However, no specific MRI signal for a PLF was observed. Conclusions: Using multimodal diagnostic measures, such as CTP testing and different MRI sequences, no correlation could be found in patients with a PLF.</p>

                Background: Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) or Leriche syndrome, is a peripheral artery disease, specifically affecting the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. Presentation of AIOD patients ranged from asymptomatic to having limb-threatening emergencies. Advances and innovations in endovascular devices have replaced surgical approach for AIOD treatment. Here we reported a 52-year-old man presenting with AIOD managed by endovascular approach using kissing stent technique. Case presentation: A 52-year-old man, with history of chronic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, long-standing hypertension, and who was a heavy smoker, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of long time with bilateral claudication and became leg rest pain. He had history of aorto-infrarenal occlusion known from previous percutaneous coronary intervention from right and left femoral artery access. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (TASC II Type D Class) diagnosis was made by lower extremity duplex ultrasound and CT angiography. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with kissing stent technique. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure without any significant complaints, received optimal medical treatment, and was educated about smoking cessation. Conclusion: Treatment of AIOD should include both modification of risk factors and efforts to increase perfusion to the lower extremities. An endovascular approach is an excellent alternative and may replace surgical approach in complex aortoiliac obstructive disease. In this case report, an endovascular approach with kissing stent technique showed good results for the patient.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-745/v1?src=rss">Efficiency of Microorganisms and Effectiveness of Biodegradation Techniques on LDPE Plastics: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The aim of the research was to demonstrate the efficiency of microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques on Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics. The research question was: What is the efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques? Methods The systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Articles were obtained from Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), Embase, and Google Scholar. The DeCS/Mesh search terms were: Low-density polyethylene, efficiency, biodegradation, microbial consortia, fungi, bacteria. Inclusion criteria were: scientific articles that included bacteria, fungi, and microbial consortia reported as LDPE degraders that report the percentage of weight loss; articles published from January 2010 to October 2022, and publications in Spanish and English with open access. Exclusion criteria were: studies that do not report gravimetry, the biodegradation time of LDPE, and the genus or species of the polyethylene-degrading microorganism. Results Out of 483 studies found, 50 were included in this Systematic Review (SR). The most frequent study techniques were scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gravimetry, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and in the case of microorganisms, the most studied belonged to the genus Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Aspergillus. Regarding the isolation place, the most frequent mentioned in the reviewed articles were landfill soil and sanitary landfill soil. The efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms was higher in bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp., which obtained a range of DE of 9.00-70.00%, 24.00-64%, 1.15 – 61.00%, 45.00%, and 1.5-40% with DT of 4-150, 120, 4-150, 30, and 30-120 days, respectively; in the case of fungi, the main microorganisms are Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii with efficiencies of 54.34, 48.78, and 46.34%, in 90 days, respectively; and the most efficient microbial consortia were from Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp. with 38.00 – 81.00%, in 120 days; and, Pseudomonas protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp. with 55. 00 – 75.00% in 120 days. Conclusions The most efficient microorganisms in LDPE degradation are Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp.; in fungi Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii; and in microbial consortia, those formed by Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp., and that of P. protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp.; and the most effective techniques used in LDPE biodegradation are SEM, gravimetry, and FTIR.

                Background Recent innovations are making radiology more advanced for patient and patient services. Under the immense burden of radiology practice, Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in obtaining Computed Tomography (CT) images with less scan time, proper patient placement, low radiation dose (RD), and improved image quality (IQ). Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the positioning accuracy, RD, and IQ of AI-based automatic and manual positioning techniques for CT kidney ureters and bladder (CT KUB). Methods This prospective study included 143 patients in each group who were referred for computed tomography (CT) KUB examination. Group 1 patients underwent manual positioning (MP), and group 2 patients underwent AI-based automatic positioning (AP) for CT KUB examination. The scanning protocol was kept constant for both the groups. The off-center distance, RD, and quantitative and qualitative IQ of each group were evaluated and compared. Results The AP group (9.66±6.361 mm) had significantly less patient off-center distance than the MP group (15.12±9.55 mm). There was a significant reduction in RD in the AP group compared with that in the MP group. The quantitative image noise (IN) was lower, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the AP group than in the MP group (p<0.05). Qualitative IQ parameters such as IN, sharpness, and overall IQ also showed significant differences (p< 0.05), with higher scores in the AP group than in the MP group. Conclusions The AI-based AP showed higher positioning accuracy with less off-center distance (44%), which resulted in 12% reduction in RD and improved IQ for CT KUB imaging compared with MP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-744/v1?src=rss">Teacher attributes as predictors of assessment practices in public universities of Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education teachers dwell on various classroom assessment practices. Their assessment practices play a significant part of the teaching learning process and in determining student achievement. In this respect, their different attributes determine the nature of their classroom assessment practices. This cross-sectional survey study aimed to examine differences in assessment practices among public university teachers with respect to their academic status, teaching experience, assessment training and specializations. Methods The study adopted Assessment Practices Inventory (API) which was distributed to a sample of 380 randomly selected teachers from four public universities. The majorities (93.4%) of questionnaires which were properly completed were entered to SPSS version 25 software and used for analysis. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used for analysis and Pillai’s Trace was utilized for interpretation of the results. Results The results showed that academic status (P= .000); teaching experience (P = .000); and assessment training (P =.030) had significant differences for the combined dependent variables (assessment practice). However, field of specialization (P =.130) did not show significant difference in the overall assessment practice although differences were observed in assessment design and interpretation. Conclusion Academic status, teaching experience, and assessment training are important attributes of teachers that shape their assessment practices. Therefore, as teachers hold the sole responsibility of classroom assessment, training and development courses in assessment, experience sharing and learning opportunities are necessary regardless of their specializations, academic status, and teaching experience.

                Abstract* Background Attachment style and object relation maturity have been linked to patterns of relating to others and mental health outcomes. However, little research has tested how these processes relate or the level of unique variance they each account for in outcomes. This study aimed to explore these issues. Methods A sample of n = 77 adults completed self-report scales of attachment style, splitting and dyadic splitting tendencies and mental distress (measured via the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) scales). Questionnaires were completed online. Results The results suggested that anxious attachment and tendency towards splitting were related to higher levels of mental distress. Splitting was positively related to attachment anxiety and avoidance. However, a series of mediation models (testing the relationship between splitting and mental health, mediated by attachment avoidance and anxiety) suggested that anxious attachment did not predict unique variance in distress. Splitting remained related to mental distress but was not mediated by anxious or avoidant attachment styles. Conclusions The findings point towards potential links between two distinct aspects of systems that influence relating and psychological wellbeing. They also suggested that addressing both aspects will be beneficial in helping clients improve their relationships and well-being.

                Background The objective was to investigate the impact of physical activity (PA) teaching and learning approaches in healthcare professionals (HCPs) education on PA-related knowledge, confidence, and behaviour. Methods Eligible experimental studies investigated the effect of interventions that incorporate PA in to the undergraduate and postgraduate education, and continuous professional development of any HCP (medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc.) on PA-related outcomes including knowledge, perceptions, and confidence to prescribe PA. Six databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, Medline, and SPORTDiscus) were searched from inception to October 2022. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. A narrative data synthesis was undertaken to assess the overall effectiveness of the reviewed educational interventions: knowledge, perceptions, confidence, attitudes, beliefs, and changes in behaviour/practice. Results A total of 32 studies comprising 3,256 participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The most frequently employed learning approach in eligible studies was training workshops (n=13), followed by experiential learning (n=4). Half of the studies included knowledge as an outcome (n=16) and 10 studies each included a measure of confidence and changes in behaviour/practice. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=7), showed no improvement in any measure of knowledge, confidence, or behaviour. Two RCTs reported beneficial effects of experiential learning on confidence and perceived behavioural control. In non-randomised studies, training workshops and didactic input with and without simulated e-learning led to statistical improvements in knowledge, confidence, perceived competence, and attitudes. Discussion Most of the eligible studies lacked an adequate sample size, and, in many cases, there was a high loss to follow up which represents a threat to the internal validity of the studies. We found that a blended approach to teaching and learning supported with experiential or simulated experiences to improve the knowledge, perceived competence, and confidence to prescribe PA.

                Health systems are experiencing increasing pressures worldwide due to heightened service demands, demographic aging, stringent regulations, and economic constraints, making efficiency and efficacy in health management critical aspects. At the heart of this complexity, health managers seek to optimize resources and improve care delivery at a time when the adoption of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), becomes increasingly imperative. This necessity reflects not only the pursuit of innovation but also the urgency to adapt to an ever-evolving environment. However, the effective characterization, availability, and incorporation of these technologies as support tools still represent an emerging challenge that is insufficiently explored in the literature. In response, this project proposes the development of a framework of theoretical and practical guidelines for the implementation and management of digital tools in health systems in the age of AI. Adopting a mixed-methods approach that includes systematic review, analyses of commercial off-the-shelf solutions, and qualitative studies with health managers and practitioners, the aim is to map current technology use, identify gaps and best practices, and provide a guide for future direction. This project also intends to develop in co-creation with professionals in the field to ensure the relevance and practical applicability of the developed guidelines. The results are expected to not only contribute to the scientific literature but also offer an evidence-based guide to optimizing the use of digital technologies in health management, promoting a significant transformation in the development and adoption of innovative digital solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-740/v1?src=rss">Protocol for scoping review: Instruments for assessing vision-specific health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with visual impairment. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Childhood visual impairment (VI) is less common than in adults, but research has demonstrated that it can have significant long-term negative impacts on the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) of children and adolescents. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of vision-specific instruments available for accurately assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI, particularly in resource-limited settings. The objective of this scoping review is to methodically evaluate the evidence pertaining to (1) the accessibility and usage of instruments specifically designed to assess HR-QoL in children and adolescents who have VI, (2) summarise studies on HR-QoL in children and adolescent with VI, and (3) describe the psychometric properties of vision-specific instruments used for assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI. The review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guideline (2020) for scoping reviews, utilizing frameworks by Arksey and O’Malley, and methodological enhancements suggested by Levac (2010). A systematic search will be performed through various databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost, to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English from inception until 31 December 2023. The EBSCOhost platform will include several databases, such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycINFO, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analysed narratively using QualCoder 1.9 version, and the study’s findings will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The researchers anticipate that the literature will assist in exploring and relating various types of HR-QoL tools used globally. This review’s conclusion will help researchers ascertain research gaps in vision-related QoL instruments based on different economies, countries, and environments. This will further aid researchers in planning and developing tools suitable for African contexts and languages.

We hypothesized that Alzheimer disease pathology is uncommon in MS patients. In 100 MS patients, the rate of amyloid-β plasma biomarker positivity was approximately half the rate in 300 non-MS controls matched on age, sex, apolipoprotein E proteotype, and cognitive status. Interestingly, most MS patients who did have amyloid-β pathology had features atypical for MS at diagnosis.

                Background Healthcare, like other industries, emphasizes performance, quality, and consumer experience while also attempting to reduce costs. However, high-quality healthcare remains paramount for vulnerable and ill patients. This study aimed to investigate parents' and caregivers' level of satisfaction with physiotherapy services provided to neuropediatric outpatients on the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study included 103 parents/caregivers of children with neurological disabilities that were randomly selected from different Emirates Health Services Hospitals in the UAE. Data was collected using the long-form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-III). Results The overall mean satisfaction was 159±7.73 (out of 250 points). Communication (20.36/25), interpersonal factors (20.17/35), and doctor-patient time (20.17/35) had the highest mean satisfaction scores (8.06/10). The lowest mean satisfaction scores were for access/availability/convenience (34.60/60), technical quality (33.17/50), and economic elements (23.83/40). Conclusion Despite participants’ overall satisfaction scores being positive, some service domains require improvement to improve satisfaction, specifically the access/availability/convenience, technical quality, and economic elements. These areas should be prioritized by service providers and managers to improve patients’ experiences and clinical outcomes.

<p>Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the “core” thalamocortical projection to the neocortex in the African elephant. In the elephant and other mammals with unusual skin (such as pachydermatous skin), layer 4 is cytoarchitecturally indistinct, possibly absent, and the thalamocortical input terminates primarily on the neurons forming the inner sublamina of layer 3. Scale bar = 1 mm.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the mammalian cerebral cortex is most often described as a hexalaminar structure, there are cortical areas (primary motor cortex) and species (elephants, cetaceans, and hippopotami), where a cytoarchitecturally indistinct, or absent, layer 4 is noted. Thalamocortical projections from the core, or first order, thalamic system terminate primarily in layers 4/inner 3. We explored the termination sites of core thalamocortical projections in cortical areas and in species where there is no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 using the immunolocalization of vesicular glutamate transporter 2, a known marker of core thalamocortical axon terminals, in 31 mammal species spanning the eutherian radiation. Several variations from the canonical cortical column outline of layer 4 and core thalamocortical inputs were noted. In shrews/microchiropterans, layer 4 was present, but many core thalamocortical projections terminated in layer 1 in addition to layers 4 and inner 3. In primate primary visual cortex, the sublaminated layer 4 was associated with a specialized core thalamocortical projection pattern. In primate primary motor cortex, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was evident and the core thalamocortical projections terminated throughout layer 3. In the African elephant, cetaceans, and river hippopotamus, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was observed and core thalamocortical projections terminated primarily in inner layer 3 and less densely in outer layer 3. These findings are contextualized in terms of cortical processing, perception, and the evolutionary trajectory leading to an indistinct or absent cortical layer 4.</p>

<p>This study matched physiology and anatomical subregions in the chicken inferior colliculus. We found neural topographies for binaural sound localization cues, but, in contrast to the well-studied barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions. Together with previous work in pigeon and chicken, this suggests a plesiomorphic condition of multisensory integration in the midbrain that is dominated by lateral panoramic vision.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The sound localization behavior of the nocturnally hunting barn owl and its underlying neural computations is a textbook example of neuroethology. Differences in sound timing and level at the two ears are integrated in a series of well-characterized steps, from brainstem to inferior colliculus (IC), resulting in a topographical neural representation of auditory space. It remains an important question of brain evolution: How is this specialized case derived from a more plesiomorphic pattern? The present study is the first to match physiology and anatomical subregions in the non-owl avian IC. Single-unit responses in the chicken IC were tested for selectivity to different frequencies and to the binaural difference cues. Their anatomical origin was reconstructed with the help of electrolytic lesions and immunohistochemical identification of different subregions of the IC, based on previous characterizations in owl and chicken. In contrast to barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions. We found neural topographies for both binaural cues but no evidence for a coherent representation of auditory space. The results are consistent with previous work in pigeon IC and chicken higher-order midbrain and suggest a plesiomorphic condition of multisensory integration in the midbrain that is dominated by lateral panoramic vision.</p>

   title="Link to external resource: RRID:SCR_017001">RRID:SCR_017001</a>) searching for genes expressed selectively throughout the adult mouse mesocortex (transitional cortex ring predicted within the concentric ring theory of mammalian cortical structure, in contrast with central isocortex [ICx] and peripheral allocortex). We aimed to explore a shared molecular profile selective of all or most mesocortex areas. This approach checks and corroborates the precision of other previous definitory criteria, such as poor myelination and high kainate receptor level. Another aim was to examine which cortical areas properly belong to mesocortex. A total of 34 positive adult selective marker genes of mesocortex were identified, jointly with 12 negative selective markers, making a total of 46 markers. All of them identify the same set of cortical areas surrounding the molecularly different ICx as well as excluding adjacent allocortex. Four representative mesocortex markers—<i>Crym</i>, <i>Lypd1</i>, <i>Cdh13</i>, and <i>Smoc2</i>—are amply illustrated, jointly with complementary material including <i>myelin basic protein</i>, to check myelination, and <i>Rorb</i>, to check layer 4 presence. The retrosplenial (ReSp) area, long held to be mesocortical, does not share any of the 46 markers of mesocortex and instead expresses <i>Nr4a2</i> and <i>Tshz2</i>, selective parahippocampal allocortex markers. Moreover, it is not hypomyelinic and lacks a <i>Rorb</i>-positive layer 4, aspects generally present in mesocortex. Exclusion of the ReSp area from the mesocortex ring reveals the latter to be closed at this locus instead by two adjacent areas previously thought to be associative visual ICx (reidentified here molecularly as postsplenial and parasplenial mesocortex areas). The concepts of ICx, mesocortex, and parahippocampal allocortex are thus subtly modified by substantial molecular evidence.</p>

     alt="Atypical Course of the Habenulo-Interpeduncular Tract in Chick Embryos"/>
<p>The retroflex tract is a prominent diencephalic landmark in vertebrates but seems absent in adult avian. Here, using BEN immunohistochemistry that specifically identifies fibers of this tract, we study their distribution from the habenular region to the interpeduncular complex. We found that many habenular fibers diverge in an atypical dispersed course through the thalamic cell mass and toward the prethalamic region (top figure). The diagram shows the atypical course of the fibers.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Classical studies of the avian diencephalon hardly mention the habenulo-interpeduncular tract (a.k.a. retroflex tract), although both the habenula (HB) (its origin) and the interpeduncular nuclear complex (its target) are present. Retroflex tract fibers were described at early embryonic stages but seem absent in the adult in routine stains. However, this tract is a salient diencephalic landmark in all other vertebrate lineages. It typically emerges out of the caudal HB, courses dorsoventrally across thalamic alar and basal plates just in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary, and then sharply bends 90° caudalwards at paramedian basal plate levels (this is the “retroflexion”), to approach longitudinally via paramedian pretectum and midbrain the rostralmost hindbrain, specifically the prepontine median interpeduncular complex across isthmus and rhombomere 1. We systematize this habenulo-interpeduncular course into four parts named subhabenular, retrothalamic, tegmental, and interpeduncular. We reexamined the chicken habenulo-interpeduncular fibers at stages HH30 and HH35 (6.5- and 9-day incubation) by mapping them specifically with immunoreaction for BEN protein, a well-known marker. We found that only a small fraction of the stained retroflex tract fibers approaches the basal plate by coursing along the standard dorsoventral pathway in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary. Many other habenular fibers instead diverge into atypical dispersed courses across the thalamic cell mass (implying alteration of the first subhabenular part of the standard course) before reaching the basal plate; this dispersion explains their invisibility. A significant number of such transthalamic habenular fibers cross orthogonally the zona limitans (ZLI) (the rostral thalamic boundary) and invade the caudal alar prethalamus. Here, they immediately descend dorsoventrally, just rostrally to the ZLI, until reaching the prethalamic basal plate, where they bend (retroflex) caudalwards, entering the thalamic basal paramedian area. These atypical fibers gradually fasciculate with the other groups of habenular efferent fibers in their final longitudinal approach to the hindbrain interpeduncular complex. We conclude that the poor visibility of this tract in birds is due to its dispersion into a diversity of atypical alternative routes, though all components eventually reach the interpeduncular complex. This case merits further analysis of the diverse permissive versus nonpermissive guidance mechanisms called into action, which partially correlate distinctly with successive diencephalic, mesencephalic, and hindbrain neuromeric fields and their boundaries.</p>

     alt="Excitatory Projections of Wide Field Collicular Neurons to the Nucleus of the Optic Tract in the Rat"/>
<p>We report a novel class of rat collicular neurons (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) with horizontally oriented and spiny-rich dendrites in the retinorecipient superficial layers of the superior colliculus. This subpopulation of excitatory wide field neurons invariably project to the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT), and some of them express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The superficial layers of the mammalian superior colliculus (SC) contain neurons that are generally responsive to visual stimuli but can differ considerably in morphology and response properties. To elucidate the structure and function of these neurons, we combined extracellular recording and juxtacellular labeling, detailed anatomical reconstruction, and ultrastructural analysis of the synaptic contacts of labeled neurons, using transmission electron microscopy. Our labeled neurons project to different brainstem nuclei. Of particular importance are neurons that fit the morphological criteria of the wide field (WF) neurons and whose dendrites are horizontally oriented. They display a rather characteristic axonal projection pattern to the nucleus of optic tract (NOT); thus, we call them superior collicular WF projecting to the NOT (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) neurons. We corroborated the morphological characterization of this neuronal type as a distinct neuronal class with the help of unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. Our ultrastructural data demonstrate that SCWF<sub>NOT</sub> neurons establish excitatory connections with their targets in the NOT. Although, in rodents, the literature about the WF neurons has focused on their extensive projection to the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, as a conduit for information to reach the visual association areas of the cortex, our data suggest that this subclass of WF neurons may participate in the optokinetic nystagmus.</p>

                E. Courvan et al. show that hypoxia and inflammatory signals synergize to induce rapid transcriptome turnover in macrophages. Using TimeLapse-seq to measure transcript degradation rates and gene expression simultaneously, they find that inflammation generates a distinct hypoxic state with characteristic signaling output, decreased ECM component production, and increased ribosome biosynthesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93079">The breath shape controls intonation of mouse vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Intonation in speech is the control of vocal pitch to layer expressive meaning to communication, like increasing pitch to indicate a question. Also, stereotyped patterns of pitch are used to create distinct sounds with different denotations, like in tonal languages and, perhaps, the 10 sounds in the murine lexicon. A basic tone is created by exhalation through a constricted laryngeal voice box, and it is thought that more complex utterances are produced solely by dynamic changes in laryngeal tension. But perhaps, the shifting pitch also results from altering the swiftness of exhalation. Consistent with the latter model, we describe that intonation in most vocalization types follows deviations in exhalation that appear to be generated by the re-activation of the cardinal breathing muscle for inspiration. We also show that the brainstem vocalization central pattern generator, the iRO, can create this breath pattern. Consequently, ectopic activation of the iRO not only induces phonation, but also the pitch patterns that compose most of the vocalizations in the murine lexicon. These results reveal a novel brainstem mechanism for intonation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94608">Perceptual error based on Bayesian cue combination drives implicit motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor system can recalibrate itself without our conscious awareness, a type of procedural learning whose computational mechanism remains undefined. Recent findings on implicit motor adaptation, such as over-learning from small perturbations and fast saturation for increasing perturbation size, challenge existing theories based on sensory errors. We argue that perceptual error, arising from the optimal combination of movement-related cues, is the primary driver of implicit adaptation. Central to our theory is the increasing sensory uncertainty of visual cues with increasing perturbations, which was validated through perceptual psychophysics (Experiment 1). Our theory predicts the learning dynamics of implicit adaptation across a spectrum of perturbation sizes on a trial-by-trial basis (Experiment 2). It explains proprioception changes and their relation to visual perturbation (Experiment 3). By modulating visual uncertainty in perturbation, we induced unique adaptation responses in line with our model predictions (Experiment 4). Overall, our perceptual error framework outperforms existing models based on sensory errors, suggesting that perceptual error in locating one’s effector, supported by Bayesian cue integration, underpins the sensorimotor system’s implicit adaptation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92993">Involvement of TRPV4 in temperature-dependent perspiration in mice</a></h4>

              
                Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (ANO1) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84798">Hsp47 promotes biogenesis of multi-subunit neuroreceptors in the endoplasmic reticulum</a></h4>

              
                Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) deficiency is an important contributing factor to neurological and metabolic diseases. However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates the folding and assembly of multi-subunit membrane proteins is poorly understood. Previous proteomics studies identified Hsp47 (Gene: <i>SERPINH1</i>), a heat shock protein in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, as the most enriched interacting chaperone for gamma-aminobutyric type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors. Here, we show that Hsp47 enhances the functional surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in rat neurons and human HEK293T cells. Furthermore, molecular mechanism study demonstrates that Hsp47 acts after BiP (Gene: <i>HSPA5</i>) and preferentially binds the folded conformation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors without inducing the unfolded protein response in HEK293T cells. Therefore, Hsp47 promotes the subunit-subunit interaction, the receptor assembly process, and the anterograde trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Overexpressing Hsp47 is sufficient to correct the surface expression and function of epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variants in HEK293T cells. Hsp47 also promotes the surface trafficking of other Cys-loop receptors, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and serotonin type 3 receptors in HEK293T cells. Therefore, in addition to its known function as a collagen chaperone, this work establishes that Hsp47 plays a critical and general role in the maturation of multi-subunit Cys-loop neuroreceptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95727">An atlas of brain-bone sympathetic neural circuits in mice</a></h4>

              
                There is clear evidence that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates bone metabolism. Histological studies show abundant SNS innervation of the periosteum and bone marrow-these nerves consist of noradrenergic fibers that immunostain for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta hydroxylase, or neuropeptide Y. Nonetheless, the brain sites that send efferent SNS outflow to bone have not yet been characterized. Using pseudorabies (PRV) viral transneuronal tracing, we report, for the first time, the identification of central SNS outflow sites that innervate bone. We find that the central SNS outflow to bone originates from 87 brain nuclei, sub-nuclei and regions of six brain divisions, namely the midbrain and pons, hypothalamus, hindbrain medulla, forebrain, cerebral cortex, and thalamus. We also find that certain sites, such as the raphe magnus (RMg) of the medulla and periaqueductal gray (PAG) of the midbrain, display greater degrees of PRV152 infection, suggesting that there is considerable site-specific variation in the levels of central SNS outflow to bone. This comprehensive compendium illustrating the central coding and control of SNS efferent signals to bone should allow for a greater understanding of the neural regulation of bone metabolism, and importantly and of clinical relevance, mechanisms for central bone pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89903">Essential function of transmembrane transcription factor MYRF in promoting transcription of miRNA lin-4 during C. elegans development</a></h4>

              
                Precise developmental timing control is essential for organism formation and function, but its mechanisms are unclear. In <i>C. elegans</i>, the microRNA <i>lin-4</i> critically regulates developmental timing by post-transcriptionally downregulating the larval-stage-fate controller LIN-14. However, the mechanisms triggering the activation of <i>lin-4</i> expression toward the end of the first larval stage remain unknown. We demonstrate that the transmembrane transcription factor MYRF-1 is necessary for <i>lin-4</i> activation. MYRF-1 is initially localized on the cell membrane, and its increased cleavage and nuclear accumulation coincide with <i>lin-4</i> expression timing. MYRF-1 regulates <i>lin-4</i> expression cell-autonomously and hyperactive MYRF-1 can prematurely drive <i>lin-4</i> expression in embryos and young first-stage larvae. The tandem <i>lin-4</i> promoter DNA recruits MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> to form visible loci in the nucleus, suggesting that MYRF-1 directly binds to the <i>lin-4</i> promoter. Our findings identify a crucial link in understanding developmental timing regulation and establish MYRF-1 as a key regulator of <i>lin-4</i> expression.

">Mesolimbic local field potentials are modulated by motor control</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: While historically cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops were believed to process limbic and sensorimotor data in parallel, there is now evidence to suggest that the two information streams can be processed in a single open loop. However, the limbic-motor interface remains insufficiently characterized. We sought to further investigate how extrastriatal regions may regulate motor output by examining electrophysiological activity in these areas during a response inhibition paradigm. Methods: We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from epilepsy patients implanted with intracranial depth electrodes for seizure localization purposes. Participants performed the stop-signal task, during which they made speeded choice reactions to go stimuli and occasionally inhibited their reactions in the incident of a stop signal. To compare power during movement and the absence of movement, we applied a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Additionally, we performed a linear mixed-effects model to relate power in limbic regions to power in the motor cortex. Finally, we implemented exploratory analyses to identify power differences for correct go versus correct stop trials and for correct stop versus incorrect stop trials using cluster-based permutation testing. Results: 14 patients participated. A comparison between movement and baseline fixation revealed that motor response is associated with reduced beta (15-35 Hz) power in the amygdala, hippocampus, and motor cortex and reduced gamma (35-100 Hz) power in the amygdala and hippocampus. Moreover, average beta and gamma power in the amygdala and hippocampus during motor execution were positively associated with average beta and gamma power in the motor cortex. Additionally, we identified significant differences between correct go and stop trials in delta (1-4 Hz) power for all three regions and in theta (4-8 Hz) power for the amygdala and motor cortex. Likewise, we identified significant differences between correct and incorrect stop trials in delta power for the hippocampus and motor cortex, in theta power for the motor cortex, in alpha (8-15 Hz) and beta power for the amygdala and motor cortex, and in gamma power for all three areas. Discussion: These correlations between neural oscillations in the hippocampus and amygdala and movement strengthen the notion of mesolimbic modulation of motor activity.

">Linking functional and structural brain organisation with behaviour in healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Multimodal data integration approaches, such as Linked Independent Component Analysis (LICA), increase sensitivity to brain-behaviour relationships and allow us to probe the relationship between modalities. Here we focus on inter-regional functional and structural organisation to determine if organisational patterns persist across modalities and if investigating multi-modality organisations provides increased sensitivity to brain-behaviour associations. We utilised multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; T1w, resting-state functional [fMRI] and diffusion weighted [DWI]) and behavioural data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, n=676; 51% female). Unimodal features were extracted to produce individual grey matter density maps, probabilistic tractography connectivity matrices and connectopic maps from the T1w, DWI and fMRI data, respectively. DWI and fMRI analyses were restricted to subcortical regions for computational reasons. LICA was then used to integrate features, generating 100 novel independent components. Associations between these components and demographic/behavioural (n=308) variables were examined. 15 components were significantly associated with various demographic/behavioural measures. 2 components were strongly related to various measures of intoxication, driven by DWI and resemble components previously identified. Another component was driven by striatal functional data and related to working memory. A small number of components showed shared variance between structure and function but none of these displayed any significant behavioural associations. Our working memory findings provide support for the use of fMRI connectopic mapping in future research of working memory. Given the lack of behaviourally relevant shared variance between functional and structural organisation, as indexed here, we question the utility of integrating connectopic maps and tractography data.

                Auditory-motor synchronization with musical rhythm may extend beyond overt body movements like fingers, hands, or feet. In four experiments with 123 young non-musicians, we demonstrated that spontaneous eye blinks can robustly track musical beats. Participants listened to Bach chorales with regular beat rates while their eye movements were monitored. The blinking rate consistently aligned with the beat rate across various tempi and independent of melodic cues. Blinking showed selective tuning to different beat phases, with inhibition immediately before beat onset and increased blinking afterward. EEG recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink and neural beat tracking. Mechanistically, this synchronization reflects dynamic auditory attention and temporal modulation of visual sampling. Our findings introduce 'eye tapping,' where eye blinks track musical beats, expanding the behavioral repertoire of auditory-motor synchronization during music listening. This highlights the intricate relationship between music perception and peripheral oculomotor activity, enriching our understanding of cross-modal active sensing.

                Accurate quantification of tau binding from 18F-PI-2620 PET requires kinetic modeling and an input function. Here, we implemented a non-invasive Image-derived input function (IDIF) derived using the state-of-the-art total-body uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner to quantify tau binding and tracer delivery rate from 18F-PI-2620 in the brain. Additionally, we explored the impact of scan duration on the quantification of kinetic parameters. Total-body PET dynamic data from 15 elderly participants were acquired. Time-activity curves from the grey matter regions of interest (ROIs) were fitted to the two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) using a subject-specific IDIF derived from the descending aorta. ROI-specific kinetic parameters were estimated for different scan durations ranging from 10 to 90 minutes. Logan graphical analysis was also used to estimate the total distribution volume (VT). Differences in kinetic parameters were observed between ROIs, including significant reduction in tracer delivery rate (K1) in the medial temporal lobe. All kinetic parameters remained relatively stable after the 60-minute scan window across all ROIs, with K1 showing high stability after 30 minutes of scan duration.

">Complement C5a receptor 1 blockade reverses cognitive deficits following cranialradiation therapy for brain cancer</a></h4>

              
                Cranial radiation therapy (RT) for brain cancers leads to an irreversible decline in cognitive function without an available remedy. Radiation-induced cognitive deficits (RICD) are particularly a pressing problem for the survivors of pediatric and low grade glioma (LGG) patients who often live long post-RT. Radiation-induced elevated neuroinflammation and gliosis, triggered by the detrimental CNS complement cascade, lead to excessive synaptic and cognitive loss. Using intact and brain cancer-bearing mouse models, we now show that targeting anaphylatoxin complement C5a receptor (C5aR1) is neuroprotective against RICD. We used a genetic knockout, C5aR1 KO mouse, and a pharmacologic approach, employing the orally active, brain penetrant C5aR1 antagonist PMX205, to reverse RICD. Irradiated C5aR1 KO and WT mice receiving PMX205 showed significant neurocognitive improvements in object recognition memory and memory consolidation tasks. C5aR1 inhibition reduced microglial activation, astrogliosis, and synaptic loss in the irradiated brain. Importantly, C5aR1 inhibition in the syngeneic, orthotopic astrocytoma, and glioblastoma-bearing mice protected against RICD without interfering with the therapeutic efficacy of RT to reduce tumor volume in vivo. PMX205 is currently in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Thus, C5aR1 inhibition is a translationally feasible approach to address RICD, an unmet medical need.

">3D directional tuning in the orofacial sensorimotor cortex during natural feeding and drinking</a></h4>

              
                Directional tongue movements are essential for vital behaviors, such as feeding and speech, to position food for chewing and swallowing safely and to position the tongue for accurate sound production. While directional tuning has been well-studied in the arm region of the sensorimotor cortex during reaching tasks, little is known about how 3D tongue direction is encoded in the orofacial region during natural behaviors. Understanding how tongue direction is represented in the brain has important implications for improving rehabilitation for people with orolingual dysfunctions. The goal of this study is to investigate how 3D direction of tongue movement is encoded in the orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMCx) during feeding and drinking, and how this process is affected by the loss of oral sensation. Using biplanar video-radiography to track implanted markers in the tongue of behaving non-human primates (Macaca mulatta), 3D positional data was recorded simultaneously with spiking activity in primary motor (MIo) and somatosensory (SIo) areas of the orofacial cortex using chronically implanted microelectrode arrays. In some sessions, tasks were preceded by bilateral nerve block injections to the sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve. Modulation to the 3D tongue direction was found in a majority of MIo but not SIo neurons during feeding, while the majority of neurons in both areas were modulated to the direction of tongue protrusion during drinking. Following sensory loss, the proportion of directionally tuned neurons decreased and shifts in the distribution of preferred direction were observed in OSMCx neurons. Overall, we show that 3D directional tuning of MIo and SIo to tongue movements varies with behavioral tasks and availability of sensory information.

">TDP43 autoregulation gives rise to shortened isoforms that are tightly controlled by both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear RNA-binding protein TDP43 is integrally involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Previous studies uncovered N-terminal TDP43 isoforms that are predominantly cytosolic in localization, highly prone to aggregation, and enriched in susceptible spinal motor neurons. In healthy cells, however, these shortened (s)TDP43 isoforms are difficult to detect in comparison to full-length (fl)TDP43, raising questions regarding their origin and selective regulation. Here, we show that sTDP43 is created as a byproduct of TDP43 autoregulation and cleared by nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD). The sTDP43-encoding transcripts that escape NMD can lead to toxicity but are rapidly degraded post-translationally. Circumventing these regulatory mechanisms by overexpressing sTDP43 results in neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo via N-terminal oligomerization and impairment of flTDP43 splicing activity, in addition to RNA binding-dependent gain-of-function toxicity. Collectively, these studies highlight endogenous mechanisms that tightly regulate sTDP43 expression and provide insight into the consequences of aberrant sTDP43 accumulation in disease.

">Differential Aging Effects on Implicit and Explicit Sensorimotor Learning</a></h4>

              
                Deterioration in motor control is a hallmark of aging, significantly contributing to a decline in quality of life. More controversial is the question of whether and how aging impacts sensorimotor learning. We hypothesized that the inconsistent picture observed in the current literature can be attributed to at least two factors. First, aging studies tend to be underpowered. Second, the learning assays used in these experiments tend to reflect, to varying degrees, the operation of multiple learning processes, making it difficult to make inferences across studies. We took a two-pronged approach to address these issues. We first performed a meta-analysis of the sensorimotor adaptation literature focusing on outcome measures that provide estimates of explicit and implicit components of adaptation. We then conducted two well-powered experiments to re-examine the effect of aging on sensorimotor adaptation, using behavioral tasks designed to isolate explicit and implicit processes. Convergently, both approaches revealed a striking dissociation: Older individuals exhibited a marked impairment in their ability to discover an explicit strategy to counteract a visuomotor perturbation. However, they exhibited enhanced implicit recalibration. We hypothesize that the effect of aging on explicit learning reflects an age-related decline in reasoning and problem solving, and the effect of aging on implicit learning reflects age-related changes in multisensory integration. Taken together, these findings deepen our understanding of the impact of aging on sensorimotor learning.

">Lack of Synergistic Outcomes with Roflumilast Combined with Levetiracetam or Adipose Stem Cell Secretome After Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                The Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) pathophysiology is highly complex, contributing to a poor prognosis and lack of effective treatments. Previously, we demonstrated that Roflumilast (Rof), leads to functional recovery when tested in a SCI contusion model. However, it is unlikely that Rof treatment on its own could fully restore the spinal cord. Therefore, our objective was to scrutinize the synergistic effects of combining Rof with neuroprotective approaches. Herein we tested two therapies, firstly, Rof combined with Levetiracetam (Lev), and in a second phase, the complementary interplay between Rof and Adipose Stem Cells secretome (Sec). We induced SCI using a weight drop trauma model at the T8 level. Functional recovery was assessed according to the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale, Activity Box Test, Motor Swimming Test, and Von Frei test. Results indicate that the unilateral use of Rof, Lev, or Sec was effective in promoting functional recovery. However, the combination of Rof + Lev or Rof + Sec did not lead to an improvement in functional outcomes when compared to standalone treatments. Moreover, the combination of Rof + Sec actually led to worst functional outcome than the single treatments. Further studies are needed to find a combinatorial treatment that can lead to superior therapeutic effects with potential clinical application.

">Reciprocal interactions between CA1 pyramidal and axo-axonic cells control sharp wave-ripple events</a></h4>

              
                Excitation and inhibition compete to organize spike timing of pyramidal cells (PYR) in CA1 during network events, including sharp wave-ripples (SPW-R). Specific cellular-synaptic sources of inhibition in SPW-R remain unclear, as there are >60 types of GABAergic interneurons in CA1. Axo-axonic cells (AAC) are defined by their synaptic targeting of the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells, potently controlling spike output. The impact of AAC activity on SPW-R is controversial, due mainly to ambiguity of AAC identification. Here we monitored and manipulated opto-tagged AACs in behaving mice using silicon probe recordings. We found a large variability of AAC neurons, varying from enhanced to suppressed spiking during SPW-Rs, in contrast to the near-uniform excitation of other parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. AACs received convergent monosynaptic inputs from local pyramidal cell assemblies, which strongly influenced their participation in SPW-Rs. Optogenetic silencing of AACs increased power and duration of SPW-Rs, recruiting a greater number of PYR, suggesting AACs control SPW-R dynamics. We hypothesize that lateral inhibition by reciprocal PYR-AAC interactions thus supports the organization of cell assemblies in SPW-R.

">An Intra-brainstem Circuit for Pain-induced Inhibition of Itch</a></h4>

              
                Pain and itch are unpleasant and distinct sensations that give rise to behaviors such as reflexive withdrawal and scratching in humans and mice. Interestingly, it has been observed that pain modulate itch through the neural circuits housed in the brain and spinal cord. However, we are yet to fully understand the identities of and mechanisms by which specific neural circuits mediate pain-induced modulation of itch. Independent studies indicate that brainstem nuclei such as the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are important for the suppression of itch by painful stimuli. Here, using mouse and viral genetics, rabies tracing, chemogenetics, and calcium imaging, we show that the synaptic connections between LPBN and RVM plays an instrumental role in the interactions between pain and itch. Notably, we found that the LPBN neurons that express the gene encoding the substance P receptor, Tacr1 (LPBNTacr1), synapse onto Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons (RVMTacr1). The RVMTacr1 neurons were found to be nociceptive, sufficient for inhibiting itch, and necessary for pain-induced itch suppression. Moreover, through brain-wide anterograde and retrograde viral tracing studies, we found that the RVMTacr1 neurons are bidirectionally connected with LPBN, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Thus, together, our data indicate that the RVMTacr1 neurons integrate nociceptive information to mediate itch-induced scratching and can mediate the physiological effects of itch through their downstream targets.

">Redox signaling by hydrogen peroxide modulates axonal microtubule organization and induces a specific phosphorylation signature of microtubule proteins distinct from distress</a></h4>

              
                Many life processes are regulated by physiological redox signals, referred to as oxidative eustress. However, excessive oxidative stress can damage biomolecules and contribute to disease. The neuronal microtubule system is critically involved in axon homeostasis, regulation of axonal transport, and neurodegenerative processes. However, whether and how physiological redox signals affect axonal microtubules is largely unknown. Using live cell imaging and super-resolution microscopy, we show that subtoxic concentrations of the central redox metabolite hydrogen peroxide increase axonal microtubule dynamics, alter the structure of the axonal microtubule array, and affect the efficiency of axonal transport. We report that the mitochondria-targeting antioxidant SkQ1 and the microtubule stabilizer EpoD abolish the increase in microtubule dynamics. We found that oxidative eustress and distress specifically modulate the phosphorylation state of the microtubule system and induce a largely non-overlapping phosphorylation pattern of MAP1B as the main target. Cell-wide phosphoproteome analysis revealed that different signaling pathways are inversely activated by oxidative eustress and distress. Signaling via casein kinase (CK2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK) is activated during eustress and signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase (SGK) is activated during distress. The results suggest that the redox metabolite and second messenger hydrogen peroxide induces rapid and local reorganization of the microtubule array in response to mitochondrial activity or as a messenger from neighboring cells by activating specific signaling cascades.

                Epileptogenesis is the process that leads the brain into epileptic activity. Clinical evidence shows that ~90% of people with epilepsy present rhythmicity in the timing of their seizures presentation. However, whether the circadian clock is a key player during epileptogenesis remains unknown. Here, we triggered epileptogenesis in mice by the intra-amygdala injection of kainic acid and profiled by RNA sequencing their hippocampal diurnal mRNA rhythmicity. We show that epileptogenesis largely reshapes the hippocampal transcriptomic rhythmicity and that the molecular clock machinery is inhibited due to the disruption of the core clock gene Bmal1. We identified relevant dysregulated pathways and their dynamics in epileptogenesis, predicting a key role for microglial-driven neuroinflammation. We predicted the genes that Bmal1 is directly controlling over time. Finally, we sought for translational relevance evidence by performing RNA sequencing in hippocampal samples resected from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) and cross-analyzing datasets.

">Spectrotemporal profiling of ultrasonic vocalizations during neonatal opioid withdrawal reveals a kappa opioid receptor component in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use during pregnancy can lead to negative infant health outcomes, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome(NOWS). NOWS comprises gastrointestinal, autonomic nervous system, and neurological dysfunction that manifest during spontaneous withdrawal. Current treatments involve non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, however, there is no one standardized approach, in part because of variability in NOWS severity. To effectively model NOWS traits in mice, we used a third trimester-approximate opioid exposure paradigm, where neonatal inbred FVB/NJ and outbred Carworth Farms White(CFW) pups were injected twice-daily with morphine(10-15mg/kg, s.c.) or saline(0.9%, 20 ul/g, s.c.) from postnatal day(P) one to P14. We observed reduced body weight gain, hypothermia, thermal hyperalgesia, and increased ultrasonic vocalizations(USVs). Neonatal USVs are emitted exclusively in isolation to communicate distress and thus serve as a model behavior for affective states. On P14, we observed altered USV syllable profiles during spontaneous morphine withdrawal, including an increase in Complex 3 syllables in FVB/NJ females(but not males) and in CFW mice of both sexes. Brainstem transcriptomics revealed an upregulation of the kappa opioid receptor(Oprk1), whose activation has previously been shown to contribute to withdrawal-induced dysphoria. Treatment with the kappa opioid receptor(KOR) antagonist, nor-BNI(30 mg/kg, s.c.), significantly reduced USV emission in FVB/NJ females, but not FVB/NJ males during spontaneous morphine withdrawal. Furthermore, treatment with the KOR agonist, U50,488h(0.625 mg/kg, s.c.), was sufficient to increase USV emission on P10(both sexes) and on P14(females only) in FVB/NJ mice. Together, these results indicate a female-specific recruitment of the dynorphin/KOR system in neonatal opioid withdrawal symptom severity.

">IGF-1 Acts through Kiss1-expressing Cells to Influence Metabolism and Reproduction</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Kisspeptin, encoded by the Kiss1 gene, ties puberty and fertility to energy status; however, the metabolic factors that control Kiss1-expressing cells need to be clarified. Methods: To evaluate the impact of IGF-1 on the metabolic and reproductive functions of kisspeptin producing cells, we created mice with IGF-1 receptor deletion driven by the Kiss1 promoter (IGF1RKiss1 mice). Previous studies have shown IGF-1 and insulin can bind to each other's receptor, permitting IGF-1 signaling in the absence of IGF1R. Therefore, we also generated mice with simultaneous deletion of the IGF1R and insulin receptor (IR) in Kiss1-expressing cells (IGF1R/IRKiss1 mice). Results: Loss of IGF1R in Kiss1 cells caused stunted body length. In addition, female IGF1RKiss1 mice displayed lower body weight and food intake plus higher energy expenditure and physical activity. This phenotype was linked to higher proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression and heightened brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Male IGF1RKiss1 mice had mild changes in metabolic functions. Moreover, IGF1RKiss1 mice of both sexes experienced delayed puberty. Notably, male IGF1RKiss1 mice had impaired adulthood fertility accompanied by lower gonadotropin and testosterone levels. Thus, IGF1R in Kiss1-expressing cells impacts metabolism and reproduction in a sex-specific manner. IGF1R/IRKiss1 mice had higher fat mass and glucose intolerance, suggesting IGF1R and IR in Kiss1-expressing cells together regulate body composition and glucose homeostasis. Conclusions: Overall, our study shows that IGF1R and IR in Kiss1 have cooperative roles in body length, metabolism, and reproduction.

">Adult-neurogenesis allows for representational stability and flexibility in early olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                In the early olfactory system, adult-neurogenesis, a process of neuronal replacement results in the continuous reorganization of synaptic connections and network architecture throughout the animal's life. This poses a critical challenge: How does the olfactory system maintain stable representations of odors and therefore allow for stable sensory perceptions amidst this ongoing circuit instability? Utilizing a detailed spiking network model of early olfactory circuits, we uncovered dual roles for adult-neurogenesis: one that both supports representational stability to faithfully encode odor information and also one that facilitates plasticity to allow for learning and adaptation. In the main olfactory bulb, adult-neurogenesis affects neural codes in individual mitral and tufted cells but preserves odor representations at the neuronal population level. By contrast, in the olfactory piriform cortex, both individual cell responses and overall population dynamics undergo progressive changes due to adult-neurogenesis. This leads to representational drift, a gradual alteration in sensory perception. Both processes are dynamic and depend on experience such that repeated exposure to specific odors reduces the drift due to adult-neurogenesis; thus, when the odor environment is stable over the course of adult-neurogenesis, it is neurogenesis that actually allows the representations to remain stable in piriform cortex; when those olfactory environments change, adult-neurogenesis allows the cortical representations to track environmental change. Whereas perceptual stability and plasticity due to learning are often thought of as two distinct, often contradictory processing in neuronal coding, we find that adult-neurogenesis serves as a shared mechanism for both. In this regard, the quixotic presence of adult-neurogenesis in the mammalian olfactory bulb that has been the focus of considerable debate in chemosensory neuroscience may be the mechanistic underpinning behind an array of complex computations.

">Dynamic functional connectivity correlates of trait mindfulness in early adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Trait mindfulness, the tendency to attend to present-moment experiences without judgement, is negatively correlated with adolescent anxiety and depression. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying trait mindfulness may inform the neural basis of psychiatric disorders. However, few studies have identified brain connectivity states that correlate with trait mindfulness in adolescence, nor have they assessed the reliability of such states. Methods: To address this gap in knowledge, we rigorously assessed the reliability of brain states across 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan from 106 adolescents aged 12 to 15 (50% female). We performed both static and dynamic functional connectivity analyses and evaluated the test-retest reliability of how much time adolescents spent in each state. For the reliable states, we assessed associations with self-reported trait mindfulness. Results: Higher trait mindfulness correlated with lower anxiety and depression symptoms. Static functional connectivity (ICCs from 0.31-0.53) was unrelated to trait mindfulness. Among the dynamic brains states we identified, most were unreliable within individuals across scans. However, one state, an hyperconnected state of elevated positive connectivity between networks, showed good reliability (ICC=0.65). We found that the amount of time that adolescents spent in this hyperconnected state positively correlated with trait mindfulness. Conclusions: By applying dynamic functional connectivity analysis on over 100 resting-state fMRI scans, we identified a highly reliable brain state that correlated with trait mindfulness. The brain state may reflect a state of mindfulness, or awareness and arousal more generally, which may be more pronounced in those who are higher in trait mindfulness.

">Building a small brain with a simple stochastic generative model</a></h4>

              
                The architectures of biological neural networks result from developmental processes shaped by genetically encoded rules, biophysical constraints, stochasticity, and learning. Understanding these processes is crucial for comprehending neural circuits' structure and function. The ability to reconstruct neural circuits, and even entire nervous systems, at the neuron and synapse level, facilitates the study of the design principles of neural systems and their developmental plan. Here, we investigate the developing connectome of C. elegans using statistical generative models based on simple biological features: neuronal cell type, neuron birth time, cell body distance, reciprocity, and synaptic pruning. Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally-observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Validation of our model's predictions of the synaptic connections using multiple reconstructions of adult worms suggests that our model identified the fundamental"backbone" of the connectivity graph. The accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.

                Parkinson's Disease (PD) develops unilaterally, which may be related to brain hemispheric differences in gene expression. Here we measured bulk RNA-seq levels in neuronal nuclei obtained from prefrontal cortex postmortem brain samples from males and females with PD and from healthy controls. Left and right hemispheres from each brain were related the side of symptom onset and compared. We employed two a priori approaches; first we identified genes differentially expressed between PD and controls and between left vs right PD brain hemispheres. Second, we examined the presence of, and correlates to, variable asymmetry seen in candidate PD differentially expressed genes. We found large variation among individuals with PD, and PD stratification by gene expression similarity was required for patterns of genetic asymmetry to emerge. For a subset of PD brains, hemispherical variation of CCT and BEX gene levels correlated with the side of PD symptom onset.

                An automated ultra-microtome capable of sectioning thousands of ultrathin sections onto standard TEM slot grids was developed and used to section: a complete Drosophila melanogaster first-instar larva, three sections per grid, into 4,866 34-nm-thick sections with a cutting and pickup success rate of 99.74%; 30 microns of mouse cortex measuring roughly 400 um x 2000 um at 40 nm per slice; and a full adult Drosophila brain and ventral nerve column into 9,300 sections with a pickup success rate of 99.95%. The apparatus uses optical interferometers to monitor a reference distance between the cutting knife and multiple sample blocks. Cut sections are picked up from the knife-boat water surface while they are still anchored to the cutting knife. Blocks without embedded tissue are used to displace tissue-containing sections away from the knife edge so that the tissue regions end up in the grid slot instead of on the grid rim.

                Microgliosis and astrogliosis characteristically occur at A{beta} plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients although the impact of gliosis in AD is poorly understood. We studied the impact of A{beta}-induced gliosis using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived 3D neurospheres (hiNS), containing only astrocytes and neurons versus hiNS with the addition of iPSC-derived microglia (hiMG). Applying A{beta} to hiNS containing only astrocytes and neurons triggered pathological features of AD including plaque-like aggregates, reactive astrocytes, oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction and cell death. In contrast, when hiMG were combined with hiNS, infiltrating hiMG effectively phagocytose A{beta} and facilitate neuroprotection. Our findings further support a pivotal role for microglia in modulating astrocyte A{beta} responses by inducing AD-associated gene expression in astrocytes, including the upregulation of APOE, crucial for A{beta} clearance. This model, highlighting the neuroprotective potential of microglia-astrocyte interactions, offers a novel platform for exploring AD mechanisms and novel therapeutic strategies.

">Rhythmic modulation of subthalamo-pallidal interactions depends on synaptic rewiring through inhibitory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic stimulation offers a paradigm to modulate brain oscillations and, therefore, influence brain function. A growing body of evidence indicates that reciprocal interactions between the neurons of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus externus (GPe) play a central role in the emergence of abnormal synchronous beta (15-30 Hz) oscillations in Parkinson's disease (PD). The proliferation of inhibitory GPe-to-STN synapses following dopamine loss exacerbates this pathological activity. Rhythmic modulation of the STN and/or GPe, for example, by deep brain stimulation (DBS), can restore physiological patterns of activity and connectivity. Here, we tested whether dual targeting of STN-GPe by rhythmic stimulation can modulate pathologically strong GPe-to-STN synapses through inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP). More specifically, we examined how time-shifted paired stimuli delivered to the STN and GPe can lead to inter-population synaptic rewiring. To that end, we first theoretically analysed the optimal range of stimulation time shift and frequency for effective synaptic rewiring. Then, as a minimal model for generating subthalamo-pallidal oscillations in healthy and PD conditions, we considered a biologically inspired STN-GPe loop comprised of conductance-based spiking neurons. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, rhythmic stimulation with appropriate time shift and frequency modified GPe-to-STN interactions through iSTDP, i.e., by long-lasting rewiring of pathologically strong synaptic connectivity. This ultimately caused desynchronising after-effects within each population such that excessively synchronous beta activity in the PD state was suppressed, resulting in a decoupling of the STN-GPe network and restoration of healthy dynamics in the model. Decoupling effects of the dual STN-GPe stimulation can be realised by time-shifted continuous and intermittent stimuli, as well as monopolar and bipolar simulation waveforms. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of neuroplasticity in shaping long-lasting stimulation effects and may contribute to the optimisation of a variety of multi-site stimulation paradigms aimed at reshaping dysfunctional brain networks by targeting plasticity.

">Sleep homeostasis in a naturalistic setting</a></h4>

              
                Sleep, especially NREM sleep depth is homeostatically regulated, as sleep pressure builds up during wakefulness and diminishes during deep sleep. Previous evidence from this phenomenon, however, mainly stems from experimental studies which may not generalize to an ecologically valid setting. In the current study, we used a dataset of 246 individuals sleeping for at least seven nights each with a mobile EEG headband according to their ordinary daily schedule to investigate the effect of time spent in wakefulness on sleep characteristics. Increased time in wakefulness prior to sleep was associated with decreased sleep onset latency, increased sleep efficiency, a larger percentage of N3 sleep, and higher delta activity. Moreover, increased sleep pressure resulted in an increase in both the slope and the intercept of the sleep EEG spectrum. As predicted, PSD effects were most prominent in the earliest hours of sleep. Our results demonstrate that experimental findings showing increased sleep depth after extended wakefulness generalize to ecologically valid settings, and that time spent awake is an important determinant of sleep characteristics on the subsequent night. Our findings are evidence for the efficacy of sleep restriction, a behavioral technique already widely used in clinical settings, as a simple but powerful method to improve the objective quality of sleep in those with sleep problems.

">Exploring Comorbidity Networks in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Subjects through Graph Theory: A Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems Study</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are characterized by myriad comorbidities that affect the functioning of the affected individuals. The comorbidities that TBI subjects experience span a wide range, ranging from psychiatric diseases to those that affect the various systems of the body. This is compounded by the fact that the problems that TBI subjects face could span over an extended period post-primary injury. Further, no drug exists to prevent the spread of secondary injuries after a primary impact. In this study, we employed graph theory to understand the patterns of comorbidities after mild TBIs. Upon application of network analysis and a novel clustering algorithm, we discovered interesting associations between comorbidities in young and old subjects with the condition. Specifically, bipolar disorder was seen as related to cardiovascular comorbidities, a pattern that was observed only in the young subjects. Similar associations between obsessive-compulsive disorder and rheumatoid arthritis were observed in young subjects. Psychiatric comorbidities exhibited differential associations with non-psychiatric comorbidities depending on the age of the cohort. The study results might have implications for effective surveillance and the management of comorbidities post mild TBIs.

">Load-dependent and load-independent effects on longitudinal motor training in human continuous hand movements</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning involves complex interactions between the cognitive and sensorimotor systems, which is susceptible to different levels of task load. While the mechanism underlying load-dependent regulations in cognitive functions has been extensively investigated, their influence on downstream execution in motor skill learning remains less understood. The current study extends the understanding of how load levels affect motor learning by a longitudinal functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study in which 30 participants (15 females) engaged in extensive practice on a two-dimensional continuous hand tracking task with varying task difficulties. We propose the index of difficulty (ID) as a quantitative estimate of task difficulty, which is positively correlated with psychometric measure of subjective workload level. Results shows that as behavioral performance improved over time, participants adopted a direction-specific and load-independent (i.e., consistent across different load levels) control strategy, shifting from feedback-dominant to feedforward-dominant control in the vertical direction as training progressed. Crucially, we provide robust evidence of the learning-induced alteration in load-dependent cortical activation patterns, suggesting that effective motor skill learning may lead to shift towards an inverted-U relationship between activation and load level in the pre-motor and supplementary motor areas. In addition, brain-behavior relationship in the frontoparietal network was strengthened after training. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the learning-induced plasticity in brain and behavior associated with load-dependent and load-independent contributions to motor skill learning.

">Parallel Synapses with Transmission Nonlinearities Enhance Neuronal Classification Capacity</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neurons often establish multiple synaptic contacts with the same postsynaptic neuron. To avoid functional redundancy of these parallel synapses, it is crucial that each synapse exhibits distinct computational properties. Here we model the current to the soma contributed by each synapse as a sigmoidal transmission function of its presynaptic input, with learnable parameters such as amplitude, slope, and threshold. We evaluate the classification capacity of a neuron equipped with such nonlinear parallel synapses, and show that with a small number of parallel synapses per axon, it substantially exceeds that of the Perceptron. Furthermore, the number of correctly classified data points can increase superlinearly as the number of presynaptic axons grows. When training with an unrestricted number of parallel synapses, our model neuron can effectively implement an arbitrary aggregate transmission function for each axon, constrained only by monotonicity. Nevertheless, successful learning in the model neuron often requires only a small number of parallel synapses. We also apply these parallel synapses in a feedforward neural network trained to classify MNIST images, and show that they can increase the test accuracy. This demonstrates that multiple nonlinear synapses per input axon can substantially enhance a neuron's computational power.

">Immune Checkpoint Inhibition-related Neuroinflammation Disrupts Cognitive Function</a></h4>

              
                Combinatorial blockade of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) significantly improve the progression-free survival of individuals with metastatic cancers, including melanoma. In addition to unleashing anti-tumor immunity, combination immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) disrupts immune-regulatory networks critical for maintaining homeostasis in various tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Although ICI- and cancer-related cognitive impairments (CRCI) in survivors are increasingly becoming evident, our understanding of ICI-induced immune-related adverse effects (IREA) in the CNS remains incomplete. Here, our murine melanoma model reveals that combination ICI impairs hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as memory consolidation processes. Mechanistically, combination ICI disrupted synaptic integrity, and neuronal plasticity, reduced myelin, and further predisposed CNS for exaggerated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Combination ICI substantially altered both lymphoid and myeloid cells in the CNS. Neurogenesis was unaffected, however, microglial activation persisted for two-months post-ICI, concurrently with cognitive deficits, which parallels clinical observations in survivors. Overall, our results demonstrate that blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 alters neuro-immune homeostasis and activates microglia, promoting long-term neurodegeneration and driving cognitive impairments. Therefore, limiting microglial activation is a potential avenue to mitigate CNS IRAE while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of rapidly evolving ICIs and their combinations.

	<p>The differential diagnosis between atypical Parkinsonian syndromes may be challenging and critical. We aimed to proposed a radiomics-guided deep learning (DL) model to discover interpretable DL features and further verify the proposed model through the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes. We recruited 1495 subjects for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) scanning, including 220 healthy controls and 1275 patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (IPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Baseline radiomics and two DL models were developed and tested for the Parkinsonian diagnosis. The DL latent features were extracted from the last layer and subsequently guided by radiomics. The radiomics-guided DL model outperformed the baseline radiomics approach, suggesting the effectiveness of the DL approach. DenseNet showed the best diagnosis ability (sensitivity: 95.7%, 90.1%, and 91.2% for IPD, MSA, and PSP, respectively) using retained DL features in the test dataset. The retained DL latent features were significantly associated with radiomics features and could be interpreted through biological explanations of handcrafted radiomics features. The radiomics-guided DL model offers interpretable high-level abstract information for differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian disorders and holds considerable promise for personalized disease monitoring.</p>

                Objective The study investigates the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and assess whether women with PCOS are at a higher susceptibility and risk for COVID-19 complications. Methods This review analyzes articles indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library, focusing on the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 1, 2019, until November 1, 2022. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the NIH quality assessment tool. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023371956) on January 12, 2023. Results A total of 11 observational studies were identified, totaling 22,155 PCOS patients. Despite the heterogeneity of the included studies, the findings of most of the studies were similar in terms of increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection in PCOS patients. PCOS patients were reported to have a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-PCOS women (HR =1.51). Many causes have been identified to play a role, most notably the overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and elevated levels of RAS-associated proteins, decreased serum levels of neuropilin-1 (sNRP1), elevated serum biomarkers such as platelet degranulation and coagulation cascade markers increased acute phase response, and lower levels of vitamin D could render PCOS patients susceptible to a chronic inflammatory state, which can also lead to difficulties and severe consequences, when impacted by COVID-19. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic also influenced psychological well-being, with an increase in the incidence and severity of depression and anxiety among PCOS patients in the COVID-19 pandemic era compared to healthy individuals. Conclusions Patients with PCOS are more likely to get infected with COVID-19 and display a higher affinity to severe infections and complications due to overlapping and confounding factors. These findings suggest that PCOS patients may need more medical attention when infected with COVID-19.

                <p>Phospholipids (PLs) are asymmetrically distributed at the plasma membrane. This asymmetric lipid distribution is transiently altered during calcium-regulated exocytosis, but the impact of this transient remodeling on presynaptic function is currently unknown. As phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) randomizes PL distribution between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane in response to calcium activation, we set out to determine its role in neurotransmission. We report here that PLSCR1 is expressed in cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) and that PLSCR1-dependent phosphatidylserine egress occurred at synapses in response to neuron stimulation. Synaptic transmission is impaired at GrC <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> synapses, and both PS egress and synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis are inhibited in <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cultured neurons from male and female mice, demonstrating that PLSCR1 controls PL asymmetry remodeling and SV retrieval following neurotransmitter release. Altogether, our data reveal a novel key role for PLSCR1 in SV recycling and provide the first evidence that PL scrambling at the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for optimal presynaptic performance.</p>

                <p>Sex differences have complicated our understanding of the neurobiological basis of many behaviors that are key for survival. As such, continued elucidation of the similarities and differences between sexes is necessary to gain insight into brain function and vulnerability. The connection between the hippocampus (Hipp) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial site where modulation of neuronal activity mediates reward-related behavior. Our previous work demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) of Hipp-&gt;NAc synapses is rewarding, and mice can establish learned associations between LTP of these synapses and the contextual environment in which LTP occurred. Here, we investigated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying Hipp-&gt;NAc LTP using whole-cell electrophysiology and pharmacology. We observed similarities in basal synaptic strength between males and females and found that LTP occurs postsynaptically with similar magnitudes in both sexes. However, key sex differences emerged as LTP in males required NMDA receptors (NMDAR), whereas LTP in females utilized an NMDAR-independent mechanism involving L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) and estrogen receptor &alpha; (ER&alpha;). We also uncovered sex-similar features as LTP in both sexes depended on CaMKII activity and occurred independently of dopamine-1 receptor (D1R) activation. Our results have elucidated sex-specific molecular mechanisms for LTP in an integral pathway that mediates reward-related behaviors, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a variable in mechanistic studies. Continued characterization of sex-specific mechanisms underlying plasticity will offer novel insight into the neurophysiological basis of behavior, with significant implications for understanding how diverse processes mediate behavior and contribute to vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>The semantic knowledge stored in our brains can be accessed from different stimulus modalities. For example, a picture of a cat and the word "cat" both engage similar conceptual representations. While existing research has found evidence for modality-independent representations, their content remains unknown. Modality-independent representations could be semantic, or they might also contain perceptual features. We developed a novel approach combining word/picture cross-condition decoding with neural network classifiers that learned latent modality-independent representations from MEG data (25 human participants, 15 females, 10 males). We then compared these representations to models representing semantic, sensory, and orthographic features. Results show that modality-independent representations correlate both with semantic and visual representations. There was no evidence that these results were due to picture-specific visual features or orthographic features automatically activated by the stimuli presented in the experiment. These findings support the notion that modality-independent concepts contain both perceptual and semantic representations.</p>

                <p>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) acts via its sole receptor MCHR1 in rodents and is an important regulator of homeostatic behaviors like feeding, sleep, and mood to impact overall energy balance. The loss of MCH signaling by MCH or MCHR1 deletion produces hyperactive mice with increased energy expenditure, and these effects are consistently associated with a hyperdopaminergic state. We recently showed that MCH suppresses dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which principally receives dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the mechanisms underlying MCH-regulated dopamine release are not clearly defined. MCHR1 expression is widespread and includes dopaminergic VTA cells. However, as the VTA is a neurochemically diverse structure, we assessed <I>Mchr1</I> gene expression at glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic VTA cells and determined if MCH inhibited the activity of VTA cells and/or their local microcircuit. <I>Mchr1</I> expression was robust in major VTA cell types, including most dopaminergic (78%) or glutamatergic cells (52%) and some GABAergic cells (38%). Interestingly, MCH directly inhibited dopaminergic and GABAergic cells but did not regulate the activity of glutamatergic cells. Rather, MCH produced a delayed increase in excitatory input to dopamine cells and a corresponding decrease in GABAergic input to glutamatergic VTA cells. Our findings suggested that MCH may acutely suppress dopamine release while disinhibiting local glutamatergic signaling to restore dopamine levels. This indicated that the VTA is a target of MCH action, which may provide bidirectional regulation of energy balance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e1175232024?rss=1">Complexity Matters: Normalization to Prototypical Viewpoint Induces Memory Distortion along the Vertical Axis of Scenes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scene memory is prone to systematic distortions potentially arising from experience with the external world. Boundary transformation, a well-known memory distortion effect along the near-far axis of the three-dimensional space, represents the observer's erroneous recall of scenes&rsquo; viewing distance. Researchers argued that normalization to the prototypical viewpoint with the high-probability viewing distance influenced this phenomenon. Herein, we hypothesized that the prototypical viewpoint also exists in the vertical angle of view (AOV) dimension and could cause memory distortion along scenes&rsquo; vertical axis. Human subjects of both sexes were recruited to test this hypothesis, and two behavioral experiments were conducted, revealing a systematic memory distortion in the vertical AOV in both the forced choice (<I>n</I> = 79) and free adjustment (<I>n</I> = 30) tasks. Furthermore, the regression analysis implied that the complexity information asymmetry in scenes&rsquo; vertical axis and the independent subjective AOV ratings from a large set of online participants (<I>n</I> = 1,208) could jointly predict AOV biases. Furthermore, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (<I>n</I> = 24), we demonstrated the involvement of areas in the ventral visual pathway (V3/V4, PPA, and OPA) in AOV bias judgment. Additionally, in a magnetoencephalography experiment (<I>n</I> = 20), we could significantly decode the subjects&rsquo; AOV bias judgments ~140&nbsp;ms after scene onset and the low-level visual complexity information around the similar temporal interval. These findings suggest that AOV bias is driven by the normalization process and associated with the neural activities in the early stage of scene processing.</p>

                <p>It was proposed that a reorganization of the relationships between cognitive functions occurs in dementia, a vision that surpasses the idea of a mere decline of specific domains. The complexity of cognitive structure, as assessed by neuropsychological tests, can be captured by exploratory graph analysis (EGA). EGA was applied to the neuropsychological assessment of people (humans) with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD; total <I>N</I> = 638). Both sexes were included. In AD, memory scores detach from the other cognitive functions, and memory subdomains reduce their reciprocal relation. SCD showed a pattern of segregated neuropsychological domains, and MCI showed a noisy and less stable pattern. Results suggest that AD drives a reorganization of cognitive functions toward a less-fractionated architecture compared with preclinical conditions. Cognitive functions show a reorganization that goes beyond the performance decline. Results also have clinical implications in test interpretations and usage.</p>

                <p>The canonical visual cycle employing RPE65 as the retinoid isomerase regenerates 11-<I>cis</I>-retinal to support both rod- and cone-mediated vision. Mutations of <I>RPE65</I> are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis that results in rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss of affected patients at an early age. Dark-reared <I>Rpe65<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mouse has been known to form isorhodopsin that employs 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal as the photosensitive chromophore. The mechanism regulating 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal synthesis and the role of the endogenous 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal in cone survival and function remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that ablation of fatty acid transport protein-4 (FATP4), a negative regulator of 11-<I>cis</I>-retinol synthesis catalyzed by RPE65, increased the formation of 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal, but not 11-<I>cis</I>-retinal, in a light-independent mechanism in both sexes of RPE65-null <I>rd</I>12 mice. Both <I>rd</I>12 and <I>rd</I>12;<I>Fatp4<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice contained a massive amount of all-<I>trans</I>-retinyl esters in the eyes, exhibiting comparable scotopic vision and rod degeneration. However, expression levels of M- and S-opsins as well as numbers of M- and S-cones surviving in the superior retinas of <I>rd</I>12;<I>Fatp4<sup>&ndash;/</sup></I><sup>&ndash;</sup> mice were at least twofold greater than those in age-matched <I>rd</I>12 mice. Moreover, FATP4 deficiency significantly shortened photopic <I>b</I>-wave implicit time, improved M-cone visual function, and substantially deaccelerated the progression of cone degeneration in <I>rd</I>12 mice, whereas FATP4 deficiency in mice with wild-type <I>Rpe65</I> alleles neither induced 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal formation nor influenced cone survival and function. These results identify FATP4 as a new regulator of synthesis of 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal, which is a "cone-tropic" chromophore supporting cone survival and function in the retinas with defective RPE65.</p>

                <p>The intricate relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and visual contrast detection variability has been the focus of numerous studies. However, the causal impact of prestimulus alpha traveling waves on visual contrast detection remains largely unexplored. In our research, we sought to discern the causal link between prestimulus alpha traveling waves and visual contrast detection across different levels of mental fatigue. Using electroencephalography alongside a visual detection task with 30 healthy adults (13 females; 17 males), we identified a robust negative correlation between prestimulus alpha forward traveling waves (FTWs) and visual contrast threshold (VCT). Inspired by this correlation, we utilized 45/&ndash;45&deg; phase-shifted transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in a sham-controlled, double-blind, within&ndash;subject experiment with 33 healthy adults (23 females; 10 males) to directly modulate these alpha traveling waves. After the application of 45&deg; phase-shifted tACS, we observed a substantial decrease in FTW and an increase in backward traveling waves, along with a concurrent increase in VCT, compared with the sham condition. These changes were particularly pronounced under a low fatigue state. The findings of state-dependent tACS effects reveal the potential causal role of prestimulus alpha traveling waves in visual contrast detection. Moreover, our study highlights the potential of 45/&ndash;45&deg; phase-shifted tACS in cognitive modulation and therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>Aberrant condensation and localization of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) fused in sarcoma (FUS) occur in variants of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Changes in RBP function are commonly associated with changes in axonal cytoskeletal organization and branching in neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we asked whether branching defects also occur in vivo in a model of FUS-associated disease. We use two reported <I>Xenopus</I> models of ALS/FTD (of either sex), the ALS-associated mutant FUS(P525L) and a mimic of hypomethylated FUS, FUS(16R). Both mutants strongly reduced axonal complexity in vivo. We also observed an axon looping defect for FUS(P525L) in the target area, which presumably arises due to errors in stop cue signaling. To assess whether the loss of axon complexity also had a cue-independent component, we assessed axonal cytoskeletal integrity in vitro. Using a novel combination of fluorescence and atomic force microscopy, we found that mutant FUS reduced actin density in the growth cone, altering its mechanical properties. Therefore, FUS mutants may induce defects during early axonal development.</p>

                <p>While ipsilesional cortical electroencephalography has been associated with poststroke recovery mechanisms and outcomes, the role of the cerebellum and its interaction with the ipsilesional cortex is still largely unknown. We have previously shown that poststroke motor control relies on increased corticocerebellar coherence (CCC) in the low beta band to maintain motor task accuracy and to compensate for decreased excitability of the ipsilesional cortex. We now extend our work to investigate corticocerebellar network changes associated with chronic stimulation of the dentato-thalamo-cortical pathway aimed at promoting poststroke motor rehabilitation. We investigated the excitability of the ipsilesional cortex, the dentate (DN), and their interaction as a function of treatment outcome measures. Relative to baseline, 10 human participants (two women) at the end of 4&ndash;8&nbsp;months of DN deep brain stimulation (DBS) showed (1) significantly improved motor control indexed by computerized motor tasks; (2) significant increase in ipsilesional premotor cortex event-related desynchronization that correlated with improvements in motor function; and (3) significant decrease in CCC, including causal interactions between the DN and ipsilesional cortex, which also correlated with motor function improvements. Furthermore, we show that the functional state of the DN in the poststroke state and its connectivity with the ipsilesional cortex were predictive of motor outcomes associated with DN-DBS. The findings suggest that as participants recovered, the ipsilesional cortex became more involved in motor control, with less demand on the cerebellum to support task planning and execution. Our data provide unique mechanistic insights into the functional state of corticocerebellar-cortical network after stroke and its modulation by DN-DBS.</p>

                <p>Neurons are highly polarized cells that are composed of a single axon and multiple dendrites. Axon&ndash;dendrite polarity is essential for proper tissue formation and brain functions. Intracellular protein transport plays an important role in the establishment of neuronal polarity. However, the regulatory mechanism of polarized transport remains unclear. Here, we show that Rab6, a small GTPase that acts on the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking, plays key roles in neuronal polarization and brain development. Central nervous system-specific Rab6a/b double knock-out (Rab6 DKO) mice of both sexes exhibit severe dysplasia of the neocortex and the cerebellum. In the Rab6 DKO neocortex, impaired axonal extension of neurons results in hypoplasia of the intermediate zone. In vitro, deletion of Rab6a and Rab6b in cultured neurons from both sexes causes the abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) adjacent to the Golgi apparatus, which leads to defects in axonal extension and the loss of axon&ndash;dendrite polarity. Moreover, Rab6 DKO causes significant expansion of lysosomes in the soma in neurons. Overall, our results reveal that Rab6-mediated polarized transport of SVPs is crucial for neuronal polarization and subsequent brain formation.</p>

                <p>We previously showed that orexin neurons are activated by hypoxia and facilitate the peripheral chemoreflex (PCR)-mediated hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), mostly by promoting the respiratory frequency response. Orexin neurons project to the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). The PVN contributes significantly to the PCR and contains nTS-projecting corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons. We hypothesized that in male rats, orexin neurons contribute to the PCR by activating nTS-projecting CRH neurons. We used neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to quantify the degree that hypoxia activates PVN-projecting orexin neurons. We coupled this with orexin receptor (OxR) blockade with suvorexant (Suvo, 20&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) to assess the degree that orexin facilitates the hypoxia-induced activation of CRH neurons in the PVN, including those projecting to the nTS. In separate groups of rats, we measured the PCR following systemic orexin 1 receptor (Ox1R) blockade (SB-334867; 1&nbsp;mg/kg) and specific Ox1R knockdown in PVN. OxR blockade with Suvo reduced the number of nTS and PVN neurons activated by hypoxia, including those CRH neurons projecting to nTS. Hypoxia increased the number of activated PVN-projecting orexin neurons but had no effect on the number of activated nTS-projecting orexin neurons. Global Ox1R blockade and partial Ox1R knockdown in the PVN significantly reduced the PCR. Ox1R knockdown also reduced the number of activated PVN neurons and the number of activated tyrosine hydroxylase neurons in the nTS. Our findings suggest orexin facilitates the PCR via nTS-projecting CRH neurons expressing Ox1R.</p>

                <p>The magnitude of dopamine signals elicited by rewarding events and their predictors is updated when reward value changes. It is actively debated how readily these dopamine signals adapt and whether adaptation aligns with model-free or model-based reinforcement&ndash;learning principles. To investigate this, we trained male rats in a pavlovian-conditioning paradigm and measured dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core in response to food reward (unconditioned stimulus) and reward-predictive conditioned stimuli (CS), both before and after reward devaluation, induced via either sensory-specific or nonspecific satiety. We demonstrate that (1) such devaluation reduces CS-induced dopamine release rapidly, without additional pairing of CS with devalued reward and irrespective of whether the devaluation was sensory-specific or nonspecific. In contrast, (2) reward devaluation did not decrease food reward-induced dopamine release. Surprisingly, (3) postdevaluation reconditioning, by additional pairing of CS with devalued reward, rapidly reinstated CS-induced dopamine signals to predevaluation levels. Taken together, we identify distinct, divergent adaptations in dopamine-signal magnitude when reward value is decreased: CS dopamine diminishes but reinstates fast, whereas reward dopamine is resistant to change. This implies that, respective to abovementioned findings, (1) CS dopamine may be governed by a model-based mechanism and (2) reward dopamine by a model-free one, where (3) the latter may contribute to swift reinstatement of the former. However, changes in CS dopamine were not selective for sensory specificity of reward devaluation, which is inconsistent with model-based processes. Thus, mesolimbic dopamine signaling incorporates both model-free and model-based mechanisms and is not exclusively governed by either.</p>

                <p>Synapsins are highly abundant presynaptic proteins that play a crucial role in neurotransmission and plasticity via the clustering of synaptic vesicles. The synapsin III isoform is usually downregulated after development, but in hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, it persists in adulthood. Mossy fiber boutons express presynaptic forms of short- and long-term plasticity, which are thought to underlie different forms of learning. Previous research on synapsins at this synapse focused on synapsin isoforms I and II. Thus, a complete picture regarding the role of synapsins in mossy fiber plasticity is still missing. Here, we investigated presynaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber boutons by combining electrophysiological field recordings and transmission electron microscopy in a mouse model lacking all synapsin isoforms. We found decreased short-term plasticity, i.e., decreased facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation, but increased long-term potentiation in male synapsin triple knock-out (KO) mice. At the ultrastructural level, we observed more dispersed vesicles and a higher density of active zones in mossy fiber boutons from KO animals. Our results indicate that all synapsin isoforms are required for fine regulation of short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber synapse.</p>

     alt="Emergence of the ZNF675 Gene During Primate Evolution–Influenced Human Neurodevelopment Through Changing HES1 Autoregulation"/>
<p>During primate evolution, structural changes in ZNF675 drove its ability to repress a primate-specific class of transposable elements (TEs) as part of the evolutionary arms race between ZNF genes and TEs. As an evolutionary by-stander effect, ZNF675 also became important for the expression of key neurodevelopmental genes, thereby changing the human neurodevelopmental gene regulatory program.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this study, we investigated recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) in the 19p12 locus, which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The two genes in this locus, <i>ZNF675</i> and <i>ZNF681</i>, arose via gene duplication in primates, and their presence in several pathological CNVs in the human population suggests that either or both of these genes are required for normal human brain development. ZNF675 and ZNF681 are members of the Krüppel-associated box zinc finger (KZNF) protein family, a class of transcriptional repressors important for epigenetic silencing of specific genomic regions. About 170 primate-specific KZNFs are present in the human genome. Although KZNFs are primarily associated with repressing retrotransposon-derived DNA, evidence is emerging that they can be co-opted for other gene regulatory processes. We show that genetic deletion of <i>ZNF675</i> causes developmental defects in cortical organoids, and our data suggest that part of the observed neurodevelopmental phenotype is mediated by a gene regulatory role of ZNF675 on the promoter of the neurodevelopmental gene Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1 (<i>HES1</i>). We also find evidence for the recently evolved regulation of genes involved in neurological disorders, microcephalin 1 and sestrin 3. We show that ZNF675 interferes with HES1 auto-inhibition, a process essential for the maintenance of neural progenitors. As a striking example of how some KZNFs have integrated into preexisting gene expression networks, these findings suggest the emergence of <i>ZNF675</i> has caused a change in the balance of <i>HES1</i> autoregulation. The association of <i>ZNF675</i> CNV with human developmental disorders and ZNF675-mediated regulation of neurodevelopmental genes suggests that it evolved into an important factor for human brain development.</p>

                Background The open field assay is used to study anxiety-related traits and anxiolytic drugs in rodents. This assay entails measuring locomotor activity and time spent in the center of a chamber that is maintained at ambient room temperature. However, the ambient temperature in most laboratories varies daily and seasonally and can differ between buildings. We sought to evaluate how varying ambient temperature and core body temperature (CBT) affected open field locomotor activity and center time of male wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) and Transient Receptor Potential Subfamily M Member 8 (Trpm8) knock-out (Trpm8-/- ) mice. TRPM8 is an ion channel that detects cool temperatures and is activated by icilin. Methods Mice were placed in the open field at 4°C and 23°C for 1 hour. Distance traveled and time spent in the center were measured. Mice were injected with icilin, M8-B, diazepam, or saline, and changes in activity level were recorded. Results The cooling agent icilin increased CBT and profoundly reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to controls. Likewise, cooling the ambient temperature to 4°C reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to Trpm8-/- mice. Conversely, the TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) reduced CBT and increased distance traveled and center time of WT mice when tested at 4°C. The TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) had no effect on CBT or open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. The anxiolytic diazepam reduced CBT in WT and Trpm8-/- mice. When tested at 4°C, diazepam increased distance traveled and center time in WT mice but did not alter open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. Conclusions Environmental temperature and drugs that affect CBT can influence locomotor behavior and center time in the open field assay, highlighting temperature (ambient and core) as sources of environmental and physiologic variability in this commonly used behavioral assay.

                Background Climate change denial (CCD) has been found to be more pronounced among individuals with a conservative political orientation. Terror Management Theory posits that an individual’s worldview serves as a primary defense mechanism in coping with existential threats, such as the reality of climate change. Drawing on these premises, we conducted preliminary research investigating the impact of death priming on CCD from the Terror management theory perspective. Methods and results We administered a death priming task and measured CCD in its immediate wake or following a delay task. We confirmed among 219 Amazon’s MTurk participants that immediately following death priming, CCD was reduced among all participants. In the delayed death priming condition, we acquired preliminary evidence that CCD was heightened among Republican participants. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the relevance of death priming to CCD tendencies and potentially spawn future research regarding CCD as a particular form of coping with existential threats.

                <p>by Shihan Ma, Irene Mendez Guerra, Arnault Hubert Caillet, Jiamin Zhao, Alexander Kenneth Clarke, Kostiantyn Maksymenko, Samuel Deslauriers-Gauthier, Xinjun Sheng, Xiangyang Zhu, Dario Farina</p>

Neuromechanical studies investigate how the nervous system interacts with the musculoskeletal (MSK) system to generate volitional movements. Such studies have been supported by simulation models that provide insights into variables that cannot be measured experimentally and allow a large number of conditions to be tested before the experimental analysis. However, current simulation models of electromyography (EMG), a core physiological signal in neuromechanical analyses, remain either limited in accuracy and conditions or are computationally heavy to apply. Here, we provide a computational platform to enable future work to overcome these limitations by presenting NeuroMotion, an open-source simulator that can modularly test a variety of approaches to the full-spectrum synthesis of EMG signals during voluntary movements. We demonstrate NeuroMotion using three sample modules. The first module is an upper-limb MSK model with OpenSim API to estimate the muscle fibre lengths and muscle activations during movements. The second module is BioMime, a deep neural network-based EMG generator that receives nonstationary physiological parameter inputs, like the afore-estimated muscle fibre lengths, and efficiently outputs motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). The third module is a motor unit pool model that transforms the muscle activations into discharge timings of motor units. The discharge timings are convolved with the output of BioMime to simulate EMG signals during the movement. We first show how MUAP waveforms change during different levels of physiological parameter variations and different movements. We then show that the synthetic EMG signals during two-degree-of-freedom hand and wrist movements can be used to augment experimental data for regressing joint angles. Ridge regressors trained on the synthetic dataset were directly used to predict joint angles from experimental data. In this way, NeuroMotion was able to generate full-spectrum EMG for the first use-case of human forearm electrophysiology during voluntary hand, wrist, and forearm movements. All intermediate variables are available, which allows the user to study cause-effect relationships in the complex neuromechanical system, fast iterate algorithms before collecting experimental data, and validate algorithms that estimate non-measurable parameters in experiments. We expect this modular platform will enable validation of generative EMG models, complement experimental approaches and empower neuromechanical research.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011198">A variational autoencoder trained with priors from canonical pathways increases the interpretability of transcriptome data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bin Liu, Bodo Rosenhahn, Thomas Illig, David S. DeLuca</p>

Interpreting transcriptome data is an important yet challenging aspect of bioinformatic analysis. While gene set enrichment analysis is a standard tool for interpreting regulatory changes, we utilize deep learning techniques, specifically autoencoder architectures, to learn latent variables that drive transcriptome signals. We investigate whether simple, variational autoencoder (VAE), and beta-weighted VAE are capable of learning reduced representations of transcriptomes that retain critical biological information. We propose a novel VAE that utilizes priors from biological data to direct the network to learn a representation of the transcriptome that is based on understandable biological concepts. After benchmarking five different autoencoder architectures, we found that each succeeded in reducing the transcriptomes to 50 latent dimensions, which captured enough variation for accurate reconstruction. The simple, fully connected autoencoder, performs best across the benchmarks, but lacks the characteristic of having directly interpretable latent dimensions. The beta-weighted, prior-informed VAE implementation is able to solve the benchmarking tasks, and provide semantically accurate latent features equating to biological pathways. This study opens a new direction for differential pathway analysis in transcriptomics with increased transparency and interpretability.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002703">Limb-related sensory prediction errors and task-related performance errors facilitate human sensorimotor learning through separate mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anushka Oza, Adarsh Kumar, Apoorva Sharma, Pratik K. Mutha</p>

The unpredictable nature of our world can introduce a variety of errors in our actions, including sensory prediction errors (SPEs) and task performance errors (TPEs). SPEs arise when our existing internal models of limb-environment properties and interactions become miscalibrated due to changes in the environment, while TPEs occur when environmental perturbations hinder achievement of task goals. The precise mechanisms employed by the sensorimotor system to learn from such limb- and task-related errors and improve future performance are not comprehensively understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we performed a series of learning experiments wherein the location and size of a reach target were varied, the visual feedback of the motion was perturbed in different ways, and instructions were carefully manipulated. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms employed to compensate SPEs and TPEs are dissociable. Specifically, our results fail to support theories that suggest that TPEs trigger implicit refinement of reach plans or that their occurrence automatically modulates SPE-mediated learning. Rather, TPEs drive improved action selection, that is, the selection of verbally sensitive, volitional strategies that reduce future errors. Moreover, we find that exposure to SPEs is necessary and sufficient to trigger implicit recalibration. When SPE-mediated implicit learning and TPE-driven improved action selection combine, performance gains are larger. However, when actions are always successful and strategies are not employed, refinement in behavior is smaller. Flexibly weighting strategic action selection and implicit recalibration could thus be a way of controlling how much, and how quickly, we learn from errors.

Ricci, Lucie Etienne</p>

Sterile alpha motif domain-containing proteins 9 and 9-like (SAMD9/9L) are associated with life-threatening genetic diseases in humans and are restriction factors of poxviruses. Yet, their cellular function and the extent of their antiviral role are poorly known. Here, we found that interferon-stimulated human SAMD9L restricts HIV-1 in the late phases of replication, at the posttranscriptional and prematuration steps, impacting viral translation and, possibly, endosomal trafficking. Surprisingly, the paralog SAMD9 exerted an opposite effect, enhancing HIV-1. More broadly, we showed that SAMD9L restricts primate lentiviruses, but not a gammaretrovirus (MLV), nor 2 RNA viruses (arenavirus MOPV and rhabdovirus VSV). Using structural modeling and mutagenesis of SAMD9L, we identified a conserved Schlafen-like active site necessary for HIV-1 restriction by human and a rodent SAMD9L. By testing a gain-of-function constitutively active variant from patients with SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease, we determined that SAMD9L pathogenic functions also depend on the Schlafen-like active site. Finally, we found that the constitutively active SAMD9L strongly inhibited HIV, MLV, and, to a lesser extent, MOPV. This suggests that the virus-specific effect of SAMD9L may involve its differential activation/sensing and the virus ability to evade from SAMD9L restriction. Overall, our study identifies SAMD9L as an HIV-1 antiviral factor from the cell autonomous immunity and deciphers host determinants underlying the translational repression. This provides novel links and therapeutic avenues against viral infections and genetic diseases.

                Background: The aim of the current study was to assess the patients with COVID-19 and the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the course of COVID-19. Methods: This prospective cohort study included patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 between December 2020 and December 2021. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were analysed. Results: 301 participants were enrolled in the study. 46 (15,3%) had moderate, and 162 (53,8%) had severe COVID-19. 14 (4,7%) patients died, and 30 (10,0%) were admitted to the ICU due to disease worsening. The majority needed oxygen therapy (n=224; 74,4%). Average vitamin 25(OH)D3 levels were below optimal at the admittance, and vitamin D deficiency was detected in 205 individuals. More male patients were suffering from vitamin D deficiency. Patients with the more severe disease showed lower levels of vitamin 25(OH)D3 in their blood. The most severe group of patients had more symptoms that lasted significantly longer with progressing disease severity. This group of patients also suffered from more deaths, ICU admissions, and treatments with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and oxygen. Conclusion: Patients with the severe course of COVID-19 were shown to have increased inflammatory parameters, increased mortality, and higher incidence of vitamin D deficiency. The results suggest that the vitamin D deficiency might represent a significant risk factor for a severe course of COVID-19.

                Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a pathogenic bacterium that affects shrimp aquaculture; its infection can lead to severe production losses of up to 90%. On the other hand, plant phenolic compounds have emerged as a promising alternative to combat bacterial infections. The antibacterial and anti-virulence activity of the plant phenolic compounds quercetin, morin, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid against two strains of V. parahaemolyticus (Vp124 and Vp320) was evaluated. Methods: The broth microdilution test was carried out to determine phenolic compounds' antibacterial activity. Moreover, the biofilm-forming ability of V. parahaemolyticus strains in the presence of phenolic compounds was determined by total biomass staining assay using the cationic dye crystal violet. The semisolid agar displacement technique was used to observe the effect of phenolic compounds on the swimming-like motility of V. parahaemolyticus. Results: Results showed that phenolic compounds inhibited both strains effectively, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.8 to 35.03 mM. Furthermore, at 0.125 – 0.5 × MIC of phenolic compounds, V. parahaemolyticus biofilms biomass was reduced by 63.22 – 92.68%. Also, quercetin and morin inhibited the motility of both strains by 15.86 – 23.64% (Vp124) and 24.28 – 40.71% (Vp320). Conclusions: The results suggest that quercetin, morin, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids may be potential agents for controlling V. parahaemolyticus.

                Understanding the nature of life and its propensity for reproduction has long been a question that humans aspire to answer. Reproduction, a defining characteristic of life, fundamentally involves the replication of genetic material, be it DNA or RNA. The driving force behind this replication process has always intrigued scientists. In recent years, theories involving selfish genes, the RNA world, and entropic forces have been proposed by some scholars. These theories seem to suggest that life, as we know it, exists solely in Earth’s environment and is based on a single type of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. However, if we broaden our definition of life to include any replicable molecules, we might be able to transcend traditional thought. This could potentially enhance our understanding of the impetus behind DNA replication and provide deeper insights into the essence of life.

                Background: Several studies have resulted in controversial data about the recurrence or new incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C who were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).   Aim: This observational study aimed to assess the occurrence rate of HCC in patients who developed a sustained virological response (SVR). METHOD:  A six-month prospective study was done at the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute [NHTMRI] in Cairo, Egypt on 150 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their laboratory values to either receive sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (S/D/R) or receive only sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (S/D). The main outcome measure was the occurrence of HCC. Results: SVR-12 was 100%. 8.5% of patients developed HCC in the S/D/R group, while 0% in the S/D group. Conclusion:  New incidence or recurrence of HCC may occur in CHC genotype 4 cirrhotic patients receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (difficult to treat) although achieving SVR. The cause of HCC development in this study is cirrhosis, not the administered DAAs.

                Background Thoracic trauma is defined as a trauma that hits the chest wall directly or indirectly, either as a result of blunt or penetrating trauma. Thoracic trauma can occur in any age or genders, and become a life-threatening if the treatment isn’t immediate and appropriate. Methods This research was an observational study with a cohort retrospective design using secondary data in the form of thoracic trauma patients at The Zainoel Abidin General Hospital, Banda Aceh, Indonesia in the period January 2019-December 2020. The statistical analysis used were chi square for bivariate and multivariate analysis, spesifically logistic regression analysis was conducted to know which risk factor influences the most. Result There were 141 medical records used in this study, thoracic trauma was more common in men compared to women. The age group of 46-55 is the age group with the highest percentage of thoracic trauma patients, road traffic are the leading cause of thoracic trauma where the most common diagnosis is rib fractures. Significant factors that associated with the short outcome of thoracic trauma are thoracic trauma diagnosis (p=0,00), management of thoracic trauma (p=0,00), ventilator (p=0,04), duration of ventilator (p=0.01), sepsis (p=0,00), qSOFA score (p=0,00) and injury severity score (p=0,00). Conclusions Vehicle accidents contributed to a considerable number of traumatic chest injuries in this study. Diagnosis, management of trauma, days of ventilation, qSOFA score, injury severity score, and development of sepsis were associated with the short-term outcome among thoracic trauma patients. Injury severity score seems to be the most influential variable in this study, the lower the better it is. Road safety intervention is urgently needed to control the underlying problems in this study.

                Background As Thailand’s population ages, promoting senior citizens’ quality of life (QoL) is crucial. In 2017, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security launched the “elderly school” initiative to foster lifelong learning and enhance the QoL among senior citizens. However, comprehensive evaluations of its impact on QoL remain limited. Methods This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the policy’s effect on QoL in Phetchabun province, Thailand. Using quota and systematic sampling, 1,374 senior citizens aged 60-80 participated. Propensity score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 match was employed to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of attending the elderly school on QoL. Additionally, multiple linear regression was analyzed to assess the association between QoL and its associated factors. Results PSM were matched successfully, the standardized difference was less than 10 percent, and the baseline after matching indicated balances with 687 elderly people in each group. The mean QoL score of the non-attending group was 44.40 (SD = 7.11), and that of the attending group was 57.50 (SD = 7.53). The ATE for elderly people attending school was 10.67 scores (95% CI: 9.67 – 11.67 scores) higher than those unattended. Being female, having monthly income higher than 20,000, having employment, having a caregiver, and attendance at elderly school were positively associated with QoL, and the standardized beta coefficients were 0.078, 0.059, 0.094, 0.066, and 0.550, respectively. Additionally, higher education was positively associated with higher QoL. Conclusion The elderly school policy significantly enhanced the QoL of the attending senior citizens. Findings suggest continued collaboration among stakeholders to sustain and optimize this policy for improved seniors’ QoL, which has the potential to utilize lifelong learning to create an inclusive framework for healthy aging among senior citizens.

                Background Religion and its exercise are among the most sensitive discourses in different parts of the world, especially in Nigeria. The constitution and other laws ensure citizens are afforded basic human rights of which religious rights are included and yet regulated. There are questions of interpretation as to the extent to which such rights can be enjoyed and the efficacy of both the legal and institutional frameworks protecting religious rights in Nigeria. Methods This article utilises a doctrinal legal research approach utilising existing literature, statutes, and laws enacted towards the protection of religious rights in Nigeria with the consideration of primary and secondary sources of statutes including the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), judicial precedents, International Conventions, law textbooks, and peer-reviewed journals. A comparative analysis of Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey and Kazakhstan was done to gain perspectives on balancing conflicting interests in light of Nigeria’s heterogeneous status. As part of the contribution to knowledge, a hybrid model for mitigating the socio-legal effect of the usage of hijab in Nigeria’s public institutions is presented to further enrich Nigeria’s jurisprudence. A hybrid model is an approach that combines different sources or methodologies by integrating two or more distinct frameworks to leverage their strengths and effectively address specific needs or challenges. It is utilized to achieve synergy and maximize outcomes by blending diverse legal approaches in law. Results Nigeria, being a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state, demonstrates that the government must protect the public interests as it relates to religious rights regardless of faith or religion. The study reveals that the current legal approach without further legislative intervention on religious issues will be inadequate to address the problem. Therefore, this study presents a hybrid model for mitigating the socio-legal effect of the usage of hijab in Nigeria’s public institutions to avoid harm and further enrich Nigeria’s jurisprudence. Conclusions This study concludes by emphasizing the inadequacy of Nigeria’s legal and institutional frameworks regarding the protection of religious rights and the right to wear hijab in public institutions. Consequently, reform is deemed necessary.

                Preterm infants can face lasting neurodevelopmental challenges due to hypoxia-induced injury of the cerebral white matter. In this issue of Neuron, Ren et al. identify microvascular pericytes as unexpected targets for growth hormone signaling, which enhances angiogenesis and remyelination after hypoxic injury in the developing mouse brain.

                The locus coeruleus is the seat of a brain-wide neuromodulatory circuit. Using optogenetic and electrophysiological tools to selectively interrogate noradrenergic neurons in non-human primates, Ghosh and Maunsell show how locus coeruleus neurons contribute to a specific aspect of visual attention.

                Using TRAP to perform a brain-wide screen for embryonically active neurons, Wang et al. identify and demonstrate the transient developmental role of activity in a hub-like neuronal population in promoting recurrent connectivity in the piriform cortex. These findings suggest a mechanism of activity-dependent maturation of intracortical circuits.

                Metabolic and transcriptional cellular heterogeneity drives melanoma drug resistance and progression. This study reveals that ALDH1A3-ACSS2 directly coordinates nuclear acetaldehyde-acetyl-CoA metabolism with histone H3 acetylation and is associated with TFAP2B-neural crest stem cell and glucose metabolism gene expression. The ALDH1A3 metabolism-stem cell axis represents a potential therapeutic vulnerability in melanoma.

Using cultured cancer cells and a mouse xenograft model, they show that DDX4 is involved in the transcriptome regulation in cancer cells, and it promotes cancerous properties and tumor growth.

                CB2 is highly expressed on adipose-resident ILC2s. Shafiei-Jahani et al. reveal that CB2 agonists stimulate murine and human ILC2s, enhancing their proliferation and cytokine production through the AKT, ERK1/2, and CREB pathways. This activation promotes an IL-13-dependent mechanism that prevents insulin resistance, enhances glucose tolerance, and reverses established conditions in T2DM.

                Sciarretta et al. found obesity increases lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) in BAT. Metabolically overloaded brown adipocytes release damaged lipids and mitochondria via EVs, cleared by BAT macrophages via CD36. EVs induce LAM identity. LAMs secrete TGF-β1, suppressing brown fat genes via Aldh1a1 induction, regulating brown-to-white fat conversion in obesity and type 2 diabetes.

                Songbirds’ vocal mastery is impressive, but to what extent is it a result of practice? Can they, based on experienced mismatch with a known target, plan the necessary changes to recover the target in a practice-free manner without intermittently singing? In adult zebra finches, we drive the pitch of a song syllable away from its stable (baseline) variant acquired from a tutor, then we withdraw reinforcement and subsequently deprive them of singing experience by muting or deafening. In this deprived state, birds do not recover their baseline song. However, they revert their songs toward the target by about 1 standard deviation of their recent practice, provided the sensory feedback during the latter signaled a pitch mismatch with the target. Thus, targeted vocal plasticity does not require immediate sensory experience, showing that zebra finches are capable of goal-directed vocal planning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90944">Neurofeedback training can modulate task-relevant memory replay rate in rats</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal replay – the time-compressed, sequential reactivation of ensembles of neurons related to past experience – is a key neural mechanism of memory consolidation. Replay typically coincides with a characteristic pattern of local field potential activity, the sharp-wave ripple (SWR). Reduced SWR rates are associated with cognitive impairment in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that a clinically viable intervention to promote SWRs and replay would prove beneficial. We therefore developed a neurofeedback paradigm for rat subjects in which SWR detection triggered rapid positive feedback in the context of a memory-dependent task. This training protocol increased the prevalence of task-relevant replay during the targeted neurofeedback period by changing the temporal dynamics of SWR occurrence. This increase was also associated with neural and behavioral forms of compensation after the targeted period. These findings reveal short-timescale regulation of SWR generation and demonstrate that neurofeedback is an effective strategy for modulating hippocampal replay.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95648">Bacterial exonuclease III expands its enzymatic activities on single-stranded DNA</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial exonuclease III (ExoIII), widely acknowledged for specifically targeting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), has been documented as a DNA repair-associated nuclease with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)-endonuclease and 3′→5′ exonuclease activities. Due to these enzymatic properties, ExoIII has been broadly applied in molecular biosensors. Here, we demonstrate that ExoIII (<i>Escherichia coli</i>) possesses highly active enzymatic activities on ssDNA. By using a range of ssDNA fluorescence-quenching reporters and fluorophore-labeled probes coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, we found ExoIII cleaved the ssDNA at 5′-bond of phosphodiester from 3′ to 5′ end by both exonuclease and endonuclease activities. Additional point mutation analysis identified the critical residues for the ssDNase action of ExoIII and suggested the activity shared the same active center with the dsDNA-targeted activities of ExoIII. Notably, ExoIII could also digest the dsDNA structures containing 3′-end ssDNA. Considering most ExoIII-assisted molecular biosensors require the involvement of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or nucleic acid aptamer containing ssDNA, the activity will lead to low efficiency or false positive outcome. Our study revealed the multi-enzymatic activity and the underlying molecular mechanism of ExoIII on ssDNA, illuminating novel insights for understanding its biological roles in DNA repair and the rational design of ExoIII-ssDNA involved diagnostics.

">Regulation of proteostasis by sleep through autophagy in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunctions are common clinical features of Alzheimer 's Disease (AD). Increasing evidence suggests that in addition to being a symptom, sleep disturbances can also drive the progression of neurodegeneration. Protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of AD, however the molecular pathways behind how sleep affects protein homeostasis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that sleep modulation influences proteostasis and the progression of neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of Tauopathy. We show that sleep deprivation enhanced Tau aggregational toxicity resulting in exacerbated synaptic degeneration. In contrast, sleep induction using gaboxadol led to reduced hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulation in neurons as a result of modulated autophagic flux and enhanced clearance of ubiquitinated Tau, suggesting altered protein processing and clearance that resulted in improved synaptic integrity and function. These findings highlight the complex relationship between sleep and autophagy, in regulating protein homeostasis, and the neuroprotective potential of sleep-enhancing therapeutics to slow the progression or delay the onset of neurodegeneration.

">Vasopressin-to-Oxytocin Receptor Crosstalk in the Preoptic Area Underlying Parental Behaviors in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                The transition to parenthood brings significant changes in behavior toward offspring. For instance, in anticipation of their offspring, male mice shift from infanticidal to caregiving behaviors. While the release of oxytocin from the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) plays a critical role in paternal caregiving, it does not fully account for the entire behavioral shift. The specific downstream neurons and signaling mechanisms involved in this process remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that PVH vasopressin neurons also essentially contribute to a paternal behavioral shift. This vasopressin signal is partially transmitted through oxytocin receptors (OTRs) expressed in the anterior commissure and medial nuclei of the preoptic area. These OTR-expressing neurons receive inputs from both PVH oxytocin and vasopressin neurons and are responsible for expressing paternal caregiving behaviors. Collectively, this non-canonical vasopressin-to-OTR crosstalk within specific limbic circuits acts as a pivotal regulator of paternal behavioral changes in mice.

">Thalamic Control Over Laminar Cortical Dynamics Across Conscious States</a></h4>

              
                The human brain must support both stable and flexible neural dynamics in order to adapt to changing contexts. This paper investigates the role of the thalamus, a crucial subcortical structure, in orchestrating these opposing dynamics in the cerebral cortex. Through two distinct classes of cortical projections, the thalamus is able to support distinct dynamics modes: some cells relay precise information between cortical regions, whereas others diffusely modulate ongoing cortical dynamics. Traditional approaches to analysing neural data struggle to capture the moment-to-moment intricacies of brain dynamics, akin to mapping a rivers topography without understanding its flow, or laminarity. Inspired by the field of fluid dynamics, we show that spontaneous fMRI data exhibits non-trivial fluctuations in laminarity. Propofol-induced anesthesia selectively disrupts the non-laminar aspects of cortical dynamics while preserving laminar flow, which we validate with a large-scale biophysical model of the thalamocortical system. Finally, we confirmed theoretical predictions from the biophysical model using multielectrode electrophysiological recordings from the cerebral cortex of an anesthetized macaque - direct stimulation of the diffusely-projecting thalamus restored non-laminar cortical fluctuations and the waking state. We conclude that the thalamus provides versatile control over the cortical laminar and non-laminar flows that characterize conscious states.

	<p>Mitral cells (MCs) in the main olfactory bulb relay odor information to higher-order olfactory centers by encoding the information in the form of action potentials. The firing patterns of these cells are influenced by both their intrinsic properties and their synaptic connections within the neural network. However, reports on MC firing patterns have been inconsistent, and the mechanisms underlying these patterns remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse brain slices, we discovered that MCs exhibit two types of integrative behavior: regular/rhythmic firing and bursts of action potentials. These firing patterns could be transformed both spontaneously and chemically. MCs with regular firing maintained their pattern even in the presence of blockers of fast synaptic transmission, indicating this was an intrinsic property. However, regular firing could be transformed into bursting by applying GABAA receptor antagonists to block inhibitory synaptic transmission. Burst firing could be reverted to regular firing by blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors, rather than applying a GABAA receptor agonist, indicating that ionotropic glutamatergic transmission mediated this transformation. Further experiments on long-lasting currents (LLCs), which generated burst firing, also supported this mechanism. In addition, cytoplasmic Ca2+ in MCs was involved in the transformation of firing patterns mediated by glutamatergic transmission. Metabotropic glutamate receptors also played a role in LLCs in MCs. These pieces of evidence indicate that odor information can be encoded on a mitral cell (MC) platform, where it can be relayed to higher-order olfactory centers through intrinsic and dendrodendritic mechanisms in MCs.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathology including amyloid beta (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (tau). Factors initiating or driving these pathologies remain unclear, though microbes have been increasingly implicated. Our data and others&amp;amp;rsquo; findings indicate that microbes may be common constituents of the brain. It is notable that A&amp;amp;beta; and tau have antimicrobial properties, suggesting a response to microbes in the brain. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare major bacterial phyla in post-mortem tissues from individuals exhibiting a range of neuropathology and cognitive status in two brain regions variably affected in AD. Our data indicate that strong regional differences exist, driven in part by the varied presence of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We confirmed our data using ELISA of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid in the same brain tissue. We identified a potential association between the composition of phyla and the presence of neuropathology but not cognitive status. Declining cognition and increasing pathology correlated closely with serum LPS, but not brain levels of LPS, although brain LPS showed a strong negative correlation with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Collectively, our data suggest a region-specific heterogeneity of microbial populations in brain tissue potentially associated with neurodegenerative pathology.</p>

	<p>This study aims to understand the cognitive profiles of cerebellar infarction patients and compare them to those with supratentorial infarctions, particularly frontal infarctions. This current study also aims to find reliable assessment tools for detecting cognitive impairment in cerebellar infarction patients. A total of fifty cerebellar infarction patients, sixty supratentorial infarction patients, and thirty-nine healthy controls were recruited. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Addenbrooke&amp;amp;rsquo;s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), and Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome scale (CCAS-s) were used to assess global cognitive function. An extensive neuropsychological assessment battery was also tested to evaluate the characteristics of each cognitive domain. To assess the features of cognitive function, a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation tool was also utilized. The cerebral infarction patients demonstrated cognitive impairment comparable to those with frontal infarcts, notably characterized by disturbance in attention and executive function. However, the degree of cognitive impairment was comparatively milder in cerebellar infarction patients. Furthermore, the patients in the cerebellar group had worse scores in the ACE-III and CCAS-s compared to healthy controls. The two assessments also demonstrated a significant area under the curve values, indicating their effectiveness in distinguishing cognitive impairment in cerebellar infarctions. In conclusion, cognitive impairment in a cerebellar infarction resembles frontal lobe dysfunction but is generally mild. It can be accurately assessed using the ACE-III and CCAS-s scales.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-731/v1?src=rss">Differential physical interactions of wild-type and S59L mutant CHCHD10 with mitochondrial proteases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background CHCHD10 is a small mitochondrial protein with a C-terminal coiled-coil-helix–coiled-coil-helix domain. The N-terminal region of CHCHD10 is mostly intrinsically disordered. Therefore, CHCHD10 has no catalytic activity other than protein-protein interactions through the CHCH domain or intrinsically disordered region. The S59L mutation in CHCHD10 has been identified as a genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. However, the disease-causing mechanisms of CHCHD10S59L are not yet fully understood. Our previous study showed that CHCHD10S59L induces PINK1 and Parkin accumulation. PINK1 stabilization in the mitochondria is dependent on proteolytic processing by mitochondrial proteases. It has also been reported that mutant CHCHD10 disrupts protein homeostasis within mitochondria. Therefore, we hypothesized that CHCHD10S59L physically interacts with mitochondrial proteases during the disease pathogenesis. Methods To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using transiently transfected wild-type and mutant S59L CHCHD10 in HeLa cells. We employed a dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) cross-linker to detect transient physical interactions. Results We expected that CHCHD10S59L may activate mitochondrial protease processing or expression and that it interacts with more diverse mitochondrial proteases than the wild type. In general, however, there was no difference in the expression and processing levels of mitochondrial proteases and the proteases that interact with wild-type and CHCHD10S59L. LonP1 degrading unfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix was the major proteases that can bind to wild-type CHCHD10 and CHCHD10S59L. LonP1 and HtrA2 were significantly less strongly bound to CHCHD10S59L. Conclusions This result can be interpreted in many different ways, including the regulatory role of CHCHD10 in mitochondrial proteases. However, more precise biochemical and cell biological investigations are required to determine the role of CHCHD10 in the activity of mitochondrial proteases, mechanism of PINK1 stabilization, and disruption of mitochondrial proteostasis.

                Background Community chemists now provide more professional and public health care, which is beneficial to the community, in addition to traditional medication distribution. While community pharmacists play a vital role in maintaining and promoting health, further research is required to accurately evaluate their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward oral health care among Jordanian pharmacists in northern Jordan. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire in Arabic language, targeting 250 community pharmacists in four cities (Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun, and Al-Mafraq) in northern Jordan. The questionnaire comprised four domains: socio-demographic, knowledge, attitudes and practice concerning oral health care. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22.0 was used to analyze the collected data, and the significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05. Results A total of 198 respondents returned the survey form, returning a response rate of 79.2%. Community pharmacists showed a good knowledge score of 58.2%. Only 40.9% said periodontal disease was the most frequent cause of tooth loss. The majority lacked knowledge of the optimal fluoride levels in toothpaste. The average attitude score was 71.05%. The most common oral health issues raised by patients were gingivitis and toothache (43.4% and 38.9%), respectively. Conclusion Community pharmacists have the general knowledge and attitude needed to play a significant role in providing dental care counselling to patients dental care. Nonetheless, community pharmacists stated they needed education and training to improve their practice. Continuing education courses related to oral health are recommended to reduce the risk of oral diseases and improve quality of life.

                Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) commonly affects individuals within the working age group, often resulting in unemployment, particularly in low- to middle-income countries. The purpose of the study was to determine the return to work (RTW) rate of individuals with CVD after cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and the impact of impairment and socio-demographics on the individual’s ability to (RTW). Methods A cross-sectional survey, namely the Work Rehabilitation Questionnaire (WORQ) was used to gather the information. The IBM SPSS software (version 25) was used to manage the statistical analysis. Individuals who completed a CR program between the ages of 18 and 64 years made up a sample of 63 research participants. Results The RTW rate reported that only 30 (47.6%) of the participants successfully RTW after CR and 33 (52.4%) of participants did not RTW. The results also indicated that the older the individual and the higher the degree of impairment experienced, the less likely RTW would occur. Conclusion Factors such as the age and level of functional impairment of the individual with CVD must be addressed more aggressively in CR programs, particularly if the goal of the individual with CVD is to RTW.

                Gender equality in decision-making positions is crucial to achieving the goals of good governance, peace, democracy, and inclusive/sustainable development. The major aim of this research article is to investigate the representation trend of women in higher decision-making positions over the last thirty years, since 1991. The federal three organs of government (law formulating, law enforcing, and law interpreting bodies) were the focus of this research. This research is a mixed type of research that inculcates both qualitative and quantitative data types. Secondary data sources from relevant government institutions were mostly used. The data was analyzed through content analysis of documents and presented via descriptive data presenting techniques. The research findings reveal that although women’s representation in positions of decision-making has advanced considerably in recent years, the empirical data throughout the previous thirty years demonstrated the underrepresentation of women in higher leadership positions within the Ethiopian federal government. Furthermore, Women never held certain higher-level government leadership positions, such as the Prime Minister position, which seems to be forbidden for women. Women made up 23%, 19%, 19%, and 24% of the House of Peoples Representatives (HPR), the House of Federation (HoF), ministerial posts, and judicial bodies, respectively over the last three decades. Women are visibly underrepresented in the executive positions as compared to others. Thus, substantial policy and practical initiatives are needed to remove institutional, social, and economic barriers to boost women’s advanced visibility in senior leadership roles.

                <p>by Paul Schmidt-Barbo, Gabriel Kalweit, Mehdi Naouar, Lisa Paschold, Edith Willscher, Christoph Schultheiß, Bruno Märkl, Stefan Dirnhofer, Alexandar Tzankov, Mascha Binder, Maria Kalweit</p>

The classification of B cell lymphomas—mainly based on light microscopy evaluation by a pathologist—requires many years of training. Since the B cell receptor (BCR) of the lymphoma clonotype and the microenvironmental immune architecture are important features discriminating different lymphoma subsets, we asked whether BCR repertoire next-generation sequencing (NGS) of lymphoma-infiltrated tissues in conjunction with machine learning algorithms could have diagnostic utility in the subclassification of these cancers. We trained a random forest and a linear classifier via logistic regression based on patterns of clonal distribution, VDJ gene usage and physico-chemical properties of the top-n most frequently represented clonotypes in the BCR repertoires of 620 paradigmatic lymphoma samples—nodular lymphocyte predominant B cell lymphoma (NLPBL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)—alongside with 291 control samples. With regard to DLBCL and CLL, the models demonstrated optimal performance when utilizing only the most prevalent clonotype for classification, while in NLPBL—that has a dominant background of non-malignant bystander cells—a broader array of clonotypes enhanced model accuracy. Surprisingly, the straightforward logistic regression model performed best in this seemingly complex classification problem, suggesting linear separability in our chosen dimensions. It achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.84 on a test cohort including 125 samples from all three lymphoma entities and 58 samples from healthy individuals. Together, we provide proof-of-concept that at least the 3 studied lymphoma entities can be differentiated from each other using BCR repertoire NGS on lymphoma-infiltrated tissues by a trained machine learning model.

The vegetative insecticidal protein Vip3Aa from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) has been produced by transgenic crops to counter pest resistance to the widely used crystalline (Cry) insecticidal proteins from Bt. To proactively manage pest resistance, there is an urgent need to better understand the genetic basis of resistance to Vip3Aa, which has been largely unknown. We discovered that retrotransposon-mediated alternative splicing of a midgut-specific chitin synthase gene was associated with 5,560-fold resistance to Vip3Aa in a laboratory-selected strain of the fall armyworm, a globally important crop pest. The same mutation in this gene was also detected in a field population. Knockout of this gene via CRISPR/Cas9 caused high levels of resistance to Vip3Aa in fall armyworm and 2 other lepidopteran pests. The insights provided by these results could help to advance monitoring and management of pest resistance to Vip3Aa.

The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has become a major threat to public health, requiring swift initiatives for discovering new strategies to control bacterial infections. Hence, antibiotic stewardship and rapid diagnostics, but also the development, and prudent use, of novel effective antimicrobial agents are paramount. Ideally, these agents should be less likely to select for resistance in pathogens than currently available conventional antimicrobials. The usage of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), key components of the innate immune response, and combination therapies, have been proposed as strategies to diminish the emergence of resistance. Herein, we investigated whether newly developed random antimicrobial peptide mixtures (RPMs) can significantly reduce the risk of resistance evolution in vitro to that of single sequence AMPs, using the ESKAPE pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>) as a model gram-negative bacterium. Infections of this pathogen are difficult to treat due the inherent resistance to many drug classes, enhanced by the capacity to form biofilms. <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> was experimentally evolved in the presence of AMPs or RPMs, subsequentially assessing the extent of resistance evolution and cross-resistance/collateral sensitivity between treatments. Furthermore, the fitness costs of resistance on bacterial growth were studied and whole-genome sequencing used to investigate which mutations could be candidates for causing resistant phenotypes. Lastly, changes in the pharmacodynamics of the evolved bacterial strains were examined. Our findings suggest that using RPMs bears a much lower risk of resistance evolution compared to AMPs and mostly prevents cross-resistance development to other treatments, while maintaining (or even improving) drug sensitivity. This strengthens the case for using random cocktails of AMPs in favour of single AMPs, against which resistance evolved in vitro, providing an alternative to classic antibiotics worth pursuing.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We investigated whether patients with large infarct and the presence or absence of perfusion mismatch are associated with endovascular treatment benefit.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a post-hoc analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion with a Large Infarct (ANGEL-ASPECT) randomized trial, which enrolled patients within 24 hours of onset with ASPECTS 3 to 5 or ASPECTS 0 to 2 with an infarct core 70 to 100 ml. Mismatch ratio was defined as time-to-maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s cerebral volume/ischemic core volume, and mismatch volume was defined as T<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s volume minus ischemic core volume. We divided patients into mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml, and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups. The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ordinal distribution. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 425 patients included. In both the mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 395; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 31) and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 346; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 80), better 90-day modified Rankin Scale outcomes were found in the endovascular treatment group compared with the MM group (4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], common odds ratio [cOR], 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.001; 4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], cOR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively), but not in patients without mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (5 [3–6] vs 5 [4–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.3–4.1, <i>p</i> = 0.83), and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml (4 [3–6] vs 5 [3–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.60). However, no interaction effect was found in both subgroups (<i>p</i> interaction &gt;0.10).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Endovascular treatment was more efficacious than MM in patients with mismatch profiles, but no treatment effect or interaction was noted in the no mismatch profile patients. However, the small sample size of patients with no mismatch may have underpowered our analysis. A pooled analysis of large core trials stratified by mismatch is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25364?af=R">A strike to the head: Parallels between the pediatric and adult human and the rodent in traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition that occurs commonly in children from infancy through adolescence and is a global health concern. Pediatric TBI presents with a bimodal age distribution, with very young children (0–4 years) and adolescents (15–19 years) more commonly injured. Because children's brains are still developing, there is increased vulnerability to the effects of head trauma, which results in entirely different patterns of injury than in adults. Pediatric TBI has a profound and lasting impact on a child's development and quality of life, resulting in long-lasting consequences to physical, cognitive, and emotional development. Chronic issues like learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and emotional disturbances can develop. Early intervention and ongoing support are critical for minimizing these long-term deficits. Many animal models of TBI exist, and each varies significantly, displaying different characteristics of clinical TBI. The neurodevelopment differs in the rodent from the human in timing and effect, so TBI outcomes in the juvenile rodent can thus vary from the human child. The current review compares findings from preclinical TBI work in juvenile and adult rodents to clinical TBI research in pediatric and adult humans. We focus on the four brain regions most affected by TBI: the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Each has its unique developmental projections and thus is impacted by TBI differently. This review aims to compare the healthy neurodevelopment of these four brain regions in humans to the developmental processes in rodents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25366?af=R">Gray matter alterations in Huntington's disease: A meta‐analysis of VBM neuroimaging studies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing neuroimaging studies have attempted to identify biomarkers of Huntington's disease (HD) progression. Here, we conducted voxel-based meta-analyses of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies on HD to investigate the evolution of gray matter volume (GMV) alterations and explore the effects of genetic and clinical features on GMV changes. A systematic review was performed to identify the relevant studies. Meta-analyses of whole-brain VBM studies were performed to assess the regional GMV changes in all HD mutation carriers, in presymptomatic HD (pre-HD), and in symptomatic HD (sym-HD). A quantitative comparison was performed between pre-HD and sym-HD. Meta-regression analyses were used to explore the effects of genetic and clinical features on GMV changes. Twenty-eight studies were included, comparing a total of 1811 HD mutation carriers [including 1150 pre-HD and 560 sym-HD] and 969 healthy controls (HCs). Pre-HD showed decreased GMV in the bilateral caudate nuclei, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri, middle temporal gyri, and left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus compared with HCs. Compared with pre-HD, GMV decrease in sym-HD extended to the bilateral median cingulate/paracingulate gyri, Rolandic operculum and middle occipital gyri, left amygdala, and superior temporal gyrus. Meta-regression analyses found that age, mean lengths of CAG repeats, and disease burden were negatively associated with GMV atrophy of the bilateral caudate and right insula in all HD mutation carriers. This meta-analysis revealed the pattern of GMV changes from pre-HD to sym-HD, prompting the understanding of HD progression. The pattern of GMV changes may be biomarkers for disease progression in HD.</p>

                Solid pseudo-papillary tumors (SPT) of the pancreas are rare neoplasms accounting for less than 2% of all pancreatic tumors and primarily affecting young women. They are generally characterized by a clinical and radiological polymorphism. In most cases, complete surgical resection is curative. We report a case of a young woman presenting with a pancreatic tumor revealed through a vague non-specific abdominal pain. The diagnosis was based on the histological examination of the surgically-removed piece.

                Chen et al. elucidate the intricate molecular, circuit, and functional architecture of the septal area and identify Esr1-expressing neurons in the LS as a key driver of reward seeking and methamphetamine addiction. These findings open new avenues for exploring how the septal region regulates reward and addiction.
