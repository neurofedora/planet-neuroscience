              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A short-term prospective study to evaluate the clinical performance of endosseous zirconia implants [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Endosseous zirconia implants have been established as an alternative to conventional titanium implants, especially in the aesthetic zone. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the outcome of rehabilitation with zirconia implants, in a subset of the Indian population, involving varying clinical scenarios. Methods: A total of 10 one-piece zirconia implants were placed in seven patients requiring rehabilitation of missing teeth. The survival rate and marginal bone levels were evaluated at six months and 12 months following implant placement. Results: Five implants were placed in the maxilla and five in the mandible, including well-healed sites, extraction sockets, a single cantilever in the lower anterior region, and a full-arch rehabilitation. During the observation period, two early implant failures were noted resulting in a survival rate of 80%. Mean marginal bone loss of 0.73mm was seen one year following implant placement, with maximum bone loss occurring in the first six months. Conclusion: The results of this study encourage the use of endosseous zirconia implants in diverse clinical scenarios with careful case selection. However, long-term studies are needed to further validate these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Readiness Potential Correlates with Action-Linked Modulation of Visual Accuracy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visual accuracy is consistently shown to be modulated around the time of the action execution. The neural underpinning of this motor-induced modulation of visual perception is still unclear. Here, we investigate with EEG whether it is related to the readiness potential, an event-related potential (ERP) linked to motor preparation. Across 18 human participants, the magnitude of visual modulation following a voluntary button press was found to correlate with the readiness potential amplitude measured during visual discrimination. Participants&rsquo; amplitude of the readiness potential in a purely motor-task was also found to correlate with the extent of the motor-induced modulation of visual perception in the visuomotor task. These results provide strong evidence that perceptual changes close to action execution are associated with motor preparation processes and that this mechanism is independent of task contingencies. Further, our findings suggest that the readiness potential provides a fingerprint of individual visuomotor interaction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 Regulates cPLA2 Activity and Neuroinflammation in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hyperactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) by p25, contributes to neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. However, the mechanism by which Cdk5 induces neuroinflammation in the PD brain is largely unexplored. Here, we show that Cdk5 phosphorylates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) at Thr-268 and Ser-505 sites lead to its activation and generation of eicosanoid products. Mutational studies using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular simulations show that the architecture of the protein changes on each single-point mutation. Interestingly, double mutations also led to a severe decline in the activity of cPLA2 and to the disruption of its translocation to the plasma membrane. Further, the brain lysates of transgenic PD mouse models show hyperactivation of Cdk5, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Thr-268 and Ser-505 of cPLA2 and its heightened activity, confirming the findings observed in the cell culture model of PD. These phosphorylation sites of cPLA2 and Cdk5 could be explored as the future therapeutic targets against neuroinflammation in PD. Further, conjoint transcriptomic analysis of the publicly available human PD datasets strengthens the hypothesis that genes of the arachidonic acid, prostaglandin synthesis, and inflammatory pathways are significantly upregulated in the case of PD patients compared with that of healthy control subjects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Correlates of Sensory Eye Dominance in Human Visual White Matter Tracts</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A significant proportion of the human neurotypical population exhibits some degree of sensory eye dominance (SED), referring to the brain&rsquo;s preferential processing of one eye&rsquo;s input versus another. The neural substrates underlying this functional imbalance are not well known. Here, we investigated the relationship between visual white matter tract properties and SED in the human neurotypical population. Observers&rsquo; performance on two commonly used dichoptic tasks were used to index SED, along with performance on a third task to address a functional implication of binocular imbalance: stereovision. We show that diffusivity metrics of the optic radiations (ORs) well predict behavioral SED metrics. We found no relationship between SED and stereosensitivity. Our data suggest that SED is not simply reflected by gray matter structural and functional alterations, as often suggested, but relates, at least in part to the microstructural properties of thalamocortical white matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Shisa7-Dependent Regulation of GABAA Receptor Single-Channel Gating Kinetics</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission throughout the brain. Although it is widely known that pore-forming subunits critically determine receptor function, it is unclear whether their single-channel properties are modulated by GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-associated transmembrane proteins. We previously identified Shisa7 as a GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R auxiliary subunit that modulates the trafficking, pharmacology, and deactivation properties of these receptors. However, whether Shisa7 also regulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R single-channel properties has yet to be determined. Here, we performed single-channel recordings of &alpha;2&beta;32L GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs cotransfected with Shisa7 in HEK293T cells and found that while Shisa7 does not change channel slope conductance, it reduced the frequency of receptor openings. Importantly, Shisa7 modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R gating by decreasing the duration and open probability within bursts. Through kinetic analysis of individual dwell time components, activation modeling, and macroscopic simulations, we demonstrate that Shisa7 accelerates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R deactivation by governing the time spent between close and open states during gating. Together, our data provide a mechanistic basis for how Shisa7 controls GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R gating and reveal for the first time that GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R single-channel properties can be modulated by an auxiliary subunit. These findings shed light on processes that shape the temporal dynamics of GABAergic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) single-channel properties are largely determined by pore-forming subunits, it remains unknown whether they are also controlled by GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-associated transmembrane proteins. Here, we show that Shisa7, a recently identified GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R auxiliary subunit, modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R activation by altering single-channel burst kinetics. These results reveal that Shisa7 primarily decreases the duration and open probability of receptor burst activity during gating, leading to accelerated GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R deactivation. These experiments are the first to assess the gating properties of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in the presence of an auxiliary subunit and provides a kinetic basis for how Shisa7 modifies temporal attributes of GABAergic transmission at the single-channel level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Preserved Motility after Neonatal Dopaminergic Lesion Relates to Hyperexcitability of Direct Pathway Medium Spiny Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>In Parkinson's disease patients and rodent models, dopaminergic neuron loss (DAN) results in severe motor disabilities. In contrast, general motility is preserved after early postnatal DAN loss in rodents. Here we used mice of both sexes to show that the preserved motility observed after early DAN loss depends on functional changes taking place in medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) that belong to the direct pathway (dMSN). Previous animal model studies showed that adult loss of dopaminergic input depresses dMSN response to cortical input, which likely contributes to Parkinson's disease motor impairments. However, the response of DMS-dMSN to their preferred medial PFC input is preserved after neonatal DAN loss as shown by <I>in vivo</I> studies. Moreover, their response to inputs from adjacent cortical areas is increased, resulting in reduced cortical inputs selectivity. Additional <I>ex vivo</I> studies show that membrane excitability increases in dMSN. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of DMS-dMSN has a more marked inhibitory effect on general motility in lesioned mice than in their control littermates, indicating that expression of normal levels of locomotion and general motility depend on dMSN activity after early DAN loss. Contrastingly, DMS-dMSN inhibition did not ameliorate a characteristic phenotype of the DAN-lesioned animals in a marble burying task demanding higher behavioral control. Thus, increased dMSN excitability likely promoting changes in corticostriatal functional connectivity may contribute to the distinctive behavioral phenotype emerging after developmental DAN loss, with implications for our understanding of the age-dependent effects of forebrain dopamine depletion and neurodevelopment disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The loss of striatal dopamine in the adult brain leads to life-threatening motor impairments. However, general motility remains largely unaffected after its early postnatal loss. Here, we show that the high responsiveness to cortical input of striatal neurons belonging to the direct basal ganglia pathway, crucial for proper motor functioning, is preserved after early dopamine neuron loss, in parallel with an increase in these cells' membrane excitability. Chemogenetic inhibition studies show that the preserved motility depends on this direct pathway hyperexcitability/hyperconnectivity, while other phenotypes characteristic of this condition remained unaltered despite the dMSN inhibition. This insight has implications for our understanding of the mechanism underlying the behavioral impairments observed in neuropsychiatric conditions linked to early dopaminergic hypofunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single Nuclei Analyses Reveal Transcriptional Profiles and Marker Genes for Diverse Supraspinal Populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mammalian brain contains numerous neurons distributed across forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain that project axons to the lower spinal cord and work in concert to control movement and achieve homeostasis. Extensive work has mapped the anatomic location of supraspinal cell types and continues to establish specific physiological functions. The patterns of gene expression that typify and distinguish these disparate populations, however, are mostly unknown. Here, using adult mice of mixed sex, we combined retrograde labeling of supraspinal cell nuclei with fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting and single-nuclei RNA sequencing analyses to transcriptionally profile neurons that project axons from the brain to lumbar spinal cord. We identified 14 transcriptionally distinct cell types and used a combination of established and newly identified marker genes to assign an anatomic location to each. To validate the putative marker genes, we visualized selected transcripts and confirmed selective expression within lumbar-projecting neurons in discrete supraspinal regions. Finally, we illustrate the potential utility of these data by examining the expression of transcription factors that distinguish different supraspinal cell types and by surveying the expression of receptors for growth and guidance cues that may be present in the spinal cord. Collectively, these data establish transcriptional differences between anatomically defined supraspinal populations, identify a new set of marker genes of use in future experiments, and provide insight into potential differences in cellular and physiological activity across the supraspinal connectome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain communicates with the body through a wide variety of neuronal populations with distinct functions and differential sensitivity to damage and disease. We have used single-nuclei RNA sequencing technology to distinguish patterns of gene expression within a diverse set of neurons that project axons from the mouse brain to the lumbar spinal cord. The results reveal transcriptional differences between populations previously defined on the basis of anatomy, provide new marker genes to facilitate rapid identification of cell type in future work, and suggest distinct responsiveness of different supraspinal populations to external growth and guidance cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Circadian Regulation of the Rod Contribution to Mesopic Vision in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>At intermediate (mesopic) light levels, rods and cones are both active and can contribute to vision. This presents a challenge to the retina because the visual responses originating with rods and cones are distinct, yet their visual responses must be seamlessly combined. The current study aimed to establish how the circadian clock regulates rod and/or cone vision in these conditions, given the strong time-of-day change in the reliance on each photoreceptor. Visual responses were recorded in the retina and visual thalamus of anaesthetized male mice at distinct circadian time points, and the method of receptor silent substitution was used to selectively stimulate different photoreceptor types. With stimuli designed to only activate rods, responses in the mesopic range were highly rhythmic and peaked in amplitude in the subjective night. This rhythm was abolished following intravitreal injection of the gap junction blocker meclofenamic acid, consistent with a circadian variation in the strength of electrical coupling of photoreceptors. In contrast, responses to stimuli designed to only activate cones were arrhythmic within the mesopic to photopic range when adapted to the background irradiance. The outcome was that combined rod-plus-cone responses showed a stable contrast-response relationship across mesopic-photopic backgrounds in the circadian day, whereas at night, responses were significantly amplified at lower light levels. These data support the idea that the circadian clock is a key regulator of vision, in this case defining the relative amplitude of rod/cone vision across the mesopic transition according to time of day.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the importance of circadian clocks in regulating vision has been long recognized, less is known about how the clock shapes vision in conditions where both rods and cones are active (mesopic conditions). Here, the novel approach of receptor silent substitution has been applied to trace rod and cone visual responses in mice across the circadian cycle and has identified pronounced rhythms in rod, but not cone, vision. This has the effect of boosting responses in dimmer backgrounds at night at the cost of impaired contrast&ndash;response stability across the mesopic to photopic range. Thus, the circadian clock drives anticipatory changes in the relative contribution of rods versus cones to vision, which match the prevailing visual environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Whole-Brain Propagation Delays in Multiple Sclerosis, a Combined Tractography-Magnetoencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two structurally connected brain regions are more likely to interact, with the lengths of the structural bundles, their widths, myelination, and the topology of the structural connectome influencing the timing of the interactions. We introduce an <I>in vivo</I> approach for measuring functional delays across the whole brain in humans (of either sex) using magneto/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) and integrating them with the structural bundles. The resulting topochronic map of the functional delays/velocities shows that larger bundles have faster velocities. We estimated the topochronic map in multiple sclerosis patients, who have damaged myelin sheaths, and controls, demonstrating greater delays in patients across the network and that structurally lesioned tracts were slowed down more than unaffected ones. We provide a novel framework for estimating functional transmission delays <I>in vivo</I> at the single-subject and single-tract level.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This article provides a straightforward way to estimate patient-specific delays and conduction velocities in the CNS, at the individual level, in healthy and diseased subjects. To do so, it uses a principled way to merge magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG) and tractography.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence of Serial Dependence from Decoding of Visual Evoked Potentials</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is well known that recent sensory experience influences perception, recently demonstrated by a phenomenon termed "serial dependence." However, its underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We measured ERP responses to pairs of stimuli presented randomly to the left or right hemifield. Seventeen male and female adults judged whether the upper or lower half of the grating had higher spatial frequency, independent of the horizontal position of the grating. This design allowed us to trace the memory signal modulating task performance and also the implicit memory signal associated with hemispheric position. Using classification techniques, we decoded the position of the current and previous stimuli and the response from voltage scalp distributions of the current trial. Classification of previous responses reached full significance only 700 ms after presentation of the current stimulus, consistent with retrieval of an activity-silent memory trace. Cross-condition classification accuracy of past responses (trained on current responses) correlated with the strength of serial dependence effects of individual participants. Overall, our data provide evidence for a silent memory signal that can be decoded from the EEG potential, which interacts with the neural processing of the current stimulus. This silent memory signal could be the physiological substrate subserving at least one type of serial dependence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neurophysiological underpinnings of how past perceptual experience affects current perception are poorly understood. Here, we show that recent experience is reactivated when a new stimulus is presented and that the strength of this reactivation correlates with serial biases in individual participants, suggesting that serial dependence is established on the basis of a silent memory signal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">How Does Literacy Affect Speech Processing? Not by Enhancing Cortical Responses to Speech, But by Promoting Connectivity of Acoustic-Phonetic and Graphomotor Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous research suggests that literacy, specifically learning alphabetic letter-to-phoneme mappings, modifies online speech processing and enhances brain responses, as indexed by the BOLD, to speech in auditory areas associated with phonological processing (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B7">Dehaene et al., 2010</cross-ref>). However, alphabets are not the only orthographic systems in use in the world, and hundreds of millions of individuals speak languages that are not written using alphabets. In order to make claims that literacy per se has broad and general consequences for brain responses to speech, one must seek confirmatory evidence from nonalphabetic literacy. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal fMRI study in India probing the effect of literacy in Devanagari, an abubgida, on functional connectivity and cerebral responses to speech in 91 variously literate Hindi-speaking male and female human participants. Twenty-two completely illiterate participants underwent 6 months of reading and writing training. Devanagari literacy increases functional connectivity between acoustic-phonetic and graphomotor brain areas, but we find no evidence that literacy changes brain responses to speech, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. These findings shows that a dramatic reconfiguration of the neurofunctional substrates of online speech processing may not be a universal result of learning to read, and suggest that the influence of writing on speech processing should also be investigated.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is widely claimed that a consequence of being able to read is enhanced auditory processing of speech, reflected by increased cortical responses in areas associated with phonological processing. Here we find no relationship between literacy and the magnitude of brain response to speech stimuli in individuals who speak Hindi, which is written using a nonalphabetic script, Devanagari, an abugida. We propose that the exact nature of the script under examination must be considered before making sweeping claims about the consequences of literacy for the brain. Further, we find evidence that literacy enhances functional connectivity between auditory processing areas and graphomotor areas, suggesting a mechanism whereby learning to write might influence speech perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Roles of Dopamine Receptor Subtypes in the Nucleus Accumbens during Itch Signal Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, which are well known for their central roles in reward and motivation-related behaviors, have been shown to participate in itch processing via their projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the functional roles of different dopamine receptor subtypes in subregions of the NAc during itch processing remain unknown. With pharmacological approaches, we found that the blockade of dopamine D1 receptors (D1R), but not dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), in the lateral shell (LaSh) of the NAc impaired pruritogen-induced scratching behavior in male mice. In contrast, pharmacological activation of D2R in both the LaSh and medial shell (MeSh) of the NAc attenuated the scratching behavior induced by pruritogens. Consistently, we found that dopamine release, as detected by a dopamine sensor, was elevated in the LaSh rather than the MeSh of the NAc at the onset of scratching behavior. Furthermore, the elevation of dopamine release in the LaSh of the NAc persisted even though itch-relieving behavior was blocked, suggesting that the dopamine signal in the NAc LaSh represents a motivational component of itch processing. Our study revealed different dynamics of dopamine release that target neurons expressing two dopamine receptors subtypes within different subregions of the NAc, and emphasized that D1R in the LaSh of the NAc is important in itch signal processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine has been implicated in itch signal processing. However, the mechanism underlying the functional role of dopamine in itch processing remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and D2R in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell during pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. We demonstrated that D1R in the NAc lateral shell (LaSh) play an important role in motivating itch-induced scratching behavior, while activation of D2R would terminate scratching behavior. Our study revealed the diverse functional roles of dopamine signals in the NAc shell during itch processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Updating Contextual Sensory Expectations for Adaptive Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain has the extraordinary capacity to construct predictive models of the environment by internalizing statistical regularities in the sensory inputs. The resulting sensory expectations shape how we perceive and react to the world; at the neural level, this relates to decreased neural responses to expected than unexpected stimuli ("expectation suppression"). Crucially, expectations may need revision as context changes. However, existing research has often neglected this issue. Further, it is unclear whether contextual revisions apply selectively to expectations relevant to the task at hand, hence serving adaptive behavior. The present fMRI study examined how contextual visual expectations spread throughout the cortical hierarchy as we update our beliefs. We created a volatile environment: two alternating contexts contained different sequences of object images, thereby producing context-dependent expectations that needed revision when the context changed. Human participants of both sexes attended a training session before scanning to learn the contextual sequences. The fMRI experiment then tested for the emergence of contextual expectation suppression in two separate tasks, respectively, with task-relevant and task-irrelevant expectations. Effects of contextual expectation emerged progressively across the cortical hierarchy as participants attuned themselves to the context: expectation suppression appeared first in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex, followed by the ventral visual stream, up to early visual cortex. This applied selectively to task-relevant expectations. Together, the present results suggest that an insular and frontoparietal executive control network may guide the flexible deployment of contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behavior in our complex and dynamic world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The world is structured by statistical regularities, which we use to predict the future. This is often accompanied by suppressed neural responses to expected compared with unexpected events ("expectation suppression"). Crucially, the world is also highly volatile and context-dependent: expected events may become unexpected when the context changes, thus raising the crucial need for belief updating. However, this issue has generally been neglected. By setting up a volatile environment, we show that expectation suppression emerges first in executive control regions, followed by relevant sensory areas, only when observers use their expectations to optimize behavior. This provides surprising yet clear evidence on how the brain controls the updating of sensory expectations for adaptive behavior in our ever-changing world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Age-Related Learning and Working Memory Impairment in the Common Marmoset</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet we still do not understand how the aging process leads to pathologic vulnerability. The research community has relied heavily on mouse models, but the considerable anatomic, physiological, and cognitive differences between mice and humans limit their translational relevance. Ultimately, these barriers necessitate the development of novel aging models. As a nonhuman primate (NHP), the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) shares many features in common with humans and yet has a significantly shorter lifespan (10 years) than other primates, making it ideally suited to longitudinal studies of aging. Our objective was to evaluate the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment. To do this, we used the Delayed Recognition Span Task (DRST) to characterize age-related changes in working memory capacity in a cohort of sixteen marmosets, of both sexes, varying in age from young adult to geriatric. These monkeys performed thousands of trials over periods of time ranging up to 50% of their adult lifespan. To our knowledge, this represents the most thorough cognitive profiling of any marmoset aging study conducted to date. By analyzing individual learning curves, we found that aged animals exhibited delayed onset of learning, slowed learning rate after onset, and decreased asymptotic working memory performance. These findings are not accounted for by age-related impairments in motor speed and motivation. This work firmly establishes the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the normal aging process is fundamental to identifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases for which aging is the biggest risk factor. Historically, the aging field has relied on animal models that differ markedly from humans, constraining translatability. Here, we firmly establish a short-lived nonhuman primate (NHP), the common marmoset, as a key model of age-related cognitive impairment. We demonstrate, through continuous testing over a substantial portion of the adult marmoset lifespan, that aging is associated with both impaired learning and working memory capacity, unaccounted for by age-related changes in motor speed and motivation. Characterizing individual cognitive aging trajectories reveals inherent heterogeneity, which could lead to earlier identification of the onset of impairment, and extended timelines during which therapeutics are effective.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The SYNGAP1 3'UTR Variant in ALS Patients Causes Aberrant SYNGAP1 Splicing and Dendritic Spine Loss by Recruiting HNRNPK</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a pathogenic RNA-binding protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that FUS stabilizes Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein 1 (<I>Syngap1</I>) mRNA at its 3' untranslated region (UTR) and maintains spine maturation. To elucidate the pathologic roles of this mechanism in ALS patients, we identified the <I>SYNGAP1</I> 3'UTR variant rs149438267 in seven (four males and three females) out of 807 ALS patients at the FUS binding site from a multicenter cohort in Japan. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons with the <I>SYNGAP1</I> variant showed aberrant splicing, increased isoform &alpha;1 levels, and decreased isoform  levels, which caused dendritic spine loss. Moreover, the <I>SYNGAP1</I> variant excessively recruited FUS and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK), and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) blocking HNRNPK altered aberrant splicing and ameliorated dendritic spine loss. These data suggest that excessive recruitment of RNA-binding proteins, especially HNRNPK, as well as changes in <I>SYNGAP1</I> isoforms, are crucial for spine formation in motor neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modulation of Hippocampal Network Oscillation by PICK1-Dependent Cell Surface Expression of mGlu3 Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metabotropic glutamate receptor Type 3 (mGlu3) controls the sleep/wake architecture, which plays a role in the glutamatergic pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Interestingly, mGlu3 receptor expression is decreased in the brain of schizophrenic patients. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptors at the cell membrane. Subcellular receptor localization is strongly dependent on protein&ndash;protein interactions. Here we show that mGlu3 interacts with PICK1 and that this scaffolding protein is important for mGlu3 surface expression and function in hippocampal primary cultures. Disruption of their interaction via an mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide or an inhibitor of the PDZ domain of PICK1 altered the functional expression of mGlu3 receptors in neurons. We next investigated the impact of disrupting the mGlu3-PICK1 interaction on hippocampal theta oscillations <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> in WT male mice. We found a decreased frequency of theta oscillations in organotypic hippocampal slices, similar to what was previously observed in mGlu3 KO mice. In addition, hippocampal theta power was reduced during rapid eye movement sleep, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and wake states after intraventricular administration of the mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide. Targeting the mGlu3-PICK1 complex could thus be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysregulation of the glutamatergic system might play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Metabotropic glutamate receptors Type 3 (mGlu3) have been proposed as potential targets for schizophrenia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptor at the cell membrane is critical toward comprehending how their dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here we describe that the binding of the signaling and scaffolding protein PICK1 to mGlu3 receptors is important for their localization and physiological functions. The identification of new proteins that associate specifically to mGlu3 receptors will advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms associated with their targeting and function and ultimately might provide new therapeutic strategies to counter these psychiatric conditions.</p>

                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum), and normal group (without ulcer and treatment). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and the positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background: This paper presents a new software tool, Inglämnlagare, developed to be open-source, that restructures information about ancient remains in Sweden for analysis. The background is a new version of the ancient sites database, the Historic Environment Record, curated by the Swedish National Heritage Board, that was launched in 2018 with a new database model that structures the information differently compared to previous versions. Methods: The program, written in Python programming language, has multicore support in order to improve performance for large files and uses regular expressions to extract information about individual features of composite sites. Such features, together with their summed amount, are written as new individual fields to a comma-separated value file. The program is delivered as a source script file that can be executed in any Python environment. Use cases: As an example of use, a case study of exploring graves of rectangular shape found within Sweden is provided. The use case also describes the different steps involved in preparing the data in QGIS to run the program, as well as some methods to efficiently analyse and visualize the output. Conclusions: Inglämnlagare will make more information from the Swedish record of ancient sites accessible for research and can be used to explore different content of the record more efficiently than previously possible. While the tool is written specifically for this dataset it also provides an example of how open-source tools can be used for data wrangling making information designed for a specific purpose, such as online dissemination, appropriate for analysis.

                Background: Food and kitchen hygiene are necessary conditions for safe food and prevent foodborne illnesses. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with caregivers’ knowledge of kitchen hygiene in San Juan de Lurigancho (SJL). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. We surveyed 250 mothers at comedores populares (a sort of community kitchens which are very popular in Lima) and who were part of mothers' clubs in the areas of Huascar V and San Pablo, in SJL in Lima. The sample was selected through non-probability convenience sampling. A questionnaire with three dimensions (cleanliness, storage and contamination of children) was administered. Results: On average, in Huascar and San Pablo, most caregivers were the children’s mothers (93.2%); most of the caregivers were between 21 and 30 years old (54%); they had secondary level of education (70.4%); they were living in free union with their partners (69.2%); they were mainly housewives (80.4%); their houses were constructed with materials different from brick and cement (68.4%); and their houses had a bare floor (70.0%). They did not have drinking water in the kitchen (88.4%); they did not use a gas stove (88.4%), a refrigerator (50.0%), a radio (82.0%), or a microwave (16.4%). A good level of knowledge of food hygiene was found in 63.2% of caregivers. No predictive capacity of the assessed sociodemographic characteristics on the level of knowledge of kitchen hygiene was identified. Conclusions: This study determined that the assessed sociodemographic variables were not significantly associated with the level of knowledge about kitchen hygiene. It is necessary to improve mothers' knowledge about the handling and consumption of spoiled food and their effect on children's health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The “Rotten” matter in A Farewell to Arms: An Ecological Gothic reading [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This article uncovers the gothic tropes manifest in the “rotten” food, human bodies, landscapes, and rain in Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms through an eco-gothic perspective. It demonstrates how the rotten food, the disjointed bodies, the broken landscapes, and the gothic rain can be viewed in the novel as counter-narratives against the narratives of war, the military, and modern medicine. The first part of this article suggests interpreting war as a form of cannibalism by exploring the representations of rotten food and the connection between eating and killing. Next, the author focuses on how the body is fragmented both metaphorically and literally by the discourse of war, the military, and medical science. The third part uncovers the non-anthropocentric consciousness embedded within the protagonist’s narrative, followed by the gothicizing and romanticization of nature in the fourth section. Here, the protagonist’s linking of the human body to the natural landscape, the descriptions of the gothic rain, and the romanticized snow—all these, as the author argues, can be interpreted as a collective resistance against industrial, anthropocentric warfare.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Micronutrients in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                About 10 to 20% of reported pregnancies have complications like spontaneous abortion (SA), preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), and fetal growth restriction (FGR);  60% are attributed to maternal nutritional alterations. Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are supplemented in the antenatal period, but no proper validation/guidelines are available regarding dosing/time, the need for initiation, and the duration of supplementation. Studies have reported adverse pregnancy complications related to the overuse/unwanted use of multiple micronutrient supplementations during pregnancy. Identifying the exact population requiring supplementation is necessary to prevent its abuse. This article attempts to review the impacts of micronutrient deficiency/supplementation in cases of SA, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery and PE.  The study used a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Scopus Databases using search words pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE) or “adverse pregnancy” associated with minerals, micronutrients, or supplementation. The review also considered in-house literature databases, a single-window search at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) Health sciences library, MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The figures included in the study were created by Biorender.com. Micronutrients play multiple roles during pregnancy and fetoplacental growth stimulating growth hormone secretion, Lysyl oxidase (LOX), involved in the crosslinking between collagen and elastin in the amniotic membrane, downregulation of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, Il-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several chemokines involved in hypertension, immune-inflammatory pathways, attenuate insulin resistance a structural development of neurons and glia. Over-supplementation has led to complications such as spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes mellitus. Since there is a lack of standardization concerning micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, there is a need for  systematic study related to the role of micronutrients during each trimester of pregnancy to optimize its supplementation and to prevent hazards associated with its abuse.

Background <p>Following rapidly rising COVID-19 case numbers, England entered a national lockdown on 6 January 2021, with staged relaxations of restrictions from 8 March 2021 onwards.</p> Aim <p>We characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.</p> Methods <p>On average, risk of infection is proportional to infection prevalence. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>t</sub>) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> of each relaxation of restrictions.</p> Results <p>Following an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was offset by the effects of vaccination and also affected by the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.</p> Conclusion <p>High-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays/closures playing a significant part.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Humans combine value learning and hypothesis testing strategically in multi-dimensional probabilistic reward learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mingyu Song, Persis A. Baah, Ming Bo Cai, Yael Niv</p>

Realistic and complex decision tasks often allow for many possible solutions. How do we find the correct one? Introspection suggests a process of trying out solutions one after the other until success. However, such methodical serial testing may be too slow, especially in environments with noisy feedback. Alternatively, the underlying learning process may involve implicit reinforcement learning that learns about many possibilities in parallel. Here we designed a multi-dimensional probabilistic active-learning task tailored to study how people learn to solve such complex problems. Participants configured three-dimensional stimuli by selecting features for each dimension and received probabilistic reward feedback. We manipulated task complexity by changing how many feature dimensions were relevant to maximizing reward, as well as whether this information was provided to the participants. To investigate how participants learn the task, we examined models of serial hypothesis testing, feature-based reinforcement learning, and combinations of the two strategies. Model comparison revealed evidence for hypothesis testing that relies on reinforcement-learning when selecting what hypothesis to test. The extent to which participants engaged in hypothesis testing depended on the instructed task complexity: people tended to serially test hypotheses when instructed that there were fewer relevant dimensions, and relied more on gradual and parallel learning of feature values when the task was more complex. This demonstrates a strategic use of task information to balance the costs and benefits of the two methods of learning.

The influence of protocol standardization between laboratories on their replicability of preclinical results has not been addressed in a systematic way. While standardization is considered good research practice as a means to control for undesired external noise (i.e., highly variable results), some reports suggest that standardized protocols may lead to idiosyncratic results, thus undermining replicability. Through the EQIPD consortium, a multi-lab collaboration between academic and industry partners, we aimed to elucidate parameters that impact the replicability of preclinical animal studies. To this end, 3 experimental protocols were implemented across 7 laboratories. The replicability of results was determined using the distance travelled in an open field after administration of pharmacological compounds known to modulate locomotor activity (MK-801, diazepam, and clozapine) in C57BL/6 mice as a worked example. The goal was to determine whether harmonization of study protocols across laboratories improves the replicability of the results and whether replicability can be further improved by systematic variation (heterogenization) of 2 environmental factors (time of testing and light intensity during testing) within laboratories. Protocols were tested in 3 consecutive stages and differed in the extent of harmonization across laboratories and standardization within laboratories: stage 1, minimally aligned across sites (local protocol); stage 2, fully aligned across sites (harmonized protocol) with and without systematic variation (standardized and heterogenized cohort); and stage 3, fully aligned across sites (standardized protocol) with a different compound. All protocols resulted in consistent treatment effects across laboratories, which were also replicated within laboratories across the different stages. Harmonization of protocols across laboratories reduced between-lab variability substantially compared to each lab using their local protocol. In contrast, the environmental factors chosen to introduce systematic variation within laboratories did not affect the behavioral outcome. Therefore, heterogenization did not reduce between-lab variability further compared to the harmonization of the standardized protocol. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that subtle variations between lab-specific study protocols may introduce variation across independent replicate studies even after protocol harmonization and that systematic heterogenization of environmental factors may not be sufficient to account for such between-lab variation. Differences in replicability of results within and between laboratories highlight the ubiquity of study-specific variation due to between-lab variability, the importance of transparent and fine-grained reporting of methodologies and research protocols, and the importance of independent study replication.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among women of reproductive age group attending Gaur Provincial Hospital: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anemia is a principal public health concern. Worldwide one-third of women of reproductive age are affected. A 2016 survey showed that 41% of women in Nepal had anemia with the highest prevalence in Pradesh two. A complex interaction among socio-political, biological, and ecological elements determines anemia. Assessing the factors would help in minimizing anemia and its consequences. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of anemia in the reproductive age group and the factors affecting anemia.    Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women of the reproductive age group (15–45) from 15th April to 15th June 2022 after ethical clearance was obtained from the Nepal health research council (Ref. 2737/2022). Regarding data collection, 375 women participants were selected via a simple random sampling technique. Participants underwent an interview after informed written consent followed by blood sample collection. Through a semi-structured questionnaire, the data was obtained. Then data entry and its analysis were performed via Microsoft Excel 2019 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.0.    Results: The study showed that 229 (61.3%) females of the reproductive age group had anemia. Inadequate nutrition (OR 3.0, 1.9–5.0), breastfeeding (OR 7.3, 4.5–11.9), and rural place of residence (OR 4.2, 2.5–7.0) were significantly associated with anemia, with a corresponding odds ratio at 95% confidence each.    Conclusions: The prevalence of anemia was higher among women of the reproductive age group compared to provincial and national prevalence. The interventions should be focused on breastfeeding, nutrition, and rural women to combat anemia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The RAM signaling pathway links morphology, thermotolerance, and CO2 tolerance in the global fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans</a></h4>

              
                The environmental pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> claims over 180,000 lives each year. Survival of this basidiomycete at host CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations has only recently been considered an important virulence trait. Through screening gene knockout libraries constructed in a CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant clinical strain, we found mutations leading to CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity are enriched in pathways activated by heat stress, including calcineurin, Ras1-Cdc24, cell wall integrity, and Regulator of Ace2 and Morphogenesis (RAM). Overexpression of Cbk1, the conserved terminal kinase of the RAM pathway, partially restored defects of these mutants at host CO<sub>2</sub> or temperature levels. In ascomycetes such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>, transcription factor Ace2 is an important target of Cbk1, activating genes responsible for cell separation. However, no Ace2 homolog or any downstream component of the RAM pathway has been identified in basidiomycetes. Through <i>in vitro</i> evolution and comparative genomics, we characterized mutations in suppressors of <i>cbk1</i>D in <i>C. neoformans</i> that partially rescued defects in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance, thermotolerance, and morphology. One suppressor is the RNA translation repressor Ssd1, which is highly conserved in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The other is a novel ribonuclease domain-containing protein, here named <i>PSC1</i>, which is present in basidiomycetes and humans but surprisingly absent in most ascomycetes. Loss of Ssd1 in <i>cbk1</i>D partially restored cryptococcal ability to survive and amplify in the inhalation and intravenous murine models of cryptococcosis. Our discoveries highlight the overlapping regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance and thermotolerance, the essential role of the RAM pathway in cryptococcal adaptation to the host condition, and the potential importance of post-transcriptional control of virulence traits in this global pathogen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phenotyping single-cell motility in microfluidic confinement</a></h4>

              
                The movement trajectories of organisms serve as dynamic read-outs of their behaviour and physiology. For microorganisms this can be difficult to resolve due to their small size and fast movement. Here, we devise a novel droplet microfluidics assay to encapsulate single micron-sized algae inside closed arenas, enabling ultralong high-speed tracking of the same cell. Comparing two model species - <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (freshwater, 2 cilia), and <i>Pyramimonas octopus</i> (marine, 8 cilia), we detail their highly-stereotyped yet contrasting swimming behaviours and environmental interactions. By measuring the rates and probabilities with which cells transition between a trio of motility states (smooth-forward swimming, quiescence, tumbling or excitable backward swimming), we reconstruct the control network that underlies this gait switching dynamics. A simplified model of cell-roaming in circular confinement reproduces the observed long-term behaviours and spatial fluxes, including novel boundary circulation behaviour. Finally, we establish an assay in which pairs of droplets are fused on demand, one containing a trapped cell with another containing a chemical that perturbs cellular excitability, to reveal how aneural microorganisms adapt their locomotor patterns in real-time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptome-wide association study and eQTL colocalization identify potentially causal genes responsible for human bone mineral density GWAS associations</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for bone mineral density (BMD) in humans have identified over 1100 associations to date. However, identifying causal genes implicated by such studies has been challenging. Recent advances in the development of transcriptome reference datasets and computational approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) colocalization have proven to be informative in identifying putatively causal genes underlying GWAS associations. Here, we used TWAS/eQTL colocalization in conjunction with transcriptomic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to identify potentially causal genes for the largest BMD GWAS performed to date. Using this approach, we identified 512 genes as significant using both TWAS and eQTL colocalization. This set of genes was enriched for regulators of BMD and members of bone relevant biological processes. To investigate the significance of our findings, we selected <i>PPP6R3</i>, the gene with the strongest support from our analysis which was not previously implicated in the regulation of BMD, for further investigation. We observed that <i>Ppp6r3</i> deletion in mice decreased BMD. In this work, we provide an updated resource of putatively causal BMD genes and demonstrate that <i>PPP6R3</i> is a putatively causal BMD GWAS gene. These data increase our understanding of the genetics of BMD and provide further evidence for the utility of combined TWAS/colocalization approaches in untangling the genetics of complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A general approach for stabilizing nanobodies for intracellular expression</a></h4>

              
                Conventional antibodies and their derived fragments are difficult to deploy against intracellular targets in live cells, due to their bulk and structural complexity. Nanobodies provide an alternative modality, with well-documented examples of intracellular expression. Despite their promise as intracellular reagents, there has not been a systematic study of nanobody intracellular expression. Here, we examined intracellular expression of 75 nanobodies from the Protein Data Bank. Surprisingly, a majority of these nanobodies were unstable in cells, illustrated by aggregation and clearance. Using comparative analysis and framework mutagenesis, we developed a general approach that stabilized a great majority of nanobodies that were originally unstable intracellularly, without significantly compromising target binding. This approach led to the identification of distinct sequence features that impacted the intracellular stability of tested nanobodies. Mutationally stabilized nanobody expression was found to extend to in vivo contexts, in the murine retina and in <i>E. coli</i>. These data provide for improvements in nanobody engineering for intracellular applications, potentiating a growing field of intracellular interrogation and intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortex-wide response mode of VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons by reward and punishment</a></h4>

              
                Neocortex is classically divided into distinct areas, each specializing in different function, but all could benefit from reinforcement feedback to inform and update local processing. Yet it remains elusive how global signals like reward and punishment are represented in local cortical computations. Previously, we identified a cortical neuron type, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, in auditory cortex that is recruited by behavioral reinforcers and mediates disinhibitory control by inhibiting other inhibitory neurons. As the same disinhibitory cortical circuit is present virtually throughout cortex, we wondered whether VIP neurons are likewise recruited by reinforcers throughout cortex. We monitored VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical regions using three-dimensional random access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry while mice learned an auditory discrimination task. We found that reward and punishment during initial learning produce rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither the weak sensory tuning of VIP interneurons in visual cortex nor their arousal state modulation was fully predictive of reinforcer responses. We suggest that the global response mode of cortical VIP interneurons supports a cell-type-specific circuit mechanism by which organism-level information about reinforcers regulates local circuit processing and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Centrally expressed Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel is critical for the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel is a major molecular actor of neuropathic pain in peripheral sensory neurons, but its involvement at the supra-spinal level is almost unknown. In the Anterior Pretectum (APT), a hub of connectivity of the somatosensory system involved in pain perception, we show that Cav3.2 channels are expressed in a sub-population of GABAergic neurons co-expressing parvalbumin (PV). In these PV-expressing neurons, Cav3.2 channels contribute to a high frequency bursting activity, which is increased in the spared nerve injury model of neuropathy. Specific deletion of Cav3.2 channels in APT neurons reduced both the initiation and maintenance of mechanical and cold allodynia. These data are a direct demonstration that centrally expressed Cav3.2 channels also play a fundamental role in pain pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multivalency, autoinhibition, and protein disorder in the regulation of interactions of dynein intermediate chain with dynactin and the nuclear distribution protein</a></h4>

              
                As the only major retrograde transporter along microtubules, cytoplasmic dynein plays crucial roles in the intracellular transport of organelles and other cargoes. Central to the function of this motor protein complex is dynein intermediate chain (IC), which binds the three dimeric dynein light chains at multivalent sites, and dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup> and nuclear distribution protein (NudE) at overlapping sites of its intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. The disorder in IC has hindered cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography studies of its structure and interactions. Here we use a suite of biophysical methods to reveal how multivalent binding of the three light chains regulate IC interactions with p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE. Using IC from <i>Chaetomium thermophilum</i>, a tractable species to interrogate IC interactions, we identify a significant reduction in binding affinity of IC to p150<sup>Glued</sup> and a loss of binding to NudE for constructs containing the entire N-terminal domain as well as for full-length constructs when compared to the tight binding observed with short IC constructs. We attribute this difference to autoinhibition caused by long-range intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal single α-helix of IC, the common site for p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE binding, and residues closer to the end of the N-terminal domain. Reconstitution of IC subcomplexes demonstrate that autoinhibition is differentially regulated by light chains binding, underscoring their importance both in assembly and organization of IC, and in selection between multiple binding partners at the same site.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Variation in the ACE2 receptor has limited utility for SARS-CoV-2 host prediction</a></h4>

              
                Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to other species threatens wildlife conservation and may create novel sources of viral diversity for future zoonotic transmission. A variety of computational heuristics have been developed to pre-emptively identify susceptible host species based on variation in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor used for viral entry. However, the predictive performance of these heuristics remains unknown. Using a newly compiled database of 96 species, we show that, while variation in ACE2 can be used by machine learning models to accurately predict animal susceptibility to sarbecoviruses (accuracy = 80.2%, binomial confidence interval [CI]: 70.8–87.6%), the sites informing predictions have no known involvement in virus binding and instead recapitulate host phylogeny. Models trained on host phylogeny alone performed equally well (accuracy = 84.4%, CI: 75.5–91.0%) and at a level equivalent to retrospective assessments of accuracy for previously published models. These results suggest that the predictive power of ACE2-based models derives from strong correlations with host phylogeny rather than processes which can be mechanistically linked to infection biology. Further, biased availability of ACE2 sequences misleads projections of the number and geographic distribution of at-risk species. Models based on host phylogeny reduce this bias, but identify a very large number of susceptible species, implying that model predictions must be combined with local knowledge of exposure risk to practically guide surveillance. Identifying barriers to viral infection or onward transmission beyond receptor binding and incorporating data which are independent of host phylogeny will be necessary to manage the ongoing risk of establishment of novel animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

                Infection with the etiological agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, appears capable of impacting cognition, which some patients with Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). To evaluate neuro-pathophysiological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examine transcriptional and cellular signatures in the Broadman area 9 (BA9) of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation (HF) in SARS-CoV-2, Alzheimers disease (AD) and SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals, compared to age- and gender-matched neurological cases. Here we show similar alterations of neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier integrity in SARS-CoV-2, AD, and SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals. Distribution of microglial changes reflected by the increase of Iba-1 reveal nodular morphological alterations in SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals. Similarly, HIF-1 is significantly upregulated in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same brain regions regardless of AD status. The finding may help to inform decision-making regarding therapeutic treatments in patients with neuro-PASC, especially those at increased risk of developing AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deficits in integrative NMDA receptors caused by Grin1 disruption can be rescued in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are critical for cognitive function, and their reduced expression leads to intellectual disability. Since subpopulations of NMDARs exist in distinct subcellular environments, their functioning may be unevenly vulnerable to genetic disruption. Here, we investigate synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs on the major output neurons of the prefrontal cortex in mice deficient for the obligate NMDAR subunit encoded by Grin1 and wild-type littermates. With whole-cell recording in brain slices, we find that single, low-intensity stimuli elicit surprisingly-similar glutamatergic synaptic currents in both genotypes. By contrast, clear genotype differences emerge with manipulations that recruit extrasynaptic NMDARs, including stronger, repetitive, or pharmacological stimulation. These results reveal a disproportionate functional deficit of extrasynaptic NMDARs compared to their synaptic counterparts. To probe the repercussions of this deficit, we examine an NMDAR-dependent phenomenon considered a building block of cognitive integration, basal dendrite plateau potentials. Since we find this phenomenon is readily evoked in wild-type but not in Grin1-deficient mice, we ask whether plateau potentials can be restored by an adult intervention to increase Grin1 expression. This genetic manipulation, previously shown to restore cognitive performance in adulthood, successfully rescues electrically-evoked basal dendrite plateau potentials after a lifetime of NMDAR compromise. Taken together, our work demonstrates NMDAR subpopulations are not uniformly vulnerable to the genetic disruption of their obligate subunit. Furthermore, the window for functional rescue of the more-sensitive integrative NMDARs remains open into adulthood.

                We investigated the modulatory effects of cathodal High-Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) on risk-taking. Methods: Thirty-four healthy adults underwent 3 independent cathodal HD-tDCS interventions (DLPFC, VLPFC, sham) delivered in counterbalanced order during the performance of the balloon analogue risk task (autoBART). Participants were clustered post-hoc in 3 separate personality profiles according to the HEXACO-60 and the Dark Triad dirty dozen and we reanalysed the data. Results: Dorsal prefrontal cathodal HD-tDCS significantly modulated autoBART performance rendering participants less prone to risk-taking (i.e., more conservative) under left DLPFC HD-tDCS compared to left VLPFC or sham stimulation. The re-analysis of the same dataset, taking into consideration personality traits, suggested specific effects in impulsive-disinhibited and normative participants for DLPFC and VLPFC stimulation, respectively. Specifically, we saw that participants classified as impulsive-disinhibited were more affected by HD-tDCS left DLPFC stimulation than other profiles. Conclusions: Both, dorsal and ventral prefrontal active HD-tDCS decrease risk-taking behaviour compared to sham stimulation. Importantly, such effects are likely influenced by personality traits (impulsive disinhibited vs normative) exhibited by the participants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential reach vector computations in mIPS and PMd as revealed through HD-tDCS</a></h4>

              
                Recent neural and behavioural findings provide support that the medial intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) and dorsal premotor (PMd) activity reflect aspects of a kinematic plan for reaching movements. However, it is unclear how these two regions differentially contribute to reach planning. Here, we used high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS; 4 x 1 electrode placement; 2 mA for 20 min; 3 cm radius) to investigate the functional roles of mIPS and PMd in the left hemisphere of humans. We examined the changes in endpoint error in reaching task with different initial hand positions and different target locations spanning both visual hemi-fields. Participants completed the task with (stimulation, post-stimulation) and without stimulation (pre-stimulation) of individually fMRI-localized cortical areas mIPS and PMd. We found a significant interaction effect between initial hand position (IHP) and target position on the difference in horizontal endpoint error after cathodal left mIPS stimulation and significant IHP and target position main effects after cathodal left PMd stimulation, suggesting that IHP and target position are not yet integrated into a movement vector at the input of the mIPS, but are integrated in the input of PMd. Hence, these findings reveal a distinction between mIPS and PMd in the stages of movement vector formation for reaching movements and indicate that HD-tDCS is a viable method for perturbing localized cortical activity to elucidate localized cortical function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">IFNγ drives neuroinflammation and demyelination in a mouse model of multiple system atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal synucleinopathy characterized by insoluble alpha-synuclein (-syn) cytoplasmic inclusions located within oligodendroglia. Neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration are correlated with areas of GCI pathology, however it is not known what specifically drives disease pathogenesis. Recently in a mouse model of MSA, CD4+ T cells have been shown to drive neuroinflammation and demyelination, however the mechanism by which this occurs also remains unclear. In this study we use genetic and pharmacological approaches in a novel model of MSA to show that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) drives neuroinflammation and demyelination. Furthermore, using an IFN{gamma} reporter mouse, we found that infiltrating CD4+ T cells were the primary producers of IFN{gamma} in response to -syn overexpression in oligodendrocytes. Results from these studies indicate that IFN{gamma} expression in CD4 T cells drives -syn-mediated neuroinflammation and demyelination, and strategies to target IFN{gamma} expression may be a potential disease modifying therapeutic strategy for MSA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tau pathology in the dorsal raphe may be a prodromal indicator of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregation in brainstem nuclei is thought to occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its specific role in driving prodromal symptoms and disease progression is largely unknown. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contains a large population of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurons that regulate mood, reward-related behavior, and sleep, all of which are disrupted in AD. We report here that tau pathology is present in the DRN of cognitively intact individuals 54-80 years of age, whereas synuclein and TDP-43 are relatively absent. Almost all AD cases had tau pathology in the DRN, whereas only a subset contained TDP-43 or synuclein, but not both. Mice overexpressing human P301L-tau in the DRN also exhibited depressive-like behaviors and hyperactivity without any deficits in spatial memory. There was a negative correlation between the density of Tph2-expressing neurons and phospho-tau (ptau) optical density in P301L-tauDRN mice, although mean Tph2 expression did not differ significantly from the controls. 5-HT neurons were hyperexcitable in P301L-tauDRN mice, and there was an increase in the amplitude of excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) which is suggestive of increased glutamatergic transmission. Astrocytic density was also elevated in the DRN and accompanied by an increase in GFAP expression, as well as changes in Htr2a, Htr2c, and Htr3a gene expression. Additionally, tau pathology was detected in axonal processes in the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and caudate putamen, suggesting that tau may spread in an anterograde manner to regions outside the DRN. Together, these results suggest that tau pathology accumulates in the DRN in a subset of individuals over 50 years and may lead to prodromal AD symptoms, 5-HT neuronal dysfunction, and activation of local astrocytes. The presence of tau pathology in the DRN combined with psychiatric assessments for depression may be a useful screening tool for individuals at risk for AD.

                It has long been known that human breathing is altered during listening and speaking compared to rest. Theoretical models of human communication suggest two distinct phenomena during speaking and listening: During speaking, inhalation depth is adjusted to the air volume required for the upcoming utterance. During listening, inhalation is temporally aligned to inhalation of the speaker. While evidence for the former is relatively strong, it is virtually absent for the latter. We address both questions using recordings of speech envelope and respiration in 30 participants during 14 minutes of speaking and listening. We extend existing evidence for the first phenomenon by using the speech envelope to show that inhalation depth is positively correlated with the total power of the speech envelope in the following utterance. Pertaining to the second phenomenon, we provide first evidence that inhalation during listening to your own speech is significantly more likely at time points of inhalation during speaking. These findings are compatible with models that postulate alignment of internal forward models of interlocutors with the aim to facilitate communication.

                Early-life adversity impacts on anxiety-related behaviors in adulthood. The effects of such adversity not only affects the animal itself, but can be passed on transgenerationally. Pervasive effects of experimentally-induced early-life stress (ELS) have been documented in adult zebrafish but it is not clear if this can be passed on via the germline. Here, we investigated the effects of ELS across three generations, by analyzing the responses of adult animals exposed to ELS in two different anxiety-related tasks, as well as in social behavior, memory, and cognition. Animals exposed to ELS (at 7 days-post-fertilization) showed a marked attenuation of specific anxiety-related behaviors (F0) when adults, and these alterations were maintained across two subsequent generations (F1 and F2). These findings suggest that zebrafish may be a useful model organism to study the transgenerational effects of ELS, and how this pertains to (for example) neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, our data may naturally provoke questions regarding the consideration of the environment of laboratory-housed zebrafish at early developmental stages. In particular, more work may be necessary to determine how different environmental stressors could affect data variability across laboratories.

                The retina, behind the transparent optics of the eye, is the only neural tissue whose physiology and pathology can be non-invasively probed by optical microscopy. The aberrations intrinsic to the mouse eye, however, prevent high-resolution investigation of retinal structure and function in vivo. Optimizing the design of a two-photon fluorescence microscope (2PFM) and sample preparation procedure, we found that adaptive optics (AO), by measuring and correcting ocular aberrations, is essential for resolving synapses and achieving three-dimensional cellular resolution in the mouse retina in vivo. Applying AO-2PFM to longitudinal retinal imaging in transgenic models of retinal pathology, we characterized microvascular lesions and observed microglial migration in a proliferative vascular retinopathy model, and found Lidocaine to effectively suppress retinal ganglion cell hyperactivity in a retinal degeneration model. Tracking structural and functional changes at high resolution longitudinally, AO-2PFM enables microscopic investigations of retinal pathology and pharmacology for disease diagnosis and treatment in vivo.

                Tinnitus affects roughly 15-20% of the population while severely impacting 10% of those afflicted. Tinnitus pathology is multifactorial, generally initiated by damage to the auditory periphery, resulting in a cascade of maladaptive plastic changes at multiple levels of the central auditory neuraxis as well as limbic and non-auditory cortical centers. Using a well-established condition-suppression model of tinnitus, we measured tinnitus-related changes in the microcircuits of excitatory/inhibitory neurons onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons (PNs), as well as changes in the excitability of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1). Patch-clamp recordings from PNs in A1 slices showed tinnitus-related increases in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and decreases in spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). Both measures were directly correlated to the rat's behavioral evidence of tinnitus. Tinnitus-related changes in PN excitability were independent of changes in A1 excitatory or inhibitory cell numbers. VIP neurons, part of an A1 local circuit that can disinhibit layer 5 PNs, showed significant tinnitus-related increases in excitability that directly correlated with the rat's behavioral tinnitus score. That PN and VIP changes directly correlated to tinnitus behavior, suggests an essential role in A1 tinnitus pathology. Tinnitus-related A1 changes were similar to findings in studies of neuropathic pain in somatosensory cortex suggesting a common pathology of these troublesome perceptual impairments. Improved understanding between excitatory, inhibitory and disinhibitory sensory cortical circuits can serve as a model for testing therapeutic approaches to the treatment of tinnitus and chronic pain.

	<p>The brain lesions images of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) patients are slightly different from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging of normal people, and the classification effect of general image recognition technology is not ideal. Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s datasets are small, making it difficult to train large-scale neural networks. In this paper, we propose a network model (WS-AMN) that fuses weak supervision and an attention mechanism. The weakly supervised data augmentation network is used as the basic model, the attention map generated by weakly supervised learning is used to guide the data augmentation, and an attention module with channel domain and spatial domain is embedded in the residual network to focus on the distinctive channels and spaces of images respectively. The location information enhances the corresponding features of related features and suppresses the influence of irrelevant features.The results show that the F1-score is 99.63%, the accuracy is 99.61%. Our model provides a high-performance solution for accurate classification of AD.</p>

	<p>Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of risk factors in predicting the variation in carotid atherosclerosis at ultrasonographic follow-up and, therefore, its role in the progression of large-vessel disease. Methods: This retrospective population study included all the outpatients that underwent at least two carotid ultrasonographies at our laboratory from 2001 to 2017. Demographic data, vascular risk factors, and the results at follow-up were analysed to determine if correlations exist between these risk factors and variation in carotid atherosclerosis. Results: Data from 600 patients (327 males and 273 females with a mean age of 67 years) were collected. The mean follow-up period was 49 months (range: 1&amp;amp;ndash;195). We analysed each demographic variable and risk factor to assess its correlation with a worsening of carotid atherosclerosis; previous myocardial infarction (2.594), previous carotid surgical treatment (2.368), and hypertension (1.85) were found to have the highest odds ratios, respectively. Furthermore, the sample was divided into specific subpopulations (diabetes, hypertension, and smoking), and an association was found between age and worsening stenosis. Discussion and conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of carotid ultrasonographic follow-up in the monitoring and managing of large-vessel disease. Myocardial infarction, previous stroke, and previous surgical treatment were the strongest predictors of a worsening of carotid atherosclerosis. These findings suggest a strict follow-up is needed, even in the absence of significant carotid atherosclerosis at baseline.</p>

	<p>Spatial cognition facilitates the successful completion of specific cognitive tasks through lateral processing and neuroplasticity. Long-term training in table tennis induces neural processing efficiency in the visuospatial cognitive processing cortex of athletes. However, the lateralization characteristics and neural mechanisms of visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial cognitive processing in table tennis players in non-sport domains are unclear. This study utilized event-related potentials to investigate differences in the spatial cognition abilities of regular college students (controls) and table tennis players. A total of 48 participants (28 controls; 20 s-level national table tennis players) completed spatial cognitive tasks while electroencephalography data were recorded. Task performance was better in the table tennis group than in the control group (reaction time: P &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; correct number/sec: P = 0.043), P3 amplitude was greater in the table tennis group (P = 0.040), spatial cognition showed obvious lateralization characteristics (P &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), table tennis players showed a more obvious right-hemisphere advantage, and the P3 amplitude in the right hemisphere was significantly greater in table tennis athletes than in the control group. (P = 0.044). Our findings demonstrate a right-hemisphere advantage in spatial cognition. Long-term training strengthened the visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial processing ability of table tennis players, and this advantage effect was reflected in the neuroplasticity of the right hemisphere (the dominant hemisphere for spatial processing).</p>

	<p>Subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation (STN-DBS), in addition to a rapid improvement of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) motor symptoms, can exert fast, local, neuromodulator activity, reducing &amp;amp;beta;-synchronous oscillations between STN and the motor cortex with possible antikinetic features. However, STN-DBS modulation of &amp;amp;beta;-band synchronization in extramotor cortical areas has been scarcely explored. For this aim, we investigated DBS-induced short-term effects on EEG-based cortical functional connectivity (FC) in &amp;amp;beta; bands in six PD patients who underwent STN-DBS within the past year. A 10 min, 64-channel EEG recording was performed twice: in DBS-OFF and 60 min after DBS activation. Seven age-matched controls performed EEG recordings as the control group. A source-reconstruction method was used to identify brain-region activity. The FC was calculated using a weighted phase-lag index in &amp;amp;beta; bands. Group comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon test. The PD patients showed a widespread cortical hyperconnectivity in &amp;amp;beta; bands in both DBS-OFF and -ON states compared to the controls. Moreover, switching on STN-DBS determined an acute reduction in &amp;amp;beta; FC, primarily involving corticocortical links of frontal, sensorimotor and limbic lobes. We hypothesize that an increase in &amp;amp;beta;-band connectivity in PD is a widespread cortical phenomenon and that STN-DBS could quickly reduce it in the cortical regions primarily involved in basal ganglia&amp;amp;ndash;cortical circuits.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD), formerly known as Brown&amp;amp;ndash;Vialetto&amp;amp;ndash;Van Laere syndrome, is a rare condition that causes a progressive neurological syndrome in early life with features of auditory and optic neuropathy, weakness of bulbar muscles and the diaphragm and sensorimotor neuropathy. Pathologic mutations in the genes that code for riboflavin transporters have been identified as the genetic basis of RTD, and the majority of the genetically confirmed cases are caused by mutations of SLC52A3, a riboflavin transporter 2 coding gene or compound mutations in SLC52A2, encoding riboflavin transporter 3. Fatality in childhood is common if the condition is left untreated, but survival into adulthood has been reported in cases treated with high-dose oral riboflavin. (2) Case summary: We report two long-term survivors of RTD type 2 due to compound heterozygous 185T&amp;amp;gt; G and 1258G&amp;amp;gt;A mutations in gene SLC2A2. They are two brothers in a family in which two female siblings died in childhood from a similar neurological disorder. Brother one, the older RTD survivor, is aged 71, and brother two is aged 58. Both have significant visual impairment from optic nerve atrophy and sensory ataxia. Their muscle biopsies showed decreased muscle adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase activity. No AMPD1 mutation was detected through whole-genome sequencing. (3) Conclusion: Co-existing riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD) type 2 and muscle AMP deaminase deficiency has not been previously reported. Apart from the possibility that there is a milder phenotype associated with these mutations in SLC2A2, AMP deaminase deficiency might have contributed to a survival benefit by preserving muscle function through accumulating intracellular AMP</p>

	<p>The presence of different clinical symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) of different sexes may be related to different neuropathological mechanisms. A total of 16 male patients with TRD, 18 female patients with TRD, 18 male healthy controls (HCs) and 19 female HCs completed this study. We used the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) method to analyze the results. Moreover, the correlation between abnormal brain areas and clinical symptoms in different sexes of the TRD groups was also analyzed. The effects of the sex-by-group interaction difference in ALFF among the four groups was located in the left middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left precuneus. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the male TRD group had lower ALFF in the left middle frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus compared with the female TRD group. There was a positive correlation between the left middle frontal gyrus, the left precuneus and the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scale (HAMD-17) scores, and a negative correlation between the left precentral gyrus and the HAMD-17 scores in the female TRD group. This study will provide some clinical reference value for the sex differences in neuropathological mechanisms of TRD.</p>

	<p>The presence of reward deficits in major depressive disorder is associated with abnormal striatal function. However, differences in striatal whole-brain functional between recurrent depressive episode (RDE) and first-episode depression (FDE) have not been elucidated. Thirty-three patients with RDE, 27 with FDE, and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for this study. A seed-based functional connectivity (FC) method was used to analyze abnormalities in six predefined striatal subregion circuits among the three groups of subjects and to further explore the correlation between abnormal FC and clinical symptoms. The results revealed that compared with the FDE group, the RDE group showed higher FC of the striatal subregion with the left middle occipital gyrus, left orbital area of the middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral posterior cerebellar gyrus, while showing lower FC of the striatal subregion with the right thalamus, left inferior parietal lobule, left middle cingulate gyrus, right angular gyrus, right cerebellum anterior lobe, and right caudate nucleus. In the RDE group, the HAMD-17 scores were positively correlated with the FC between the left dorsal rostral putamen and the left cerebellum posterior lobe. This study provides new insights into understanding the specificity of striatal circuits in the RDE group.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Suicidal ideation and attempts in youth are a growing health concern, and more data are needed regarding their biological underpinnings. Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disorder in youth and has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescent and adult populations, but data in younger children and early adolescents are lacking. We wished to study associations of asthma with childhood suicidality considering asthma&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential as a clinically relevant model for childhood chronic immune dysregulation. Methods: Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n = 11,876, 47.8% female, mean age 9.9 years at baseline assessment and 12.0 years at two-year follow-up), we assessed associations between asthma and suicidal ideation and attempts through baseline to two-year follow-up. Results: Asthma history as defined by parent report (n = 2282, 19.2% of study population) was associated with suicide attempts (SA) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, p = 0.01), and this association remained significant even when controlling for demographics, socioeconomic factors, and environmental factors (OR = 1.46, p = 0.028). History of asthma attacks was associated with both suicidal ideation (SI) and SA when controlling for demographics, socioeconomic factors, and environmental factors (OR = 1.27, p = 0.042; OR = 1.83, p = 0.004, respectively). The association of asthma attack with SA remained significant when controlling for self-reported psychopathology (OR = 1.92, p = 0.004). The total number of asthma attacks was associated with both SI and SA (OR = 1.03, p = 0.043; OR = 1.06, p = 0.05, respectively). Conclusions: Findings suggest an association between asthma and suicidality in early adolescence. Further research is needed to investigate mechanisms underlying this relationship.</p>

     alt="Cortical synapses of the world's smallest mammal: An FIB/SEM study in the Etruscan shrew"/><p>The present work provides a quantitative dataset of synapses from the Etruscan shrew (the smallest known terrestrial mammal). We have identified common and differing principles of synaptic organization compared to other mammalian species.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The main aim of the present study was to determine if synapses from the exceptionally small brain of the Etruscan shrew show any peculiarities compared to the much larger human brain. We analyzed the cortical synaptic density and a variety of structural characteristics of 7,239 3D reconstructed synapses, using using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM). We found that some of the general synaptic characteristics are remarkably similar to those found in the human cerebral cortex. However, the cortical volume of the human brain is about 50,000 times larger than the cortical volume of the Etruscan shrew, while the total number of cortical synapses in human is only 20,000 times the number of synapses in the shrew, and synaptic junctions are 35% smaller in the Etruscan shrew. Thus, the differences in the number and size of synapses cannot be attributed to a brain size scaling effect but rather to adaptations of synaptic circuits to particular functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chatbot to predict need of a stent in cardiac treatment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Every year, across the globe about 1,800,000 people suffers with heart attack and India has the highest rate in the world with almost 25% families having a member who suffered heart attack at least once. One of the solutions to reduce the heart attacks in patients is placing a stent. Once the blockage is identified, it is suggested that a stent with the required size is inserted into the coronary artery. The invasive device and its associated cost automatically leads to a dilemma for both the doctors as well as patients. The young practitioners of cardiology may face a dilemma sometimes whether to go for stent or not. The patients undergoing treatment for cardiac issues would be in a two state mind whether to go for stent or not. The above two dilemmas can be mitigated and confidence of both doctors and patients in decision making can be enhanced with the help of a technology driven application that suggests requirement of stent with a degree of confidence.  Methods: The chatbot in our project shall help in taking textual and image based inputs of the information of the heart and coronary artery of a patient and predicts the requirement of stent being placed. The real time data of 50 patients was used in training the model with a data set consisting of 349 scanned images of angiogram. The model developed consists of sequential CNN model with 5 convolutional 2D layers and 5 Maxpool layers.  Results: The model could achieve an accuracy of 81%. Conclusions: The authors have successfully developed and tested a machine learning based chatbot model to predict the need of a stent in cardiac treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study among final year medical students at the University of Zambia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Since the globe was faced with the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, numerous adjustments have been made in all sectors to curtail the spread of infection. Most elementary and tertiary schools were closed or suspended until the transmission rates dropped. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, medical schools in Zambia have sought ways to replace face-to-face medical learning with virtual clinical teaching. The objectives of this study were to explore the perceptions of online learning among University of Zambia medical students and understand the barriers and facilitators to effective online learning. Methods A qualitative descriptive approach was used, enrolling final year medical students from the University of Zambia; the consenting participants were sampled purposively and interviewed through virtual platforms until data saturation was reached upon interviewing the 11th participant. A total of 14 participants were interviewed, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and data was analyzed using six steps of thematic analysis. Results Three broad themes arose from the interviews: online learning perceptions, facilitators and barriers to online learning. Regarding perceptions of online learning, they highlighted that the delivery was simple to understand, with convenient scheduling and the benefit of being able to refer back to the recorded lectures. Some barriers encountered during the online learning were poor network connection, frequent power outages, lack of patient-student interaction and challenges with learning space in their homes. The facilitators were self-paced learning, availability of lecturers and the desire to complete their training despite the lockdown being in effect. Conclusions Most medical students had positive perceptions of online learning despite its challenges. With the improvement in technology, online education should be incorporated into the traditional training of medical students to get the best outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">IL1B gene variants, but not TNF, CXCL8, IL6 and IL10, modify the course of cystic fibrosis in Polish patients. [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether selected polymorphic variants in genes from the inflammatory pathway can be predictors of pulmonary or digestive manifestation of cystic fibrosis, as well as of severity of lung disease. Materials and methods: Using pyrosequencing and sequencing we have genotyped 12 variants in TNF (rs361525, rs1800629), CXCL8 (rs4073, rs2227306, rs2227307, rs188378669), IL1B (rs16944, rs1143634, rs1142639, rs1143627), IL6 (rs1800795) and IL10 (rs1800896) genes in a cohort of 55 Polish patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis and controls. In our study group, a pulmonary manifestation of disease revealed 44 of subjects (80%), and digestive symptoms dominated in 11 (20%) of analyzed individuals. Severe lung dysfunction has occurred in 20 (36.4%) of patients. Results: We proved, that two promoter variants of IL1B, rs1143627 (c.-118G > A) and rs16944 (c.-598T > C) are presented significantly more often  in patients with severe character of lung disease compared to mild (82.5% vs. 62.8%, p-value 0.030, and 87.5% vs. 64.3%, p-value 0.008, respectively) in cystic fibrosis course. Haplotype AC formed by both changes had also a higher frequency (80%) in patients with severe course compared to the mild character (61.4%) of disease. However, the frequency of promoter variant TNF c.-308C > T (rs1800629) was presented at a significantly lower level in the patient’s group compared to healthy controls (2.7% vs. 15%, p-value 0.001). Furthermore, the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus significantly correlated with the lower FEV1% in patients (p-value 0.01). Conclusions: Genetic variants, rs1143627 and rs16944, of IL1B are promising candidates as predictors of the severe character of lung disease in Polish patients with cystic fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in chronic kidney disease (CKD) individuals [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that has rapidly spread across the world with a detrimental effect on the global population. Several reports have highlighted an increased mortality rate and a higher severity of COVID-19 infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) individuals. Upon the development of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, mRNA vaccines including BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were deemed safe, with a high efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in the general population. This review investigates whether  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are as effective in triggering an immune response in Dialysis Patients (DPs) and Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs) and if a third dose is required in this  population. Methods: A systematic search employing the PRISMA criteria was conducted in several major databases, with the data being extracted from publications for the period January 2021 to May 2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022338514, June 15, 2022). Results: 80 studies were included in this analysis with a total cohort number of 15,059 participants. Overall, 85.29% (OR = 17.08, 95% CI = 15.84-18.42, I2 = 98%) and 41.06% (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.48-0.5, I2 = 95%) of DPs and KTRs included in this review showed positive seroconversion after two doses of either mRNA vaccine, respectively. A total 76% (OR = 6.53, 95% CI = 5.63-7.5, I2 = 96%) of the cohort given a third dose of an mRNA vaccine demonstrated positive seroconversion, with 61.86% (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.95-2.75 I2 = 95%) of the cohort that was assessed for a cellular response displaying a positive response. Conclusions: This data emphasises a reduced incidence of a positive immune response in DPs and KTRs compared to healthy controls, albeit a better response in DPs than when compared to KTRs alone was observed. A third dose  appears to increase the occurrence of an immune response in the overall DP/KTR cohort.

                Background: Accounting practices, profit bubbles, information manipulation and deception, and earning management are all examples of fraudulent financial statement cases. Companies create fraudulent financial statements for a variety of reasons, including financial challenges and debt payment delays. Financial fraud is created by five factors: pressure, opportunity, rationalization, capability, and arrogance. Methods: The purpose of this study is to see whether audit quality (AQ) has a moderating effect on the relationship between financial distress (FD) and earning management (EM) to financial statement fraud (FSF) in infrastructure, utility, and transportation companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the years 2015 to 2019. The data sources are the www.idx.go.id and the company’s annual reports. Purposive sampling was used to collect data from thirty companies over the course of five years, totaling 150 observations. Moderating regression analysis (MRA) was used in data analysis. Result and conclusions: The hypothesis testing revealed that FD and EM have a significant impact on FSF.  AQ is able to moderate the relationship between FD to FSF but unable to moderate the relationship between EM to FSF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Reversal and subsequent return of optic disc cupping in a myocilin (MYOC) gene-associated severe Juvenile Open-Angle Glaucoma (JOAG) patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                To our knowledge, this case report describes the first instance of reversal of glaucomatous optic nerve cupping in a young adult with a rare form of juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) associated with a novel variant of the myocilin gene (MYOC). This 25-year-old woman with severe-stage MYOC-associated JOAG presented with blurry vision and intermittent pain in her left eye. She had a strong family history of glaucoma in multiple first-degree relatives with an identified novel variant of MYOC. Examination revealed intraocular pressures (IOPs) of 10 mmHg OD and 46 mmHg OS, with cup-to-disc ratios of 0.90 and 0.80. The patient experienced substantial reversal of optic disc cupping OS following dramatic IOP reduction with trabeculectomy, and subsequently experienced a return of cupping after an IOP spike 15 months postoperatively. The reversal of cupping did not correspond to any changes in the patient’s visual field. After an initial decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, RNFL remained stable for over 2 years after trabeculectomy as seen on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). This case suggests reversal of cupping can occur well into adulthood in a MYOC-associated JOAG patient, and it demonstrates the potential bidirectionality of this phenomenon. Moreover, it suggests that these structural changes may not correspond to any functional changes in visual fields or RNFL thickness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Exploring the mono-/bistability range of positively autoregulated signaling systems in the presence of competing transcription factor binding sites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rong Gao, Samantha E. Brokaw, Zeyue Li, Libby J. Helfant, Ti Wu, Muhammad Malik, Ann M. Stock</p>

Binding of transcription factor (TF) proteins to regulatory DNA sites is key to accurate control of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. Theoretical modeling of transcription regulation is often focused on a limited set of genes of interest, while binding of the TF to other genomic sites is seldom considered. The total number of TF binding sites (TFBSs) affects the availability of TF protein molecules and sequestration of a TF by TFBSs can promote bistability. For many signaling systems where a graded response is desirable for continuous control over the input range, biochemical parameters of the regulatory proteins need be tuned to avoid bistability. Here we analyze the mono-/bistable parameter range for positively autoregulated two-component systems (TCSs) in the presence of different numbers of competing TFBSs. TCS signaling, one of the major bacterial signaling strategies, couples signal perception with output responses via protein phosphorylation. For bistability, competition for TF proteins by TFBSs lowers the requirement for high fold change of the autoregulated transcription but demands high phosphorylation activities of TCS proteins. We show that bistability can be avoided with a low phosphorylation capacity of TCSs, a high TF affinity for the autoregulated promoter or a low fold change in signaling protein levels upon induction. These may represent general design rules for TCSs to ensure uniform graded responses. Examining the mono-/bistability parameter range allows qualitative prediction of steady-state responses, which are experimentally validated in the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> CusRS system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Look twice: A generalist computational model predicts return fixations across tasks and species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mengmi Zhang, Marcelo Armendariz, Will Xiao, Olivia Rose, Katarina Bendtz, Margaret Livingstone, Carlos Ponce, Gabriel Kreiman</p>

Primates constantly explore their surroundings via saccadic eye movements that bring different parts of an image into high resolution. In addition to exploring new regions in the visual field, primates also make frequent return fixations, revisiting previously foveated locations. We systematically studied a total of 44,328 return fixations out of 217,440 fixations. Return fixations were ubiquitous across different behavioral tasks, in monkeys and humans, both when subjects viewed static images and when subjects performed natural behaviors. Return fixations locations were consistent across subjects, tended to occur within short temporal offsets, and typically followed a 180-degree turn in saccadic direction. To understand the origin of return fixations, we propose a proof-of-principle, biologically-inspired and image-computable neural network model. The model combines five key modules: an image feature extractor, bottom-up saliency cues, task-relevant visual features, finite inhibition-of-return, and saccade size constraints. Even though there are no free parameters that are fine-tuned for each specific task, species, or condition, the model produces fixation sequences resembling the universal properties of return fixations. These results provide initial steps towards a mechanistic understanding of the trade-off between rapid foveal recognition and the need to scrutinize previous fixation locations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Effective resistance against pandemics: Mobility network sparsification for high-fidelity epidemic simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Mercier, Samuel Scarpino, Cristopher Moore</p>

Network science has increasingly become central to the field of epidemiology and our ability to respond to infectious disease threats. However, many networks derived from modern datasets are not just large, but dense, with a high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human mobility networks where most locations have a large number of links to many other locations. Simulating large-scale epidemics requires substantial computational resources and in many cases is practically infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of simulating epidemics on these networks is <i>sparsification</i>, where a representative subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their importance. We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S. Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most accurate approach uses the <i>effective resistances</i> of edges, which prioritizes edges that are the only efficient way to travel between their endpoints. The resulting sparse network preserves many aspects of the behavior of an SIR model, including both global quantities, like the epidemic size, and local details of stochastic events, including the probability each node becomes infected and its distribution of arrival times. This holds even when the sparse network preserves fewer than 10% of the edges of the original network. In addition to its practical utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a weighted, undirected network are most important to disease spread.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpreting and de-noising genetically engineered barcodes in a DNA virus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sylvain Blois, Benjamin M. Goetz, James J. Bull, Christopher S. Sullivan</p>

The concept of a nucleic acid barcode applied to pathogen genomes is easy to grasp and the many possible uses are straightforward. But implementation may not be easy, especially when growing through multiple generations or assaying the pathogen long-term. The potential problems include: the barcode might alter fitness, the barcode may accumulate mutations, and construction of the marked pathogens may result in unintended barcodes that are not as designed. Here, we generate approximately 5000 randomized barcodes in the genome of the prototypic small DNA virus murine polyomavirus. We describe the challenges faced with interpreting the barcode sequences obtained from the library. Our Illumina NextSeq sequencing recalled much greater variation in barcode sequencing reads than the expected 5000 barcodes–necessarily stemming from the Illumina library processing and sequencing error. Using data from defined control virus genomes cloned into plasmid backbones we develop a vetted post-sequencing method to cluster the erroneous reads around the true virus genome barcodes. These findings may foreshadow problems with randomized barcodes in other microbial systems and provide a useful approach for future work utilizing nucleic acid barcoded pathogens.

     alt="Vascular perfusion differs in two distinct PDGFRβ-positive zones within the ischemic core of male mice 2 weeks following photothrombotic stroke"/>
<p>Blood vessels in the ischemic core and peri-lesion are capable of flow 2 weeks post-photothrombotic stroke. There are two PDGFRβ-positive zones within the ischemic core, one which resembles fibrotic scarring, adjacent to a GFAP-positive peri-lesion, whereas the other is primarily vessel associated.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Stroke therapy has largely focused on preventing damage and encouraging repair outside the ischemic core, as the core is considered irreparable. Recently, several studies have suggested endogenous responses within the core are important for limiting the spread of damage and enhancing recovery, but the role of blood flow and capillary pericytes in this process is unknown. Using the Rose Bengal photothrombotic model of stroke, we illustrate blood vessels are present in the ischemic core and peri-lesional regions 2 weeks post stroke in male mice. A FITC-albumin gel cast of the vasculature revealed perfusion of these vessels, suggesting cerebral blood flow (CBF) may be partially present, without vascular leakage. The length of these vessels is significantly reduced compared to uninjured regions, but the average width is greater, suggesting they are either larger vessels that survived the initial injury, smaller vessels that have expanded in size (i.e., arteriogenesis), or that neovascularization begins with larger vessels. Concurrently, we observed an increase in platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ, a marker of pericytes) expression within the ischemic core in two distinct patterns, one which resembles pericyte-derived fibrotic scarring at the edge of the core, and one which is vessel associated and may represent blood vessel recovery. We find little evidence for dividing cells on these intralesional blood vessels 2 weeks post stroke. Our study provides evidence flow is present in PDGFRβ-positive vessels in the ischemic core 2 weeks post stroke. We hypothesize intralesional CBF is important for limiting injury and for encouraging endogenous repair following cerebral ischemia.</p>

     alt="Thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of multiple functional domains in posterior parietal cortex of galagos"/>
<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos contains a series of domains where electrical stimulation evokes different types of complex movements. The medial domains have more connections with the motor thalamus, whereas the lateral domains connect more densely with the posterior thalamus that involves in somatosensory processing.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In prosimian galagos, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into a number of functional domains where long-train intracortical microstimulation evoked different types of complex movements. Here, we placed anatomical tracers in multiple locations of PPC to reveal the origins and targets of thalamic connections of four PPC domains for different types of hindlimb, forelimb, or face movements. Thalamic connections of all four domains included nuclei of the motor thalamus, ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, as well as parts of the sensory thalamus, the anterior pulvinar, posterior and ventral posterior superior nuclei, consistent with the sensorimotor functions of PPC domains. PPC domains also projected to the thalamic reticular nucleus in a somatotopic pattern. Quantitative differences in the distributions of labeled neurons in thalamic nuclei suggested that connectional patterns of these domains differed from each other.</p>

<p>We studied the expression of the corticortropin-releasing hormone (CRH) transcript and mature peptide in the brain and spinal cord of sea lamprey prolarvae, larvae, and adults. We also studied the expression of the CRH binding protein transcript. Our data show that a complex CRHergic system is present in a representative of the oldest extant vertebrates. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (<i>PmCRH</i>) and the CRH-binding protein (<i>PmCRHBP</i>) mRNAs was studied by in situ hybridization in the brain of prolarvae, larvae, and adults of the sea lamprey <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>. We also generated an antibody against the PmCRH mature peptide to study the distribution of PmCRH-immunoreactive cells and fibers. PmCRH immunohistochemistry was combined with antityrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, PmCRHBP in situ hybridization, or neurobiotin transport from the spinal cord. The most numerous PmCRH-expressing cells were observed in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus and in the superior and medial rhombencephalic reticular formation. <i>PmCRH</i> expression was more extended in adults than in larvae, and some cell populations were mainly (olfactory bulb) or only (striatum, ventral hypothalamus, prethalamus) observed in adults. The preopto-paraventricular fibers form conspicuous tracts coursing toward the neurohypophysis, but many immunoreactive fibers were also observed coursing in many other brain regions. Brain descending fibers in the spinal cord mainly come from cells located in the isthmus and in the medial rhombencephalic reticular nucleus. The distribution of <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing neurons was different from that of PmCRH cells, with cells mainly present in the septum, striatum, preoptic region, tuberal hypothalamus, pretectum, pineal complex, isthmus, reticular formation, and spinal cord. Again, expression in adults was more extended than in larvae. <i>PmCRH</i>- and <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing cells are different, excluding colocalization of these substances in the same neuron. Present findings reveal a complex CRH/CRHBP system in the brain of the oldest extant vertebrate group, the agnathans, which shows similarities but important divergences with that of mammals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lungfish are the fish related most closely to tetrapods. The olfactory organ of lungfish contains two distinct sensory epithelia: the lamellar olfactory epithelium (OE) and the recess epithelium (RecE). Based on their ultrastructural and histological characteristics, the lamellar OE and the RecE are considered to correspond respectively to the teleost OE and a primitive vomeronasal organ (VNO). In tetrapods, the OE and VNO have been shown to express different families of olfactory receptors; for example, in mammals, the OE expresses odorant receptors and trace amine-associated receptors, while the VNO expresses type 1 (V1Rs) and type 2 (V2Rs) vomeronasal receptors. In the present study, we examined the expression of V1Rs in the olfactory organs of two African lungfish, <i>Protopterus annectens</i> and <i>Protopterus amphibius</i>. RNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses identified 29 V1R genes in <i>P. annectens</i> and 50 V1R genes in <i>P. amphibius</i>. Most V1Rs identified in these lungfish were classified as the tetrapod-type V1Rs initially found in tetrapods and distinct from fish-type V1Rs. In teleost, which all lack a VNO, all olfactory receptors are expressed in the OE, while in <i>Xenopus</i> V1Rs are expressed exclusively in the OE, and not in the VNO. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that lungfish V1Rs were expressed mainly in the lamellar OE and rarely in the RecE. These results imply that V1R expression in lungfish represents an intermediate step toward the complete segregation of V1R expression between the OE and VNO, reflecting the phylogenetic position of lungfish between teleosts and amphibians.</p>

     alt="Subclass-specific expression patterns of MET receptor tyrosine kinase during development in medial prefrontal and visual cortices"/>
<p>Percentage of MET-expressing neurons in medial prefrontal and primary visual (V1) cortices varies between layer and age in mice. The predominant subclass of MET<sup>+</sup> projection neurons in mPFC is subcortical, including corticothalamic, whereas it is intratelencephalic in V1, demonstrating stark heterogeneity between cortical regions. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Met</i> encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) that is expressed during development and regulates cortical synapse maturation. Conditional deletion of <i>Met</i> in the nervous system during embryonic development leads to deficits in adult contextual fear learning, a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-dependent cognitive task. MET also regulates the timing of critical period plasticity for ocular dominance in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the underlying circuitry responsible remains unknown. Therefore, this study determines the broad expression patterns of MET throughout postnatal development in mPFC and V1 projection neurons (PNs), providing insight into similarities and differences in the neuronal subtypes and temporal patterns of MET expression between cortical areas. Using a transgenic mouse line that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in <i>Met<sup>+</sup>
</i> neurons, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were performed to visualize MET-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell bodies and PN subclass-specific protein markers. Analyses reveal that the MET expression is highly enriched in infragranular layers of mPFC, but in supragranular layers of V1. Interestingly, temporal regulation of the percentage of MET<sup>+</sup> neurons across development not only differs between cortical regions but also is distinct between lamina within a cortical region. Further, MET is expressed predominantly in the subcerebral PN subclass in mPFC, but the intratelencephalic PN subclass in V1. The data suggest that MET signaling influences the development of distinct circuits in mPFC and V1 that underlie subcerebral and intracortical functional deficits following <i>Met</i> deletion, respectively.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The melanocortin system is a key regulator of appetite and food intake in vertebrates. This system includes the neuropeptides neuropeptide y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). An important center for appetite control in mammals is the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, with neurons that coexpress either the orexigenic NPY/AGRP or the anorexigenic CART/POMC neuropeptides. In ray-finned fishes, such a center is less characterized. The Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) has multiple genes of these neuropeptides due to whole-genome duplication events. To better understand the potential involvement of the melanocortin system in appetite and food intake control, we have mapped the mRNA expression of <i>npy</i>, <i>agrp</i>, <i>cart</i>, and <i>pomc</i> in the brain of Atlantic salmon parr using in situ hybridization. After identifying hypothalamic mRNA expression, we investigated the possible intracellular coexpression of <i>npy/agrp</i> and <i>cart/pomc</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The results showed that the neuropeptides were widely distributed, especially in sensory and neuroendocrine brain regions. In the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the putative homolog to the mammalian arcuate nucleus, <i>npya</i>, <i>agrp1</i>, <i>cart2b</i>, and <i>pomca</i> were predominantly localized in distinct neurons; however, some neurons coexpressed <i>cart2b/pomca</i>. This is the first demonstration of coexpression of <i>cart2b/pomca</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus of a teleost. Collectively, our data suggest that the lateral tuberal nucleus is the center for appetite control in salmon, similar to that of mammals. Extrahypothalamic brain regions might also be involved in regulating food intake, including the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain.</p>

     alt="In vivo tracking of KCC2b expression during early brain development"/><p>We used CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to generate a KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence reporter zebrafish line and characterized KCC2b regional distribution and dynamics in vivo during early brain development. We demonstrate KCC2b expression in postmigration stage neurons and suppression of KCC2b expression by exposure to bisphenol-A. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing this protein's complex dynamics during brain development and screening compounds aimed at modulating chloride homeostasis through KCC2b.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuronal chloride (Cl−) exporter, KCC2, regulates neuron excitability and development and undergoes a stereotypical pattern of delayed upregulation as neurons mature. KCC2 upregulation favors neural inhibition by establishing a negative Cl− gradient, ensuring GABA-induced Cl− currents are inward and inhibitory. We developed a zebrafish fluorescent reporter line, KCC2b:mCitrine, to track KCC2 expression in vivo during early brain development. KCC2b:mCitrine was first detected at 16 h postfertilization and by day 6 labeled most central and peripheral neurons and processes. At 20 h, expression was greatest in the soma-dense basal neuroepithelium but largely absent in apical and mantle zones where differentiation and migration primarily occur, and time lapse imaging at this stage supports a postmigration upregulation of KCC2b. Central dopamine neurons showed low KCC2b expression as observed in other species. KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence was stable over minutes in most neurons, but brightness transients observed in single cells fit our expectation for real-time tracking of KCC2b upregulation in new neurons. To further assess whether fluorescence brightness tracks KCC2b expression, zebrafish embryos were exposed to bisphenol-A (BPA), which is known to suppress KCC2 expression. Fluorescence decreased after 6 days of BPA exposure but not after 2 or 4 days, suggesting that it is an accurate but delayed indicator of KCC2b expression. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing KCC2b's complex dynamics during brain development, and potentially screening compounds aimed at modulating KCC2 expression.</p>

     alt="Convergence of bilateral auditory midbrain inputs on neurons in the auditory thalamus of chicken"/><p>In chicken, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis projects to bilateral nucleus ovoidalis (Ov), and ipsilateral projection is stronger than the contralateral one. A subpopulation of Ov neurons receive input from both sides of Ov. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the avian ascending auditory pathway, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis (MLd; the auditory midbrain center) receives inputs from virtually all lower brainstem auditory nuclei and sends outputs bilaterally to the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov; the auditory thalamic nucleus). Axons from part of the MLd terminate in a particular domain of Ov, thereby suggesting a formation of segregated pathways point-to-point from lower brainstem nuclei via MLd to the thalamus. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether any spatial clustering of thalamic neurons that receive inputs from specific domains of MLd exists. Ov neurons receive input from bilateral MLds; however, the degree of laterality has not been reported yet. In this study, we injected a recombinant avian adeno-associated virus, a transsynaptic anterograde vector into the MLd of the chick, and analyzed the distribution of labeled postsynaptic neurons on both sides of the Ov. We found that fluorescent protein-labeled neurons on both sides of the Ov were clustered in domains corresponding to subregions of the MLd. The laterality of projections was calculated as the ratio of neurons labeled by comparing ipsilateral to contralateral projections from the MLd, and it was 1.86 on average, thereby indicating a slight ipsilateral projection dominance. Bilateral inputs from different subdomains of the MLd converged on several single Ov neurons, thereby implying a possibility of a de novo binaural processing of the auditory information in the Ov.</p>

     alt="Adult spinal Dmrt3 neurons receive direct somatosensory inputs from ipsi- and contralateral primary afferents and from brainstem motor nuclei"/>
<p>Monosynaptic tracing analysis demonstrates the direct connectivity of Dmrt3 neurons to proprioceptors and brain centers involved in motor control, suggesting a sensorimotor integrative role for Dmrt3 interneurons in a neuronal path for motion and locomotion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the spinal cord, sensory-motor circuits controlling motor activity are situated in the dorso–ventral interface. The neurons identified by the expression of the transcription factor Doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 (Dmrt3) have previously been associated with the coordination of locomotion in horses (<i>Equus caballus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), and zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>, F. Hamilton, 1822). Based on earlier studies, we hypothesized that, in mice, these neurons may be positioned to receive sensory and central inputs to relay processed commands to motor neurons. Thus, we investigated the presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons using monosynaptic retrograde replication-deficient rabies tracing. The analysis showed that lumbar Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from intrasegmental neurons, and intersegmental neurons from the cervical, thoracic, and sacral segments. Some of these neurons belong to the excitatory V2a interneurons and to plausible Renshaw cells, defined by the expression of Chx10 and calbindin, respectively. We also found that proprioceptive primary sensory neurons of type Ia2, Ia3, and Ib, defined by the expression of calbindin, calretinin, and Brn3c, respectively, provide presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons. In addition, we demonstrated that Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from brain areas involved in motor regulation, including the red nucleus, primary sensory–motor cortex, and pontine nuclei. In conclusion, adult spinal Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from motor-related brain areas as well as proprioceptive primary sensory neurons and have been shown to connect directly to motor neurons. Dmrt3 neurons are thus positioned to provide sensory–motor control and their connectivity is suggestive of the classical reflex pathways present in the spinal cord.</p>

     alt="Cellular distribution of the Fragile X mental retardation protein in the inner ear: a developmental and comparative study in the mouse, rat, gerbil, and chicken"/><p>The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA binding protein, loss of which leads to Fragile X syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by abnormal auditory processing. This study provides the first description of FMRP distribution pattern in the developing and mature auditory inner ear of rodents and birds.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA binding protein that is essential for neural circuit assembly and synaptic plasticity. Loss of functional FMRP leads to Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by sensory dysfunction including abnormal auditory processing. While the central mechanisms of FMRP regulation have been studied in the brain, whether FMRP is expressed in the auditory periphery and how it develops and functions remains unknown. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of FMRP immunoreactivity in the inner ear of mice, rats, gerbils, and chickens. Across species, FMRP was expressed in hair cells and supporting cells, with a particularly high level in immature hair cells during the prehearing period. Interestingly, the distribution of cytoplasmic FMRP displayed an age-dependent translocation in hair cells, and this feature was conserved across species. In the auditory ganglion (AG), FMRP immunoreactivity was detected in neuronal cell bodies as well as their peripheral and central processes. Distinct from hair cells, FMRP intensity in AG neurons was high both during development and after maturation. Additionally, FMRP was evident in mature glial cells surrounding AG neurons. Together, these observations demonstrate distinct developmental trajectories across cell types in the auditory periphery. Given the importance of peripheral inputs to the maturation of auditory circuits, these findings implicate involvement of FMRP in inner ear development as well as a potential contribution of periphery FMRP to the generation of auditory dysfunction in FXS.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia and cortical proteinopathies in a large population of pathologically confirmed patients with PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We reviewed clinical data from all patients with autopsy data seen in the Movement Disorders Center at Washington University, St. Louis, between 1996 and 2019. All patients with a diagnosis of PD based on neuropathology were included. We used logistic regression and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) to investigate the relationship between neuropathology and dementia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 165 patients with PD met inclusion criteria. Among these, 128 had clinical dementia. Those with dementia had greater mean ages of motor onset and death but equivalent mean disease duration. The delay between motor symptom onset and dementia was 1 year or less in 14 individuals, meeting research diagnostic criteria for possible or probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Braak Lewy body stage was associated with diagnosis of dementia, whereas severities of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and small vessel pathology did not. Pathology of individuals diagnosed with DLB did not differ significantly from that of other patients with PD with dementia. Six percent of individuals with PD and dementia did not have neocortical Lewy bodies; and 68% of the individuals with PD but without dementia did have neocortical Lewy bodies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neocortical Lewy bodies almost always accompany dementia in PD; however, they also appear in most PD patients without dementia. In some cases, dementia may occur in patients with PD without neocortical Lewy bodies, ADNC, or small vessel disease. Thus, other factors not directly related to these classic neuropathologic features may contribute to PD dementia. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Breast milk exposure is associated with cortical maturation in preterm infants</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Breast milk (BM) exposure is associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes following preterm birth but the neural substrates linking BM with outcome are uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that high versus low BM exposure in preterm infants results in cortical morphology that more closely resembles that of term-born infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 135 preterm (&lt;32 weeks’ gestation) and 77 term infants. Feeding data was collected from birth until hospital discharge and brain MRI was performed at term-equivalent age. Cortical indices (volume, thickness, surface area, gyrification index, sulcal depth, curvature) and diffusion parameters (fractional anisotropy[FA], mean diffusivity[MD], radial diffusivity[RD], axial diffusivity[AD], neurite density index[NDI], orientation dispersion index[ODI]) were compared between preterm infants who received exclusive BM for &lt;75% of inpatient days, preterm infants who received exclusive BM for ≥75% of inpatient days and term-born controls. To investigate a dose response effect, we performed linear regression using BM exposure quartile weighted by propensity scores.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In preterm infants, high BM exposure was associated with reduced cortical gray matter volume (<i>d</i>=0.47, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.94, <i>p</i>=0.014), thickness (<i>d</i>=0.42, 95%CI 0.08 to 0.84, <i>p</i>=0.039) and RD (<i>d</i>=0.38, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.77, <i>p</i>=0.039), and increased FA (<i>d</i>=-0.38, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.01, <i>p</i>=0.037) after adjustment for age at MRI, which was similar to the cortical phenotype observed in term-born controls. BM exposure quartile was associated with cortical volume (ß=-0.192, 95% CI -0.342 to -0.042, <i>p</i>=0.017), FA (ß=0.223, 95% CI 0.075 to 0.372, <i>p</i>=0.007) and RD (ß=-0.225, 95% CI -0.373 to -0.076, <i>p</i>=0.007) following adjustment for age at birth, age at MRI and weighted by propensity scores, suggesting a dose effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>High BM exposure following preterm birth is associated with a cortical imaging phenotype that more closely resembles the brain morphology of term-born infants and effects appear to be dose-dependent.</p>

                Accurate perception of the environment is a constructive process that requires integration of external bottom-up sensory signals with internally generated top-down information. Decades of work have elucidated how sensory neocortex processes physical stimulus features. By contrast, examining how top-down information is encoded and integrated with bottom-up signals has been challenging using traditional neuroscience methods. Recent technological advances in functional imaging of brain-wide afferents in behaving mice have enabled the direct measurement of top-down information.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The endoplasmic reticulum puts a new spin on synaptic tagging</a></h4>

              
                The heterogeneity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) makes it a versatile platform for a broad range of homeostatic processes, ranging from calcium regulation to synthesis and trafficking of proteins and lipids. It is not surprising that neurons use this organelle to fine-tune synaptic properties and thereby provide specificity to synaptic inputs. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that enable activity-dependent ER recruitment into dendritic spines, with a focus on molecular mechanisms that mediate transport and retention of the ER in spines.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The tricky business of defining brain functions</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience has a long history of investigating the neural correlates of brain functions. One example is fear, which has been studied intensely in a variety of species. In parallel, unease about definitions of brain functions has existed for over 100 years. Because the translational impact of basic research hinges on how we define these functions, these definitions should be carefully considered.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Continuously changing memories: a framework for proactive and non-linear consolidation</a></h4>

              
                The traditional view of long-term memory is that memory traces mature in a predetermined 'linear' process: their neural substrate shifts from rapidly plastic medial temporal regions towards stable neocortical networks. We propose that memories remain malleable, not by repeated reinstantiations of this linear process but instead via dynamic routes of proactive and non-linear consolidation: memories change, their trajectory is flexible and reversible, and their physical basis develops continuously according to anticipated demands.

                Huang et al. find that the m6A-modified lincRNA Dubr binds and stabilizes the YTHDF1/3 complex through its m6A modification, thereby facilitating the translation of Tau and Calmodulin, as well as maintaining subsequent axon elongation and neuronal migration. The findings provide insight into how m6A-modified lincRNA orchestrates neuronal development.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">OCT4 expression transactivated by GATA protein is essential for non-rodent trophectoderm early development</a></h4>

              
                OCT4 expression is maintained in early TE of many non-rodent animals, but its molecular basis and significance remain elusive. Bou et al. demonstrate that, in porcine TE, GATA4 transcriptionally activates OCT4 to guarantee TE rapid proliferation and emphasize the importance of embryonic studies in more species.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mitotic phosphorylation inhibits the Golgi mannosidase MAN1A1</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Huang et al. discover that MAN1A1, the first enzyme that cargo proteins encounter once arriving the Golgi, is phosphorylated in mitosis. This attenuates its activity likely by reducing its interaction with the subsequent glycosyltransferase, MGAT1, suggesting that glycosylation is regulated by cytosolic signaling during the cell cycle.

                Mutations in nuclear membrane proteins cause many human diseases. While several of those affect protein stability, the mechanisms of protein quality control at the mammalian nuclear envelope remain to be elucidated. Using a functional genomic approach, Tsai et al. identify a dynamic machinery that targets misfolded nuclear membrane proteins for degradation.

                Ichino et al. develop a method to profile gene expression of individual Arabidopsis pollen nuclei along their developmental trajectories. This leads them to discover that mutation of DNA methylation readers MBD5 and MBD6 causes loss of transposon silencing in pollen vegetative nuclei, likely because of their sensitized decompacted chromatin state.

                Inflammatory monocytes (iMOs) play a critical role in controlling viral spread from the draining lymph node. Melo-Silva et al. show that bystander and infected iMOs adjust their global transcription to complement each other for anti-viral protection. They also show that these transcriptional changes are partly shaped by interferon signaling.

                Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is a main pathogenicity factor of α<i>-</i> and β<i>-</i>coronaviruses. Nsp1 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suppresses the host gene expression by sterically blocking 40S host ribosomal subunits and promoting host mRNA degradation. This mechanism leads to the downregulation of the translation-mediated innate immune response in host cells, ultimately mediating the observed immune evasion capabilities of SARS-CoV-2. Here, by combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations, fragment screening and crystallography, we reveal druggable pockets in Nsp1. Structural and computational solvent mapping analyses indicate the partial crypticity of these newly discovered and druggable binding sites. The results of fragment-based screening via X-ray crystallography confirm the druggability of the major pocket of Nsp1. Finally, we show how the targeting of this pocket could disrupt the Nsp1-mRNA complex and open a novel avenue to design new inhibitors for other Nsp1s present in homologous β<i>-</i>coronaviruses.

                We describe a subset of glioblastoma, the most prevalent malignant adult brain tumour, harbouring a bias towards hypomethylation at defined differentially methylated regions. This epigenetic signature correlates with an enrichment for an astrocytic gene signature, which together with the identification of enriched predicted binding sites of transcription factors known to cause demethylation and to be involved in astrocytic/glial lineage specification, point to a shared ontogeny between these glioblastomas and astroglial progenitors. At functional level, increased invasiveness, at least in part mediated by SRPX2, and macrophage infiltration characterise this subset of glioblastoma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bundling and segregation affect pheromone deposition, but not choice, in an ant</a></h4>

              
                Behavioural economists have identified many psychological manipulations which affect perceived value. A prominent example of this is bundling, in which several small gains (or costs) are experienced as more valuable (or costly) than if the same total amount is presented together. While extensively demonstrated in humans, to our knowledge this effect has never been investigated in an animal, let alone an invertebrate. We trained individual <i>Lasius niger</i> workers to two of three conditions in which either costs (travel distance), gains (sucrose reward), or both were either bundled or segregated: (1) both costs and gains bundled, (2) both segregated, and (3) only gains segregated. We recorded pheromone deposition on the ants’ return trips to the nest as measure of perceived value. After training, we offer the ants a binary choice between odours associated with the treatments. While bundling treatment did not affect binary choice, it strongly influenced pheromone deposition. Ants deposited c. 80% more pheromone when rewards were segregated but costs bundled as compared with both costs and rewards being bundled. This pattern is further complicated by the pairwise experience each animal made, and which of the treatments it experiences first during training. This demonstrates that even insects are influenced by bundling effects. We propose that the deviation between binary choice and pheromone deposition in this case may be due to a possible linearity in distance perception in ants, while almost all other sensory perception in animals is logarithmic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of human phagocyte NADPH oxidase in the resting state</a></h4>

              
                Phagocyte oxidase plays an essential role in the first line of host defense against pathogens. It oxidizes intracellular NADPH to reduce extracellular oxygen to produce superoxide anions that participate in pathogen killing. The resting phagocyte oxidase is a heterodimeric complex formed by two transmembrane proteins NOX2 and p22. Despite the physiological importance of this complex, its structure remains elusive. Here we reported the cryo-EM structure of the functional human NOX2-p22 complex in nanodisc in the resting state. NOX2 shows a canonical 6-TM architecture of NOX and p22 has four transmembrane helices. M3, M4, and M5 of NOX2 and M1 and M4 helices of p22 are involved in the hetero-dimer formation. DH domain of NOX2 in the resting state is not optimally docked onto the transmembrane domain (TMD), leading to inefficient electron transfer and NADPH binding. Structural analysis suggests that the cytosolic factors might activate the NOX2-p22 complex by stabilizing the dehydrogenase domain (DH) in a productive docked conformation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The genetic risk of gestational diabetes in South Asian women</a></h4>

              
                South Asian women are at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Few studies have investigated the genetic contributions to GDM risk. We investigated the association of a type 2 diabetes (T2D) polygenic risk score (PRS), on its own, and with GDM risk factors, on GDM-related traits using data from two birth cohorts in which South Asian women were enrolled during pregnancy. 837 and 4372 pregnant South Asian women from the SouTh Asian BiRth CohorT (START) and Born in Bradford (BiB) cohort studies underwent a 75-g glucose tolerance test. PRSs were derived using genome-wide association study results from an independent multi-ethnic study (~18% South Asians). Associations with fasting plasma glucose (FPG); 2 hr post-load glucose (2hG); area under the curve glucose; and GDM were tested using linear and logistic regressions. The population attributable fraction (PAF) of the PRS was calculated. Every 1 SD increase in the PRS was associated with a 0.085 mmol/L increase in FPG ([95% confidence interval, CI=0.07–0.10], p=2.85×10<sup>−20</sup>); 0.21 mmol/L increase in 2hG ([95% CI=0.16–0.26], p=5.49×10<sup>−16</sup>); and a 45% increase in the risk of GDM ([95% CI=32–60%], p=2.27×10<sup>−14</sup>), independent of parental history of diabetes and other GDM risk factors. PRS tertile 3 accounted for 12.5% of the population’s GDM alone, and 21.7% when combined with family history. A few weak PRS and GDM risk factors interactions modulating FPG and GDM were observed. Taken together, these results show that a T2D PRS and family history of diabetes are strongly and independently associated with multiple GDM-related traits in women of South Asian descent, an effect that could be modulated by other environmental factors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular basis for the role of disulfide-linked αCTs in the activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and insulin receptor</a></h4>

              
                The insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) control metabolic homeostasis and cell growth and proliferation. The IR and IGF1R form similar disulfide bonds linked homodimers in the apo-state; however, their ligand binding properties and the structures in the active state differ substantially. It has been proposed that the disulfide-linked C-terminal segment of α-chain (αCTs) of the IR and IGF1R control the cooperativity of ligand binding and regulate the receptor activation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the roles of disulfide-linked αCTs in IR and IGF1R activation are still unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of full-length mouse IGF1R/IGF1 and IR/insulin complexes with modified αCTs that have increased flexibility. Unlike the Γ-shaped asymmetric IGF1R dimer with a single IGF1 bound, the IGF1R with the enhanced flexibility of αCTs can form a T-shaped symmetric dimer with two IGF1s bound. Meanwhile, the IR with non-covalently linked αCTs predominantly adopts an asymmetric conformation with four insulins bound, which is distinct from the T-shaped symmetric IR. Using cell-based experiments, we further showed that both IGF1R and IR with the modified αCTs cannot activate the downstream signaling potently. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the certain structural rigidity of disulfide-linked αCTs is critical for optimal IR and IGF1R signaling activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Whole brain correlates of individual differences in skin conductance responses during discriminative fear conditioning to social cues</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis for individual differences in the skin conductance response (SCR) during discriminative fear conditioning may inform on our understanding of autonomic regulation in fear-related psychopathology. Previous region-of-interest (ROI) analyses have implicated the amygdala in regulating conditioned SCR, but whole brain analyses are lacking. This study examined correlations between individual differences in SCR during discriminative fear conditioning to social stimuli and neural activity throughout the brain, by using data from a large functional magnetic resonance imaging study of twins (<i>N</i> = 285 individuals). Results show that conditioned SCR correlates with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/anterior midcingulate cortex, anterior insula, bilateral temporoparietal junction, right frontal operculum, bilateral dorsal premotor cortex, right superior parietal lobe, and midbrain. A ROI analysis additionally showed a positive correlation between amygdala activity and conditioned SCR in line with previous reports. We suggest that the observed whole brain correlates of SCR belong to a large-scale midcingulo-insular network related to salience detection and autonomic-interoceptive processing. Altered activity within this network may underlie individual differences in conditioned SCR and autonomic aspects of psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of perceptual reorganisation from prior knowledge in human development and Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                The use of prior knowledge to guide perception is fundamental to human vision, especially under challenging viewing circumstances. Underpinning current theories of predictive coding, prior knowledge delivered to early sensory areas via cortical feedback connections can reshape perception of ambiguous stimuli, such as 'two-tone' images. Despite extensive interest and ongoing research into this process of perceptual reorganisation in the adult brain, it is not yet fully understood how or when the efficient use of prior knowledge for visual perception develops. Here we show for the first time that adult-like levels of perceptual reorganisation do not emerge until late childhood. We used a behavioural two-tone paradigm to isolate the effects of prior knowledge on visual perception in children aged 4 - 12 years and adults, and found a clear developmental progression in the perceptual benefit gained from informative cues. Whilst photo cueing reliably triggered perceptual reorganisation of two-tones for adults, 4- to 9-year-olds' performed significantly poorer immediately after cueing than within-subject benchmarks of recognition. Young childens' behaviour revealed perceptual biases towards local image features, as has been seen in image classification neural networks. We tested three such models (AlexNet, CorNet and NASNet) on two-tone classification, and while we found that network depth and recurrence may improve recognition, the best-performing network behaved similarly to young children. Our results reveal a prolonged development of prior-knowledge-guided vision throughout childhood, a process which may be central to other perceptual abilities that continue developing throughout childhood. This highlights the importance of effective reconciliation of signal and prediction for robust perception in both human and computational vision systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reducing brain kynurenic acid synthesis precludes kynurenine-induced sleep disturbances</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives Patients with neurocognitive disorders often battle sleep disturbances. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a tryptophan metabolite implicated in the pathology of these illnesses. Modest increases in KYNA, an antagonist at glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors, result in cognitive impairments and sleep dysfunction. We explored the hypothesis that inhibition of the KYNA synthesizing enzyme, kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), may alleviate sleep disturbances. Methods At the start of the light phase, adult male and female Wistar rats received systemic injections of either i) vehicle, ii) kynurenine (100mg/kg; i.p.), iii) the KAT II inhibitor, PF-04859989 (30 mg/kg; s.c), or iv) PF-04859989 and kynurenine in combination. Kynurenine and KYNA levels were evaluated in the plasma and brain. Separate animals were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) telemetry devices to record polysomnography and evaluate vigilance states wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep following each treatment. Results Kynurenine challenge increased brain KYNA and resulted in reduced REM duration, NREM delta power and sleep spindles. PF-04859989 reduced brain KYNA formation when given prior to kynurenine, prevented sleep disturbances, and enhanced NREM sleep. Conclusion REM sleep was restored when PF-04859989 was administered prior to kynurenine challenge, suggesting that reducing KYNA attenuated the kynurenine-induced decrease in REM. Further, KAT II inhibition may cause mild somnolence. Our findings suggest for the first time that reducing KYNA may serve as a potential strategy for improving sleep dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-session tDCS paired with passive mobilisation increases thalamo-cortical coupling during command following.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Therapeutic options for patients with prolonged disorder of consciousness (PDOC) are limited. PDOC patients often exhibit a dissociation between their retained level of (covert) cognitive ability and their (overt) behavioural responses (cognitive-motor dissociation; CMD). This is linked to reduced coupling between thalamus and the primary motor cortex. Objective: To assess whether pairing tDCS with a concurrent passive mobilisation protocol (designed to be feasible in PDOC) can influence thalamo-M1 dynamics and whether these changes are enhanced after multiple stimulation sessions. Methods: We used Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 22 healthy participants to assess tDCS changes on effective connectivity within motor network areas during command-following. Results: We found that a single anodal tDCS session (paired with passive mobilisation of the thumb) decreased self-inhibition in the motor cortex, with five sessions further enhancing this effect. In addition, anodal tDCS increased thalamo-M1 excitation as compared to cathodal stimulation, with the effects maintained after 5 sessions. In turn, cathodal tDCS had opposing effects on these connections after one session but became more similar to anodal after 5. Conclusions: Together, our results suggest that pairing anodal tDCS with passive mobilisation across multiple sessions may facilitate behavioural command-following in PDOC patients with CMD. More broadly, they offer a mechanistic window into the neural underpinnings of the cumulative effects of multi-session tDCS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-fat diet feeding triggers a regenerative response in the adult zebrafish brain</a></h4>

              
                Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a range of liver conditions ranging from excess fat accumulation to liver failure. NAFLD is strongly associated with high-fat diet (HFD) consumption that constitutes a metabolic risk factor. While HFD has been elucidated concerning its several systemic effects, there is little information about its influence on the brain at the molecular level. Here, by using a high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding of adult zebrafish, we first reveal that excess fat uptake results in weight gain and fatty liver. Prolonged exposure to HFD induces a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation markers in the liver and brain tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses of the brain tissues disclose stimulation of apoptosis and widespread activation of glial cell response. Moreover, glial activation is accompanied by an initial decrease in the number of neurons and their subsequent replacement in the olfactory bulb and the telencephalon. Long-term consumption of HFD causes activation of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling in the brain tissues. Finally, fish fed an HFD induces anxiety, and aggressiveness and increases locomotor activity. Thus, HFD feeding leads to a non-traumatic brain injury and stimulates a regenerative response. The activation mechanisms of a regeneration response in the brain can be exploited to fight obesity and recover from non-traumatic injuries.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep RNA-seq of male and female murine sensory neuron subtypes after nerve injury</a></h4>

              
                Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons have been well described for their role in driving both acute and pain. Although nerve injury is known to cause transcriptional dysregulation, how this differs across neuronal subtypes and the impact of sex is unclear. Here, we study the deep transcriptional profiles of multiple murine DRG populations in early and late pain states while considering sex. We have exploited currently available transgenics to label numerous subpopulations for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and subsequent transcriptomic analysis. Using bulk tissue samples, we are able to circumvent the issues of low transcript coverage and drop-outs seen with single cell datasets. This increases our power to detect novel and even subtle changes in gene expression within neuronal subtypes and discuss sexual dimorphism at the neuronal subtype level. We have curated this resource into an accessible database for other researchers (https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/). We see both stereotyped and unique subtype signatures in injured states after nerve injury at both an early and late timepoint. While all populations contribute to a general injury signature, subtype enrichment changes can also be seen. Within populations, there is not a strong intersection of sex and injury, but previously unknown sex differences in naive states- particularly in AB-RA + Ad-LTMRs - still contribute to differences in injured neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BrainAGE revisited: Keeping up the pace with deep learning methods</a></h4>

              
                Since the introduction of the BrainAGE method (Franke et al., 2010), novel machine learning methods of brain age prediction have continued to emerge. The idea of estimating the chronological age from (different modalities of) magnetic resonance images proved to be an interesting field of research due to the simplicity of its interpretation and its potential use as a biomarker of brain health. With the advancement of deep learning methods that are starting to dominate the field, it may seem like standard machine learning methods are not competitive anymore. Here we present our revised BrainAGE framework that combines multiple weighted BrainAGE models. We employed the analyses on a sample of 36840 T1-weighted images from the UK Biobank. The most accurate prediction with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.02 years was obtained by relevance vector regression weighted model combination. Our results are comparable to those of deep learning methods. We additionally tested the relation of different BrainAGE models and white matter hyperintensities as markers of ageing brain and found no differences in association to biomedical data between models of differing accuracies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG and pupillometric signatures of working memory overload</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the physiological correlates of cognitive overload has implications for gauging the limits of human cognition, for developing novel methods to define cognitive overload, and for mitigating the negative outcomes associated with overload. Most previous psychophysiological studies manipulated verbal working memory load in a narrow range (an average load of 5 items). It is unclear, however. how the nervous system responds to working memory load exceeding typical capacity limits. The objective of the current study was to characterize the central and autonomic nervous system changes associated with memory overload, by means of combined recording of EEG and pupillometry. Eighty-six participants were presented with a digit span task involving the serial auditory presentation of items. Each trial consisted of sequences of either 5, 9, or 13 digits, each separated by 2 seconds. Both theta activity and pupil size, after the initial rise, expressed a pattern of a short plateau and a decrease with reaching the state of memory overload, indicating that pupil size and theta possibly have similar neural mechanisms. Based on the described above triphasic pattern of pupil size temporal dynamics, we concluded that cognitive overload causes physiological systems to reset, and to release effort. Although memory capacity limits were exceeded and effort was released (as indicated by pupil dilation), alpha continued to decrease with increasing memory load. These results suggest that associating alpha with the focus of attention and distractor suppression is not warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A replication study on key neurodevelopmental pathways affected by valproate treatment ofneural precursor cells</a></h4>

              
                Adults with bipolar disorder or epileptic seizures are commonly prescribed sodium valproate. In utero exposure to this drug is linked to a multitude of defects in normal brain development, from neural tube defects to autism spectrum disorders. During the course of brain development, neural precursor cells (NPCs) give rise to neurons and glia, and therefore to understand the valproate-induced defects, it is crucial to understand its effect on NPCs. Two NPC lines, both derived from healthy individuals, were used for all experiments. Cells were treated with 0.7mM valproate for one week. Fresh media (+/- drug) was replenished every alternate day. RNA was extracted on day 7 of drug treatment, and transcriptomics performed. All experiments were performed in biological replicates. Genes that showed >1-fold difference (with FDR adjusted q-value [&le;] 0.05) were considered differentially expressed. We further investigated the interacting partners of the differentially expressed genes using PINOT, as well as cellular pathways using DAVID. Our primary endpoint of analysis were genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) with valproate treatment in both the NPC lines used. We found 21 such genes that were common in the two lines. PINOT revealed 504 interacting partners of the DEGs. Functional annotation analysis showed significant enrichment of four signaling pathways - Wnt, Notch, Rho-GTPase and PI3K-AKT. While the role of Rho-GTPase is a novel finding, we have replicated previously reported findings on Wnt, Notch and PI3K-Akt pathways, which further strengthens their role in mediating neurodevelopmental anomalies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG-LLAMAS: an open source, low latency, EEG-fMRI neurofeedback platform</a></h4>

              
                Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a powerful multimodal technique for imaging the brain, but its use in neurofeedback experiments has been limited by EEG noise caused by the MRI environment. Neurofeedback studies typically require analysis of EEG in real time, but EEG acquired inside the scanner is heavily contaminated with ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, a high-amplitude artifact locked to the cardiac cycle. Although techniques for removing BCG artifacts do exist, they are either not suited to real-time, low-latency applications, such as neurofeedback, or have limited efficacy. We propose and validate a new open-source BCG removal software called EEG-LLAMAS (Low Latency Artifact Mitigation Acquisition Software), which adapts and advances existing artifact removal techniques for low-latency experiments. We first used simulations to validate LLAMAS in data with known ground truth. We found that LLAMAS performed better than the best publicly-available real-time BCG removal technique, optimal basis sets (OBS), in terms of its ability to recover EEG waveforms, power spectra, and slow wave phase. To determine whether LLAMAS would be effective in practice, we then used it to conduct real-time EEG-fMRI recordings in healthy adults, using a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) task. We found that LLAMAS was able to recover the SSVEP in real time, and recovered the power spectra collected outside the scanner better than OBS. We also measured the latency of LLAMAS during live recordings, and found that it introduced a lag of less than 50ms on average. The low latency of LLAMAS, coupled with its improved artifact reduction, can thus be effectively used for EEG-fMRI neurofeedback. This platform enables closed-loop experiments which previously would have been prohibitively difficult, such as those that target short-duration EEG events, and is shared openly with the neuroscience community.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Supramodal Shape Representation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                We can sense an object's shape by vision or touch. Previous studies suggested that the inferolateral occipitotemporal cortex (ILOTC) implements supramodal shape representations as it responds more to seeing or touching objects than shapeless textures. However, such activation in the anterior portion of the ventral visual pathway could be due to the conceptual representation of an object or visual imagery triggered by touching an object. We addressed these possibilities by directly comparing shape and conceptual representations in early blind (who lack visual experience/imagery) and sighted participants. We found that bilateral ILOTC in both groups showed stronger activation during a shape verification task than during a conceptual verification task made on the names of the same manmade objects. Moreover, the distributed activity in the ILOTC encoded shape similarity but not conceptual association among objects. Besides the ILOTC, we also found shape representation in both groups' bilateral ventral premotor cortices and intraparietal sulcus, a frontoparietal circuit relating to object grasping and haptic processing. In contrast, the conceptual verification task activated both groups' left perisylvian brain network relating to language processing, and, interestingly, the cuneus in early blind participants only. The ILOTC had stronger functional connectivity to frontoparietal circuit than to the left perisylvian network, forming a modular structure specialized in shape representation. Our results conclusively support that the ILOTC selectively implements shape representation independently of visual experience, and this unique functionality likely comes from its privileged connection to the frontoparietal haptic circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heard or understood? Neural tracking of language features in a comprehensible story, an incomprehensible story and a word list</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension is a complex neural process on which relies on activation and integration of multiple brain regions. In the current study, we evaluated whether speech comprehension can be investigated by neural tracking. Neural tracking is the phenomenon in which the brain responds in a time-locked fashion to specific features of the speech. These features can be acoustic, i.e., acoustic tracking, or derived from the content of the speech using language properties, i.e., language tracking. We evaluated whether neural tracking of speech differs between a comprehensible story, an incomprehensible story, and a word list. We evaluated the neural responses to speech of 19 participants (6 men). No significant difference regarding acoustic tracking was found. However, significant language tracking was only found for the comprehensible story. The most prominent effect was visible to word surprisal, a language feature at the word level. The neural response to word surprisal showed a prominent negativity between 300 and 400~ms, similar to the N400 in evoked response paradigms. This N400 was significantly more negative when the story was be comprehended, i.e., when words could be integrated in the context of previous words. These results show that language tracking can capture the effect of speech comprehension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Isolated catatonia-like executive dysfunction in micewith forebrain-specific loss of myelin integrity</a></h4>

              
                A key feature of advanced brain aging includes structural defects of intracortical myelin that are associated with secondary neuroinflammation. A similar pathology is seen in specific myelin mutant mice that model 'advanced brain aging' and exhibit a range of behavioral abnormalities. However, the cognitive assessment of these mutants is problematic because myelin-dependent motor-sensory functions are required for quantitative behavioral readouts. To better understand the role of cortical myelin integrity for higher brain functions, we generated mice lacking Plp1, encoding the major integral myelin membrane protein, selectively in ventricular zone stem cells of the mouse forebrain. In contrast to conventional Plp1 null mutants, subtle myelin defects were restricted to the cortex, hippocampus and underlying callosal tracts. Moreover, forebrain-specific Plp1 mutants exhibited no defect of basic motor-sensory performance at any age tested. Surprisingly, several behavioral alterations reported for conventional Plp1 null mice (Gould et al., 2018) were absent and even social interactions appeared normal. However, with novel behavioral paradigms, we determined catatonia-like symptoms and isolated executive dysfunction in both genders. This suggests that loss of myelin integrity has an impact on cortical connectivity and underlies specific defects of executive function. These observations are likewise relevant for human neuropsychiatric conditions and other myelin-related diseases.

                Anopheles mosquitoes, as vectors for the malaria parasite, are a global threat to human health. To find and bite a human, they utilize neurons within their sensory appendages. However, the identity and quantification of sensory appendage neurons are lacking. Here we use a neurogenetic approach to label all neurons in Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. We utilize the Homology Assisted CRISPR Knock-in (HACK) approach to generate a T2A-QF2w knock-in of the synaptic gene bruchpilot. We use a membrane-targeted GFP reporter to visualize the neurons in the brain and to quantify neurons in all major chemosensory appendages (antenna, maxillary palp, labella, tarsi). By comparing labeling of brp>GFP and Orco>GFP mosquitoes, we predict the extent of neurons expressing Ionotropic Receptors or other chemosensory receptors. This work introduces a valuable genetic tool for the functional analysis of Anopheles mosquito neurobiology and initiates characterization of the sensory neurons that guide mosquito behavior.

                Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an essential modulator for neuroplasticity in sensory and emotional domains. Here, we investigated the role of CCK in motor learning using a single pellet reaching task in mice. Mice with a knockout of cck gene (CCK-/-) or blockade of CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) showed defective motor learning ability; the success rate of retrieving reward remained at the baseline level compared to the wildtype mice with significantly increased success rate. We observed no long-term potentiation (LTP) upon high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the motor cortex of CCK-/- mice, indicating a possible association between motor learning deficiency and neuronal plasticity in the motor cortex. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that the deficiency of CCK signalling disrupted the refinement of population neuronal activity in the motor cortex during motor skill training. Anatomical tracing revealed direct projections from CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Inactivating the CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex using chemogenetic methods significantly suppressed motor learning, and intraperitoneal application of CCK4, a tetrapeptide CCK agonist, rescued the motor learning deficits of CCK-/- mice. In summary, our results suggest that CCK, which could be provided from the rhinal cortex, enables neuroplasticity in the motor cortex leading to motor skill learning.

                Tools available for reproducible, quantitative assessment of brain correspondence have been limited. We previously validated the anatomical fiducial (AFID) placement protocol for point-based assessment of image registration with millimetric (mm) accuracy. In this data descriptor, we release curated AFID placements for some of the most commonly used structural magnetic resonance imaging templates and datasets. The release of our accurate placements allows for rapid quality control of image registration, teaching neuroanatomy, and clinical applications such as disease diagnosis and surgical targeting. We release placements on individual subjects from four datasets (n = 132 subjects for a total of 15,232 fiducials) and more than 10 brain templates (4,288 fiducials), compiling over 300 human rater hours of annotation. We also validate human rater accuracy of released placements to be within 1-2 mm (using a total of 50,336 Euclidean distances), consistent with prior studies. Our data is compliant with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) allowing for facile incorporation into modern neuroimaging analysis pipelines. Data is accessible on GitHub (https://github.com/afids/afids-data).

                Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition after central nervous system (CNS) injury leads to inhibitory scarring in mammals, whereas it facilitates axon regeneration in the zebrafish. However, the molecular basis of these different fates is not understood. Here, we identify small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) as a causal factor in regeneration failure. We demonstrate that the SLRPs Chondroadherin, Fibromodulin, Lumican, and Prolargin are enriched in human, but not zebrafish, CNS lesions. Targeting SLRPs to the zebrafish injury ECM inhibits axon regeneration and functional recovery. Mechanistically, we find that SLRPs confer structural and mechanical properties to the lesion environment that are adverse to axon growth. Our study reveals SLRPs as previously unknown inhibitory ECM factors in the human CNS that impair axon regeneration by modifying tissue mechanics and structure.
