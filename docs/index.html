              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09816">A mathematical theory for understanding when abstract representations emerge in neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments reveal that task-relevant variables are often encoded in approximately orthogonal subspaces of the neural activity space. These disentangled low-dimensional representations are observed in multiple brain areas and across different species, and are typically the result of a process of abstraction that supports simple forms of out-of-distribution generalization. The mechanisms by which such geometries emerge remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms that have been investigated are typically unsupervised (e.g., based on variational auto-encoders). Here, we show mathematically that abstract representations of latent variables are guaranteed to appear in the last hidden layer of feedforward nonlinear networks when they are trained on tasks that depend directly on these latent variables. These abstract representations reflect the structure of the desired outputs or the semantics of the input stimuli. To investigate the neural representations that emerge in these networks, we develop an analytical framework that maps the optimization over the network weights into a mean-field problem over the distribution of neural preactivations. Applying this framework to a finite-width ReLU network, we find that its hidden layer exhibits an abstract representation at all global minima of the task objective. We further extend these analyses to two broad families of activation functions and deep feedforward architectures, demonstrating that abstract representations naturally arise in all these scenarios. Together, these results provide an explanation for the widely observed abstract representations in both the brain and artificial neural networks, as well as a mathematically tractable toolkit for understanding the emergence of different kinds of representations in task-optimized, feature-learning network models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951">Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs.We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture.In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10251">Neural Hardware for the Language of Thought: New Rules for an Old Game</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis posits that at least some important cognitive processes involve language-like representations. These representations must be processed by appropriate hardware. Since the organ of biological cognition is the nervous system, whether biological cognition relies on a LOT depends on how neural hardware works. I distinguish between different versions of LOT, articulate their hardware requirements, and consider which versions of LOT are supported by empirical evidence. I argue that the Classical LOT hypothesis (Fodor 1975) is ruled out; the version of LOT that is best supported by empirical evidence is the Nonclassical LOT thesis that some neural representations mirror some of the structure of natural language and represent in a language-like way, yet they encode information nondigitally and are processed by ordinary (nondigital, and hence Nonclassical) neural computations that rely not only on syntactic structure but many other features.

                arXiv:2510.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on evidence of structural parallels between brain networks and the cosmic web [1], we apply AI-based geometric analysis to cultured neuronal networks. Isolated neurons self-organize into dendritic lattices shaped by reproducible wiring rules. These lattices show non-random features-frequent dendritic convergence, hub nodes, small-world connectivity, and large voids. Synaptic contacts cluster and strengthen at hubs. Strikingly, these properties mirror the cosmic web: dendritic branches resemble cosmic filaments and synapses map to galaxies. Quantitative metrics align across systems, suggesting shared underlying geometric principles. We invite cross-disciplinary collaboration to interrogate and extend these parallels.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10559">Evidence of Physiological Co-Modulation During Human-Animal Interaction: A Systematic Review</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examines the evidence in the literature for physiological co-modulation during human-animal interaction. The aim of this work is to identify studies that assessed co-modulation via simultaneous measurement of physiological signals in both species, performing quantitative comparisons, and evaluate the consistency of the findings.\\ We searched PubMed, EM-BASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Animal Studies Repository, and the ''Consensus app'' tool between June and August 2025 (last search: August 5, 2025). Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the ROBINS-I V2 tool. Results were grouped by data analysis method, interaction context, and physiological parameter. Data were synthesised narratively, in structured tables and in barplots. Thirty-seven studies were included, primarily focusing on dogs (n=22) and horses (n=15), framed primarily within the interaction contexts of Animal-Assisted Therapy and Intervention (AAT and AAI) and companionship. Cardiac and hormonal measures were most frequently assessed. Most studies (n = 20) performed correlation analyses. Sample sizes ranged from less than 10 to more than 130 dyads. Co-modulation resulted significant in 22 studies, partial (limited to subsets of data) in 9, and absent in 6. Time-series coupling methods yielded more consistent evidence than discrete-time correlations. Many studies had small samples and did not explicitly test for significant co-modulation. Evidence, while not conclusive, supports physiological co-modulation during human-animal interactions. However, studies' heterogeneity limits generalizability: rather than indicating a universal phenomenon, findings suggest co-modulation may emerge under specific biological and methodological conditions. Future research should explicitly test its presence across contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10733">Does Re-referencing Matter? Large Laplacian Filter Optimizes Single-Trial P300 BCI Performance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity, enabling Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for communication and control. However, their performance is limited by signal fidelity issues, among which the choice of re-referencing strategy is a pervasive but often overlooked preprocessing bias. Addressing controversies about its necessity and optimal choice, we adopted a quantified approach to evaluate four strategies - no re-referencing, Common Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian, and large Laplacian - using 62-channels EEG (31 subjects, 2,520 trials). To our knowledge, this is the first study systematically quantifying their impact on single-trial P300 classification accuracy. Our controlled pipeline isolated re-referencing effects for source-space reconstruction (eLORETA with Phase Lag Index) and anatomically constrained classification. The large Laplacian resolves distributed P3b networks while maintaining P3a specificity, achieving the best P300 peak classification accuracy (81.57% hybrid method; 75.97% majority regions of interest). Performance follows a consistent and statistically significant hierarchy: large Laplacian > CAR > no re-reference > small Laplacian, providing a foundation for unified methodological evaluation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10770">The Cost of Simplicity: How Reducing EEG Electrodes Affects Source Localization and BCI Accuracy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10791">A compressed code for memory discrimination</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli is an important index of memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or ``separated.'' An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows individuals to retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation -- a process linked to higher-order visual processing -- without hindering discrimination. Under this hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserved. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. We train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, measuring lossiness using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, especially in deeper convolutional network layers that predict higher-order visual brain activity. We then confirm these predictions across two image sets, four behavioral datasets, and alternative lossiness metrics. Finally, using task fMRI, we identify signatures of lossy compression -- neural dimensionality reduction and information loss -- in higher-order visual regions V4 and IT and hippocampal DG/CA3 and CA1 linked to lure discrimination. These results suggest lossy compression supports mnemonic discrimination by discarding redundant and overlapping information.

                arXiv:2510.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both natural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or even super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the "Intuitive Gamer". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited) goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000 participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no experience at all ("just thinking"), to a single round of play, to indirect experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at all.

                arXiv:2510.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy with which the human proprioceptive system estimates hand speed is not well understood. To investigate this, we designed an experiment using hobby-grade mechatronics parts and integrated it as a laboratory exercise in a large remote laboratory course. In a simple joint position reproduction task, participants (N = 191) grasped a servomotor-driven shaft with one hand as it followed a randomized trajectory composed of sinusoidal submovements. They simultaneously attempted to reproduce the movement by turning the shaft of a potentiometer with the other hand. Focusing on the first movement of the trajectory, we found that participants consistently overestimated the speed of the slowest rotations by ~45% and underestimated the speed of the fastest rotations also by ~30%. Speed estimation errors were near zero for trajectories with peak velocities ~63 deg/s. Participants' movements also overshot slow trajectories and undershot fast trajectories. We show that these trajectory errors can be explained by a model in which the proprioceptive system integrates velocity misestimates to infer position.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10276">Lost in the Middle: An Emergent Property from Information Retrieval Demands in LLMs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information (a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce positional bias observed in LLMs.

                arXiv:2510.10289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with asymmetric electric field pulses, such as monophasic, offers directional selectivity for neural activation but requires excessive energy. Previous pulse shape optimisation has been limited to symmetric pulses or heavily constrained variations of conventional waveforms without achieving general optimality in energy efficiency or neural selectivity. We implemented an optimisation framework that incorporates neuron model activation constraints and flexible control of pulse asymmetry. The optimised electric field waveforms achieved up to 92 % and 88 % reduction in energy loss and thus coil heating respectively compared to conventional monophasic pulses and previously improved monophasic-equivalent pulses. In the human experiments, OUR pulses showed similar motor thresholds to monophasic pulses in both AP and PA directions with significantly lower energy loss, particularly in the AP direction. Moreover, there was a significant MEP latency difference of (1.79 +/- 0.41) ms between AP and PA direction with OUR pulses, which suggests directional selectivity. Our framework successfully identified highly energy-efficient asymmetric pulses for directionally-selective neural engagement. These pulses can enable selective rapid-rate repetitive TMS protocols with reduced power consumption and coil heating, with potential benefits for precision and potency of neuro-modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300">The algorithmic regulator</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) > 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta > 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.

                arXiv:2510.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as \emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local) actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} -- equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii) \emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations} (prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower layers.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel auditory neuronal network model that integrates speech signal input, cochlear processing, and a cortical excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balanced network. Our findings reveal that increasing noise intensity attenuates the auditory steady-state responses in gamma oscillations, a mechanism validated by public EEG data. Moreover, enhancing the brain's E-I balance significantly improves auditory attention during speech recognition. This work not only elucidates the neural basis of selective attention in noisy environments but also offers a promising therapeutic strategy for auditory attention disorders, marking a significant advancement in the field of computational neuroscience and auditory processing.

                arXiv:2505.18361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.

                arXiv:2507.23116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs) is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence, which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison. Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional (e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g., affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied, and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

Abstract: Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient, human-inspired access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and $\infty$-Bench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens -- a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting parallels between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19262">The role of oscillations in grid cells' toroidal topology</a></h4>

Abstract: Persistent homology applied to the activity of grid cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex suggests that this activity lies on a toroidal manifold. By analyzing real data and a simple model, we show that neural oscillations play a key role in the appearance of this toroidal topology. To quantitatively monitor how changes in spike trains influence the topology of the data, we first define a robust measure for the degree of toroidality of a dataset. Using this measure, we find that small perturbations ($\sim$ 100 ms) of spike times have little influence on both the toroidality and the hexagonality of the ratemaps. Jittering spikes by $\sim$ 100-500 ms, however, destroys the toroidal topology, while still having little impact on grid scores. These critical jittering time scales fall in the range of the periods of oscillations between the theta and eta bands. We thus hypothesized that these oscillatory modulations of neuronal spiking play a key role in the appearance and robustness of toroidal topology and the hexagonal spatial selectivity is not sufficient. We confirmed this hypothesis using a simple model for the activity of grid cells, consisting of an ensemble of independent rate-modulated Poisson processes. When these rates were modulated by oscillations, the network behaved similarly to the real data in exhibiting toroidal topology, even when the position of the fields were perturbed. In the absence of oscillations, this similarity was substantially lower. Furthermore, we find that the experimentally recorded spike trains indeed exhibit temporal modulations at the eta and theta bands, and that the ratio of the power in the eta band to that of the theta band, $A_{\eta}/A_{\theta}$, correlates with the critical jittering time at which the toroidal topology disappears.

                arXiv:2510.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the way we construct computational counterparts of the brain, giving rise to a new class of ``surrogate brains''. In contrast to conventional hypothesis-driven biophysical models, the AI-based surrogate brain encompasses a broad spectrum of data-driven approaches to solve the inverse problem, with the primary objective of accurately predicting future whole-brain dynamics with historical data. Here, we introduce a unified framework of constructing an AI-based surrogate brain that integrates forward modeling, inverse problem solving, and model evaluation. Leveraging the expressive power of AI models and large-scale brain data, surrogate brains open a new window for decoding neural systems and forecasting complex dynamics with high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and adaptability. We highlight that the learned surrogate brain serves as a simulation platform for dynamical systems analysis, virtual perturbation, and model-guided neurostimulation. We envision that the AI-based surrogate brain will provide a functional bridge between theoretical neuroscience and translational neuroengineering.

                arXiv:2510.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL, which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for designing adaptive AI systems.

                arXiv:2508.21566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

                arXiv:2510.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization of analog circuits is hindered by high-dimensional parameter spaces, strong feedback couplings, and expensive transistor-level simulations. Evolutionary algorithms such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are widely used but treat all parameters equally, thereby wasting effort on variables with little impact on performance, which limits their scalability. We introduce CaDRO, a causal-guided dimensionality reduction framework that embeds causal discovery into the optimization pipeline. CaDRO builds a quantitative causal map through a hybrid observational-interventional process, ranking parameters by their causal effect on the objectives. Low-impact parameters are fixed to values from high-quality solutions, while critical drivers remain active in the search. The reduced design space enables focused evolutionary optimization without modifying the underlying algorithm. Across amplifiers, regulators, and RF circuits, CaDRO converges up to 10$\times$ faster than NSGA-II while preserving or improving Pareto quality. For instance, on the Folded-Cascode Amplifier, hypervolume improves from 0.56 to 0.94, and on the LDO regulator from 0.65 to 0.81, with large gains in non-dominated solutions.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

                arXiv:2510.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.

                arXiv:2510.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns. Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs, while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

                arXiv:2501.16745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that mimic how neurons in the brain communicate through discrete spikes, which have great potential in various tasks due to their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities. SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks, and inspired by traditional Transformers, several studies have demonstrated that spiking absolute positional encoding can help capture sequential relationships for input data, enhancing the capabilities of spiking Transformers for tasks such as sequential modeling and image classification. However, how to incorporate relative positional information into SNNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce several strategies to approximate relative positional encoding in spiking Transformers while preserving the binary nature of spikes. Firstly, we formally prove that encoding relative distances with Gray Code ensures that the binary representations of positional indices maintain a constant Hamming distance whenever their decimal values differ by a power of two, and we propose Gray-PE based on this property. In addition, we propose another RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the relative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore, we extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for processing image patches. We evaluate our RPE methods on various tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification, and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfying performance gain by incorporating our RPE methods across many architectures. Our results provide fresh perspectives on designing spiking Transformers to advance their sequential modeling capability, thereby expanding their applicability across various domains.

Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26003">Scaling Equilibrium Propagation to Deeper Neural Network Architectures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.26003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer. These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip) connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is $\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

                The genetic and spatial determinants of cell type diversity in human cerebral cortices remain poorly defined. Here, we present a population-level single-cell spatial transcriptomic atlas of human cortices from 71 donors across the lifespan. We identified 906 layer-specific genes showing conserved and divergent laminar expression patterns between humans and other species. Spatial analysis revealed neuronal vulnerability and glial activation during aging, together with a decline in the proportion of superficial SST neurons and their interactions with other cells. Disease-associated genes exhibited high cell-type and layer-specific expression, implicating the pathogenic role of spatially specific gene expression. Spatial cis-eQTL analysis identified regulatory variants linked to genes related to diseases like Tourette syndrome. Cross-species comparison demonstrated glial expansion in the human cortex, accompanied by enhanced neuron-glia communication via the neuregulin signaling. Together, we provide a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the human cortex that is essential for understanding aging, evolution, and disease pathogenesis.

">Hippocampal transformations occur along dimensions of memory interference</a></h4>

              
                The role of the hippocampus in resolving memory interference has been greatly elucidated by considering the relationship between the similarity of visual stimuli (input) and corresponding similarity of hippocampal activity patterns (output). However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.

">Distinct neocortical and entorhinal networks for time, space, and reward</a></h4>

              
                Variables relevant to behavior and cognition are often synthesized via computations that combine external cues and internal states. Especially salient and ubiquitous among these variables are time, space, and reward, but how they are simultaneously represented throughout the neocortex and the entorhinal cortex is not well understood. Here, we devised a behavioral task in virtual reality that includes timing, navigation, and reward components and, using a multifocus microscope that permits simultaneous mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging of neocortex and entorhinal cortex, we uncover dedicated and distinct subnetworks for interval timing, spatial navigation, and reward. Interestingly, the timing subnetwork includes a strong contribution from barrel cortex, pointing towards a previously unknown role for this cortex in interval timing.

">Neural Phoneme Processing in Children with and without Dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the neural dynamics of phoneme processing in 7-year-old children with and without dyslexia (25;9 male), using EEG recordings collected during continuous speech listening. By applying temporal generalization to phonetic descriptor decoding, we can disentangle whether potential phoneme processing deficits are due to the maintenance of phonemes in verbal short-term memory and/or inferred differences in phonetic processing speed, both of which are thought to be impaired in dyslexia. We investigated whether phonetic processing depends on the phoneme's position or its lexical competition. Our results reveal two key findings that may help explain the challenges faced by children with dyslexia. First, these children exhibit reduced decoding accuracy for word-onset phonemes, suggesting disruptions in either predictive, word-level anticipatory mechanisms or in the intrinsic rhythmic processing aligned with word boundaries. Second, they exhibit increased decoding accuracy for non-onset phonemes with low lexical competition approximately 400 ms after phoneme onset. This pattern suggests that children with dyslexia retain linguistically less relevant sounds longer in verbal short-term memory and process them more slowly compared to their typical reading peers. Together, these findings suggest that dyslexia is characterized by altered phonetic encoding strategies, specifically inefficient prioritization of relevant phonological information. This work provides new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying phonological deficits and contributes to a deeper understanding of the cognitive basis of dyslexia.

">Early developmental characterization of gap-induced prepulse inhibition and habituation in the Fragile X Syndrome mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Atypical sensory processing, particularly auditory hypersensitivity, is a common and debilitating phenotype of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Electrophysiology studies in FMR1-knockout (KO) mice previously observed hyperexcitability at the auditory cortex (AC), with enhanced neuronal firing to auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), a behavioral measure of sensorimotor gating, is robustly impaired in FXS individuals. Interestingly, a related paradigm called gap-induced inhibition of the acoustic startle (GPIAS) is mediated by the AC, and a previous study observed decreased GPIAS in mature FMR1-KO mice. Further, habituation is also an important sensory filtering mechanism, which has been reported to be impaired in mature FMR1-KO mice. However, not much is known about GPIAS and habituation in FMR1-KO mice during early development. Methods: We evaluated GPIAS in male and female FMR1-KO mice at post-natal days 15 (P15), 20 (P20) and 30 (P30). The paradigm consisted of a prepulse stimulus (a gap in a continuous background noise) followed by a startle stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval of 50 or 100 ms. Habituation was assessed prior to the GPIAS trials, with a series of startle only stimulus. Results: We observed a trend for genotype difference in acoustic startle response (ASR) magnitude, particularly in the female mice at P30. No significant genotype differences were noted in GPIAS or latency of ASR. Response duration was significantly increased in the male FMR1-KO mice compared to their WT counterparts during early development. Significant genotype differences were also observed in habituation and sensitization. In terms of development, we observed a significant increase in GPIAS with maturation. Furthermore, we also observed significant changes in the magnitude, response latency and duration of ASR with maturation. Finally, significant sex differences were observed in ASR magnitude and duration. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that behavioral responses to auditory stimuli are dynamic during development and differ between females and males, an important consideration for future study design. Additionally, the FMR1-KO mice display habituation deficits during early development, which could be an ideal window for addressing auditory hypersensitivity in FXS.

">Right time, right place: Heterochronicity shapes brain network formation</a></h4>

              
                Brain network formation unfolds on a non-uniform developmental timetable, with different cortical regions generating connections at different developmental phases. Generative network models (GNMs) aim to uncover the principles underpinning the organisation of connectomes by creating synthetic networks according to simple computational rules. These models capture the connectome's topology, operationalised here as the overall distributions of network metrics (e.g., modularity, small-worldness, rich-club structure). However, they typically ignore the differential timing of connectivity formation. By omitting this temporal programme, GNMs often misplace topological features in physical space. Here, we add a heterochronous growth term to GNMs and use a new model fitness function that weighs topology and topography equally. Topography refers to the spatial embedding of the network, the actual anatomical positions of tracts. With these advances, we can generate synthetic networks that more faithfully reproduce the spatial layout of diffusion-MRI connectomes from two independent adult cohorts. Compared with classical, temporally agnostic models, heterochronous simulations improve model fit, accurately locate cortical hubs and modules, and converge on a single caudal-to-rostral gradient of brain maturation. Integrating heterochronicity makes GNMs more faithful to brain development, setting the stage for using them to explain and ultimately predict individual differences in network formation.

                <p>Perception is shaped by both the physical properties of stimuli and their contextual presentation, often leading to systematic biases such as the central tendency effect, where perceptual judgments shift toward the average of the stimulus set. This study explored the central tendency bias in vibrotactile perception, an area that has received limited attention while also replicating its well-documented occurrence in color perception to validate previous findings. Using a within-subject design, participants (5 males, 15 females) completed color and vibrotactile discrimination tasks, each consisting of three blocks, which comprised systematically shifted stimulus sets. In an established virtual reality color task, stimuli ranged from yellow&ndash;green to blue&ndash;green, while in the vibrotactile task, stimuli varied in vibration intensity around a baseline distribution. As predicted, the point of subjective equality shifted toward the mean of the stimulus sets in both tasks, confirming the presence of a central tendency bias. These findings demonstrate that perception of both color and vibrotactile intensity is not determined solely based on the physical properties of the stimulus per se, but it is rather influenced by the distribution of the presented stimuli, underscoring the pervasive role of contextual factors in shaping sensory judgments.</p>

                Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) can occur in patients with tuberculosis. The purpose of this research was to develop an early detection system for MDD and conduct an accuracy test. Methods The MOODMIND application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) with sentiment analysis techniques. MOODMIND offers both speech and text options and is available in Indonesian/English. The screening results were compared with those of the doctor’s autoanamnesis test. Single blinding is used so that doctors are unaware of the application test. Results The app asks open- and closed-ended questions for MDD identification based on the DSM-5. The test results were divided into non-depressive (none or at-risk) and suspected depression groups. MOODMIND showed 67% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Conclusions Ease is advantageous because the steps are simple. MOODMIND has sufficient accuracy, but it can be improved by adding words related to depression in the lexicon adjustment.

                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Introduction During the postmenopausal period, hyperandrogenic manifestations include hirsutism and variable degrees of virilization. Metabolic syndrome is often associated. True hirsutism and acne should not be considered normal as they may reveal tumorous sources of excessive androgen secretion originating from either the adrenals or the ovaries. Once adrenal causes are excluded, virilizing ovarian tumors must be considered, with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor being the most common histological subtype. Cases presentations We report the observations of three female patients who presented with post-menopausal hyperandrogenism of ovarian origin during the year 2023, with details on clinical presentation, lab results, and aspects found both on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. They all underwent surgery and two of them were diagnosed with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. Conclusion Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism, though rare, requires thorough assessment to avoid misdiagnosis of underlying androgen-secreting tumors, with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors being the predominant subtype. Surgical intervention is the primary treatment modality, often resulting in complete postoperative recovery.

                Background The major component of patchouli oil, patchouli alcohol, is used as fixative and has antimicrobial activity. The function of other components, such as α-guaiene, remains unknown. Therefore, this study reports the antifungal activity of α-guaiene isolated from patchouli oil against for pathogenic fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans ATCC 7102, Microsporum gypseum ATCC 14683, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes ATCC 16404. Methods The material from fraction (249°C-254°C) had the highest α-guaiene. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined using the microdilution technique to evaluate antifungal activity, with n-hexane and medium serving as negative controls, and ketoconazole and fluconazole serving as positive controls. Results The results showed that the MIC and MFC value were determined at 45%, 50% for C. albicans, 55%, 60% for A. niger, 50%, 60% for M. gypseum, and 95%, 100% for T. mentagrophytes, respectively. Positive and medium controls demonstrated no microbial growth, whereas negative and growth controls revealed the presence of microorganisms. Fungus resistance to α-guaiene T. mentagrophytes exhibited the highest MIC value. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals that α-guaiene is a promising agent effective against the studied pathogenic fungi.

                Background Plectranthus amboinicus is an aromatic herb known for its medicinal properties and is increasingly explored for cosmetic applications. Its bioactive compounds possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a promising candidate for multifunctional skincare formulations. Methods This study investigated the extraction of bioactive compounds from P. amboinicus leaves using microwave-assisted ethanol extraction. Two drying techniques—tray drying and freeze-drying—were compared to evaluate their impact on the extraction efficiency. The optimal extract (PF15), prepared using 15-minute microwave extraction and freeze-drying, was selected for further analysis. Bioactive content was assessed through quantification of caffeic acid, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity via the DPPH assay. The antimicrobial activity of PF15 was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Cutibacterium acnes. Anti-inflammatory potential of PF15 was evaluated in LPS-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages by measuring cytokine production. Results The PF15 extract yielded the highest levels of bioactive compounds and demonstrated strong antioxidant activity. It exhibited significant antimicrobial effects against all tested skin pathogens. In the anti-inflammatory assay, PF15 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) while upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The extract was formulated into a topical cream, which underwent accelerated stability testing over six heat-cool cycles. The cream remained stable with no signs of phase separation, discoloration, odor change, or microbial contamination, and maintained a pH of 5.5. Conclusions The PF15 extract of P. amboinicus demonstrates potent antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its successful incorporation into a stable cream formulation supports its potential as a multifunctional active ingredient in skincare products. These findings highlight P. amboinicus as a valuable natural source for the development of cosmetic formulations targeting oxidative stress, microbial infection, and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013586">Social imitation dynamics of vaccination driven by vaccine effectiveness and beliefs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Feng Fu, Ran Zhuo, Xingru Chen</p>

Declines in vaccination coverage for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, have enabled their surprising comebacks and pose significant public health challenges in the wake of growing vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine opt-outs and refusals are often fueled by beliefs concerning perceptions of vaccine effectiveness and exaggerated risks. Here, we quantify the impact of competing beliefs – vaccine-averse versus vaccine-neutral – on social imitation dynamics of vaccination, alongside the epidemiological dynamics of disease transmission. These beliefs may be pre-existing and fixed, or coevolving attitudes. This interplay among beliefs, behaviors, and disease dynamics demonstrates that individuals are not perfectly rational; rather, they base their vaccine uptake decisions on beliefs, personal experiences, and social influences. We find that the presence of a small proportion of fixed vaccine-averse beliefs can significantly exacerbate the vaccination dilemma, making the tipping point in the hysteresis loop more sensitive to changes in individuals’ perceived costs of vaccination and vaccine effectiveness. However, in scenarios where competing beliefs spread concurrently with vaccination behavior, their double-edged impact can lead to self-correction and alignment between vaccine beliefs and behaviors. The results show that coevolution of vaccine beliefs and behaviors makes populations more sensitive to abrupt changes in perceptions of vaccine cost and effectiveness compared to scenarios without beliefs. Our work provides valuable insights into harnessing the social contagion of even vaccine-neutral attitudes to overcome vaccine hesitancy.

                <p>by Adriana Manna, Marton Karsai, Nicola Perra</p>

Vaccinations are fundamental public health interventions. Yet, inequalities in vaccine uptake across socioeconomic groups can significantly undermine their impact. Moreover, heterogeneities in vaccination coverage across socioeconomic strata are typically neglected by epidemic models and considered, if at all, only at posteriori. This limitation reduces their ability to predict and assess the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Here, we study the impact of socioeconomic inequalities in vaccination uptake on disease burden, measured as attack rate. We consider a modeling framework based on generalized contact matrices that extend traditional age-stratified approaches to incorporate socioeconomic status (SES) variables. We simulate epidemic dynamics under two scenarios. In the first, vaccination campaigns are concurrent with epidemics. In the second, instead, vaccinations are completed before the onset of infection waves. By using both synthetic and empirical generalized contact matrices, we find that inequalities in vaccine uptake can lead to non-linear effects on disease outcomes and exacerbate disease burden in disadvantaged groups of the population. We demonstrate that simpler models ignoring SES heterogeneity produce incomplete or biased predictions of attack rates. Additionally, we show how inequalities in vaccine coverage interact with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), compounding differences across subgroups. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of integrating SES dimensions, alongside age, into epidemic models to inform more equitable and effective public health interventions and vaccination strategies.

                <p>by Sara Joubbi, Alessio Micheli, Paolo Milazzo, Giorgio Ciano, Stéphane M. Gagné, Pietro Liò, Duccio Medini, Giuseppe Maccari</p>

Antibodies are indispensable components of the immune system, known for their specific binding to antigens. Beyond their natural immunological functions, they are fundamental in developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases. The complex architecture of antibodies, particularly their variable regions responsible for antigen recognition, presents significant challenges for computational modeling. Recent advancements in deep learning have markedly improved protein structure prediction; however, accurately modeling antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interactions remains challenging due to the inherent flexibility of antibodies and the dynamic nature of binding processes. In this study, we examine the use of predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) scores as indicators of residue and side-chain flexibility to model Ab-Ag interactions through a fingerprint-based approach. We demonstrate the significance of flexibility in different antibody-specific tasks, enhancing the predictive accuracy of Ab-Ag interaction models by 4%, resulting in an AUC-ROC of 92%. In addition, we showcase state-of-the-art performance in paratope prediction. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for conformational flexibility in modeling antibody-antigen interactions and show that pLDDT can serve as a coarse proxy for these dynamic features. By optimizing antibody flexibility using pLDDT, they can be engineered to improve affinity or breadth for a specific target. This approach is particularly beneficial for addressing highly variable pathogens like HIV and SARS-CoV-2, as greater flexibility enhances tolerance to sequence variations in target antigens.

Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise, and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present <i>i</i>CH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, <i>i</i>ML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, including thermodynamic and kinetic constants, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for <i>E. coli</i>.

Characterizing protein families’ structural and functional diversity is essential for understanding their biological roles. Traditional analyses often focus on primary and secondary structures, which may not fully capture complex protein interactions. Here we introduce InteracTor, a novel toolkit that extracts multimodal features from protein three-dimensional (3D) structures, including interatomic interactions like hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic contacts. By integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, we quantified the importance of the extracted features in the classification of protein structural and functional families. InteracTor’s interpref features enable mechanistic insights into the determinants of protein structure, function, and dynamics, offering a transparent means to assess their predictive power within machine learning models. Interatomic interaction features extracted by InteracTor demonstrated superior predictive power for protein family classification compared to features based solely on primary or secondary structure, revealing the importance of considering specific tertiary contacts in computational protein analysis. This work provides a robust framework for future studies aiming to enhance the capabilities of models for protein function prediction and drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012986">Understanding the mechanism of facilitation in hoverfly TSDNs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anindya Ghosh, Sarah Nicholas, Karin Nordstrom, Thomas Nowotny, James Knight</p>

Many animals use visual motion cues to track and pursue small, fast-moving targets, such as prey or conspecifics. In target-pursuing insects, including dragonflies and hoverflies, Small Target Motion Detector (STMD) neurons are found in the optic lobes and are believed to be presynaptic to Target Selective Descending Neurons (TSDNs) that project to motor command centres. While STMDs respond robustly to target motion – even when displayed against moving backgrounds – TSDN target responses are modulated by background motion. Depending on whether the background motion is syn- or contra-directional to the target motion, the response of the TSDNs is either suppressed or facilitated (amplified). This suggests that TSDNs not only receive input from STMDs but also from neurons sensitive to background motion, but this neural circuit is not clearly understood. To explore the underlying neural mechanisms, we developed three candidate TSDN circuit models – which combine input from bio-plausible STMDs and optic flow-sensitive Lobula Plate Tangential Cells (LPTCs) in different ways – and fitted them to published electrophysiology data from hoverfly TSDNs. We then tested the best-fitting models against new electrophysiological data using different background patterns. We found that the overall best model suggests simple inhibition from LPTCs with the same preferred direction as the STMDs feeding into the TSDN. This parsimonious mechanism can explain the facilitation and suppression of TSDN responses to small targets, and may inform similar studies in other animals.

Background and aim <p>To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, successful interventions require early detection. The timing of implementation of preventive measures is crucial, but as outbreaks are hard to anticipate, control efforts often start too late. This applies to mosquito-borne diseases, for which the multifaceted nature of transmission complicates surveillance. Resilience indicators have been studied as a generic, model-free early warning method. However, the large data requirements limit their use in practice. In the present study, we compare the performance of multivariate indicators of resilience, combining the information contained in multiple data sources, to the performance of univariate ones focusing on one single time series. Additionally, by comparing various monitoring scenarios, we aim to find which data sources are the most informative as early warnings.</p> Methods and results <p>West Nile virus was used as a case study due to its complex transmission cycle with different hosts and vectors interacting. A synthetic dataset was generated using a compartmental model under different monitoring scenarios, including data-poor scenarios. Multivariate indicators of resilience relied on different data reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and Max Autocorrelation Factor analysis (MAF). Multivariate indicators outperformed univariate ones, especially in data-poor scenarios such as reduced resolution or observation probabilities. This finding held across the different monitoring scenarios investigated. In the explored system, species that were more involved in the transmission cycle or preferred by the mosquitoes were not more informative for early warnings.</p> Implications <p>Overall, these results indicate that combining multiple data sources into multivariate indicators can help overcome the challenges of data requirements for resilience indicators. The final decision should be based on whether the additional effort is worth the gain in prediction performance. Future studies should confirm these findings in real-world data and estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and lead time of multivariate resilience indicators.</p>

The prefrontal—hippocampal—entorhinal system is perhaps the most widely-studied circuit in cognitive and systems neuroscience, due to its role in supporting cognitive functions such as working memory and decision-making. Disrupted communication within this circuit is a key feature of disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia. Nucleus reuniens (NRe) is a midline thalamic nucleus that sits at the nexus of this circuit, linking these regions together. As there are no direct projections from prefrontal cortex to hippocampus (HPC), the accepted model is that the NRe mediates prefrontal drive of hippocampal activity, although these connections are poorly defined at the cellular and synaptic level. Using <i>ex vivo</i> optogenetics and electrophysiology in both mice and rats, alongside monosynaptic circuit-tracing, we sought to test the mechanisms through which NRe could drive hippocampal activity. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence that pyramidal cells in CA1 receive input from NRe, with midline thalamic input to HPC proper appearing selective for GABAergic interneurons. In other regions targeted by NRe, we found that pyramidal cells in prosubiculum and subiculum received synaptic inputs from NRe that were at least an order of magnitude weaker than those in prefrontal or entorhinal cortices. We conclude that, contrary to widely-held assumptions in the field, the hippocampal pyramidal cells are not a major target of NRe.

                <p>by Yuval B. Simons, Hakhamanesh Mostafavi, Huisheng Zhu, Courtney J. Smith, Jonathan K. Pritchard, Guy Sella</p>

Genome-wide association studies have revealed that the genetic architectures of complex traits vary widely, including in terms of the numbers, effect sizes, and allele frequencies of significant hits. However, at present we lack a principled way of understanding the similarities and differences among traits. Here, we describe a probabilistic model that combines the effects of mutation, drift, and stabilizing selection at individual sites with a genome-scale model of phenotypic variation. In this model, the architecture of a trait arises from the distribution of selection coefficients of mutations and from two scaling parameters. We fit this model for 95 highly polygenic quantitative traits of different kinds from the UK Biobank. Notably, we infer that all these traits have fairly similar, though not identical, distributions of selection coefficients. This similarity suggests that differences in architectures of highly polygenic traits arise mainly from the two scaling parameters: the mutational target size and heritability per site, which vary by orders of magnitude among traits. When these two scale factors are accounted for, we find that the architectures of all 95 traits are very similar.

Astrocytes comprise ~50% of all brain cells and present distinct morphological, molecular and functional properties in different brain regions. In glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive primary brain tumor, astrocytes become activated and tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) exhibit different transcriptomic profiles, morphology, and functions supporting disease progression. Heterogeneity and specific roles of TAAs within various regions of tumors are poorly known. Advancements of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics allow to profile tumors at unprecedented resolution revealing cell phenotypes, hidden functionalities, and spatial architecture in disease-specific context. We combined spatial transcriptomics and multiple immunofluorescent staining to visualize TAAs heterogeneity and location of various subpopulations in three intracranial murine glioma models. Using distinct gene expression profiles, we identified subtypes of TAAs with distinct localization and inferred their specialized functionalities. Gene signatures associated with TAAs reflected their reprograming in the tumor microenvironment (TME), revealed their multiple roles and potential contributing factors shaping the local milieu. Using spatial correlation analysis of the spots, we inferred the interactome of <i>Slc1a2</i> (encoding a glutamate transporter) with the other markers of TAAs based on segregated areas of the tumor. The designer RGD peptide that blocked tumor-microglia communications, altered the spatial distribution of TAAs in GL261 gliomas providing new insights into cell-to-cell communication. Spatial transcriptomics combined with multiple staining unveils multiple functional phenotypes of TAAs and interactions within TME. We demonstrate distinct morphology of TAAs and different roles in various regions of the tumor. Glioma-induced heterogeneity of TAAs allows adaptation to the pharmacologically induced modification of the immunosuppressive TME.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Radial glia-like cells (RGLCs) are recognized as cells with morphological and molecular similarities to embryonic radial glia but present in the nervous system of adult organisms. They are well known for playing key roles in neurogenesis and regeneration. The characterization of RGLCs in invertebrates has faced serious challenges due to interspecies limitations in identifying markers common to the vertebrate radial glia or RGLCs. This study investigates RGLCs in the echinoderm <i>Holothuria glaberrima</i>, combining transcriptomics, immunofluorescence, and advanced RNA visualization techniques (hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization [HCR-FISH]). Our results reveal the expression and localization of nine RGLC markers in the echinoderm central nervous system. These markers (<i>GS</i>, <i>PAX6</i>, <i>SOXB1</i>, Prominin, <i>GLAST</i>, SCO-spondin, Netrin, <i>EAAT2</i>, <i>UNC5C</i>) have been previously associated with vertebrate glial cells and/or their neurogenetic functions. Additionally, using an in vitro injury model, we tested the RGLC ability to respond to injury. This showed significant changes in the expression of key markers such as <i>PAX6</i> and Prominin, indicating the RGLC ability to react to injury. Our work provides insights into the phylogenetic relationships between vertebrate and invertebrate glial cells. This work advances our understanding of echinoderm RGLCs, challenging traditional views of glial cell homology and expanding the framework for studying neuroregenerative processes in nontraditional organisms.</p>
<h2>Significance Statement</h2>
<p>This article extensively characterizes the presence of glial markers in the adult radial glia-like cell (RGLC) population of <i>H. glaberrima</i>, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of glial cells in invertebrate deuterostomes, specifically echinoderms. Our work proves that holothurian RGLCs share several known molecular markers of vertebrate RGLCs and that this glial population is molecularly diverse, suggesting some degree of heterogeneity. We also evaluate changes in the RGLCs using an in vitro injury model, providing insight into cellular changes that are relevant to understanding in vivo nervous system regeneration and establishing its comparability to in vivo RNCs. In summary, this article provides strong evidence that echinoderm RGLCs are cellular homologs of vertebrate RGLCs, offering insights into the evolution of the vertebrate nervous system.</p>

                Background Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTNB) is a frequently encountered respiratory condition that affects term and late preterm infants. While standard oxygen therapy (SOT) remains the first-line intervention, emerging modalities, such as heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC), may be more efficacious with fewer complications. However, evidence from randomized trials is scarce. Methods This was an open-label, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial conducted in a tertiary-care neonatal unit. Neonates with gestational age (GA) ≥ 34 weeks who were diagnosed with TTNB and satisfied the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive either HHHFNC or SOT. The primary outcomes included the duration of respiratory support and respiratory distress score (Downe Score). Secondary outcomes included the need for escalation of respiratory support, need for higher modes of respiratory support, length of hospital stay, and incidence of complications. Results Sixty neonates were randomized equally to HHHFNC (GA: 36.79 ± 2.46 weeks; BW: 2.50 ± 0.71 kg) and SOT (GA: 37.68 ± 1.04 weeks; BW: 2.79 ± 0.53 kg) groups. The need for escalation of respiratory support was significantly lower in the HHHFNC arm (46.7% vs. 96.7%, p=0.001), with a significant improvement in the Downe score at one hour (1.97±1.42 vs. 2.73±1.14, p=0.03). Neonates on HHHFNC required a shorter duration of respiratory support and had notably reduced length of hospital stay as compared to the SOT group (2.77±6.32 hours vs 3.87±7.20 hours, p=0.53 and 4.67±1.65 days vs 5.83±3.42 days, p=0.10, respectively). Nasal crusting occurred exclusively in the standard oxygen group (20% vs. 0%; p=0.011). Conclusions HHHFNC is an effective early treatment modality for TTNB, offering greater comfort and fewer complications than the standard oxygen therapy.

                Forensic anthropology is the study of skeletal remains for the identification of individuals, and anthropology more broadly deals with the study of humans. Many studies have been conducted to estimate stature from different body parts, such as the foot, extremities, hand, and vertebrae. However, in some cases, recovering all body parts and bones in their entirety can be difficult at the crime scene for forensic examination. In such cases, it becomes necessary to use another region, such as the head and facial region, for the estimation of height. Determination of height is a crucial aspect of forensic examination for the identification of the individual. This study was done to find the correlation between the stature and the morphological variations of the external auricular region for the estimation of stature for the purpose of forensic investigation. The study was conducted on 385 male individuals a total of four ear parameters were measured from both ears using the digital caliper. The data was analysed using Jamovi version 2.4.11. The result showed that there was a positive correlation between all the dimensions with stature. The linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship, with the most predicted variable in males being the left ear length (p<0.001). This study concludes that the external auricular morphometry can be an additional tool for the estimation of stature in forensic investigation.

                Background Depression, anxiety, and insomnia significantly impact global health and impose substantial health burdens worldwide. Conventional treatments including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy face limitations in efficacy, side effects, and accessibility. Despite preliminary evidence suggesting the potential of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in managing these conditions, large-scale evaluations are lacking. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of CHM for the treatment of adults experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Methods This study will be a multicenter, pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial. Districts will be randomized to receive the CHM intervention sequentially in four steps based on a computer-generated number, while control districts remain unexposed until their respective intervention phase. The intervention consists of a three-level stepped-care approach: Level 1 involves herbal tisane for mild symptoms, Level 2 offers standardized CHM for moderate symptoms or non-responders to Level 1, and Level 3 combines personalized CHM with psychotherapy for those not improved by Level 2. Symptom severity will be assessed using validated scales, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, and Insomnia Severity Index for insomnia, with primary outcomes measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The study was approved by the Hong Kong Baptist University Research Ethics Committee (Approval No.: REC/22-23/0709). Discussion This study will provide significant insights into the effectiveness of a stepped-care CHM intervention for alleviating depression, anxiety, and insomnia. The results could guide future decision-making regarding the integration of CHM into mainstream healthcare systems in Hong Kong and beyond.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Exercise has been reported to improve outcomes in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the exact biological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study was conducted to determine whether chronic moderate treadmill exercise prevents dopaminergic neuron loss and Lewy body-like inclusion burden in a preclinical model of PD. This study also sought to identify plasma exosome bound “exerkines” with potential to induce neuroprotective brain adaptations. Benefits of exercise are thought to be achieved in part through nucleic acids, lipids, and peptides termed exerkines abundant during exercise. These exerkines can induce cell-specific exercise adaptations culminating in neuroprotection. Membrane-free exerkines are subject to degradation in blood and may not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier to induce brain adaptations to exercise, limiting their inter-organ signaling potential. This led us to hypothesize that exerkines, bioactive RNAs in particular, may be selectively packaged into exosomes and released into plasma during exercise. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, selectively packaged and released by cells, with likely important differences in composition at rest, during injury and disease, and in response to exercise. Exosomes have been demonstrated to play a major role in inter-organ communication. Chronic exercise was found to provide neuroprotection to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, without affecting Lewy body-like inclusion burden in the nigra or the striatum. Plasma exosomal RNA was isolated from age-matched exercising and sedentary non-PD rats and sequenced. We report 27 unique RNAs upregulated in the exosomes of exercisers, 3 mRNAs with clear neuroprotective potential.</p>

                In a recent article, Légaré and colleagues demonstrate that key mammalian brain network organizational features, which have been extensively mapped in human functional connectivity studies, are conserved in the tiny vertebrate brain of the larval zebrafish. Using whole-brain calcium imaging, single-cell reconstructions, and network analyses, the authors reveal how features from structural connectomes and genetic markers predict sensorimotor functional correlations.

                T cell activation requires increased biosynthesis, which depends on mitochondrial function. Galloway et al. demonstrate that mitochondrial function is regulated by cap methyltransferase CMTR1 during T cell activation. By methylating RNA Pol II-transcribed RNAs, including the spliceosomal U2 snRNA, CMTR1 controls a splicing program that impacts mitochondrial dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101688">Transcranial direct current stimulation modulates primate brain dynamics across states of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                The resting primate brain is traversed by spontaneous functional connectivity patterns that show striking differences between conscious and unconscious states. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique, can improve signs of consciousness in disorders of consciousness (DOCs); however, can it influence both conscious and unconscious dynamic functional connectivity? We investigated the modulatory effect of prefrontal cortex (PFC) tDCS on brain dynamics in awake and anesthetized non-human primates using functional MRI. In awake macaques receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS, we found that cathodal stimulation robustly disrupted the repertoire of functional connectivity patterns, increased structure–function correlation (SFC), decreased Shannon entropy, and favored transitions toward anatomically based patterns. Under deep sedation, anodal tDCS significantly altered brain pattern distribution and reduced SFC. The prefrontal stimulation also modified dynamic connectivity arrangements typically associated with consciousness and unconsciousness. Our findings offer compelling evidence that PFC tDCS induces striking modifications in the fMRI-based dynamic organization of the brain across different states of consciousness. This study contributes to an enhanced understanding of tDCS neuromodulation mechanisms and has important clinical implications for DOCs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106387">Age and learning shapes sound representations in auditory cortex during adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened plasticity. Yet, how ongoing development affects sensory processing and cognitive function is unclear. We investigated how adolescent (postnatal day 20–42) and adult (postnatal day 60–82) mice differ in performance on a pure tone Go/No-Go auditory discrimination task of varying difficulty. Using dense electrophysiological recordings, we measured spiking activity at single neuron resolution in the auditory cortex while mice were engaged in the task. As compared to adults, adolescent mice showed lower auditory discrimination performance in a difficult task. This difference in performance was due to higher response variability and weaker cognitive control expressed as higher lick bias. Adolescent and adult neuronal responses differed only slightly in representations of pure tones when measured outside the context of learning and the task. However, cortical representations after learning within the context of the task were markedly different. We found differences in stimulus- and choice-related activity at the single neuron level representations, as well as lower population-level decoding of the difficult task in adolescents. Overall, cortical decoding in adolescents was lower and slower, especially for difficult sound discrimination, reflecting immature cortical representations of sounds and choices. Notably, we found age-related differences, which were more pronounced after learning, reflecting the combined impact of age and learning. Our findings highlight distinct neurophysiological and behavioral profiles in adolescence, underscoring the ongoing development of cognitive control mechanisms and cortical plasticity during this sensitive developmental period.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106249">KDM5 demethylases suppress R-loop-mediated ‘viral mimicry’ and DNA damage in breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Tumors with low expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and antigen presentation (AP) genes respond relatively poorly to current immunotherapies. One of the early hallmarks of cancer is DNA hypomethylation in genomic repeat regions that can result in the expression of normally silenced endogenous ‘viral’ elements. Such epigenetic changes have the potential to augment anti-tumor immune responses as well as reduce tumor cell fitness through the generation of aberrant nucleic acid species (NAS) and consequent activation of NAS-sensing pathways. Therefore, tumor evolution should favor additional selective events that suppress NAS generation, possibly yielding specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we show that the lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of epigenetic regulatory enzymes suppresses R-loop formation in genomic repeat regions specifically in cancer cells. We find that KDM5 inhibition in luminal breast cancer cells results in R-loop-mediated DNA damage, reduced cell fitness, and an increase in ISG and AP signatures as well as cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, mediated by RNA:DNA hybrid activation of the CGAS/STING pathway. KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the CGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that KDM5 inhibitors may enable a wide therapeutic window in this setting, compared to STING agonists or type I interferons. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between epigenetic regulation of genomic repeats, R-loop formation, innate immunity, and cell fitness in the context of cancer evolution and therapeutic vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96718">Synchronous ensembles of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons during novel exploration</a></h4>

              
                Synchronous neuronal ensembles play a pivotal role in the consolidation of long-term memory in the hippocampus. However, their organization during the acquisition of spatial memory remains less clear. In this study, we used neuronal population voltage imaging to investigate the synchronization patterns of mice CA1 pyramidal neuronal ensembles during the exploration of a new environment, a critical phase for spatial memory acquisition. We found synchronous ensembles comprising approximately 40% of CA1 pyramidal neurons, firing simultaneously in brief windows (~25ms) during immobility and locomotion in novel exploration. Notably, these synchronous ensembles were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations but were instead phase-locked to theta waves recorded in the contralateral CA1 region. Moreover, the subthreshold membrane potentials of neurons exhibited coherent intracellular theta oscillations with a depolarizing peak at the moment of synchrony. Among newly formed place cells, pairs with more robust synchronization during locomotion displayed more distinct place-specific activities. These findings underscore the role of synchronous ensembles in coordinating place cells of different place fields.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100937">Shared functional organization between pulvinar-cortical and cortico-cortical connectivity and its structural and molecular imaging correlates</a></h4>

              
                The pulvinar, the largest thalamic nucleus, is a highly interconnected structure supporting perception, visuospatial attention, and emotional processing. Such a central role relies on a precise topographical organization reflected in anatomical connectivity and neurochemical markers. Traditionally subdivided into distinct subnuclei, recent work shows that these divisions only partially explain its organization, which is better captured by continuous gradients of cortical connections along dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes. While well studied in primates, this gradient-based architecture remains less explored in humans. The present work combines high-quality, multimodal structural and functional imaging with a whole-brain, large-scale, PET atlas mapping 19 neurotransmitter systems. By applying diffusion embedding to tractography, functional connectivity, and receptor coexpression, we identify multiple gradients of structural connections, functional coactivation, and molecular binding patterns. These converge on a shared representation along the dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes of the human pulvinar, aligning with connectivity transitions from lower-level to higher-order cortical regions. Moreover, this is paralleled by gradual changes in the expression of molecular markers associated with key neuromodulator systems, including serotoninergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and opioid systems. Our findings advance the understanding of pulvinar anatomy and function, offering an exploratory framework to investigate the role of this structure in both health and disease.

">Overexpression of α-Synuclein Alters The Nanoscopic Organisation of Presynaptic Proteins</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons Disease (PD) is characterised by accumulation of -synuclein (-Syn), but how elevated -Syn alters presynaptic architecture during prodromal phases of the disease remains unclear. We investigated presynaptic morphology and two key presynaptic proteins: MYCBP2; and the Active Zone (AZ) protein ELKS. Primary rat cortical neurons were transfected with wildtype -Syn, or the familial A30P mutant, and nanoscopic changes to bouton morphology and protein localisation were investigated using super-resolution microscopy. Variant specific accumulation patterns for overexpressed -Syn were observed without changes to bouton structure. Additionally, increases of both -Syn variants affected presynaptic proteins, decreasing MYCBP2 puncta count and intensity, and reducing ELKS protein density. Since MYCBP2 potentially regulates ELKS, these findings suggest that elevated -Syn perturbs AZ components whilst presynaptic structure is preserved. Our study supports growing evidence that increased -Syn disturbs presynaptic function potentially through a MYCBP2-ELKS axis, a mechanism which may provide a valuable target for PD therapeutics.

">PhysioMotion Artifact: A Task-Driven EEG Dataset with Channel-Level Motion Artifact Annotations</a></h4>

              
                Physiological artifacts pose persistent challenges in electroencephalogram (EEG) data acquisition, often compromising interpretation and post-analysis of EEG signals across research and clinical applications. To address such limitations, including various artifact types, insufficient annotations, and low spatial resolutions, we present PhysioMotion Artifact, a large-scale, task-driven EEG dataset with channellevel artifact annotations. EEG data was acquired from 30 healthy participants performing 16 systematically designed single-type and multi-type movement tasks, inducing 14 distinct types of physiological artifacts. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we implemented a Convolutional Neural Networks-Transformer hybrid model for artifact detection and classification, achieving 98% accuracy in binary classification and 85% in 14-class classification tasks.

">Cell-type-resolved RNA-seq reveals molecular engrams of sexual experience in Drosophila neuromodulatory neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Flexible behavioral responses rely on the ability of neural circuits to adapt their physiology and output to changing social and environmental contexts. Neuromodulation plays a central role in this flexibility, dynamically tuning neuronal activity and gene expression to align behavior with experience and internal states. Yet how specific experiences and motivational conditions are encoded within neuromodulatory neurons remains underexplored. Here, we show that distinct motivational outcomes drive discrete, largely non-overlapping transcriptional programs across three neuromodulatory neuronal populations in male Drosophila brains. Using cell-type-resolved RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of serotonergic (Trh), octopaminergic/tyraminergic (Tdc2), and neuropeptide F receptor (NPFR) neurons under three conditions: successful mating, sexual rejection, and the absence of social or sexual interaction. Each experience induced a unique molecular engram within specific neuron types. NPFR neurons exhibited the strongest transcriptional remodeling following rejection, Tdc2 neurons preferentially represented the single state, and Trh neurons displayed balanced, experience-specific tuning. Shared differentially expressed genes across neuronal classes were few and often were oppositely regulated, revealing divergent circuit-specific logic. Experience triggered multilayered reprogramming across chromatin organization, RNA metabolism, translation, proteostasis and synaptic machinery, with selective recalibration of vesicle trafficking, and neuroplasticity. We further identified a compact, cross-circuit rejection core enriched for circadian, stress, metabolic, neuropeptidergic, and synaptic components. Together, these findings demonstrate how neuromodulatory circuits translate social experience into coordinated molecular and synaptic adaptations that enable behavioral flexibility.

">Sex specific axon initial segment plasticity underlies cortical hyperexcitability in trigeminal pain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain results from peripheral lesion, causing maladaptive plasticity and central sensitization. Clinical and preclinical studies demonstrate that modifications of primary sensory cortex (S1) activity are essential for neuropathic pain persistence. Rodent studies report heightened S1 pyramidal cell excitability in neuropathic pain model, the origins of which remain debated. The axon initial segment, the action potential trigger zone, is a major determinant of neuronal excitability and is known to undergo structural changes after neural perturbation but its role in chronic pain is poorly understood and no studies have explored its role in cortical hyperexcitability in chronic pain models. Besides, despite a higher prevalence of chronic pain in women, most of preclinical studies have been conducted in males. By integrating electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and computational modeling, this study demonstrates that in a trigeminal neuropathic pain rat model, sex-specific structural plasticity of the axon initial segment enhances the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal cells in the somatosensory cortex, potentially driving network-level hyperactivity.

">CSF1R inhibition during cranial radiotherapy reshapes glial dynamics via microglial loss, monocyte engraftment, and accelerated astrocyte reactivity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cranial radiotherapy (cRT), a common treatment for central nervous system tumors, induces progressive cognitive problems in over half of patients. In mice, microglial depletion via CSF1R inhibition can mitigate this effect, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that CSF1R inhibition-induced microglial ablation and repopulation improves brain health by modulating microglial reactivity to radiotherapy, which attenuates glial responses to radiotherapy. Methods: Nine-week-old male C57BL/6JRj mice received either a CSF1R-inhibitor supplemented diet (pexidartinib, PLX3397) or control diet, followed by fractionated CT-guided cRT (30 Gy) or sham treatment. The pexidartinib diet was discontinued 10 days post-radiotherapy. Animals were sacrificed at three intervals post-radiotherapy, allowing the assessment of temporal changes. Multiple brain regions were assessed by immunohistochemistry for markers of microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and proliferating cells. Microglial morphological changes were assessed using the semi-automated microglia morphology analysis pipeline mGlia. Results: Radiotherapy alone reduced microglial numbers and induced a progressive reactive morphology; mild at 30 days and pronounced at 6 months post cRT. CSF1R inhibition before cRT markedly decreased microglial markers but increased general macrophage markers at 30 days and 6 months after cRT, consistent with monocyte-derived cell engraftment. Morphometric analysis revealed rapid and severe morphological change towards a reactive morphotype at 30 days that persisted until 6 months. Microglial depletion did not prevent loss of neurogenesis or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and accelerated reactive astrogliosis, though partial OPC recovery in the hippocampus and thalamus was observed at 6 months. Conclusion: CSF1R inhibition combined with cRT accelerates reactive gliosis and monocyte-derived macrophage engraftment without protecting vulnerable neural cell populations, though limited long-term OPC recovery occurred. Thus, with this set-up CSF1R inhibition-induced microglial ablation and repopulation does not improve overall brain health, but is beneficial for OPCs on the long term after cRT.

">A cluster of three snoRNAs including jouvence required in the gut determines lifespan and confers neuroprotection through metabolic parameters</a></h4>

              
                In our society, the aging of the population is a major concern of public health. Recently we have identified a new snoRNA (jouvence) in Drosophila, and showed that its deletion (F4) reduces lifespan, while its overexpression increases it. F4 deleted flies also present neurodegenerative lesions and a deregulation of metabolic parameters as triglycerides and sterol. However, a deeper characterization of this genomic locus has revealed the presence of two other snoRNAs. Here, we have characterized at the whole organismal level, the role of each them. First, we show that each snoRNAs are expressed in the epithelium of the gut (enterocytes), and in the fat body. Second, in F4 deletion, the re-expression of each snoRNA in the enterocytes or in the fat body is sufficient to improve lifespan, and protect against neurodegeneration in old flies. In addition, depending of the snoRNAs, it rescues the expression of specific deregulated genes within the epithelium of the gut, involved in lipids and sterol metabolism. Consequently, these two metabolic parameters are also rescued, establishing a relationship between the lesions of the brain, the metabolic disorders, the lifespan, and each snoRNAs respectively. Finally, histological stainings as Nile Red and BODIPY C11-581/591 have revealed that the neurodegenerative lesions are due to an increase of free sterol within the brain, and lipid peroxydation in the pericerebral fat body. Altogether, these results point-out a causal relationship between the epithelium of the gut and the neurodegenerative lesions through the metabolic parameters, indicating a gut-brain axis.

">Distinct Filament Conformation for Receptor-Bound Amyloid-β from Alzheimers Disease Brain</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease is triggered by amyloid-{beta}, with symptoms linked to synapse loss. Oligomeric amyloid-{beta}, rather than monomeric or fibrillar amyloid-{beta}, has been proposed to be the proximate mechanistic cause, but the relevant molecular characteristics have remained unclear. Here, we define a distinct receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} pool in Alzheimers brain by release with a receptor antagonist and purification to homogeneity. Receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} is ten times more abundant than free unbound amyloid-{beta}. The amyloid-{beta} associated with receptor is composed of 65 nm long filaments with prion protein binding at its tips. There is no evidence for an oligomeric A{beta} state interacting with human brain receptors. Cryo-electron microscopy shows two symmetric S-shaped monomers per filament rung. The tilt between rung monomers, twist along the filament axis, amino terminal conformation and amyloid seeding properties distinguish this structure from plaque-associated amyloid-{beta} filaments of the same brain. High tip:length ratio is critical for prion protein receptor interaction and synaptic damage. Characterizing receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} filament provides insight into neuronal dysfunction separate from plaque aggregation.

">AAV11 mediates efficient retrograde trans-neuronal transduction of astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate neural circuits is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in psychiatric disorders and for exploring potential therapeutic or intervention strategies. Viral tracers are powerful vehicles for comprehending the complex relationship between neurons and astrocytes. Despite adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) based anterograde trans-neuronal tools have been successfully applied for identifying astrocytes connected with presynaptic neurons, analogous retrograde trans-neuronal tools for labeling astrocytes connected to postsynaptic neurons remain under development. Here, we first demonstrate that GfaABC1D promoter embedding AAV11 can transfer retrogradely from axons of postsynaptic neurons to astrocytes. Furthermore, we established an AAV11-based dual-viral recombination strategy for labeling astrocytes connected to specific postsynaptic neurons. Finally, by employing targeted neuronal ablation technology to ablate neurons in a specific brain region, we observed that injection of AAV11 into the downstream brain region of this targeted area exhibited minimal labeling of astrocytes functionally associated with the ablated neurons. This finding indicates that AAV11 holds utility for deciphering pathological alterations in disease-related astrocyte-neuron connectivity networks. This work fills a key gap in tools used for studying astrocyte-neuron connectivity networks.

">AI-Guided Dual Strategy for Peptide Inhibitor Design Targeting Structural Polymorphs of α-Synuclein Fibrils</a></h4>

              
                One of the most important events in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related disorders is the formation of abnormal fibrils via the aggregation of -synuclein with {beta}-sheet-rich organization. The use of Cryo-EM has uncovered different polymorphs of the fibrils, each having unique structural interfaces, which has made the design of inhibitors even more challenging. Here, a structure-guided framework incorporating AI-assisted peptide generation was set up with the objective of targeting the conserved {beta}-sheet motifs that are present in various forms of -syn fibrils. The ProteinMPNN, then, AlphaFold-Multimer, and PepMLM were employed to create short peptides that would interfere with the growth of the fibrils. The two selected candidates, T1 and S1, showed a significant inhibition of -syn fibrillation, as measured by a decrease in the ThT fluorescence and the generation of either amorphous or fragmented aggregates. The inhibitory potency of the peptides was in line with the predicted interface energies. This research work illustrates that the integration of cryo-EM structural knowledge with the computational design method leads to the quick discovery of the wide-spectrum peptide inhibitors, which is a good strategy for the precision treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

">Interruption of rat absence seizures by auditory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Absence seizures are episodes of impaired consciousness and responsiveness that impact an individual's ability to interact with the world around them. Childhood absence epilepsy, a condition defined by these seizures, can have profound effects on children's social, educational, and psychological development. Absence seizures are accompanied by a distinctive electrographic signature called a spike-wave discharge. The impairment of consciousness associated with a spike-wave discharge can be variable: some people maintain responsiveness during some absence seizures, and some rodent oscillations resembling spike-wave discharges may not have any behavioral impact. We previously observed that spike-wave discharges in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg model sometimes terminated shortly after presentation of a conditioned auditory stimulus. In this study we found that these terminations were caused by the stimuli and that they occurred after approximately 50% of stimuli. We also found that the probability of a spike-wave discharge being interrupted depended on stimulus timing, degree of conditioning, and electrographic signal power. These data provide insight into the factors that determine the mechanisms of absence seizure termination, with possible implications for therapy.

">Using a wearable EEG device to examine age trends in sleep macro- and micro-architecture across adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Study objectives: Adolescence is a period of distinct maturational changes in sleep characteristics. Historically, age trends in sleep physiology have been captured using laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG). However, multiple challenges associated with PSG, including logistical issues, budgetary constraints and ecological validity questions, limit large-scale use. The current study aims to address these challenges by using the Dreem3 headband to measure sleep at home and replicate well-established age-related trends in sleep physiology from late childhood through early adulthood. Methods: 100 typically developing youth (9-26 years) wore a sleep electroencephalography (EEG) device (Dreem3) for 3-4 consecutive nights at home. Sleep EEG data were processed using the Luna pipeline. We used linear mixed models to estimate age-related trends across 8 macro-architecture and 15 micro-architecture variables previously found to be associated with age, and explored age relationships in 24 additional macro- and micro-architecture variables. Results: At-home sleep studies using Dreem3 replicated established age trends in sleep macro- and micro-architecture, including decreases in percent time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 3 (N3%) sleep and decreases in NREM delta power with increasing age. Exploratory analysis revealed age effects in seven other variables, including decreases in integrated slow spindle activity and NREM cycle duration with increasing age. Conclusion: Sleep EEG wearables may offer an accessible way to characterize sleep physiology development in large cohorts, setting the stage for understanding how deviations from normative age patterns may put young people at risk for adverse outcomes.

">Feasibility of a parent-delivered attention and working memory intervention for early school-aged children born preterm</a></h4>

              
                Preterm birth is a common neurodevelopmental condition that can have lasting impacts on cognition, including attention and working memory. Interventions that strengthen these skills in early childhood could support school readiness. Dino Island is a tablet-based intervention that combines process-specific practice of attention and working memory skills with a compensatory component that teaches metacognitive skills to scaffold learning. In this pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of parent-delivered Dino Island in young children born preterm (N=10), alongside a control group who played educational games (N=12). Both groups were instructed to play 2-3 times per week for approximately 20 minutes over a 12-week period. Attention and working memory on untrained tasks were assessed before and after completing the intervention. Parents provided fidelity data through tracking sheets and participated in exit interviews to offer feedback and identify barriers and facilitators. We found that the Dino Island program was successfully delivered by parents with high fidelity. Attrition was higher in the Dino Island group, likely reflecting the challenges of delivering cognitive remediation in home settings. Comparison of attention and working memory scores on untrained tasks pre- and post- showed practice effects but no specific benefit of Dino Island. However, parent reports suggested behavioral improvements specific to the Dino Island group, noting far-transfer effects where children applied metacognitive strategies in other contexts. Overall, this work shows feasibility and tolerability of Dino Island in young children born preterm. Future research should examine its potential impact on school readiness and longer-term academic outcomes in this population.

">Aged brain multi-omic integration captures immunometabolic and sex variation</a></h4>

              
                Resolving the molecular basis for heterogeneous aging in the human brain requires integrating its diverse molecular layers, including the transcriptional, epigenetic, and proteomic states. To provide such a view, we applied a tensor decomposition framework to jointly analyze single-nucleus RNA-seq, DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and proteomic data from 276 postmortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from the ROSMAP aging cohort. Our analysis revealed two dominant themes defined by components with strong multi-omic coherence. First, we identified a robust immunometabolic axis characterized by microglial activation, suppression of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, and epigenetic signatures suggesting the repurposing of developmental transcription factors. Second our analysis resolved the effect of sex into a mosaic of distinct, cell-type-specific molecular programs within glia. These included male-biased mitochondrial programs in microglia, a shift toward precursor-like states in the female oligodendrocyte lineage, and bidirectional epigenetic remodeling in astrocytes. This work provides a high-resolution atlas of glial aging, demonstrating that broad risk factors manifest as complex, cell-specific vulnerabilities; a critical insight for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

">Uncertainty-Gated Min-Cost Flows for In Vivo NanoScale Synaptic Plasticity Tracking</a></h4>

              
                Synapses are the fundamental unit of neural connectivity. They exhibit dynamic functional and structural changes that enable the brain to learn, adapt, and form memories. Recent advances in endogenous protein fluorescent labeling offer an opportunity to image synaptic strength in vivo and thus study the mechanisms underlying adaptive neural computation in living mice. Studying synaptic dynamics requires tracking individual signals of small, densely packed synapses over days while they change in size, position, and intensity between imaging sessions, and may even appear/disappear entirely. Tracking >100,000 dynamic, submicrometer particles is difficult even for state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, most algorithms rely on an isotropic uncertainty ball, assigning equal weight to the lateral plane (XY) and to the noisier axial dimension (Z), leading to poorer performance. To address these challenges and accurately track synapses in vivo, we developed SynTrack. We formulated SynTrack as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem under the anisotropic uncertainty ball, along with a fully temporally connected spatio-temporal graph to overcome long-term occlusions. SynTrack achieves a mean track length of 0.51 um with a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) score of 88.8%, on par with MOTA scores of expert annotators but with massively increased speed and scalability. Over two weeks, we successfully track 65,000 synapses in 5.6 out of 8 imaging sessions on average, with 20,000 synapses being tracked in at least seven sessions. We present SynTrack as a state-of-the-art algorithm capable of high-resolution and fidelity tracking of synapse dynamics in behaving mice with unprecedented detail.

">Joint multi-omics profiling of brain and body health in aging</a></h4>

              
                The human brain and peripheral systems undergo coordinated changes throughout the lifespan, yet studies of aging have traditionally examined these systems as separate entities. Here we ask how brain health relates to peripheral biomarkers of bodily health including body mass index, blood pressure, and blood biochemistry results. We use partial least squares analysis to identify generalizable patterns of covariance between multi-modal neuroimaging data (structural, functional, diffusion, and arterial spin labeling MRI), demographic, and peripheral physiological markers in two large-scale deeply phenotyped datasets: the Human Connectome Project-Aging and UK Biobank. This data-driven pattern learning approach identifies two principal axes of brain-body associations in both biological sex groups. The first axis is driven by the dominant contribution of age. Across multiple brain measures, aging is associated with loss of brain structural integrity and cerebral vascular dysfunction. The second axis is driven by metabolic features, characterized by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated body mass index, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin, glucose, and alanine aminotransferase, and reduced cerebral blood perfusion. Finally, we show that deviations from a healthy metabolic profile are linked to cognitive deficits, particularly in females. Our study contributes to development of comprehensive translatable biomarkers for brain health assessment, and highlights the importance of metabolic health as a determinant of brain health.

">Reasoning with programs in replay</a></h4>

              
                Reasoning flexibly composes known elements to solve novel problems. Recent theories suggest the brain uses the axis of time to compose elements for reasoning. In this view, elements are packaged into fast neural sequences, with each sequence exploring the implications of a different composition. Using magnetoencephalography, we tested this idea while participants mentally executed programs. Each program contained a set of steps linked to operations, the implications of which had to be computed. We found that behavioral performance scaled with program complexity, and by the end of execution, inferred program solutions were represented in prefrontal and parietal cortices. We identified a possible mechanism by which these solutions were computed. During reasoning, representations of steps in the program reactivated in fast sequences, consistent with sampling candidate partial solutions. Further evidence suggested these reactivations were accompanied by representations of their operations, and were followed by neural patterns reflecting their computed implications. Together, these results suggest replaying sequences supports program execution and reveal a highly organized temporal microarchitecture of reasoning.

">Sensorimotor adaptation of vocal pitch is severely impaired in cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Sensory errors, mismatches between predicted sensory outcomes of movement and reafferent sensory feedback, drive changes in the feedforward control of future motor behavior that correct for those errors. Across a wide variety of motor behaviors, individuals with cerebellar damage show impairments in these corrections, strongly suggesting a key role of the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation. However, the extent to which the cerebellum is involved in controlling vocal pitch is currently unknown. Crucially, vocal pitch differs in several ways from other systems that suggest it relies more on feedback than feedforward control. Adaptation itself also differs in vocal pitch: rather than the gradual build-up/decay of learning seen in other systems, pitch adaptation and de-adaptation are almost immediate. Together, this questions whether adaptation in vocal pitch relies on the same mechanism as other motor domains. Here, we test the hypothesis that the cerebellum underlies sensorimotor adaptation in vocal pitch, testing the domain-generality of this neurocomputational process. In both sustained vocalization and a more natural word production task, individuals with cerebellar ataxia fail to adapt to external auditory perturbation of vocal pitch. The complete lack of adaptation observed, compared to the impaired but present adaptation seen in other systems, suggest that the cerebellum plays an especially critical role in maintaining accurate control of vocal pitch. Conversely, we failed to detect a previously observed increase in online compensation to vocal pitch errors in ataxia, potentially suggesting this may be an idiosyncratic change in control rather than a common trait in this population.

">A single session of mild intensity physical exercise modulates brain oscillations in healthy young adults: a pilot study.</a></h4>

              
                An acute session of moderate or vigorous physical exercise (PE) induces a cascade of neurophysiological processes such as release of growth factors, which relate to increased electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. Studies using animal models of Alzheimer disease (AD) showed that these mechanisms are disrupted even at asymptomatic stages of the disease. Specifically, increased neural activity within Theta band observed in healthy mice was not evidenced in mice models of AD, suggesting that EEG could be a suitable non-invasive tool to detect preclinical AD. The present study aims investigating the possible neurophysiological effects after a session of mild intensity PE, which is feasible to carry out in most population, during an EEG recording. Thus, sixteen young humans cycled at a low intensity in a stationary bike to study PE effects on the EEG frequency bands. EEG was acquired before and after PE (immediately after performing the PE, or 20-25 minutes later). Results showed that PE increased Alpha activity in frontal and central electrodes for at least 25 minutes, which aligns with previous studies in humans. Trends to increased Theta activity were observed within the left hemisphere immediately after PE, but not 25 minutes after finishing PE. Studies using larger samples should assess whether mild intensity PE increases Alpha and Theta and induces effects of different duration in both frequency bands, suggesting sensitivity of EEG to detect diverse neurophysiological effects induced by PE. Another pending issue is whether increased Alpha after PE in humans is functionally equivalent to increased Theta observed in mice.

">Axon Regeneration and Functional Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury is Enhanced by Allele-Specific ApoE Neuronal Action through LRP8</a></h4>

              
                Adult CNS trauma frequently causes neuronal disconnection and persistent deficits due to failed axon regeneration. While model system screening has identified multiple candidate neural repair pathways, ApoE-LRP8 signaling is unique in being implicated clinically. Here, we show that cortical axon regeneration requires LRP8 and is modified by APOE variants. ApoE2-expressing mice show reparative corticospinal and raphespinal axon growth with greater motor function than controls after spinal cord injury. Distinct from ApoE in other settings, there is no change in inflammation or scarring. After axotomy, ApoE exerts allele-specific effects on LRP8 localization and signaling in cortical neurons. APOE alleles regulate synaptic organization gene expression by cortical neurons after injury, with little effect on glial gene expression. AAV-mediated overexpression of ApoE2 in mice after spinal trauma increases locomotor recovery and reparative axon growth. Thus, ApoE-LRP8 signaling for axon regrowth following CNS trauma provides a potential therapeutic intervention site.

">Asynchronous firing and off-states in working memory maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Persistent spiking activity and activity-silent mechanisms have been proposed as neural correlates of working memory. To determine their relative contribution, we recorded neural activity from the lateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex of two male macaques using high-density microelectrode probes. We found that, when averaged across all neurons, persistent delay activity was observable throughout the duration of single trials in populations of prefrontal neurons with silent periods that did not deviate significantly from chance. However, temporal fluctuations in activity-dependent mnemonic information were present and weakly correlated between the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, suggesting at least partial, long-distance synchronization of off-states. Decoding accuracy of neurons recorded simultaneously was also reduced relatively to pseudo-populations constructed by splicing different trials together. Our results support an asynchronous state of working memory, maintained by the distributed pattern of persistent discharges across cortical neurons, which is subject to widely distributed fluctuations in information representation fidelity.

">Role of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system in susceptibility and resilience following early life stress in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Child adversity (CA), encompassing emotional, physical, and sexual maltreatment or abuse, affects a substantial number of children worldwide. Moreover, it is the leading predictor of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and suicidal behavior. Despite the robust link between CA and psychopathology, individual outcomes vary significantly, with some children demonstrating resilience. Resilience is an adaptive and dynamic process, which mitigates the long-term effects of CA, suggesting potential protective mechanisms that remain underexplored. This study investigates the role of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a critical modulator of stress, cognition, and emotion, in mediating resilience and susceptibility following early life stress (ELS). Methods: Using a maternal deprivation model combined with limited nesting and bedding, we examined behavioral, physiological, and neurobiological markers associated with ELS outcomes in mice of both sex. Results: Behavioral clustering revealed distinct phenotypes: resilient, anxious, and depressive-like with sex-specific differences in distribution. Early markers, including body weight and ultrasonic vocalization (USV) patterns, predicted long-term susceptibility. Neuroanatomical analyses identified sex-specific LC-NE activation patterns associated with resilience and susceptibility, highlighting the caudal-dorsal LC as a critical region in males and females in different phenotypes, anxious in males and resilient in females. Conclusion: These findings highlight the impact of ELS on the LC-NE system and its role in shaping adaptive and maladaptive trajectories, offering insights into potential interventions targeting resilience mechanisms in children exposed to CA.

">The neural correlates of novel versus familiar metaphors in healthy young adults: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy study</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive investigation, the neural correlates of metaphor processing remain debated. Poor theoretical and experimental control of variables that drive metaphor activation (particularly the constructs of novelty and familiarity) may be the reason for past discrepancies between studies. To address this issue, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and a carefully designed paradigm modified from Cardillo et al. (2012) to investigate how neural activation varies by sentence type (metaphorical versus literal sentences) and novelty (completely novel versus familiarized phrases). Activity was significantly greater for metaphorical over literal sentences in the left inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis (LIFGtri), left inferior parietal cortex, right IFG, pars opercularis (RIFGop), and right angular gyrus (RAG). Novel metaphors to which participants had no prior exposure had significantly higher (albeit weak) effects within RIFGop, RAG, and right middle temporal gyrus (RMTG) compared to novel metaphors to which participants were exposed just prior to the fNIRS experiment. Pre-exposed, more familiar metaphors significantly activated a wider network of regions compared to novel metaphors, including bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral IFGtri, and LMTG. A greater response time difference between conditions was associated with less LMFG activity for metaphors over literal sentences but higher LMTG activity for novel over more familiar metaphors. Taken together, these findings suggest that metaphors - particularly novel metaphors - do engage right hemisphere cortex more than other phrase types (literal sentences, more familiar metaphors) but that the effects are weaker than condition differences within canonical left language network and domain-general multiple demand network regions.

">A comprehensive characterization of the phospholipid and cholesterol composition of the uncinate fasciculus in the human brain: evidence of age-related alterations</a></h4>

              
                The uncinate fasciculus (UF) is a long-range association fiber tract that serves to connect the anterior temporal lobe with the orbitofrontal cortex. The UF has been implicated via neuroimaging studies in the neurobiological vulnerability to psychiatric disorders posed by a history of childhood abuse (CA), as well as in the psychopathology underlying depressive disorders. Since the myelin sheath is highly enriched in lipids, white matter (WM) dysfunction may reflect alterations in the myelin lipid profile. In fact, our previous work showed that in the anterior cingulate cortex WM, there was a specific effect of CA in the choline glycerophospholipid fatty acids (FA) involved in the synthesis of arachidonic acid. Given that the UF does not exist in rodents, its molecular properties are highly understudied and its lipid composition is virtually unknown. As such, we sought to quantify the phospholipid FA and cholesterol quantities of the human postmortem UF and measure whether we could detect lipid-related or myelin-constituent gene/protein changes associated with CA and/or depression. Fresh-frozen left hemisphere UF samples were analyzed from individuals with depression who died by suicide with a history of severe CA (DS-CA), individuals with depression who died by suicide without a history of CA (DS), and non-psychiatric control subjects who died naturally or accidentally (CTRL). Phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography. FA and non-derivatized cholesterol were quantified using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Relative expression of myelin-constituent genes (PLP1, MAG, CNP, MOG, PLLP, MBP, and MOBP) was measured by RT-qPCR, and levels of myelin-constituent proteins (MAG, MOG, MBP, and PLP) were measured by immunoblotting. We found no robust relationships between depression or CA and any lipid measures, nor in myelin-constituent gene and protein levels. However, in the phospholipids, we observed striking age relationships that varied across fractions, with an overall pattern of increases in monounsaturates and decreases in long chain omega-6 polyunsaturates with age. In tandem, we observed that most myelin-constituent genes and proteins showed decreasing trends with age, with PLP1 and MAG showing significantly decreasing relationships. We hypothesize that the changes in lipid composition and lipid-protein interactions contribute to age-related myelin deficits and declines in cognition. The absence of group differences highlights the importance of regional specificity in molecular studies assessing neurobiological correlates of psychiatric disorders.

                Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (dMRS) is a unique, non-invasive technique capable of probing cell-type specific morphology. However, conventional dMRS methods are limited in their ability to provide detailed morphological information. This study demonstrates the potential of a multi-parametric dMRS approach, combining diffusion-time dependent and double-diffusion encoding MR spectroscopy, to characterize soma and neurite morphology of neuronal and glial cells. This methodology holds promise for developing biomarkers for the diagnosis, monitoring, and phenotyping of neurological pathologies, like Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, or Multiple Sclerosis, where alterations in soma and neurite morphology are reported.

However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been elucidated. We aimed to identify structural covariance network alterations in depressed adolescents with suicidal behaviors to provide novel neuroimaging evidence for this condition. 64 first-episode, treatment-naïve depressed adolescent patients with suicidal behaviors and 48 healthy controls were enrolled. Nonnegative matrix factorization was used to identify the structural covariance networks. The Kullback–Leibler divergence method was applied to estimate the interregional relationships between the altered brain networks. Correlation analyses were conducted between altered brain networks and clinical characteristics. Patients had lower gray matter volumes in the anterior default mode network (DMN), visual network, sensorimotor network, and right executive control network than healthy controls. Morphological connections were altered in the anterior DMN, visual network, and right executive control network in patients. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between morphological connections in anterior DMN-visual networks and illness duration in the patient group. This study revealed abnormal gray matter attributes in the anterior DMN, visual network, sensorimotor network, and executive control network in first-episode and treatment-naïve adolescent depression with suicide, which might reflect disease traits and provide essential neurobiological evidence for behavioral disturbances in depression.</span>

To provide new insights into the neuro-structural correlates of MI performance in DCD, this study examined the association between the volume of gray matter regions and MI performance in a sample of 65 children (33 females, 24 children with DCD) aged 6 to 14 yr (mean age = 10.07, SD = 2.64). Implicit MI performance was assessed using a hand laterality judgment task. Regional volumes of frontal-motor, parietal, and cerebellar regions were derived from T1-weighted neuroimaging data. Relative to typically developing children, children with DCD showed less efficient MI performance on the hand laterality judgment task and had smaller cortical volumes in frontal and cerebellar regions. Partial correlations demonstrated that smaller gray matter volumes in frontal and parietal regions were associated with less efficient MI performance in children with and without DCD. These findings provide novel insight into the neurobiological basis of MI performance in children with and without DCD and highlight the possible contribution of gray matter morphological properties to compromised internal models in children with DCD.</span>

A total of 127 adults (33 with generalized anxiety disorder, 26 with panic disorder, 36 with social anxiety disorder, and 32 healthy controls) were recruited. We found that all individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder showed abnormal activity in the prefrontal–limbic–cerebellar circuit and default mode network regions. Patients with panic disorder showed unique hypoconnectivity between the default mode network and sensory-motor network, whereas patients with social anxiety disorder showed unique extensive hyperconnectivity between the default mode network and other networks. In addition, increased activity in the left orbital inferior frontal gyrus was associated with depression and anxiety symptom severity, decreased activity in the left superior temporal gyrus was associated with panic symptom severity, and decreased activity in the right fusiform gyrus was correlated with social anxiety symptom severity. These findings provide valuable implications for understanding the neuropathology, diagnosing, and developing targeted therapeutic interventions for different subtypes of anxiety disorders.</span>

Individual-specific region-of-interest analyses showed that the same sensorimotor networks were activated across the language modalities. In motor regions, word production and comprehension elicited the same phoneme-specific topographical activity patterns, with stronger haemodynamic activations for alveolar-initial words in the tongue cortex and stronger activations for bilabial-initial words in the lip cortex. In the posterior and middle superior temporal cortex, production and comprehension likewise resulted in similar activity patterns, with enhanced activations to alveolar- compared to bilabial-initial words. These results disagree with the classical asymmetry between language production and understanding in neurobiological models of language, and instead advocate for a cortical organization where phonology is carried by similar topographical activations in motor cortex and distributed activations in temporal cortex across the language modalities.</span>

Results show that brain areas known to be modulated by both frontal and striatal dopamine were activated in conditions that are thought to call for persistence, particularly the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and basal ganglia, indicating goal-related selective attention and top-down control. In contrast, conditions that call for flexibility showed brain activation in areas of the default mode network, suggesting reduced top-down control. This pattern was much clearer for the creativity tasks than meditation. Notably, we did not find significant effects when contrasting the 2 meditation techniques and when looking at brain activation overlap between meditation and creativity at the whole-brain level.

<p>Single-cell RNA-seq of the aged mouse hippocampus, integrated with CellChat, pseudotime analysis, hdWGCNA, and machine learning, reveals astrocyte-specific molecular alterations in perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Four key genes linked to neuroinflammation and cognitive decline were identified, offering promising biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for PND disease.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is common in older patients after anesthesia and surgery, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. However, the role of astrocytes in its pathogenesis remains limitedly understood. Here, we analyzed 9976 and 9484 single-cell transcriptomes from hippocampal cells of aged mice undergoing PND surgery or sham operation, focusing on astrocytes. We identified 13 distinct clusters corresponding to nine cell types, including astrocytes, microglia, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and other relevant cell populations. Specifically, five astrocyte subclusters were identified, with cluster 0 being the most abundant. Its proportion decreased by 5.51% in the PND surgery condition, showing the largest difference between the groups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that astrocytes are involved in crucial neurodevelopmental processes and pathways associated with nervous system development and synaptic regulation. Pseudotime analysis placed cluster 0 at the early stage of differentiation, suggesting it as a key responsive population. Gene co-expression network further identified modules with peak activity in cluster 0. By intersecting cluster 0 markers with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and applying machine learning methods, including LASSO, XGBoost, and Random Forest, we pinpointed four feature genes <i>Dbp</i>, <i>PISD</i>, <i>Id4</i>, and <i>Tsc22d3</i> with differential expression patterns between surgery and control conditions. Transcription factor activity analysis highlighted distinct regulatory networks in astrocytes, providing insights into their functional differences in response to PND surgery. These findings offer a detailed aged hippocampal landscape of astrocyte dynamics and intercellular communication, contributing to our understanding of neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction following surgical stress.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has traditionally been associated with amyloid-&beta; plaques, but growing evidence underscores the role of neuroinflammation in disease progression. The autoinflammatory hypothesis of AD suggests chronic immune dysfunction contributes to neuronal damage, making immune modulation a promising therapeutic strategy. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid with anti-inflammatory properties, may offer therapeutic potential. This study investigates how CBD independently influences two key neuroinflammatory regulators in AD: the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) pathway. Though mechanistically distinct, both shape CNS immune responses. Targeting these immune-metabolic axes provides a mechanistic alternative to amyloid- or tau-based approaches by addressing upstream drivers of neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation. Using the male 5XFAD transgenic AD mouse model, we administered CBD via inhalation and assessed IDO and cGAS expression using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence (IF), and gene expression analysis. We evaluated cytokine levels and used STRING-based bioinformatics to identify CBD-target interactions. CBD treatment significantly reduced IDO and cGAS expression, correlating with decreased proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta;, and IFN-. Bioinformatics identified potential interactions between CBD and immune targets such as AKT1, TRPV1, and GPR55. These targets were prioritized based on their roles in neuroinflammatory signaling and high-confidence interactions with CBD. AKT1 regulates inflammatory signaling and cell survival, TRPV1 modulates nociception and neuroinflammation, and GPR55 influences immune cell activation. These findings support CBD as a potential monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for AD by targeting distinct neuroinflammatory pathways, including IDO and cGAS. Further studies are warranted to fully explore its therapeutic potential.</p>

                <p>Reaching movements, while seemingly simple, involve complex motor control mechanisms that select specific trajectories from infinite possibilities. Despite inherent variability in volitional movements, both humans and monkeys frequently exhibit stereotyped trajectories. The literature has offered numerous explanations for invariant trajectory shapes, including a common planning space in hand space or joint space, as well as factors like kinetic energy (KE) minimization and sensory feedback. However, since most studies have relied on single-session data, crucial insights into the motor principles guiding trajectory selection and their evolution through extended practice remain underexplored. This study fills this gap by investigating how specific trajectories are selected and evolve with practice across multiple sessions, using data from two rhesus monkeys (one male, one female) performing a reaching task in a biomechanically constrained 2D setup. Our behavioral study challenges the idea of a common planning space, revealing instead a significant influence of KE on trajectory shapes. Through a novel biomechanical modeling, we quantified KE for a wide range of trajectory shapes. We discovered that trajectory selection and evolution are not simply about minimizing KE or achieving straight paths. Instead, the monkeys&rsquo; motor systems appear to prioritize maintaining a "safe KE range," where slight changes in trajectory shapes have minimal impact on energy expenditure. These findings provide new insights into the adaptive motor control strategies, suggesting that trajectory selection involves balancing energy efficiency and flexibility. Our study enhances the understanding of trajectory selection principles, with implications for rehabilitation strategies, robotics, and broader study of motor control mechanisms.</p>

                Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and often immune-mediated demyelinating disease with no definitive treatment. Transposable elements (TEs) are receiving increasing attention as potential contributors to neurodegenerative diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the possible association of TE expression and its potential role in MS pathogenesis at the single-cell level. Results In this study, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Our results revealed that TEs are overexpressed in a cluster of cells annotated as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Furthermore, enrichment analysis of the associated transcription factors (TFs) with highly upregulated TEs in ILCs revealed the relevance of these TFs to immune pathways and cis-regulatory regions in DNA. Conclusions We propose that upregulated TEs in ILCs are consistent with the plasticity of these cells, as TEs can insert themselves in coding or regulatory regions of immune-related genes and represent themselves as immune-related TF binding sites. We also hypothesize that ILCs with overexpressed TEs could present TE-derived antigens, potentially reactivating T cell-mediated immunity in the central nervous system (CNS) of MS patients. Therefore, this study indicates a possible mechanism involving TEs in ILC plasticity and their potential role in MS pathogenicity. Additionally, we suggest that repurposing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or developing new high-efficacy NRTIs could be a feasible approach to treating MS.

                Background and Objectives Hand and wrist fractures are among the most frequently encountered injuries in emergency departments and are often misdiagnosed, particularly when interpreted by non-specialist clinicians. These diagnostic errors can lead to treatment delays and long-term complications. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning algorithms, is emerging as a promising adjunct to improve diagnostic accuracy in radiographic fracture detection. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in detecting hand and wrist fractures compared to manual radiographic interpretation by clinicians. Materials and Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the diagnostic performance of AI models in detecting hand and wrist fractures compared to conventional radiographic interpretation by clinicians. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Wiley Online Library was performed. Eligible studies included those utilizing AI for fracture detection with sensitivity and specificity data. Pooled estimates were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed via I2 statistics, and publication bias was examined using funnel plots and Egger’s test. Results Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity and specificity under the random-effects model were 0.910 and 0.912, respectively, indicating high diagnostic accuracy of AI models. However, substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 99.09% for sensitivity; 96.43% for specificity) and publication bias were observed, likely due to variations in AI algorithms, sample sizes, and study designs. Conclusions Most AI models demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, with high sensitivity and specificity scores (≥90%). However, some models fell short in sensitivity and specificity (≤90%), indicating performance variations across different AI models or algorithms. From a clinical perspective, AI models with lower sensitivity scores may fail to detect hand and wrist fractures, potentially delaying treatment, while those with lower specificity scores could lead to unnecessary interventions—treating hands and wrists that are not fractured.

(Euphorbiaceae) 'Sweet stick' leaves in Rattus rattus var. albinus [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease representing a global public health concern and is associated with severe complications such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. Although several species of the genus Acalypha have demonstrated biological activity, no prior studies have evaluated the hypoglycemic effect of Acalypha argomuelleri Briq., making this study relevant. Method The hypoglycemic effect of the aqueous leaf extract of A. argomuelleri Briq. (AAAE) was evaluated in an experimental model using Rattus rattus var. albinus (males). A randomized, prospective design was employed, consisting of a control group and three treatment groups receiving doses of 100, 150, and 300 mg/kg of the extract, respectively. Hyperglycemia was induced via oral glucose administration. Results The qualitative phytochemical analysis of AAAE revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenols, cardiotonic glycosides, and diterpenes, with no reducing sugars. The 300 mg/kg dose produced a significant and sustained reduction in blood glucose levels, reaching near-normal values at 90 minutes, demonstrating a dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect. Discussion The study confirmed that AAAE has a dose-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg. This dose showed a faster and more sustained reduction in glucose levels compared to 100 and 150 mg/kg, suggesting higher efficacy at elevated concentrations. The identified flavonoids and phenols, associated with glucose metabolism modulation and pancreatic β-cell protection, likely explain the observed effect. The absence of reducing sugars indicates the hypoglycemic effect is linked to secondary metabolites. Conclusions The AAAE exhibited a significant dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg after 90 minutes. These findings support the potential of A. argomuelleri Briq. as a natural alternative for blood glucose control, though further studies are needed to assess its safety and efficacy in clinical models.

                The integration of project-based learning (PjBL) in Mathematics and Science has received much attention because of its potential to engage students and expose them in real-world problem-solving. However, research examining the contributions, prevalence, and challenges of Project-Based Learning in mathematics and science remains limited. This review employed a systematic review approach, with articles systematically retrieved from multiple academic databases to investigate the contributions, prevalence, and challenges of PjBL in Mathematics and science education. Thus, 202 articles downloaded from Google Scholar, Academia, Search 4 Life, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Through the filtering process, 20 articles fell into the study’s scope and were considered and used for analysis. The results from the reviewed studies showed that project-based learning contributes to enhancing students’ engagement, creativity, communication, and conceptual understanding in Mathematics and Sciences. Also, the reviewed literature showed that PjBL dominates in Mathematics and Physics with the highest prevalence of 35% each in applying PjBL pedagogy. Integrated Science shows 10% of prevalence, while Chemistry records the least with only 5%. Nevertheless, challenges such as limited resources, rigid curriculum, and inadequate teacher training on monitoring students’ projects and providing adequate assessment were also identified. This study recommends a need for teacher training and resources mobilization in schools support educators to effectively embrace Project-based learning pedagocy in mathematics and science subjects.

                Background With the growing mismatch between traditional academic training and the demands of the modern workforce, student-centered education has emerged as a key reform in higher education. This study examines the relationships among student-content interaction, student-student interaction, self-efficacy, and learning achievement in student-centered classrooms at Chinese application-oriented universities. Methods Data were collected from 524 undergraduate students via online questionnaires and analyzed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results The results indicate that both student-content and student-student interactions significantly enhance learning achievement, with self-efficacy playing a critical mediating role. Higher levels of self-efficacy were also directly associated with improved academic achievement, underscoring its central importance in student success. Conclusions These findings highlight the value of fostering interactive learning environments and promoting the development of self-efficacy to improve educational outcomes. Educators are encouraged to implement instructional strategies that facilitate meaningful engagement, thereby supporting both the cognitive and motivational dimensions of learning. This study provides empirical evidence to inform the design of effective student-centered teaching practices in higher education.

                Background Placental syndromes—encompassing pregnancy loss, preterm birth, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preeclampsia—have been strongly linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses at the maternal–fetal interface. This study aims to explore the potential of peptides derived from the coelomic fluid of Echinometra lucunter targeting the inflammatory cytokines involved in placental syndromes using in silico approaches. Methods The 3D molecular structure of peptides was modeled using the UCSF Chimera application. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADMET) properties were analysed using SwissADME and the ProTox web server. The PerMM web server was used to estimate membrane permeability. Crystal structures of target proteins—including c-Met, Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), and TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL)—were obtained from the Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj). Molecular docking and structural visualization were conducted using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software, while molecular dynamics simulations were subsequently performed using the YASARA Dynamics software to assess the stability and conformational behavior of the ligand-receptor complexes. Results Peptide A was selected based on favorable ADMET properties. Molecular docking results revealed that Peptide A exhibits low binding affinities toward pro-inflammatory mediators, including TRAIL (–10.02 kcal/mol), MIF (–9.32 kcal/mol), IL-1β (–8.29 kcal/mol), and PDGF (–10.44 kcal/mol). Furthermore, Peptide A showed potential agonistic interactions with IL-10 (–10.26 kcal/mol) and c-Met (–9.27 kcal/mol), indicating a possible role in restoring anti-inflammatory and angiogenic signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the stability of the peptide–receptor complexes. Conclusions Peptide A holds promise as a dual-function therapeutic agent in placental syndromes. However, experimental validation is necessary to confirm its biological efficacy and safety.

                <p>by Renad Al-Ghazawi, Hassan Lezzeik, Xiaojian Shao, Theodore J. Perkins</p>

Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process orchestrated by diverse cell populations within a dynamic niche. In response to muscle damage and intercellular signaling, these cells undergo cell fate and migration decisions including quiescence, activation, proliferation, differentiation, infiltration, apoptosis, and exfiltration. The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies of muscle regeneration offers a significant opportunity to refine models of regeneration and enhance our understanding of cellular interactions. To better understand how crosstalk between cell types governs cell fate decisions and cell population dynamics, we developed a novel non-linear ordinary differential equation model guided by scRNA-seq data. Our model consists of 9 variables and 17 parameters, capturing the dynamics of key myogenic lineage and immune cell types. We calibrated time-series scRNA-seq data to units of cells per cubic millimeter of tissue and fit our model’s parameters to capture the observed dynamics, validating on an independent time series. The model successfully captures key features of regeneration dynamics, particularly after incorporating a novel regulatory interaction between M2 macrophages and satellite cells that has been hypothesized in the literature. Our model lays a foundation for future computational explorations of muscle regeneration, modeling of disease conditions, and in silico testing of therapeutic strategies.

                <p>by Yang Chu, Wayne Luk, Dan F. M. Goodman</p>

The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change throughout our lifetime. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate our sound localisation circuit. This is often thought of as a “supervised” learning process where a “teacher” (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your localiser. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range sound localiser. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and provide examples in which these mechanisms can interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signals. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial hearing.
