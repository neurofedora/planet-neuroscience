	<p>Background: Recent evidence suggests that a higher body weight may be linked to cognitive impairment in different domains involving executive/frontal functioning. However, challenging results are also available. Accordingly, our study was designed to verify whether (i) poor executive functions are related to a higher body weight and (ii) executive functioning could contribute to weight loss in treatment-seeking overweight and obese patients. Methods: We examined general executive functioning, inhibitory control, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed in a sample including 104 overweight and obese patients. Forty-eight normal-weight subjects participated in the study as controls. Results: Univariate Analysis of Variance showed that obese patients obtained lower scores than overweight and normal-weight subjects in all executive measures, except for errors in the Stroop test. However, when sociodemographic variables entered the model as covariates, no between-group difference was detected. Furthermore, an adjusted multiple linear regression model highlighted no relationship between weight loss and executive scores at baseline. Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence for the lack of association between obesity and the executive domains investigated. Conflicting findings from previous literature may likely be due to the unchecked confounding effects exerted by sociodemographic variables and inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Metabolic changes in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving direct acting antivirals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with direct acting antivirals (DAAS) improves the rates of sustained virological response (SVR). However, derangements with lipid profile and glycemic status have been observed. This study aimed to compare the effect of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DAC) versus sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LED) regimens on metabolic status of CHC patients. Methods: An observational prospective study was conducted on a total of 140 easy-to-treat treatment-naïve genotype-4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected Egyptian patients. Patients received either 400 mg SOF/60 mg DAC or SOF 400 mg/90 mg LED daily for 12 weeks. Patients were followed-up for 12 weeks after end-of-treatment. Total lipid profile, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured at baseline, four weeks (during treatment), and 12 weeks post-treatment (24 weeks). Clinical laboratory tests and treatment side effects during the treatment period were assessed to ensure safety. Complete blood picture, liver function tests, fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) were performed at baseline and week 12. Results: Both groups had 100% SVR. In both groups, no significant difference in body mass index was found after treatment. FIB-4 decreased significantly after treatment in the SOF/LED group. Regarding lipid profile, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were significantly increased then slightly decreased between week four and week 24 respectively in both groups with higher percentage change in the SOF/LED group. On the other hand, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased throughout the follow-up period in both groups with no significant difference between two groups. Regarding glycemic status, HbA1c and FBS were significantly decreased in both groups throughout the study period with significant difference in the percentage change of HbA1c and FBS between two groups. Conclusions: SOF/LED regimen showed a significant change in lipid profile parameters more than the SOF/DAC regimen, while both regimens showed favorable outcomes in HbA1C and FBS levels.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in hypofunctional teeth during orthodontic tooth movement in rats [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: When moved orthodontically, hypofunctional teeth will have a decreased tooth movement rate compared to normal teeth. Hypofunctional teeth would have less VEGF expression and decreased heparan sulfate proteoglycan production during orthodontic tooth movement. This study aimed to determine the number of osteoblasts in the tension side and the number of osteoclasts in the pressure side of the hypofunctional teeth during orthodontic tooth movement. Method: 18 male Wistar rats were given a palatal coil spring application on the maxillary incisors. Rats were divided into two groups, the orthodontic group with normal occlusion (NO) and hypofunctional occlusion (HO). The number of osteoblasts on the tension side and osteoclasts on the pressure side on days zero (D0), five (D5), and 10 (D10) were tested with two-way ANOVA. Observations were made by hematoxylin eosin staining. Result: The results showed that the number of osteoblasts on the tension side of the HO group was the same at the NO group (p> 0.05). The number of osteoblasts on the tension side in the NO and HO groups at D5 was the same at D10 (p = 0.99), but significantly higher (p = 0.002), than D0. The number of osteoclasts on the pressure side in the HO group was significantly lower than the NO group (p <0.05). The number of osteoclasts in the NO D5 group was significantly higher than the other groups (p <0.05). Conclusions: The number of osteoblasts on the tension side was not affected by the hypofunctional state but decreased the number of osteoclasts on the pressure side during orthodontic tooth movement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of heavy metals in food and drug packaging materials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Food and drug packaging materials are an integral part of our everyday life.  Noxious elements can inadvertently be included in packaging materials in various stages of their production. Adulterants, adhesives, colorants and heavy metal interference are the common sources of contamination in food packaging materials. Heavy metal toxicity has far-reaching ill effects on living organisms. The present study aimed at qualitatively and quantitatively analysing heavy metal contamination of various materials that are used for food and drug packaging in India. Methods: The qualitative detection was done by rapid assay and heavy metals were quantified with the help of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). A total of 13 types of food and drug packaging materials were procured from local market and analysed for four heavy metals viz. arsenic (As), vanadium (V), mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd). The concentration of each heavy metal in the samples was compared with permitted values published by the European Council. Results: Of the 13 samples, heavy metals were qualitatively detected in 10 samples. ICP­-OES values for quantitative estimation showed presence of heavy metal above permissible range in 10 of the studied samples for vanadium, all samples for arsenic, two samples for mercury and one sample for cadmium. Arsenic was found to be the commonest heavy metal contaminant, present in 13 samples above permissible limit. Conclusions: The significantly higher concentration of heavy metal poses a potential health risk to the consumer and affects the quality of the food.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Consumers’ behavior in conversational commerce marketing based on messenger chatbots [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The increasing penetration of smartphones and the Internet in developing countries caused the rise of e-retail. Conversational commerce is highly increasing via interaction through messengers. To extract the benefits of both trends, companies have adopted messenger chatbots. These chatbots use Artificial intelligence and natural language processing to give live responses to the customer and assist online shopping on the messenger interface. This research aims to discover the factors that affect the use of messenger chatbots and their influence on attitude and behavior intention. Methods: The research methodology includes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the variables of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, consumer trust, and anthropomorphism. The authors used an online survey for collecting the responses from 192 respondents and analyzed structural equation modelling. Results: Customer trust has shown the most decisive influence on customer attitude followed by Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use. Also, the use of chatbots to make online shopping faster significantly affects the use of messenger chatbots for online shopping in the future. The authors explore various factors resulting in consumers’ favor of accepting chatbots as an interface for m-commerce. Conclusions: The findings indicate that organizations should design strategies to improve interaction with the customer by developing messenger chatbots for more trusting conversations. Further research could include a theoretical digital marketing approach to conversational commerce based on anthropomorphic digital technologies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling cell biological features of meiotic chromosome pairing to study interlock resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik J. Navarro, Wallace F. Marshall, Jennifer C. Fung</p>

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes become associated side by side in a process known as homologous chromosome pairing. Pairing requires long range chromosome motion through a nucleus that is full of other chromosomes. It remains unclear how the cell manages to align each pair of chromosomes quickly while mitigating and resolving interlocks. Here, we use a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to investigate how specific features of meiosis, including motor-driven telomere motion, nuclear envelope interactions, and increased nuclear size, affect the rate of pairing and the mitigation/resolution of interlocks. By creating in silico versions of three yeast strains and comparing the results of our model to experimental data, we find that a more distributed placement of pairing sites along the chromosome is necessary to replicate experimental findings. Active motion of the telomeric ends speeds up pairing only if binding sites are spread along the chromosome length. Adding a meiotic bouquet significantly speeds up pairing but does not significantly change the number of interlocks. An increase in nuclear size slows down pairing while greatly reducing the number of interlocks. Interestingly, active forces increase the number of interlocks, which raises the question: How do these interlocks resolve? Our model gives us detailed movies of interlock resolution events which we then analyze to build a step-by-step recipe for interlock resolution. In our model, interlocks must first translocate to the ends, where they are held in a quasi-stable state by a large number of paired sites on one side. To completely resolve an interlock, the telomeres of the involved chromosomes must come in close proximity so that the cooperativity of pairing coupled with random motion causes the telomeres to unwind. Together our results indicate that computational modeling of homolog pairing provides insight into the specific cell biological changes that occur during meiosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Two types of critical cell density for mechanical elimination of abnormal cell clusters from epithelial tissue</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sang-Woo Lee, Yoshihiro Morishita</p>

Recent technological advances in high-resolution imaging and artificial modulation of genetic functions at different times and regions have enabled direct observations of the formation and elimination of abnormal cell populations. A recent trend in cell competition research is the incorporation of cell mechanics. In different tissues and species, abnormal cells developing in epithelial tissues are mechanically eliminated by cell contraction via actomyosin accumulation at the interface between normal and abnormal cells. This mechanical cell elimination process has attracted attention as a potential universal defense mechanism. Here, we theoretically examined the conditions for mechanical elimination of growing abnormal cell populations. Simulations and mathematical analyses using a vertex dynamics model revealed two types of critical cell density associated with mechanical elimination of abnormal cell clusters. One is a subtype of homeostatic density, in which the frequencies of spontaneous mechanical cell elimination and proliferation are balanced, even if no explicit dependence of proliferation or apoptosis on the cell density is assumed. This density is related to the mechanical stability of a single cell. The other is density related to mechanical stability as a cell population under external pressure. Both density types are determined by tissue mechanical properties. In solid tissues, the former type is reached first as the intensity of interfacial contraction increases, and it functions as a critical density. On the other hand, the latter type becomes critical when tissues are highly fluid. The derived analytical solution explicitly reveals the dependence of critical contractile force and density on different parameters. We also found a negative correlation between the proliferation rate of abnormal cells and the likelihood of the abnormal cell population expanding by escaping elimination. This is counterintuitive because in the context of cell competition, fast-growing cell populations generally win. These findings provide new insight into, and interpretation of, the results from experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discrete modeling for integration and analysis of large-scale signaling networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Vignet, Jean Coquet, Sébastien Auber, Matéo Boudet, Anne Siegel, Nathalie Théret</p>

Most biological processes are orchestrated by large-scale molecular networks which are described in large-scale model repositories and whose dynamics are extremely complex. An observed phenotype is a state of this system that results from control mechanisms whose identification is key to its understanding. The Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) format is widely used to standardize the biological information relative to regulatory processes. However, few modeling approaches developed so far enable for computing the events that control a phenotype in large-scale networks.
Here we developed an integrated approach to build large-scale dynamic networks from BioPAX knowledge databases in order to analyse trajectories and to identify sets of biological entities that control a phenotype. The Cadbiom approach relies on the guarded transitions formalism, a discrete modeling approach which models a system dynamics by taking into account competition and cooperation events in chains of reactions. The method can be applied to every BioPAX (large-scale) model thanks to a specific package which automatically generates Cadbiom models from BioPAX files.
The Cadbiom framework was applied to the BioPAX version of two resources (PID, KEGG) of the Pathway Commons database and to the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN). As a case-study, it was used to characterize sets of biological entities implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our results highlight the similarities between the PID and ACSN resources in terms of biological content, and underline the heterogeneity of usage of the BioPAX semantics limiting the fusion of models that require curation. Causality analyses demonstrate the smart complementarity of the databases in terms of combinatorics of controllers that explain a phenotype. From a biological perspective, our results show the specificity of controllers for epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes that are consistent with the literature and identify a novel signature for intermediate states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mechanism for punctuating equilibria during mammalian vocal development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thiago T. Varella, Yisi Zhang, Daniel Y. Takahashi, Asif A. Ghazanfar</p>

Evolution and development are typically characterized as the outcomes of gradual changes, but sometimes such changes are abrupt: States of equilibrium can be punctuated by sudden change. Here, we studied the early vocal development of three different mammals: common marmoset monkeys, Egyptian fruit bats, and humans. Consistent with the notion of punctuated equilibria, we found that all three species undergo at least one sudden transition in the acoustics of their developing vocalizations. To understand the mechanism, we modeled different developmental landscapes. We found that the transition was best described as a shift in the balance of two vocalization landscapes. We show that the natural dynamics of these two landscapes are consistent with the dynamics of energy expenditure and information transmission. By using them as constraints for each species, we predicted the differences in transition timing from immature to mature vocalizations. Using marmoset monkeys, we were able to manipulate both infant energy expenditure (vocalizing in an environment with lighter air) and information transmission (closed-loop contingent parental vocal playback). These experiments support the importance of energy and information in leading to punctuated equilibrium states of vocal development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Design and execution of a verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification plan for a numerical model of left ventricular flow after LVAD implantation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alfonso Santiago, Constantine Butakoff, Beatriz Eguzkitza, Richard A. Gray, Karen May-Newman, Pras Pathmanathan, Vi Vu, Mariano Vázquez</p>
Background <p>Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are implantable pumps that act as a life support therapy for patients with severe heart failure. Despite improving the survival rate, LVAD therapy can carry major complications. Particularly, the flow distortion introduced by the LVAD in the left ventricle (LV) may induce thrombus formation. While previous works have used numerical models to study the impact of multiple variables in the intra-LV stagnation regions, a comprehensive validation analysis has never been executed. The main goal of this work is to present a model of the LV-LVAD system and to design and follow a verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) plan based on the ASME V&V40 and V&V20 standards to ensure credible predictions.</p> Methods <p>The experiment used to validate the simulation is the SDSU cardiac simulator, a bench mock-up of the cardiovascular system that allows mimicking multiple operation conditions for the heart-LVAD system. The numerical model is based on Alya, the BSC’s in-house platform for numerical modelling. Alya solves the Navier-Stokes equation with an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation in a deformable ventricle and includes pressure-driven valves, a 0D Windkessel model for the arterial output and a LVAD boundary condition modeled through a dynamic pressure-flow performance curve. The designed VVUQ plan involves: <i>(a)</i> a risk analysis and the associated credibility goals; <i>(b)</i> a verification stage to ensure correctness in the numerical solution procedure; <i>(c)</i> a sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the inputs on the four quantities of interest (QoIs) (average aortic root flow Q A o a v g, maximum aortic root flow Q A o m a x, average LVAD flow Q V A D a v g, and maximum LVAD flow Q V A D m a x); <i>(d)</i> an uncertainty quantification using six validation experiments that include extreme operating conditions.</p> Results <p>Numerical code verification tests ensured correctness of the solution procedure and numerical calculation verification showed a grid convergence index (GCI)<sup>95%</sup> <3.3%. The total Sobol indices obtained during the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ejection fraction, the heart rate, and the pump performance curve coefficients are the most impactful inputs for the analysed QoIs. The Minkowski norm is used as validation metric for the uncertainty quantification. It shows that the midpoint cases have more accurate results when compared to the extreme cases. The total computational cost of the simulations was above 100 [core-years] executed in around three weeks time span in Marenostrum IV supercomputer.</p> Conclusions <p>This work details a novel numerical model for the LV-LVAD system, that is supported by the design and execution of a VVUQ plan created following recognised international standards. We present a methodology demonstrating that stringent VVUQ according to ASME standards is feasible but computationally expensive.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HiCImpute: A Bayesian hierarchical model for identifying structural zeros and enhancing single cell Hi-C data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qing Xie, Chenggong Han, Victor Jin, Shili Lin</p>

Single cell Hi-C techniques enable one to study cell to cell variability in chromatin interactions. However, single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data suffer severely from sparsity, that is, the existence of excess zeros due to insufficient sequencing depth. Complicating the matter further is the fact that not all zeros are created equal: some are due to loci truly not interacting because of the underlying biological mechanism (structural zeros); others are indeed due to insufficient sequencing depth (sampling zeros or dropouts), especially for loci that interact infrequently. Differentiating between structural zeros and dropouts is important since correct inference would improve downstream analyses such as clustering and discovery of subtypes. Nevertheless, distinguishing between these two types of zeros has received little attention in the single cell Hi-C literature, where the issue of sparsity has been addressed mainly as a data quality improvement problem. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose HiCImpute, a Bayesian hierarchical model that goes beyond data quality improvement by also identifying observed zeros that are in fact structural zeros. HiCImpute takes spatial dependencies of scHi-C 2D data structure into account while also borrowing information from similar single cells and bulk data, when such are available. Through an extensive set of analyses of synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the ability of HiCImpute for identifying structural zeros with high sensitivity, and for accurate imputation of dropout values. Downstream analyses using data improved from HiCImpute yielded much more accurate clustering of cell types compared to using observed data or data improved by several comparison methods. Most significantly, HiCImpute-improved data have led to the identification of subtypes within each of the excitatory neuronal cells of L4 and L5 in the prefrontal cortex.

We introduce cytoNet, a cloud-based tool to characterize cell populations from microscopy images. cytoNet quantifies spatial topology and functional relationships in cell communities using principles of network science. Capturing multicellular dynamics through graph features, cytoNet also evaluates the effect of cell-cell interactions on individual cell phenotypes. We demonstrate cytoNet’s capabilities in four case studies: 1) characterizing the temporal dynamics of neural progenitor cell communities during neural differentiation, 2) identifying communities of pain-sensing neurons <i>in vivo</i>, 3) capturing the effect of cell community on endothelial cell morphology, and 4) investigating the effect of laminin α4 on perivascular niches in adipose tissue. The analytical framework introduced here can be used to study the dynamics of complex cell communities in a quantitative manner, leading to a deeper understanding of environmental effects on cellular behavior. The versatile, cloud-based format of cytoNet makes the image analysis framework accessible to researchers across domains.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational simulations and Ca2+ imaging reveal that slow synaptic depolarizations (slow EPSPs) inhibit fast EPSP evoked action potentials for most of their time course in enteric neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Parvin Zarei Eskikand, Katerina Koussoulas, Rachel M. Gwynne, Joel C. Bornstein</p>

Transmission between neurons in the extensive enteric neural networks of the gut involves synaptic potentials with vastly different time courses and underlying conductances. Most enteric neurons exhibit fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) lasting 20–50 ms, but many also exhibit slow EPSPs that last up to 100 s. When large enough, slow EPSPs excite action potentials at the start of the slow depolarization, but how they affect action potentials evoked by fast EPSPs is unknown. Furthermore, two other sources of synaptic depolarization probably occur in enteric circuits, activated via GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors; how these interact with other synaptic depolarizations is also unclear. We built a compartmental model of enteric neurons incorporating realistic voltage-dependent ion channels, then simulated fast EPSPs, slow EPSPs and GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>C</sub> ligand-gated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels to explore these interactions. Model predictions were tested by imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in myenteric neurons ex vivo as an indicator of their activity during synaptic interactions. The model could mimic firing of myenteric neurons in mouse colon evoked by depolarizing current during intracellular recording and the fast and slow EPSPs in these neurons. Subthreshold fast EPSPs evoked spikes during the rising phase of a slow EPSP, but suprathreshold fast EPSPs could not evoke spikes later in a slow EPSP. This predicted inhibition was confirmed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in which stimuli that evoke slow EPSPs suppressed activity evoked by fast EPSPs in many myenteric neurons. The model also predicted that synchronous activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and fast EPSPs potentiated firing evoked by the latter, while synchronous activation of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors with fast EPSPs, potentiated firing and then suppressed it. The results reveal that so-called slow EPSPs have a biphasic effect being likely to suppress fast EPSP evoked firing over very long periods, perhaps accounting for prolonged quiescent periods seen in enteric motor patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Differential methods for assessing sensitivity in biological models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rachel Mester, Alfonso Landeros, Chris Rackauckas, Kenneth Lange</p>

Differential sensitivity analysis is indispensable in fitting parameters, understanding uncertainty, and forecasting the results of both thought and lab experiments. Although there are many methods currently available for performing differential sensitivity analysis of biological models, it can be difficult to determine which method is best suited for a particular model. In this paper, we explain a variety of differential sensitivity methods and assess their value in some typical biological models. First, we explain the mathematical basis for three numerical methods: adjoint sensitivity analysis, complex perturbation sensitivity analysis, and forward mode sensitivity analysis. We then carry out four instructive case studies. (a) The CARRGO model for tumor-immune interaction highlights the additional information that differential sensitivity analysis provides beyond traditional naive sensitivity methods, (b) the deterministic SIR model demonstrates the value of using second-order sensitivity in refining model predictions, (c) the stochastic SIR model shows how differential sensitivity can be attacked in stochastic modeling, and (d) a discrete birth-death-migration model illustrates how the complex perturbation method of differential sensitivity can be generalized to a broader range of biological models. Finally, we compare the speed, accuracy, and ease of use of these methods. We find that forward mode automatic differentiation has the quickest computational time, while the complex perturbation method is the simplest to implement and the most generalizable.

                <p>by Munzareen Khan, Anna H. Hartmann, Michael P. O’Donnell, Madeline Piccione, Anjali Pandey, Pin-Hao Chao, Noelle D. Dwyer, Cornelia I. Bargmann, Piali Sengupta</p>

The valence and salience of individual odorants are modulated by an animal’s innate preferences, learned associations, and internal state, as well as by the context of odorant presentation. The mechanisms underlying context-dependent flexibility in odor valence are not fully understood. Here, we show that the behavioral response of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to bacterially produced medium-chain alcohols switches from attraction to avoidance when presented in the background of a subset of additional attractive chemicals. This context-dependent reversal of odorant preference is driven by cell-autonomous inversion of the response to these alcohols in the single AWC olfactory neuron pair. We find that while medium-chain alcohols inhibit the AWC olfactory neurons to drive attraction, these alcohols instead activate AWC to promote avoidance when presented in the background of a second AWC-sensed odorant. We show that these opposing responses are driven via engagement of distinct odorant-directed signal transduction pathways within AWC. Our results indicate that context-dependent recruitment of alternative intracellular signaling pathways within a single sensory neuron type conveys opposite hedonic valences, thereby providing a robust mechanism for odorant encoding and discrimination at the periphery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">eXNVerify: coverage analysis for long and short-read sequencing data in clinical context [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Accurate identification of genetic variants to a large extent is based on the type of experimental technology, quality of the material and coverage of sequencing data obtained. The latter, coverage quality, highly influences variant calling accuracy and final diagnosis. Our motivation was to create a tool that will evaluate genome coverage and accelerate the introduction of long-read sequencing to medical diagnostics and clinical practice. The implementation was guided by the ease of use of the tool by users who are not proficient in using complex software. A Docker container is perfect for this purpose. Using Docker’s advantages (flexibility, mobility and ease of use of the proposed tools), we created eXNVerify. This is a tool for inspection of clinical data in the context of pathogenic variants search. The tool calculates clinical depth coverage (CDC) – a measure of coverage which we introduce to evaluate loci with pathogenic germline and somatic variants reported in ClinVar. The tool additionally provides visualization options for user-defined genes of interest. Finally, we present examples of BRCA1, TP53, CFTR application and results of a test conducted in the Extensive Sequence Dataset of Gold-Standard Samples for Benchmarking and Development. eXNVerify improves the diagnostic process of patients related to important genetic diseases and facilitates the assessment of genetic samples by diagnosticians. The use of Docker allows to run an analysis package and does not require any special technical preparation. Detailed examples are included in the GitHub project documentation  and the package can be downloaded directly from DockerHub using the command: docker pull porebskis/exnverify:1.0.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of pathogenic mutations of the GLUT1 glucose transporter on solute carrier dynamics using ComDYN enhanced sampling [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The solute carrier (SLC) family of membrane proteins is a large class of transporters for many small molecules that are vital for cellular function. Several pathogenic mutations are reported in the glucose transporter subfamily SLC2, causing Glut1-deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS1, GLUT1DS2), epilepsy (EIG2) and cryohydrocytosis with neurological defects (Dystonia-9). Understanding the link between these mutations and transporter dynamics is crucial to elucidate their role in the dysfunction of the underlying transport mechanism, which we investigate using molecular dynamics simulations. Methods: We studied pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations, using a newly developed coarse-grained simulation approach ‘ComDYN’, which captures the ‘COMmon constraints DYNamics’ between both states of the solute carrier protein. To guarantee the sampling of large conformational changes, we only include common constraints of the elastic network introduced upon coarse-graining, which showed similar reference distances between both conformational states (≤1 Å difference). Results: ComDYN is computationally efficient and sufficiently sensitive to capture effects of different mutations. Our results clearly indicate that the pathogenic mutation in GLUT1, G91D, situated at the highly conserved RXGRR motif between helices 2 and 3, has a strong impact on transporter function, as it blocks the protein from sampling both conformational states. In comparison, predictions from SIFT and PolyPhen only provided an impression of the impact upon mutation in the highly conserved RXGRR motifs, but yielded no clear differentiation between pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations.  Conclusions: Using our approach, we can explain the pathogenicity of the mutation G91D and some of the effects of other known pathogenic mutations, when we observe the configurations of the transmembrane helices, suggesting that their relative position is crucial for the correct functioning of the GLUT1 protein. To fully understand the impact of other mutations in the future, it is necessary to consider the effect of ligands, e.g., glucose, within the transport mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reporting characteristics of allergic rhinitis trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and in publications: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on Allergic rhinitis (AR) should be complete and consistent throughout multiple sources to ensure accurate evidence-based information. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are discrepancies in the reported data from AR trials. Methods: This cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed completed RCTs on AR registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and last updated between 9/27/2009 and 10/4/2019 with results and corresponding publications. Completeness, informativeness and major changes to World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set items as well as completeness of results data in ClinicalTrials.gov and corresponding publications were analyzed. Results: Omitted items were present in 35 (46.1%) of the 76 trials at initial registration, 15 (19.7%) at last registration, and in 22 (56.4%) of the 39 publications. All 76 trials between first and last registration and all 39 publications had major changes in registration items. Uninformative reporting of analyzed items were present both in ClinicalTrials.gov and publications. Completeness of results in ClinicalTrials.gov was satisfactory. In contrast, publications reported fewer adverse events. Conclusions: Discrepancies in data elements of AR trials are common both in ClinicalTrials.gov and subsequent publications. To ensure transparent data reporting from AR trials, multiple stakeholders should control the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of AR trial data to notice discrepancies before publication.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Hydranencephaly in a female newborn with congenital cytomegalovirus infection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hydranencephaly is a congenital abnormality of the central nervous system characterized by massive hemispheric necrosis and ventricular dilatation with most of the cerebral hemispheres being replaced by membranous sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be one of the causes of hydranencephaly. The choice of therapy for hydranencephaly is a challenge because of poor prognosis, but now neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation may give new hope. Case report: We report a case of a female newborn born at term by cesarean section from a gravida 5, para 3, abortus 1 (G5P3A1) mother with suspected hydrocephalus. Head circumference was 35 cm at birth. The baby was born crying immediately, looked active, and did not appear cyanotic, but on the second day, the baby looked less active, moaned, showed acral cyanosis, and had a large fontanelle that was dilated and soft. Signs of hydrocephalus such as Macewen’s sign, setting sun phenomenon, and transillumination were found to be positive. Echocardiographic examination showed floppy interatrial septum and mild mitral regurgitation. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head showed hydranencephaly. The toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex virus (TORCH) screening showed positive anti-CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG). The baby underwent a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt procedure with a head circumference of 36 cm before surgery. VP shunt was performed with an opening pressure of 15 cmH2O. Conclusions: After the VP shunt procedure, the baby's general condition improved with the head circumference within normal limits. The baby was discharged from the hospital after 16 days of treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The demographic effects and public health infrastructure dearth of COVID-19 in Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the last two years, the world has been experiencing a worldwide health catastrophe. The Corona Virus (COVID-19) struck at the heart of societies and is a major health-care infrastructure problem. Infrastructure has been characterised as the basic requirement for carrying out productive and relevant public health actions. Mortality has direct and indirect relationship, with the former causing short and long-term mortality, resulting in a short life expectancy. Reduced accessibility and quality of health care, isolation, loneliness, and poverty were some of the indirect repercussions. The outcomes were sad and deeply felt when the two collided with ageing and persons with co-morbidities. The fertility effect of COVID-19 in the short-term on contraception presented itself in increased difficulties in accessing services and disruptions in the supply chain. Migration was mainly affected due to travel bans and restriction of movements through stay-at-home instructions. Methods: This paper uses the qualitative paradigm of research that used corpus construction in the selection of material to represent a whole and this make it functionally equivalent to sampling but structurally different. It used secondary data to ascertain the demographic effects and the extent of health infrastructure deficit and ingenious ways to curb the challenges as exposed by the COVID -19. Results: The study underscores how demographic factors can be disrupted by pandemics to bring about high rates of mortality. Global health function is under-funded and under-produced, as a study by the World Health Organization suggests. Conclusions:  The study brings to bear that anthropogenic activities, air greenhouse gases, lifespan and hospital beds are key drivers of COVID-19 growth. The path forward to mitigate such pandemics is international harmony and alliances in the distribution of vaccines, strengthening of international health systems ability to hold back major infectious disease, addressing service quality and providing key financial injection.

                Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly critically ill patients. It poses a public health challenge in resource-constrained settings due to high administrative costs. AKI is commonly misdiagnosed due to its painless onset and late disruption of serum creatinine, which is the gold standard biomarker for AKI diagnosis. There is increasing research into the use of early biomarkers and the development of predictive models for early AKI diagnosis using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. This field note provides insight into the challenges of using available AKI prediction models in resource-constrained environments, as well as perspectives that practitioners in these settings may find useful

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the past few decades, several studies have focused on potential sex-related differences in the trajectories of language development and functioning. From a behavioral point of view, the available literature shows controversial results: differences between males and females in language production tasks may not always be detectable and, even when they are, are potentially biased by sociological and educational confounding factors. The problem regarding potential sex-related differences in language production has also been investigated at the neural level, again with controversial results. The current minireview focuses on studies assessing sex-related differences in the neural networks of language production. After providing a theoretical framework of language production, it is shown that the few available investigations have provided mixed results. The major reasons for discrepant findings are discussed with theoretical and methodological implications for future studies.</p>

                Bossi et al. show that GluN3A subunits control the activity of selective neuronal populations in the adult mouse brain via the formation of excitatory glycine GluN1/GluN3A receptors (eGlyRs). Functional analysis reveals that eGlyRs regulate the recruitment of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the neocortex and participate in the stability of fear memories in the BLA.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Dynamic task-belief is an integral part of decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Xue, Kramer, and Cohen studied decision-making when, as in real life, what needs to be decided is uncertain and changing. Interestingly, subjective beliefs about the task have inextricable neuronal links to perceptual decision-making. This suggests that task-switching and perceptual decision-making belong to a very integrated system in the brain.

                RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), essential for skeletal muscle regeneration, cause muscle degeneration and neuromuscular disease when mutated. Why mutations in these ubiquitously expressed RBPs orchestrate complex tissue regeneration and direct cell fate decisions in skeletal muscle remains poorly understood. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of regenerating <i>Mus musculus</i> skeletal muscle reveals that RBP expression, including the expression of many neuromuscular disease-associated RBPs, is temporally regulated in skeletal muscle stem cells and correlates with specific stages of myogenic differentiation. By combining machine learning with RBP engagement scoring, we discovered that the neuromuscular disease-associated RBP Hnrnpa2b1 is a differentiation-specifying regulator of myogenesis that controls myogenic cell fate transitions during terminal differentiation in mice. The timing of RBP expression specifies cell fate transitions by providing post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNAs that coordinate stem cell fate decisions during tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic lncRNA mapping to genome-wide co-essential modules uncovers cancer dependency on uncharacterized lncRNAs</a></h4>

              
                Quantification of gene dependency across hundreds of cell lines using genome-scale CRISPR screens has revealed co-essential pathways/modules and critical functions of uncharacterized genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, robust CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens are lacking for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are key regulators of many cellular processes, leaving many essential lncRNAs unidentified and uninvestigated. Integrating copy number, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data of &gt;800 cancer cell lines with CRISPR-derived co-essential pathways, our method recapitulates known essential lncRNAs and predicts proliferation/growth dependency of 289 poorly characterized lncRNAs. Analyzing lncRNA dependencies across 10 cancer types and their expression alteration by diverse growth inhibitors across cell types, we prioritize 30 high-confidence pan-cancer proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs. Further evaluating two previously uncharacterized top <i>p</i>roliferation-<i>s</i>uppressive <i>l</i>nc<i>R</i>NAs (<i>PSLR</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>PSLR</i>-<i>2</i>) showed they are transcriptionally regulated by p53, induced by multiple cancer treatments, and significantly correlate to increased cancer patient survival. These lncRNAs modulate G2 cell cycle-regulating genes within the FOXM1 transcriptional network, inducing a G2 arrest and inhibiting proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our results serve as a powerful resource for exploring lncRNA-mediated regulation of cellular fitness in cancer, circumventing current limitations in lncRNA research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative prediction of variant effects on alternative splicing in MAPT using endogenous pre-messenger RNA structure probing</a></h4>

              
                Splicing is highly regulated and is modulated by numerous factors. Quantitative predictions for how a mutation will affect precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) structure and downstream function is particularly challenging. Here we use a novel chemical probing strategy to visualize endogenous precursor and mature <i>MAPT</i> mRNA structures in cells. We used these data to estimate Boltzmann suboptimal structural ensembles, which were then analyzed to predict consequences of mutations on precursor mRNA structure. Further analysis of recent cryo-EM structures of the spliceosome at different stages of the splicing cycle revealed that the footprint of the B<sup>act</sup> complex with precursor mRNA best predicted alternative splicing outcomes for exon 10 inclusion of the alternatively spliced <i>MAPT</i> gene, achieving 74% accuracy. We further developed a b-regression weighting framework that incorporates splice site strength, RNA structure, and exonic/intronic splicing regulatory elements capable of predicting, with 90% accuracy, the effects of 47 known and six newly discovered mutations on inclusion of exon 10 of <i>MAPT</i>. This combined experimental and computational framework represents a path forward for accurate prediction of splicing-related disease-causing variants.

                A role for macronutrient metabolism in learning and memory is supported by numerous epidemiological studies. The Ppm1k gene encodes the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) phosphatase that promotes the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Here we show that nervous system deletion of Ppm1k in mice increases BCAA levels in brain tissue but not in plasma. These mice have significant impairments in working memory accompanied by a robust accumulation of DCX+/NeuroD1+ immature neurons within the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. Through single cell RNA sequencing and pathway analysis we identified substantial increases in transit-amplifying cells and immature neurons along with activated hedgehog signaling in Ppm1k deficient primary neural stem cells (NSCs). Inhibition of mTOR signaling reversed the effects of Ppm1k deletion on neuronal progenitor gene activation in primary NSCs. Together our findings uncover a new molecular link between BCAA metabolism, hippocampal neurogenesis, and cognitive performance.

                The spiking activity of mitral cells (MC) in the olfactory bulb is a key attribute in olfactory sensory information processing to downstream cortical areas. A more detailed understanding of the modulation of MC spike statistics could shed light on mechanistic studies of olfactory bulb circuits, and olfactory coding. We study the spike response of a recently developed single-compartment biophysical MC model containing 7 known ionic currents and calcium dynamics subject to constant current input with background white noise. We observe rich spiking dynamics even with constant current input, including multi-modal peaks in the interspike interval distribution (ISI). Although weak to moderate background noise for a fixed current input does not change the firing rate much, the spike dynamics can change dramatically, exhibiting non-monotonic spike variability not commonly observed in standard neuron models. We explain these dynamics with a phenomenological model of the ISI probability density function. Our study clarifies some of the complexities of MC spiking dynamics.

                Although we perceive the world in a continuous manner, our experience is partitioned into discrete events. However, to make sense of these events, they must be stitched together into an overarching narrative, a model of unfolding events. It has been proposed that such a stitching process happens in offline neural reactivations when rodents build models of spatial environments. Here we show that, whilst understanding a natural narrative, humans reactivate neural representations of past events. Similar to offline replay, these reactivations occur in hippocampus and default mode network, where reactivations are selective to relevant past events. However, these reactivations occur, not during prolonged offline periods, but at the boundaries between ongoing narrative events. These results, replicated across two datasets, suggest reactivations as a candidate mechanism for binding temporally distant information into a coherent understanding of ongoing experience.

                Synaptic spinules are thin, finger-like projections from one neuron that become fully embedded within the presynaptic or postsynaptic compartments of another neuron. While spinules are a conserved feature of synapses across the animal kingdom, their specific function(s) remain unknown. Recent focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) image volume analyses have demonstrated that spinules are embedded within ~ 25% of excitatory boutons in mammalian primary visual cortex, yet the diversity of spinule sizes, origins, and ultrastructural relationship to their boutons remained unclear. To begin to uncover the function of synaptic spinules, we sought to determine the abundance, origins, and 3D ultrastructure of spinules embedded within excitatory presynaptic spinule-bearing boutons (SBBs) in mammalian CA1 hippocampus and compare these boutons with presynaptic boutons bereft of spinules (non-SBBs). Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive 3D analysis of every excitatory presynaptic bouton, their embedded synaptic spinules, and postsynaptic densities, within a 5 nm isotropic FIB-SEM image volume from CA1 hippocampus of an adult male rat. Surprisingly, we found that ~74% of excitatory presynaptic boutons in this volume contained at least one spinule, suggesting that they are fundamental components of excitatory synapses in CA1. In addition, we found that SBBs are 2.5-times larger and have 60% larger PSDs than non-SBBs. Moreover, synaptic spinules within SBBs are clearly differentiated into two groups: small clathrin-coated spinules, and 29-times larger spinules without clathrin. Together, these findings suggest that the presence of a spinule is a marker for stronger and more stable presynaptic boutons in CA1, and that synaptic spinules serve at least two separable and distinct functions.

                All insects studied to date possess a centrally located group of neuropils, known collectively as the central complex, that has been implicated in sensory integration and motor action selection. Among the functions prescribed to the central complex, none is perhaps as intriguing as its role in orientation and navigation. Neurobiological correlates of both current and desired headings have been described in insect CXs. Despite the diversity of arthropods, understanding of the CX as a navigational center originates entirely from terrestrial insects. Stomatopod crustaceans, commonly referred to as mantis shrimps, form an order of predatory marine crustaceans with intricate and diverse visual systems that maintain the distinction of being the only fully aquatic animal known to utilize the navigational strategy of path integration. They utilize idiothetic, celestial, and landmark cues to orient in the benthos. Here, we investigate the neuroanatomy of adult and developing mantis shrimp central complexes and associated neuropils to begin understanding this brain region in a sensorially and behaviorally complex crustacean.

                Across species, the optokinetic reflex (OKR) stabilizes vision during self-motion. OKR occurs when ON direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (oDSGCs) detect slow, global image motion on the retina. How oDSGC activity is integrated centrally to generate behavior remains unknown. Here, we discover mechanisms that contribute to motion-encoding in vertically-tuned oDSGCs, and leverage these findings to empirically define signal transformation between retinal output and vertical OKR behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate that motion encoding in vertically-tuned oDSGCs is contrast-sensitive and asymmetric for oDSGC types that prefer opposite directions. These phenomena arise from the interplay between spike threshold nonlinearities and differences in synaptic input weights, including shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. In behaving mice, these neurophysiological observations, along with a central subtraction of oDSGC outputs, accurately predict the direction and magnitude of vertical OKR across stimulus conditions. Thus, asymmetric synaptic input across competing sensory input channels can critically shape behavior.

                The Serotonin Transporter (SERT) regulates extracellular serotonin levels and is the target of most current drugs used to treat depression. The mechanisms by which inhibition of SERT activity influences behavior are poorly understood. To address this question in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we developed new loss of function mutations in Drosophila SERT (dSERT). Previous studies in both flies and mammals have implicated serotonin as an important neuromodulator of sleep, and our newly generated dSERT mutants show an increase in total sleep and altered sleep architecture. Differences in daytime vs. nighttime sleep architecture as well as genetic rescue experiments unexpectedly suggest that distinct serotonergic circuits may modulate daytime versus nighttime sleep. dSERT mutants also show defects in copulation and food intake, akin to the clinical side effects of SSRIs. Starvation did not overcome the sleep drive in the mutants. Additionally in males, but not female dSERT mutants, the drive to mate also failed to overcome sleep drive. dSERT may be used to further explore the mechanisms by which serotonin regulates sleep and its interplay with other complex behaviors.

                Traditionally, when conducting voxel- or vertex-wise analyses in neuroimaging studies, it seemed imperative that brain data are convoluted with a Gaussian kernel - a procedure known as "spatial smoothing". However, we argue that smoothing may be omitted entirely for the benefit of a dramatically enhanced regional specificity under certain conditions. We demonstrate the suitability of this omission by combining high-dimensional warping and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) in a sample of 754 brains. Our findings suggest that without the traditional smoothing step it is possible to dissociate neighboring brain areas with an accuracy of a single voxel, altogether taking the field of human brain mapping to a new level. Nevertheless, classic analyses based on smoothed data will continue to provide important insights, especially if parametric tests are required, if image data cannot be precisely aligned across individuals or time points, and/or if anticipated effect sizes are only small.

The neural dynamics related to retrieval of movie scenes revealed that recalling the temporal order of close events elevates hippocampal theta power, like that observed for recalling close spatial relationships. In contrast, recalling far events elevates beta power in the orbitofrontal cortex, reflecting recall based on the overall movie structure.

                All visual information in mammals is encoded in the aggregate pattern of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) firing. How this information is decoded to yield percepts remains incompletely understood. We have trained convolutional neural networks with multielectrode array-recorded murine RGC responses to projected images. The trained model accurately reconstructed novel facial images solely from RGC firing data. In this model, subpopulations of cells with faster firing rates are largely sufficient for accurate reconstruction, and ON- and OFF- cells contribute complementary and overlapping information to image reconstruction. Information content for reconstruction correlates with overall firing rate, and locality of information contributing to reconstruction varies substantially across the image and retina. This model demonstrates that artificial neural networks are capable of learning multicellular sensory neural encoding, and provides a viable model for understanding visual information encoding.

                The belief that learning can be modulated by social context is mainly supported by high-level value-based learning studies. However, whether social context can even modulate low-level learning such as visual perceptual learning (VPL) is still unknown. Unlike traditional VPL studies in which participants were trained singly, here we developed a novel dyadic VPL paradigm in which paired participants were trained with the same orientation discrimination task and they could monitor each other's performance. We found that the social context (i.e., dyadic training) led to a greater behavioral performance improvement and a faster learning speed, compared with the single training. Interestingly, the facilitating effects could be modulated by the performance difference between paired participants. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results showed that, compared with the single training, social cognition areas including bilateral parietal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex displayed a different spatial activity pattern and enhanced functional connectivities to early visual cortex during the dyadic training. Furthermore, the dyadic training resulted in more refined orientation representation in primary visual cortex (V1), which was closely associated with the greater behavioral performance improvement. Taken together, we demonstrate that the social context, learning with a partner, can remarkably augment the plasticity of low-level visual information process by means of reshaping the neural activities in early visual cortex and social cognition areas, as well as their functional interplays.

                Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level. This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia. To address that question, we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and spike timing deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence spike timing to inform the biological data. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior. This explains how NMDAR synaptic deficits, implicated by genetic evidence as causal in schizophrenia, could prevent the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking in prefrontal local circuits during behavior, potentially disconnecting those circuits via spike-timing dependent mechanisms in the human disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Machine Learning Approach Towards the Differentiation Between Interoceptive and Exteroceptive Attention</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the representation of the body's internal state, plays a central role in emotion, motivation, and wellbeing. Interoceptive attention is qualitatively different from attention to the external senses and may recruit a distinct neural system, but the neural separability of interoceptive and exteroceptive attention is unclear. We used a machine learning approach to classify neural correlates of interoceptive and exteroceptive attention in a randomized control trial of interoceptive training (MABT). Participants in the training and control groups attended fMRI assessment before and after an 8-week intervention period (N = 44 scans). The imaging paradigm manipulated attention targets (breath vs. visual stimulus) and reporting demands (active reporting vs. passive monitoring). Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between interoceptive and exteroceptive attention using both in-sample and more stringent out-of-sample tests. We then explored the potential of these classifiers in "reading out" mental states in a sustained interoceptive attention task. Participants were classified as maintaining an active reporting state for only ~90s of each 3-minute sustained attention period. Within this active period, interoceptive training enhanced participants' ability to sustain interoceptive attention. These findings demonstrate that interoceptive and exteroceptive attention engage reliable and distinct neural networks; machine learning classifiers trained on this distinction show promise for assessing the stability of interoceptive attention, with implications for the future assessment of mental health and treatment response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential D1 and D2 receptor internalization and recycling induced by amphetamine in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The dopamine system plays a significant role in drug reward and the pathogenesis of addiction. Psychostimulant drugs acutely increase dopamine levels, triggering receptor internalization. In vitro data suggest that dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) recycle, whereas D2 receptors (D2R) degrade in response to activation. Yet, receptor fates in vivo remain unclear. This study bridges in vitro mechanisms and in vivo measurements of stimulant-induced modulation of receptor states using longitudinal multi-modal imaging combined with neuropharmacology. We demonstrate how repeated amphetamine administration differentially modulates D1R vs. D2R signaling in nonhuman primates over 24 hours using simultaneous positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In contrast to predominantly inhibitory D2R signaling due to an initial amphetamine challenge, excitatory D1R functional signaling prevails three hours later, while D2Rs stay internalized. These results demonstrate differential externalization mechanisms of the D1R and D2R in vivo and a shift in receptor subtype activation after a dopamine surge.

                Cephalopods have a remarkable visual system, with a camera-type eye, high acuity vision, and a wide range of sophisticated visual behaviors. However, the cephalopod brain is organized dramatically differently from that of vertebrates, as well as other invertebrates, and little is known regarding the cell types and molecular determinants of their visual system organization beyond neuroanatomical descriptions. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell molecular atlas of the octopus optic lobe, which is the primary visual processing structure in the cephalopod brain. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to both identify putative molecular cell types and determine their anatomical and spatial organization within the optic lobe. Our results reveal six major neuronal cell classes identified by neurotransmitter/neuropeptide usage, in addition to non-neuronal and immature neuronal populations. Moreover, we find that additional markers divide these neuronal classes into subtypes with distinct anatomical localizations, revealing cell type diversity and a detailed laminar organization within the optic lobe. We also delineate the immature neurons within this continuously growing tissue into subtypes defined by evolutionarily conserved fate specification genes as well as novel cephalopod- and octopus- specific genes. Together, these findings outline the organizational logic of the octopus visual system, based on functional determinants, laminar identity, and developmental markers/pathways. The resulting atlas presented here delineates the 'parts list' of the neural circuits used for vision in octopus, providing a platform for investigations into the development and function of the octopus visual system as well as the evolution of visual processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Can Deep Learning Provide a Generalizable Model for Dynamic Sound Encoding in Auditory Cortex?</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in machine learning have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can provide powerful and flexible models of neural sensory processing. In the auditory system, the standard linear-nonlinear (LN) model and related variants are unable to account for high-order cortical representations. Thus far, it is unclear what additional insights can be provided by CNNs. CNNs can be difficult to fit with relatively small datasets, such as those available from single neuron recordings. In the current study, we developed a population encoding model: a CNN that simultaneously predicts activity of several hundred neurons recorded during presentation of a large, fixed set of natural sounds. This approach defines a spectro-temporal space that is shared by all neurons in the model and pools statistical power across the neural population. We tested a range of CNN architectures on data from primary and non-primary auditory cortex, varying the number and size of convolutional layers at the input and dense layers at the output. The population models performed consistently better than LN models. Moreover, performance was highly generalizable. The output layer of a model pre-fit using one population of neurons could be fit to novel single units, with performance close to that of neurons in the original fit data. These results indicate that population encoding models capture a general set of computations performed by auditory cortex. In this case, the model itself can be analyzed to provide a general characterization of auditory cortical representation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Off-manifold coding in visual cortex revealed by sleep</a></h4>

              
                Low-dimensional dynamics and movement-related activity are found throughout the brain. However, primary visual cortex contains high-dimensional sensory representations, raising the question of how low-dimensional dynamics and high-dimensional representations coexist. Here we approached this question by analyzing neuronal activity during slow-wave sleep, which provided reliable estimates of low-dimensional, internally-generated manifold structure. We found that movements and visual scenes were both encoded in the on-manifold subspace, which accounts for more variance than chance during sleep, but visual scenes were also encoded in the off-manifold subspace, which accounts for less variance than chance during sleep. This off-manifold subspace contains sparse activity in the neurons with the strongest low-dimensional modulation by movement, which paradoxically prevents movement-evoked activity from interfering with high-dimensional stimulus representations. These results reveal an unexpected link between low-dimensional dynamics and sparse coding, suggesting that these phenomena play a role in creating and accessing an off-manifold coding space for high- dimensional representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing the forest and the tree: Building representations of both individual and collective dynamics with transformers</a></h4>

              
                Complex time-varying systems are often studied by abstracting away from the dynamics of individual components to build a model of the population-level dynamics from the start. However, when building a population-level description, it can be easy to lose sight of each individual and how each contributes to the larger picture. In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture for learning from time-varying data that build descriptions of both the individual as well as the collective population dynamics. Rather than combining all of our data into our model at the onset, we develop a separable architecture that operates on individual time-series first before passing them forward; this induces a permutation-invariance property and can be used to transfer across systems of different size and order. After demonstrating that our model can be applied to successfully recover complex interactions and dynamics in many-body systems, we apply our approach to populations of neurons in the nervous system. On neural activity datasets, we show that our multi-scale transformer not only yields robust decoding performance, but also provides impressive performance in transfer. Our results show that it is possible to learn from neurons in one animal's brain and transfer the model on neurons in a different animal's brain, with interpretable neuron correspondence across sets and animals. This finding opens up a new path to decode from and represent large collections of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptation shapes local cortical reactivity: from bifurcation diagram and simulations to human physiological and pathological responses</a></h4>

              
                Human studies employing intracerebral and transcranial perturbations suggest that the input-output properties of cortical circuits are dramatically affected during sleep in healthy subjects as well as in awake patients with multifocal and focal brain injury. In all these conditions, cortical circuits react to direct stimulation with an initial activation followed by suppression of activity (Off-period) that disrupts the build-up of sustained causal interactions typically observed in healthy wakefulness. The transition to this stereotypical response is of clinical relevance, being associated with loss of consciousness or loss of function. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation of these findings by means of mean-field theory and simulations of a cortical-like module endowed with activity-dependent adaptation. First, we show that fundamental aspects of the local responses elicited in humans by direct cortical stimulation can be replicated by systematically varying the relationships between adaptation strength and excitation level in the network. Then, we reveal a region in the adaptation-excitation parameter space of key relevance for both physiological and pathological conditions, where spontaneous activity and responses to perturbation diverge in their ability to reveal Off-periods. Finally, we substantiate through simulations of connected cortical-like modules the role of adaptation mechanisms in preventing cortical neurons from engaging in reciprocal causal interactions, as suggested by empirical studies. These modeling results provide a general theoretical framework and a mechanistic interpretation for a body of neurophysiological measurements that bears key relevance for physiological states as well as for the assessment and rehabilitation of brain-injured patients.

                A large range of sophisticated brain image analysis tools have been developed by the neuroscience community, greatly advancing the field of human brain mapping. Here we introduce the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) - a powerful suite of tools for morphometric analyses with an intuitive graphical user interface, but also usable as a shell script. CAT is suitable for beginners, casual users, experts, and developers alike providing a comprehensive set of analysis options, workflows, and integrated pipelines. The available analysis streams - illustrated on an example dataset - allow for voxel-based, surface-based, as well as region-based morphometric analyses. Importantly, CAT includes various quality control options and covers the entire analysis workflow, from cross-sectional or longitudinal data processing, to the statistical analysis, and visualization of results. The overarching aim of this article is to provide a complete description of CAT, while, at the same time, offering a citable standard reference.

                Advances in tridimensional (3D) culture approaches have led to the generation of organoids that recapitulate cellular and physiological features of domains of the human nervous system. Although microelectrodes have been developed for long-term electrophysiological interfaces with neural tissue, studies of long-term interfaces between microelectrodes and free-floating organoids remain limited. In this study, we report a stretchable, soft mesh electrode system that establishes an intimate in vitro electrical interface with human neurons in 3D organoids. Our mesh is constructed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based electrically conductive hydrogel electrode arrays and an elastomeric poly(styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene) (SEBS) as the substrate and encapsulation materials. This mesh electrode can maintain stable electrochemical impedance in buffer solution under 50% compressive and 50% tensile strain. We have successfully cultured pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical organoids (hCO) on this polymeric mesh for more than 3 months and demonstrated that organoids readily integrate with the mesh. Using simultaneous stimulation and calcium imaging, we show that electrical stimulation through the mesh can elicit intensity-dependent calcium signals comparable to stimulation from a bipolar stereotrode. This platform may serve as a tool for monitoring and modulating the electrical activity of in vitro models of neuropsychiatric diseases.

                Microglia, brain-resident macrophages, play key roles during prenatal development in defining neural circuitry function, including ensuring proper synaptic wiring and maintaining homeostasis. Mammalian breathing rhythmogenesis arises from interacting brainstem neural networks that are assembled during embryonic development, but the specific role of microglia in this process remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anatomical and functional consequences of respiratory circuit formation in the absence of microglia. We first established the normal distribution of microglia within the wild-type (WT, Pu.1+/+) mouse brainstem at embryonic ages when the respiratory networks are known to emerge (embryonic day (E) 14.5 for the parafacial respiratory group (epF) and E16.5 for the preBotzinger complex (preBotC)). In transgenic mice depleted of microglia (Pu.1-/- mutant), we performed anatomical staining, calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activities in vitro to assess the status of these circuits at their respective times of functional emergence. Spontaneous respiratory-related activity recorded from reduced in vitro preparations showed an abnormally slow rhythm frequency expressed by the epF at E14.5, the preBotC at E16.5 and in the phrenic motor nerves from E16.5 onwards. These deficits were associated with a reduced number of active epF neurons, defects in commissural projections that couple the bilateral preBotC half-centers, and an accompanying decrease in their functional coordination. These abnormalities probably contribute to eventual neonatal death, since plethysmography revealed that E18.5 Pu.1-/- embryos are unable to sustain breathing activity ex utero. Our results thus point to a crucial contribution of microglia in the proper establishment of the central respiratory command during embryonic development.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and the mechanism of its occurrence is still not fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the gut acts as a potential origin of PD pathogenesis. Recent studies have identified that inflammatory bowel disease acts as a risk factor for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of this study was to further explore the molecular mechanism between PD and Crohn&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (CD). The gene expression profiles of PD (GSE6613) and CD (GSE119600) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and were identified as the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two diseases. Next, analyses were performed, including functional enrichment analysis, a protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction network, core genes identification, and clinical correlation analysis. As a result, 178 common DEGs (113 upregulated genes and 65 downregulated genes) were found between PD and CD. The functional analysis found that they were enriched in regulated exocytosis, immune response, and lipid binding. Twelve essential hub genes including BUB1B, BUB3, DLGAP5, AURKC, CBL, PCNA, RAF1, LYN, RPL39L, MRPL13, RSL24D1, and MRPS11 were identified from the PPI network by using cytoHubba. In addition, inflammatory and metabolic pathways were jointly involved in these two diseases. After verifying expression levels in an independent dataset (GSE99039), a correlation analysis with clinical features showed that LYN and RAF1 genes were associated with the severity of PD. In conclusion, our study revealed the common pathogenesis of PD and CD. These common pathways and hub genes may provide novel insights for mechanism research.</p>

	<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being used in patients with various advanced malignancies, and patient outcomes have improved considerably. Although ICIs can effectively treat tumors, 30&amp;amp;ndash;60% of patients experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare irAE that has become a novel topic in neuroimmunology and has received increasing attention in recent years. Herein, we report a rare case of GAD65-antibody&amp;amp;ndash;associated AE after metastatic small cell lung cancer treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient received IVIg therapy for AE and continuous pembrolizumab therapy without suspension of tumor treatment. At 1 year follow-up, both the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s AE symptoms and tumors were stable. We consider that the treatment of ICI-associated AE should be more individualized with prudent decision-making and should balance the tumor progression and AE treatment. In addition, we have also comprehensively reviewed the literature of ICI-associated AE, and summarized the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of AE caused by ICI, thus broadening our understanding of the neurological complications caused by ICI.</p>

	<p>Central venous catheters (CVCs) are increasingly used across specialties for invasive haemodynamic monitoring and for the delivery of fluids, medications, and nutritional support. Cerebral air embolism (CAE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication associated with the insertion, maintenance, and removal of CVCs. It can occur through different mechanisms, including the direct retrograde ascension of air into the cerebral veins and paradoxical embolism due to a right-to-left intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt. The &amp;amp;ldquo;hand-knob&amp;amp;rdquo; area is the cortical region within the primary motor cortex that contains the representation of the hand. It is located in the superior precentral gyrus and is the site of less than 1% of all ischaemic strokes. We report here the case of a patient who experienced an ischaemic stroke of the right &amp;amp;ldquo;hand-knob&amp;amp;rdquo; area, due to paradoxical CAE through a previously undiagnosed patent foramen ovale (PFO), after the insertion of a catheter in the right internal jugular vein. We also provide an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CAE. Suspecting CAE in the case of an acute neurological event occurring in close temporal relationship with central venous catheterization is paramount to allow the early recognition and treatment of this uncommon form of iatrogenic stroke.</p>

	<p>The use of landmarks for navigation develops throughout childhood. Here, we examined the developmental trajectory of egocentric and allocentric navigation based on landmark information in an on-screen virtual environment in 39 5&amp;amp;ndash;6-year-olds, 43 7&amp;amp;ndash;8-year-olds, and 41 9&amp;amp;ndash;10-year-olds. We assessed both categorical performance, indicating the notion of location changes based on the landmarks, as well as metrical performance relating to the precision of the representation of the environment. We investigated whether age, sex, spatial working memory, verbal working memory, and verbal production of left and right contributed to the development of navigation skills. In egocentric navigation, Categorical performance was already above chance at 5 years of age and was positively related to visuo-spatial working memory and the production of left/right, whereas metrical performance was only related to age. Allocentric navigation started to develop between 5 and 8 years of age and was related to sex, with boys outperforming girls. Both boys and girls seemed to rely more on directional landmark information as compared to positional landmark information. To our knowledge, this study is the first to give insight into the relative contribution of different cognitive abilities to navigation skills in school-aged children.</p>

	<p>Ultrasound is routinely used for a wide range of diagnostic imaging applications. However, given that ultrasound can operate over a wide range of parameters that can all be modulated, its applicability extends far beyond the bioimaging field. In fact, the modality has emerged as a hybrid technology that effectively assists drug delivery by transiently opening the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) when combined with intravenously injected microbubbles, and facilitates neuromodulation. Studies in aged mice contributed to an insight into how low-intensity ultrasound brings about its neuromodulatory effects, including increased synaptic plasticity and improved cognitive functions, with a potential role for neurogenesis and the modulation of NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal signalling. This work is complemented by studies in mouse models of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), a form of pathological aging. Here, ultrasound was mainly employed as a BBB-opening tool that clears protein aggregates via microglial activation and neuronal autophagy, thereby restoring cognition. We discuss the currently available ultrasound approaches and how studies in senescent mice are relevant for AD and can accelerate the application of low-intensity ultrasound in the clinic.</p>

                Elko et al. use a multiplexed assay to track epitope-specific antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination. They identify conserved sites where antibodies cross-recognize endemic coronaviruses, but with divergent kinetics compared to SARS-CoV-2. The evolving recognition of polymorphic residues within otherwise conserved sites may influence the formation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

                Tau and -synuclein are major players in neurodegenerative diseases, but their physiological role, particularly in dendrites, is poorly understood. Here we show that, surprisingly, lack of tau protein induces the development of a more elaborate dendritic arbor of hippocampal pyramidal cells in organotypic tissue. Using high-speed volumetric lattice light-sheet microscopy and single particle tracking, we found a more directional KIF1A-mediated transport in dendrites of Tau KO cells. Increased transport processivity correlated with longer and straighter dendritic microtubules as revealed by three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy of cultured hippocampal neurons. Unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of tissue showed highly increased expression of -synuclein in Tau KO hippocampi. Overexpression of -synuclein mimicked the transport characteristics observed in Tau KO cells. Our data indicate that tau and -synuclein shape microtubule-dependent transport in neuronal dendrites, thereby promoting dendritic arborization during maturation. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that transport efficiency and length and straightness of microtubules are correlated.

                Dravet syndrome (DS), an intractable childhood epileptic encephalopathy with a high fatality rate, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one allele of SCN1A, which encodes Nav1.1. In contrast to other epilepsies, pharmaceutical treatment for DS is limited. Here, we demonstrate that viral vector-mediated delivery of a codon-modified SCN1A cDNA improves DS comorbidities in juvenile and adolescent DS mice (Scn1aA1783V/WT). Notably, bilateral vector injections into the hippocampus or thalamus of DS mice improved the survival of the mice, reduced the occurrence of epileptic spikes, provided protection from thermally-induced seizures, and corrected background electrocorticography activity. Together, our results provide a proof-of-concept for the potential of SCN1A delivery as a therapeutic approach for infants and adolescents with DS-associated comorbidities.

                Among the cues that a mosquito uses to find a host for blood-feeding, the smell of the host plays an important role. Previous studies have shown that host odors contain hundreds of chemical odorants, which are detected by different receptors on the peripheral sensory organs of mosquitoes. But how individual odorants are encoded by downstream neurons in the mosquito brain is not known. We developed an in vivo preparation for patch-clamp electrophysiology to record from projection neurons and local neurons in the antennal lobe of Aedes aegypti. Combining intracellular recordings with dye-fills, morphological reconstructions, and immunohistochemistry, we identify different sub-classes of antennal lobe neurons and their putative interactions. Our recordings show that an odorant can activate multiple neurons innervating different glomeruli, and that the stimulus identity and its behavioral preference are represented in the population activity of the projection neurons. Our results provide the first detailed description of olfactory neurons in the central nervous system of mosquitoes and lay a foundation for understanding the neural basis of their olfactory behaviors.

                In multiple sclerosis and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, both resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages contribute to demyelination as well as spontaneous remyelination. Nevertheless, the specific roles of microglia versus macrophages are unknown. We investigated the influence of microglia in EAE using the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor, PLX5622, to deplete microglial population and Ccr2RFP/+ fmsEGFP/+ mice, to distinguish peripheral macrophages and microglia. PLX5622 treatment depleted microglia and meningeal macrophages, and provoked a massive infiltration of CCR2+ macrophages into demyelinating lesions and spinal cord parenchyma. PLX5622 treatment did not alter EAE chronic phase. In contrast, microglia and meningeal macrophages depletion reduced the expression of CD80 co-stimulatory molecule in dendritic and myeloid cells and reduced T cell reactivation and proliferation in the spinal cord parenchyma, inducing a significant delay in EAE onset. Altogether, these data points to a specific role of CNS microglia meningeal macrophages in antigen presentation and T cell reactivation at initial stages of the EAE model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A low-cost device for cryoanesthesia of neonate rodents</a></h4>

              
                Studying the development of neural circuits in rodent models requires surgical access to the neonatal brain. Since commercially available stereotaxic and anesthetic equipment is designed for use in adults, reliable targeting of brain structures in such young animals can be challenging. Hypothermic cooling (cryoanesthesia) has been used as a preferred anesthesia approach in neonates. This commonly involves submerging neonates in ice, an approach that is poorly controllable and potentially stressful to animals. We have developed an affordable, simple to construct device - CryoPup - that allows for fast and robust cryoanesthesia of rodent pups. CryoPup consists of a microcontroller controlling a Peltier element and a heat exchanger. It is capable of both cooling and heating, thereby also functioning as a heating pad during recovery. Importantly, it has been designed for size compatibility with common stereotaxic frames. This open-source device will facilitate future studies into the development of neural circuits in the postnatal brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overall patterns of eye-specific retino-geniculo-cortical projections to layers III, IV and VI in primary visual cortex of the prosimian galago, and correlation with cytochrome oxidase blobs.</a></h4>

              
                Studies in galago have not provided a comprehensive description of the organization of eye specific retino-geniculate-cortical projections to the recipient layers in V1. Here we demonstrate the overall patterns of ocular dominance domains in layers III, IV and VI revealed after injecting the transneuronal tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into one eye. We also correlate these patterns with the array of cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs in tangential sections through the unfolded and flattened cortex. In layer IV, we observed for the first time that eye-specific domains form an interconnected pattern of bands 200-250 um wide arranged such that they do not show orientation bias and do not meet the V1 border at right angles, as is the case in macaques. We also observed distinct patterns of ocular dominance patches in layer III and layer VI. The patches in layer III, likely corresponding to patches of K LGN input described previously, align with layer IV ocular dominance columns (ODCs) of the same eye dominance. Moreover, the layer III patches overlap partially with virtually all CO blobs in both hemispheres, implying that CO blobs receive K LGN input from both eyes. Finally, we found that CO blobs straddle the border between neighboring layer IV ODCs. These results, together with studies showing that a high percentage of cells in CO blobs are monocular, suggest that CO blobs consist of ipsilateral and contralateral subregions that are in register with underlying layer IV ocular dominance columns of the same eye dominance. In macaques and humans, CO blobs are centered on ODCs in layer IV. Our finding that CO blobs in galago straddle the border of neighboring layer IV ODCs suggests that this may represent an alternative way by which visual information is processed by eye specific modular architecture in mammalian V1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Along-tract quantification of resting-state BOLD hemodynamic response functions in white matter</a></h4>

              
                Detailed knowledge of the BOLD hemodynamic response function (HRF) is crucial for accurate analysis and interpretation of functional MRI data. Considerable efforts have been made to characterize the HRF in gray matter (GM) but much less is known about BOLD effects in white matter (WM). However, recent reports have demonstrated reliable detection and analyses of WM BOLD signals after stimulation and in a resting state. WM and GM differ in energy requirements and blood flow, so neurovascular couplings may well be different. We aimed to derive a comprehensive characterization of the HRF in WM across a population, including accurate measurements of its shape and its variation along and between WM pathways, using resting-state fMRI acquisitions. Our results show that the HRF is significantly different between WM and GM. Features of the HRF, such as a prominent initial dip, show strong relationships with features of the tissue microstructure derived from diffusion imaging, and these relationships differ between WM and GM, consistent with BOLD signal fluctuations reflecting different energy demands and differences in neurovascular coupling between tissues of different composition. We also show that the HRF varies significantly along WM pathways, and is different between different WM pathways. Thus, much like in GM, changes in flow and/or oxygenation are different for different parts of the WM. These features of the HRF in WM are especially relevant for interpretation of the biophysical basis of BOLD effects in WM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long wavelength light reduces the negative consequences of dim light at night in the Cntnap2 mouse model of autism.</a></h4>

              
                Many patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show disturbances in their sleep/wake cycles, and may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of circadian disruptors. We have previously shown that exposure to dim light at night (DLaN) in contactin associated protein-like 2 knock out (Cntnap2 KO) mice disrupts diurnal rhythms, increases repetitive behaviors while reducing social interactions. These negative effects of DLaN may be mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to blue light (480nm). In this study, we used a light-emitting diode (LED) array that enabled us to shift the spectral properties of the DLaN while keeping the intensity at 10 lx. First, using wild-type (WT) mice, we confirmed that the short-wavelength enriched lighting produced a strong acute suppression of locomotor activity (masking), a robust light-induced phase shifts and c-Fos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, while the long-wavelength enriched lighting evoked much weaker responses. Furthermore, exposure of WT mice to the short-wavelength light at night reduced the amplitude of locomotor activity rhythms and impaired social interactions. Mice lacking the melanopsin expressing ipRGCs (Opn4DTA mice) were resistant to these negative effects of DLaN. Importantly, the shift of the DLaN stimulus to longer wavelengths ameliorated the negative impact on the activity rhythms and autistic behaviors (i.e. reciprocal social interactions, repetitive grooming) of the Cntnap2 KO model. The short-, but not the long-wavelength enriched, DLaN triggered cFos expression in the peri-habenula region as well as in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Finally, DLaN-driven c-Fos induction in BLA glutamatergic neurons was about 3-fold higher in the Cntnap2 KO mice, suggesting that these cells may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of photic disruption. Broadly, our findings suggest that the spectral properties of light at night should be considered in the management of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Masked target visibility is selectively impaired by 20 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                It has been proposed that both conscious and unconscious perception are associated with a feedforward sweep of oscillatory activity in the gamma band (>40 Hz), while conscious perception also requires recurrent feedback via beta band (~20 Hz) oscillations. To investigate the causal relationship between these oscillations and (un)conscious visual perception, we assessed the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in the gamma (40 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) bands on the objective and subjective visibility of targets in a metacontrast backward masking task. We expected that 40hz-tACS would affect both the correct categorization of the target (i.e. objective visibility) and the reports of conscious perception (i.e. subjective visibility). Moreover, we expected that 20Hz-tACS would selectively affect the subjective visibility. Our results showed that target visibility was selectively compromised by 20Hz-tACS but, in contrast to our hypothesis, this effect was specific to objective visibility. Although the power of local beta oscillations increased after 20Hz-tACS, inter-areal beta synchrony could have nevertheless been impaired, a possibility that should be investigated in the future by means of source reconstructed high density electroencephalography recordings. In summary, we provided evidence supporting that 20Hz-tACS is capable of modulating target visibility, suggesting a possible a causal link between synchrony in this frequency band and visual perception. Future studies could build upon this result by investigating other forms of stimulation and other model organisms, further contributing to our knowledge of how conscious access causally depends on brain oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal brain studies in adult zebrafish by MRI</a></h4>

              
                Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been successfully used for decades in developmental studies and disease modelling. The remarkable intake of zebrafish as a model system is partly due to its transparency during the early weeks of its development, allowing in vivo imaging of cellular and molecular processes. However, this key advantage wears off when tissues become opaque as the animal reaches juvenile and adult stages, rendering access to tissues for live imaging and longitudinal studies difficult. Here we aimed to provide a novel approach to image and assess tissue integrity of adult zebrafish using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) on live zebrafish suitable for longitudinal studies. We built a 3D-printed life support chamber and designed a protocol-directed sedation regime to recover adult zebrafish post scanning in a 9.4T MRI scanner. Our life support chamber is cheap and easy to create using 3D printing, allowing other groups to copy our template for quick setup. Additionally, we optimised the delivery of contrast agent to enhance brain signals in order to refine current delivery, usually delivered by intravenous in rodents. We show here that immersion in gadolinium was a viable alternative to intraperitoneal injection to reduce T1 relaxation times. This could lead to improved image contrast in adult zebrafish disease models. In conclusion, we provide here a detailed methodology to allow longitudinal studies of brain tissue integrity of adult zebrafish, combining safe and efficient delivery of contrast agent and live MRI. This technique can be used to bridge the gap between in vivo studies and longitudinal brain analysis in adult zebrafish which can be applied to the ever-growing number of adult zebrafish models of ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Doing what's not wanted: Conflict in incentives and misallocation of behavioural control lead to drug-seeking despite adverse outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Despite being aware of negative consequences and wanting to quit, long-term addicts find it difficult to quit seeking and consuming drugs. This inconsistency between the (often compulsive) behavioural patterns and the explicit knowledge of negative consequences represents a cognitive conflict which is a central characteristic of addiction. Neurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity in distinct striatal subregions, as well as the dopamine connectivity spiraling from ventral striatal regions to the dorsal regions, play critical roles in compulsive drug seeking. The focus of this work is to illustrate the mechanisms that lead to a cognitive conflict and it's impact on actions taken i.e. addictive choices. We propose an algorithmic model that captures how the action choices that the agent makes when reinforced with drug-rewards become incongruent with the presence of negative consequences that often follow those choices. We advance the understanding of having a decision hierarchy in representing "cognitive control" and how lack of such control at higher-level in the hierarchy could potentially lead to consolidated drug-seeking habits. We further propose a cost-benefit based arbitration scheme, which mediates the allocation of control across different levels of the decision-making hierarchy. Lastly, we discuss how our work on extending a computational model to an algorithmic one, could in turn also helps us improve the understanding of how drugs hijack the dopamine-spiralling circuit at an implementation level.

                The chaperon protein sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has been discovered over forty years ago. Recent pharmacological studies using S1R exogenous ligands demonstrated a promising therapeutical potential of targeting the S1R for several neurological disorders. Although intensive in vitro studies have revealed S1Rs are mainly residing at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cell-specific in vivo expression pattern of S1Rs is still unclear, mainly due to the lack of a reliable detection method which also prevented a comprehensive functional analysis. Here, first, we identified a highly specific antibody using S1R knockout (KO) mice and established an immunohistochemical protocol involving a 1% SDS antigen retrieval step. Second, we characterized the S1R expression in the mouse brain and can demonstrate that the S1R is widely expressed: in principal neurons, interneurons, and all glial cell types. Finally, we generated a novel Cre-dependent S1R conditional KO mouse (S1R flox) to study cell type-specific functions of the S1R. As a proof of concept, we successfully ablated S1R expressions in neurons or microglia employing neuronal and microglial Cre-expressing mice, respectively. In summary, we provide powerful tools to cell-specifically detect, delete and functionally characterize S1R in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intraoperative Spinal Cord Stimulation Mitigates Pain after Spine Surgery in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Managing postoperative pain after spine surgery is challenging, and up to 40% of operated patients develop failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) resulting in intractable back and/or leg pain. While spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to effectively alleviate such chronic pain, it is unknown if intraoperative SCS can mitigate the development of central sensitization that potentially causes intense postoperative pain and FBSS after spine surgery. Methods: As an experimental spine surgery, unilateral T13 laminectomy was performed in mice to expose the dorsal part of L4-5 spinal segments that receive sensory inputs from the hind limb. After the laminectomy, a group of mice received intraoperative SCS epidurally applied to the exposed side of the dorsal part of the spinal cord for an hour under anesthesia before closing the surgical wounds. Secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, a behavioral manifestation of central sensitization, was measured in hind paws using von Frey assay one day before and at predetermined times after surgery. In addition, because von Frey assay is a nocifensive reflex-based analysis that primarily assesses the sensory-discriminative domain of pain, we also performed a conflict avoidance test to capture the affective-motivational domain of pain at selected timepoints post-laminectomy. Results: Mice that underwent unilateral T13 laminectomy developed mechanical hypersensitivity in both hind paws, which gradually resolved in 1-2 weeks. The extent of the hypersensitivity was significantly less in the contralateral hind paw (relative to the laminectomy) than in the ipsilateral hind paw only in females. Intraoperative SCS applied to the exposed side of the dorsal -spinal cord significantly inhibited the development of hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity only in the SCS-applied side. When paws were mechanically stimulated in their preferred place to present a conflict between pain/discomfort and natural preference, mice avoided the conflict after laminectomy, spending less time in the place than before the surgery. However, mice treated with intraoperative SCS after laminectomy did not avoid the conflict. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that spine surgery for unilateral laminectomy induces central sensitization that results in postoperative pain hypersensitivity. Intraoperative SCS after laminectomy can mitigate the development of this hypersensitivity on the SCS-applied side.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Aversive Classical Conditioning on Pupil Dilation and Microsaccades</a></h4>

              
                Unintentional shifts of gaze and the modulation of pupil size are both highly automated processes that serve to regulate the initial influx of visual information. The present work investigated these mechanisms as they came to differentially respond to initially unthreatening stimuli following aversive conditioning. The classical conditioning experimental paradigm employed simple grating stimuli (Gabor patches) shown individually at various (5) on-screen locations, one of which was paired with a noxious auditory unconditioned stimulus (US). Aversively paired Gabor patches elicited an attenuated initial constriction of the pupil (pupillary light response; PLR) along with more rapid re-dilation compared to otherwise identical but unpaired gratings. Modulation of both the PLR and the rate of re-dilation following conditioning showed pronounced individual differences. Rapid eye movements away from fixation (microsaccades) were suppressed for the aversively associated compared to unassociated stimulus locations at several post-stimulus latencies. Mutual information between pupil dilation and microsaccade rate, meanwhile, did not differ between the aversively associated and unassociated visual on-screen locations. Together, these results suggest that measures of pupil diameter and microsaccade rate supply complementary information on early-stage processes of associative learning through experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stability of steady-state visual evoked potential contrast response functions</a></h4>

              
                A repeated measure of neural activity that is stable over time when unperturbed is needed to be able to meaningfully measure neuroplastic changes in the brain. With sensory-evoked potentials in particular, repeated presentation of stimuli can generate neuroplasticity by itself under certain conditions. We assessed the repeated-measure within-day and across-day stability of the steady-state visual-evoked potential (ssVEP), a high signal-to-noise electrophysiological readout of neural activity in human visual cortex, in preparation for studies of visual cortical neuroplasticity. Steady-state VEP contrast-sweep responses were measured daily for 4 days (four 20-trial blocks per day, 22 participants). Response amplitudes were stable in individual participants, with measured across-block and across-day coefficients of variation (CV= SD / Mean) of 12+/-1% and 19+/-2%, respectively. No consistent changes in response amplitude were observed either across blocks or across days. We conclude that contrast-sweep steady-state VEPs provide a stable human neurophysiological measure well-suited for repeated-measures studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TMS-evoked responses are driven by recurrent large-scale network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A major question in systems and cognitive neuroscience is to what extent neurostimulation responses are driven by recurrent activity. This question finds sharp relief in the case of TMS-EEG evoked potentials (TEPs). TEPs are spatiotemporal waveform patterns with characteristic inflections at [~]50ms, [~]100ms, and [~]150-200ms following a single TMS pulse that disperse from, and later reconverge to, the primary stimulated regions. What parts of the TEP are due to recurrent activity? And what light might this shed on more general principles of brain organization? We studied this using source-localized TMS-EEG analyses and whole-brain connectome-based computational modelling. Results indicated that recurrent network feedback begins to drive TEP responses from [~]100ms post-stimulation, with earlier TEP components being attributable to local reverberatory activity within the stimulated region. Subject-specific estimation of neurophysiological parameters additionally indicated an important role for inhibitory GABAergic neural populations in scaling cortical excitability levels, as reflected in TEP waveform characteristics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive exertion affects the appraisal of one's own and other people's pain</a></h4>

              
                Evaluating correctly others' pain is a crucial prosocial ability, especially relevant for the healthcare system. In clinical settings, caregivers assess their patients' pain under high workload and fatigue, often while dealing with competing information/tasks. However, the effect played by such cognitive strain in the appraisal of others' pain remains unclear. Following embodied accounts that posit a shared representational code between self and others' states, it could be hypothesized that the representation of people's pain might be influenced by cognitive exertion similarly to first-hand experiences. Fifty participants underwent one of two demanding tasks, involving either working memory (Experiment 1: N-Back task) or cognitive interference (Experiment 2: Stroop task). After each task, participants were exposed to painful laser stimulations at three intensity levels (low, medium, high), or video-clips of patients experiencing three intensity levels of pain (low, medium, high). Participants rated the intensity of each pain event on a visual analogue scale. We found that the two tasks influenced rating of both one's own and others' pain, by decreasing the sensitivity to medium and high events. This was observed either when comparing the demanding condition to a control (Stroop), or when modelling linearly the difficulty/performance of each depleting task (N-Back). These effects were mirrored by the analysis of physiological responses (Heart Variability and Skin Conductance) evoked by one's own pain. We provide converging evidence that cognitive exertion affects the subsequent appraisal of one's own and likewise others' pain. Healthcare personnel should be aware that high workload might alter their cognitive abilities.

                Nervous systems are hypothesized to learn and store internal models that predict the sensory consequences of motor actions. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms for generating accurate predictions under real-world conditions in which the sensory consequences of action depend on environmental context. Using novel methods for underwater neural recording in freely swimming electric fish, we demonstrate that complex movement-related input to the active electrosensory system is effectively cancelled, despite being highly-dependent on the nearby environment. Computational modeling and closed-loop electrophysiological experiments indicate that the cerebellum-like circuitry of the electrosensory lobe generates context-specific predictions of self-generated input by combining motor signals with electrosensory feedback. These results provide mechanistic insight into sophisticated internal models supporting natural behavior in freely moving animals.

                Deep learning has become an effective tool for classifying biological sex based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but research on what features within the brain are most relevant to this classification is still lacking. Model interpretability has become a powerful way to understand "black box" deep-learning models and select features within the input data that are most relevant to the correct classification. However, very little work has been done employing these methods to understand the relationship between the temporal dimension of functional imaging signals and classification of biological sex, nor has there been attention paid to rectifying problems and limitations associated with feature explanation models, e.g. underspecification and instability. We provide a methodology to limit the impact of underspecification on the stability of the measured feature importance, and then, using intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from fMRI data, we provide a deep exploration of sex differences among functional brain networks. We report numerous conclusions, including activity differences in the visual and cognitive domains, as well as major connectivity differences.

                Relapse, a critical issue in alcohol addiction, can be attenuated by disruption of alcohol-associated memories. Memories are thought to temporarily destabilize upon retrieval during the reconsolidation process. Here, we characterized the alcohol-specific transcriptional dynamics that regulate these memories. Using a mouse place-conditioning procedure, we found that alcohol memory retrieval increased the expression of Arc and Zif268 in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Alcohol seeking was abolished by post-retrieval non-specific inhibition of gene transcription in the DH, as well as by downregulating ARC expression in the DH using antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides. Since sucrose memory retrieval also increased Arc and Zif268 expression, we performed an RNA-sequencing assay, and revealed alterations in the expression of Adcy8, Neto1, Slc8a3 in the DH and Fkbp5 in the mPFC, caused by the retrieval of alcohol but not sucrose memories. This offers a first insight into the unique transcriptional dynamics underpinning alcohol memory reconsolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alzheimer's disease biomarker profiling in a memory clinic cohort without common comorbidities</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disorder with a heterogeneous patient population. Comorbidities such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes are known contributors to the disease progression. Indeed, therapies targeting these disorders have been shown efficient in dementia prevention. However, their mechanistic contribution to Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration has not been fully clarified. In the current study, we used CSF samples from a memory clinic cohort of 90 patients without diagnosed hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes nor other neurodegenerative disorder, to investigate 13 molecular markers representing key mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Levels were compared between clinical groups of subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Associations between markers and groups of markers were analyzed by linear regression. Two-step cluster analysis was used to determine patient clusters. Two key markers were further analyzed by immunofluorescence staining in hippocampus from control and AD individuals without hypertension, hypercholesterolemia nor diabetes. CSF angiotensinogen, thioredoxin-1, and interleukin-15 were the biomarkers with the most prominent associations with Alzheimer's pathology, synaptic and axonal damage. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa and neurofilament light chain were increased in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer cases. When we grouped biomarkers by biological function, we found that inflammatory and survival components were associated with Alzheimer's pathology, synaptic dysfunction and axonal damage. Moreover, a vascular/metabolic component was associated with synaptic dysfunction. In data-driven analysis, two patient clusters were identified; Older participants with increased CSF markers of oxidative stress, vascular pathology and neuroinflammation were assigned to cluster 1, that was also smaller and characterized by increased synaptic and axonal damage, compared to individuals in cluster 2. Clinical groups were evenly distributed between the clusters. Analysis of post-mortem hippocampal tissue, showed that, compared to controls, angiotensinogen staining was higher in Alzheimer's disease and was also found to co-localize with phosphorylated-tau. In a population free of common comorbidities, we could still find associations between Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and markers of pathways associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (i.e., neuroinflammation, vascular function, oxidative stress and cholesterol homeostasis), suggesting that these pathways are contributing to Alzheimer's disease mechanisms even in absence of clinically diagnosed comorbidities. The identification of distinct biomarker-driven endophenotypes of cognitive disorder patients, further highlights the biological heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease and the importance of developing tailored prevention and treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain dynamical modeling for classification of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Simulated whole-brain connectomes demonstrate an enhanced inter-individual variability depending on data processing and modeling approach. By considering the human brain connectome as an individualized attribute, we investigate how empirical and simulated whole-brain connectome-derived features can be utilized to classify patients with Parkinson's disease against healthy controls in light of varying data processing and model validation. To this end, we applied simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent signals derived by a whole-brain dynamical model simulating electrical signals of neuronal populations to reveal differences between patients and controls. In addition to the widely used model validation via fitting the dynamical model to empirical neuroimaging data, we invented a model validation against behavioral data, such as subject classes, which we refer to as behavioral model fitting and show that it can be beneficial for Parkinsonian patient classification. Furthermore, the results of machine-learning reported in this study also demonstrated that performance of the patient classification can be improved when the empirical data are complemented by the simulation results. We also showed that temporal filtering of blood oxygenation level-dependent signals influences the prediction results, where the filtering in the low-frequency band is advisable for Parkinsonian patient classification. In addition, composing the feature space of empirical and simulated data from multiple brain parcellation schemes provided complementary features that improve prediction performance. Based on our findings, we suggest including the simulation results with empirical data is effective for inter-individual research and its clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling and Inference Methods for Switching Regime-Dependent Dynamical Systems with Multiscale Neural Observations</a></h4>

              
                Realizing neurotechnologies that enable long-term neural recordings across multiple spatial-temporal scales during naturalistic behaviors requires new modeling and inference methods that can simultaneously address two challenges. First, the methods should aggregate information across all activity scales from multiple recording sources such as spiking and field potentials. Second, the methods should detect changes in the regimes of behavior and/or neural dynamics during naturalistic scenarios and long-term recordings. Prior regime detection methods are developed for a single scale of activity rather than multiscale activity, and prior multiscale methods have not considered regime switching and are for stationary cases. Here, we address both challenges by developing a Switching Multiscale Dynamical System model and the associated filtering and smoothing methods. This model describes the encoding of an unobserved brain state in multiscale spike-field activity. It also allows for regime-switching dynamics using an unobserved regime state that dictates the dynamical and encoding parameters at every time-step. We also design the associated switching multiscale inference methods that estimate both the unobserved regime and brain states from simultaneous spike-field activity. We validate the methods in both extensive numerical simulations and prefrontal spike-field data recorded in a monkey performing saccades for fluid rewards. We show that these methods can successfully combine the spiking and field potential observations to simultaneously track the regime and brain states accurately. Doing so, these methods lead to better state estimation compared with single-scale switching methods or stationary multiscale methods. These modeling and inference methods effectively incorporate both regime-detection and multiscale observations. As such, they could facilitate investigation of latent switching neural population dynamics and improve future brain-machine interfaces by enabling inference in naturalistic scenarios where regime-dependent multiscale activity and behavior arise.

                Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of neuronal E3 ligase UBE3A with no available treatment. Restoring UBE3A levels via downregulation of the paternally cis-acting long non-coding antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS) is a potentially disease modifying. Developing molecules targeting human UBE3A-ATS is challenging because its expression and function is restricted to neurons and lacks species sequence conservation. To overcome this, we performed a library screen of locked-nucleic acid (LNA)-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) on AS patient-derived neurons. Rounds of optimization led to the identification of RO7248824, which selectively and potently reduces UBE3A-ATS, while concomitantly upregulating UBE3A mRNA and protein. These properties held true in both human AS patient- and neurotypical-, as well as cynomolgus monkey-derived neurons. Tool molecules targeting murine UBE3A-ATS , revealed a steep relationship between UBE3A-ATS knock-down and UBE3A mRNA/protein upregulation in both wild-type (WT) and AS Ube3am-/p+ mice, whereby an almost 90% downregulation was required to achieve a 50% reactivation, respectively. This relationship was confirmed in cynomolgus monkeys. Repeated lumbar intrathecal administrations of RO7248824 was well tolerated without adverse in-life effects and produced a robust, long lasting (> 3 months) paternal UBE3A reactivation in multiple monkey brain regions. Our results demonstrate that AS induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons serve as an excellent translational tool leading to the identification of LNA-modified ASOs with excellent drug-like properties translating to infrequent, intrathecal dosing and serves as the basis for the ongoing clinical development of RO7248824 for AS.

                Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Of the different channel subtypes, Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 are prominently expressed in the adult central nervous system (CNS). All three of these sodium channel subtypes are sensitive to block by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), with TTX being almost equipotent on all three subtypes. In the present study we have used TTX to determine the fractional block of Nav channels required to impair action potential firing in pyramidal neurons and reduce network seizure-like activity. Using automated patch-clamp electrophysiology, we first determined the IC50s of TTX on mouse Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 channels expressed in HEK cells, demonstrating this to be consistent with previously published data on human Nav channels. We then compared this data to the potency of block of Nav current measured in pyramidal neurons from neocortical brain slices. Interestingly, we found that it requires nearly 10-fold greater concentration of TTX over the IC50 to induce significant block of action potentials using a current-step protocol. In contrast, concentrations near the IC50 resulted in a significant reduction in AP firing and increase in rheobase using a ramp protocol. Surprisingly, a 20% reduction in action potential generation observed with 3 nM TTX resulted in significant block of seizure-like activity in the 0 Mg2+ model of epilepsy. Additionally, we found that approximately 50% block in pyramidal cell intrinsic excitability is sufficient to completely block all seizure-like events. These data serve as a critical starting point in understanding how fractional block of Nav channels affect intrinsic neuronal excitability and seizure-like activity. It further suggests that seizures can be controlled without significantly compromising intrinsic neuronal activity and determines the required fold over IC50 for novel and clinically relevant Nav channel blockers to produce efficacy and limit side effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological Markers of Memory Consolidation in the Human Brain when Memories are Reactivated during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Human accomplishments depend on learning, and effective learning depends on consolidation. Consolidation is the process whereby new memories are gradually stored in an enduring way in the brain so that they can be available when needed. For factual or event knowledge, consolidation is thought to progress during sleep as well as during waking states, and to be mediated by interactions between hippocampal and neocortical networks. However, consolidation is difficult to observe directly, but rather is inferred through behavioral observations. Here, we investigated overnight memory change by measuring electrical activity in and near the hippocampus. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made in five patients from electrodes implanted to determine whether a surgical treatment could relieve their seizure disorders. One night, while each patient slept in a hospital monitoring room, we recorded electrophysiological responses to 10-20 specific sounds that were presented very quietly, to avoid arousal. Half of the sounds had been associated with objects and their precise spatial locations that patients learned before sleep. After sleep, we found systematic improvements in spatial recall, replicating prior results. We assume that when the sounds were presented during sleep, they reactivated and strengthened corresponding spatial memories. Notably, the sounds also elicited oscillatory intracranial EEG activity, including increases in theta, sigma, and gamma EEG bands. Gamma responses, in particular, were consistently associated with the degree of improvement in spatial memory exhibited after sleep. We thus conclude that this electrophysiological activity in the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal cortex reflects sleep-based enhancement of memory storage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-brain coupling analysis reveals learning-related attention of primary school students</a></h4>

              
                Learning-related attention is one of the most important factors influencing learning. While technologies have enabled the automatic detection of students' attention levels, the detected states might fail to be learning-related if students did not attend learning tasks (e.g., the attention level of a student who reads comics secretly during classroom learning). This phenomenon poses challenges to the practical application, especially in the primary school stage, which is crucial for students to set up learning attitudes/strategies. Inspired by the emerging inter-person perspective in neuroscience, we proposed an inter-brain attention coupling method to detect learning-related attention. Our method is based on the premise that learning-related attention should follow the structures of course contents, which is reflected in the attention dynamics shared across students. We hypothesized that one's level of learning-related attention could be detected in the inter-brain attention coupling, which is defined as the degree to which an individual student's attention dynamics match the attention dynamics averaged across classmates. To test this idea, wearable EEG devices were used to monitor students' attention levels in a class of primary school students during classroom learning. We found that one's inter-brain attention coupling was positively correlated with academic performance: higher performances are associated with higher coupling to the class-average attention dynamics. No significant correlation was found between students' attention levels averaged within the individual and their academic performances. These results demonstrated the value of inter-brain attention coupling in assessing primary school students' learning process. We argued that inter-person coupling analysis could be useful in monitoring learning-related attention in real-world educational contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhancing associative learning in rats with a computationally designed training protocol</a></h4>

              
                Associative learning requires the activation of protein kinases with distinct temporal dynamics. Learning protocols with computationally designed intertrial intervals (ITIs) that maximize the interaction between fast-activated protein kinase A (PKA) and slow-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) enhance nonassociative learning in Aplysia. Here, we tested whether an optimal learning protocol with irregular ITIs, predicted computationally to increase the overlap between PKA and ERK signaling in rat hippocampus, would enhance associative learning in mammals. We simulated ~1000 training protocols with irregular ITIs and identified an optimal protocol, predicted to induce stronger associative learning than standard protocols with fixed ITIs. With auditory fear conditioning, we showed that male adult rats exposed to the optimal conditioning protocol exhibited stronger fear memory retrieval and impaired fear memory extinction, compared to rats that received either massed or spaced conditioning protocols with fixed ITIs. With fear extinction, we likewise observed that fear conditioned rats exposed to the optimal extinction protocol showed improved extinction of contextual fear memory, compared to rats that received standard extinction protocols. Together, these findings demonstrate the capacity of a behavioral intervention driven by a computational model of memory-related signaling pathways to enhance associative learning in mammals and may provide greater insight into strategies to improve cognition in humans.

	<p>Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is a protein responsible for causing Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. In the absence of an experimentally designed protein molecule, homology modelling was performed. Through homology modelling, different CALHM1 models were generated and validated through Rampage. To carry out further in silico studies, through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments, various flavonoids and alkaloids from Bauhinia variegata were utilised as inhibitors to target the protein (CALHM1). The sequence of CALHM1 was retrieved from UniProt and the secondary structure prediction of CALHM1 was done through CFSSP, GOR4, and SOPMA methods. The structure was identified through LOMETS, MUSTER, and MODELLER and finally, the structures were validated through Rampage. Bauhinia variegata plant was used to check the interaction of alkaloids and flavonoids against CALHM1. The protein and protein&amp;amp;ndash;ligand complex were also validated through molecular dynamics simulations studies. The model generated through MODELLER software with 6VAM A was used because this model predicted the best results in the Ramachandran plot. Further molecular docking was performed, quercetin was found to be the most appropriate candidate for the protein molecule with the minimum binding energy of &amp;amp;minus;12.45 kcal/mol and their ADME properties were analysed through Molsoft and Molinspiration. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that CALHM1 and CALHM1&amp;amp;ndash;quercetin complex became stable at 2500 ps. It may be seen through the study that quercetin may act as a good inhibitor for treatment. With the help of an in silico study, it was easier to analyse the 3D structure of the protein, which may be scrutinized for the best-predicted model. Quercetin may work as a good inhibitor for treating Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, according to in silico research using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and future in vitro and in vivo analysis may confirm its effectiveness.</p>

	<p>We suggest a later timeline for full language capabilities in Homo sapiens, placing the emergence of language over 200,000 years after the emergence of our species. The late Paleolithic period saw several significant changes. Homo sapiens became more gracile and gradually lost significant brain volumes. Detailed realistic cave paintings disappeared completely, and iconic/symbolic ones appeared at other sites. This may indicate a shift in perceptual abilities, away from an accurate perception of the present. Language in modern humans interact with vision. One example is the McGurk effect. Studies show that artistic abilities may improve when language-related brain areas are damaged or temporarily knocked out. Language relies on many pre-existing non-linguistic functions. We suggest that an overwhelming flow of perceptual information, vision, in particular, was an obstacle to language, as is sometimes implied in autism with relative language impairment. We systematically review the recent research literature investigating the relationship between language and perception. We see homologues of language-relevant brain functions predating language. Recent findings show brain lateralization for communicative gestures in other primates without language, supporting the idea that a language-ready brain may be overwhelmed by raw perception, thus blocking overt language from evolving. We find support in converging evidence for a change in neural organization away from raw perception, thus pushing the emergence of language closer in time. A recent origin of language makes it possible to investigate the genetic origins of language.</p>

                The somatosensory system processes diverse types of information including mechanical, thermal, and chemical signals. It has an essential role in sensory perception and body movement and, thus, is crucial for organism survival. The neural network for processing somatosensory information comprises multiple key nodes. Spinal projection neurons represent the key node for transmitting somatosensory information from the periphery to the brain. Although the anatomy of spinal ascending pathways has been characterized, the mechanisms underlying somatosensory information processing by spinal ascending pathways are incompletely understood.

                A dopamine D2 receptor mutation was recently identified in a family with a novel hyperkinetic movement disorder (Mov Disord 36: 729-739, 2021). That allelic variant D2-I212F is a constitutively active and G protein-biased receptor. We now describe mice engineered to carry the D2-I212F variant, Drd2I212F. The mice exhibited gait abnormalities resembling those in other mouse models of chorea and/or dystonia, and had decreased striatal D2 receptor expression. Electrically evoked IPSCs in midbrain dopamine neurons and striatum from Drd2I212F mice exhibited slow onset and decay compared to wild type mice. In the presence of dopamine, current decay initiated by photolytic release of sulpiride from CyHQ-sulpiride was slower in midbrain slices from Drd2I212F mice than Drd2+/+ mice. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type mice in which dopamine is more potent at neurons in the nucleus accumbens than in the dorsal striatum, reflecting activation of Go vs. Gi1, dopamine had similar potencies in those two brain regions of Drd2I212F mice. Repeated cocaine treatment, which decreases dopamine potency in the nucleus accumbens of wild type mice, had no effect on dopamine potency in Drd2I212F mice. The results demonstrate the utility of this mouse model for investigating the role of pathogenic DRD2 variants in early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders.

	<p>In recent years, the increasing incidence of morbidity of brain stroke has made fast and accurate segmentation of lesion areas from brain MRI images important. With the development of deep learning, segmentation methods based on the computer have become a solution to assist clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Nevertheless, the variety of lesion sizes in brain MRI images and the roughness of the boundary of the lesion pose challenges to the accuracy of the segmentation algorithm. Current mainstream medical segmentation models are not able to solve these challenges due to their insufficient use of image features and context information. This paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and context capture network (FECC-Net), which is mainly composed of an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and an enhanced encoder. In particular, the ASPP model uses parallel convolution operations with different sampling rates to enrich multi-scale features and fully capture image context information in order to process lesions of different sizes. The enhanced encoder obtains deep semantic features and shallow boundary features in the feature extraction process to achieve image feature enhancement, which is helpful for restoration of the lesion boundaries. We divide the pathological image into three levels according to the number of pixels in the real mask area and evaluate FECC-Net on an open dataset called Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS). The experimental results show that our FECC-Net outperforms mainstream methods, such as DoubleU-Net and TransUNet. Especially in small target tasks, FECC-Net is 4.09% ahead of DoubleU-Net on the main indicator DSC. Therefore, FECC-Net is encouraging and can be relied upon for brain MRI image applications.</p>

	<p>Background: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hyperventilation (HV) activation has been avoided in electroencephalograms (EEGs) since April 2020. The influence of omitting HV in EEG on epilepsy diagnosis remains uncertain for patients with epilepsies other than child absence epilepsy. We hypothesized that EEGs with HV would show more interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) than EEGs without HV in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods: We reviewed the EEGs of seizure-free patients with JME who underwent EEG, both with and without HV, from January 2019 to October 2021, in our institution, and compared IEDs between EEG with and without HV. Results: This study analyzed 23 JME patients. The IED-positive rate was significantly higher in EEG with HV (65.2%) than in EEG without HV (34.8%, p = 0.016). The mean&amp;amp;plusmn;standard deviation number of IEDs per minute was significantly larger during HV (1.61 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.25 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1) than during non-activation of both first EEG (0.57 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.93 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1, p = 0.039) and second EEG (0.39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.76 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1, p = 0.009). Conclusions: In JME patients, performing HV during EEG may increase IEDs and appears to facilitate the accurate diagnosis of epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a factor associated with the central regulation of body weight, stress, anxiety, learning, memory consolidation, wakefulness&amp;amp;ndash;sleep cycle, and anti-inflammatory and neuroplastic effects. Its stress-reducing, anti-anxiety, arousal without anxiety, and pro-cognitive effects represent an interesting option for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of the study was to examine the potential associations of NPS levels in the blood with clinical and metabolic parameters during the rehabilitation therapy of patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-three male subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia were randomly divided into two groups. The rehabilitation group (REH, N16) consisted of patients who were subjected to structured, 3-month intensive rehabilitation therapy, and the control group (CON, N17) consisted of patients who were subjected to a standard support mechanism. Both groups continued their pharmacological treatment as usual. The NPS concentration, as well as clinical and metabolic parameters, were compared in both groups. Additionally, a group of healthy (H) males (N15) was tested for NPS reference scores. To look for the specificity and selectivity of the NPS relationship with clinical results, various factor models of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) were analyzed, including the original PANSS 2/3 model, its modified four-factor version, the male-specific four-factor model, and two five-factorial models validated in large groups in clinical and multi-ethnic studies. Results and conclusions: (1) Structured rehabilitation therapy, compared to unstructured supportive therapy, significantly reduced the level of schizophrenia disorders defined by various factor models derived from PANSS. (2) The clinical improvement within the 3-month rehabilitation therapy course was correlated with a significant decrease in neuropeptide S (NPS) serum level. (3) The excitement/Hostility (E/H) factor, which included schizophrenic symptoms of the psychotic disorganization, was specific and selective for the reduction in serum NPS, which was stable across all analyzed factor models. (4) The long-term relationship between serum NPS and clinical factors was not accompanied by basic metabolic parameters.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most malignant glioma among astrocytomas and is a lethal form of brain cancer. Many RAB genes are involved in different cancers but RAB42 (Ras-associated binding 42) is seldom studied in GBM. Our study aimed to explore the role of RAB42 expression in the development and prognosis of GBM. Methods: All GBM patient data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. The relevance of RAB42 expression to the clinicopathologic characteristics of GBM patients was analyzed. The overall survival (OS) significance was determined using log-rank. Significantly enriched KEGG pathways were screened using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results: High expression of RAB42 was observed in GBM specimens compared with normal samples, which was also verified in cell lines and tissue samples. Elevated RAB42 expression was correlated with higher GBM histological grade. The prognosis of GBM patients with high RAB42 expression was worse than those with lower RAB42. A total of 35 pathways, such as the P53 pathway, were significantly activated in highly RAB42-expressed GBM samples. Conclusions: High RAB42 expression is related to the development of GBM, and RAB42 is a probable prognostic marker for GBM.</p>

	<p>The deep brain stimulation (DBS) in early-stage Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) pilot trial began more than a decade ago and remains the only investigation of DBS in mildly symptomatic patients. Patients completed therapeutic washouts biannually for two years, outpatient assessments through five years, and a longitudinal washout assessment after 11 years. Here, the patient experience of participating in the early DBS pilot trial is described. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded, analyzed using an iterative inductive-deductive approach, and used to develop a conceptual framework. Ten participants (n = 6 early optimal drug therapy (ODT), n = 4 early DBS + ODT) were interviewed. Motivations for participation included benefit to future PD patients and potential personal benefit, while hesitations included risk of surgical complications. While early ODT patients who received standard-of-care DBS described significant changes in their functional capacities after surgery, early DBS patients described a maintenance of quality of life that made PD less impactful over an extended period. Patients expressed high satisfaction with trial participation and early DBS. This study suggests that the PD experience with early DBS may notably differ from standard-of-care DBS. The FDA has approved a pivotal clinical trial evaluating DBS in early-stage PD (IDEG050016).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Noise Exposure and Aging on Behavioral Tone Detection in Quiet and Noise by Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging leads to degeneration of the peripheral and central auditory systems, hearing loss, and difficulty understanding sounds in noise. Aging is also associated with changes in susceptibility to or recovery from damaging noise exposures, although the effects of the interaction between acute noise exposure and age on the perception of sounds are not well studied. We tested these effects in the CBA/CaJ mouse model of age-related hearing loss using operant conditioning procedures before and after noise exposure and longitudinally measured changes in their sensitivity for detecting tones in quiet or noise backgrounds. Cochleae from a subset of the behaviorally tested mice were immunolabeled to examine organ of Corti damage relative to what is expected based on aging alone. Mice tested in both quiet and noise background conditions experienced worse behavioral sensitivity immediately after noise exposure, but mice exposed at older ages generally showed greater threshold shifts and reduced recovery over time. Surprisingly, day-to-day stability in thresholds was markedly higher for mice detecting signals in the presence of a noise masker compared with detection in quiet conditions. Cochlear analysis revealed decreases in the total number of outer hair cells (OHCs) and the number of ribbons per inner cell in high-frequency regions in aged, noise-exposed mice relative to aging alone. Our findings build on previous work showing interactions between age and noise exposure and add that background noise can increase the stability of behavioral hearing sensitivity after noise damage.</p>

                Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using available resources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity of COVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of natural product use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity and hospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan. Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were ≥18 years old were the study population. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19 severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean ± SD) of the study sample (n=2,148) was 40.25 ± 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37–0.85]), onion (OR [0.69], CI [0.52–0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51–0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.66], CI [0.50–0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantial reduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR [0.55], CI [0.34–0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42–0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.61], CI [0.44–0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regular consumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection was associated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations are required to confirm these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for living systematic reviews (LSRs): protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While the PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to guide the reporting of original systematic reviews, updated systematic reviews, and living systematic reviews (LSRs), its explanation and elaboration document notes that additional considerations for updated systematic reviews and LSRs may need to be addressed. This paper reports the protocol for developing an extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for LSRs. Methods: We will follow the EQUATOR Network’s guidance for developing health research reporting guidelines. We will review the literature to identify possible items of the PRISMA 2020 checklist that need modification, as well as new items that need to be added. Then, we will survey representatives of different stakeholder groups for their views on the proposed modifications of the PRISMA 2020 checklist. We will summarize, present, and discuss the results of the survey in an online meeting, aiming to reach consensus on the content of the LSR extension. We will then draft the checklist, explanation and elaboration for each item, and flow diagram for the PRISMA 2020 extension. Then, we will share these initial documents with stakeholder representatives for final feedback and approval. Discussion: We anticipate that the PRISMA 2020 extension for LSRs will benefit LSR authors, editors, and peer reviewers of LSRs, as well as different users of LSRs, including guideline developers, policy makers, healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SALARECON connects the Atlantic salmon genome to growth and feed efficiency</a></h4>

Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) is the most valuable farmed fish globally and there is much interest in optimizing its genetics and rearing conditions for growth and feed efficiency. Marine feed ingredients must be replaced to meet global demand, with challenges for fish health and sustainability. Metabolic models can address this by connecting genomes to metabolism, which converts nutrients in the feed to energy and biomass, but such models are currently not available for major aquaculture species such as salmon. We present SALARECON, a model focusing on energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism that links the Atlantic salmon genome to metabolic fluxes and growth. It performs well in standardized tests and captures expected metabolic (in)capabilities. We show that it can explain observed hypoxic growth in terms of metabolic fluxes and apply it to aquaculture by simulating growth with commercial feed ingredients. Predicted limiting amino acids and feed efficiencies agree with data, and the model suggests that marine feed efficiency can be achieved by supplementing a few amino acids to plant- and insect-based feeds. SALARECON is a high-quality model that makes it possible to simulate Atlantic salmon metabolism and growth. It can be used to explain Atlantic salmon physiology and address key challenges in aquaculture such as development of sustainable feeds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deriving time-concordant event cascades from gene expression data: A case study for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anika Liu, Namshik Han, Jordi Munoz-Muriedas, Andreas Bender</p>

Adverse event pathogenesis is often a complex process which compromises multiple events ranging from the molecular to the phenotypic level. In toxicology, Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) aim to formalize this as temporal sequences of events, in which event relationships should be supported by causal evidence according to the tailored Bradford-Hill criteria. One of the criteria is whether events are consistently observed in a certain temporal order and, in this work, we study this time concordance using the concept of “first activation” as data-driven means to generate hypotheses on potentially causal mechanisms. As a case study, we analysed liver data from repeat-dose studies in rats from the TG-GATEs database which comprises measurements across eight timepoints, ranging from 3 hours to 4 weeks post-treatment. We identified time concordant gene expression-derived events preceding adverse histopathology, which serves as surrogate readout for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). We find known mechanisms in DILI to be time-concordant, and show further that significance, frequency and log fold change (logFC) of differential expression are metrics which can additionally prioritize events although not necessary to be mechanistically relevant. Moreover, we used the temporal order of transcription factor (TF) expression and regulon activity to identify transcriptionally regulated TFs and subsequently combined this with prior knowledge on functional interactions to derive detailed gene-regulatory mechanisms, such as reduced Hnf4a activity leading to decreased expression and activity of Cebpa. At the same time, also potentially novel events are identified such as Sox13 which is highly significantly time-concordant and shows sustained activation over time. Overall, we demonstrate how time-resolved transcriptomics can derive and support mechanistic hypotheses by quantifying time concordance and how this can be combined with prior causal knowledge, with the aim of both understanding mechanisms of toxicity, as well as potential applications to the AOP framework. We make our results available in the form of a Shiny app (https://anikaliu.shinyapps.io/dili_cascades), which allows users to query events of interest in more detail.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Motor response vigour and visual fixation patterns reflect subjective valuation during intertemporal choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elke Smith, Jan Peters</p>

Value-based decision-making is of central interest in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, as well as in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders characterised by decision-making impairments. Studies examining (neuro-)computational mechanisms underlying choice behaviour typically focus on participants’ decisions. However, there is increasing evidence that option valuation might also be reflected in motor response vigour and eye movements, implicit measures of subjective utility. To examine motor response vigour and visual fixation correlates of option valuation in intertemporal choice, we set up a task where the participants selected an option by pressing a grip force transducer, simultaneously tracking fixation shifts between options. As outlined in our preregistration (https://osf.io/k6jct), we used hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model the choices assuming hyperbolic discounting, compared variants of the softmax and drift diffusion model, and assessed the relationship between response vigour and the estimated model parameters. The behavioural data were best explained by a drift diffusion model specifying a non-linear scaling of the drift rate by the subjective value differences. Replicating previous findings, we found a magnitude effect for temporal discounting, such that higher rewards were discounted less. This magnitude effect was further reflected in motor response vigour, such that stronger forces were exerted in the <i>high</i> vs. the <i>low</i> magnitude condition. Bayesian hierarchical linear regression further revealed higher grip forces, faster response times and a lower number of fixation shifts for trials with higher subjective value differences. An exploratory analysis revealed that subjective value sums across options showed an even more pronounced association with trial-wise grip force amplitudes. Our data suggest that subjective utility or implicit valuation is reflected in motor response vigour and visual fixation patterns during intertemporal choice. Taking into account response vigour might thus provide deeper insight into decision-making, reward valuation and maladaptive changes in these processes, e.g. in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The polyol pathway is an evolutionarily conserved system for sensing glucose uptake</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hiroko Sano, Akira Nakamura, Mariko Yamane, Hitoshi Niwa, Takashi Nishimura, Kimi Araki, Kazumasa Takemoto, Kei-ichiro Ishiguro, Hiroki Aoki, Yuzuru Kato, Masayasu Kojima</p>

Cells must adjust the expression levels of metabolic enzymes in response to fluctuating nutrient supply. For glucose, such metabolic remodeling is highly dependent on a master transcription factor ChREBP/MondoA. However, it remains elusive how glucose fluctuations are sensed by ChREBP/MondoA despite the stability of major glycolytic pathways. Here, we show that in both flies and mice, ChREBP/MondoA activation in response to glucose ingestion involves an evolutionarily conserved glucose-metabolizing pathway: the polyol pathway. The polyol pathway converts glucose to fructose via sorbitol. It has been believed that this pathway is almost silent, and its activation in hyperglycemic conditions has deleterious effects on human health. We show that the polyol pathway regulates the glucose-responsive nuclear translocation of Mondo, a <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of ChREBP/MondoA, which directs gene expression for organismal growth and metabolism. Likewise, inhibition of the polyol pathway in mice impairs ChREBP’s nuclear localization and reduces glucose tolerance. We propose that the polyol pathway is an evolutionarily conserved sensing system for glucose uptake that allows metabolic remodeling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Does brain activity cause consciousness? A thought experiment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Albert Gidon, Jaan Aru, Matthew Evan Larkum</p>

Rapid advances in neuroscience have provided remarkable breakthroughs in understanding the brain on many fronts. Although promising, the role of these advancements in solving the problem of consciousness is still unclear. Based on technologies conceivably within the grasp of modern neuroscience, we discuss a thought experiment in which neural activity, in the form of action potentials, is initially recorded from all the neurons in a participant’s brain during a conscious experience and then played back into the same neurons. We consider whether this artificial replay can reconstitute a conscious experience. The possible outcomes of this experiment unravel hidden costs and pitfalls in understanding consciousness from the neurosciences’ perspective and challenge the conventional wisdom that causally links action potentials and consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, emotions, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 ± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Research data management for bioimaging: the 2021 NFDI4BIOIMAGE community survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusions The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.

<p>This study shows for the first time that itch mediator gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is expressed in both trigeminal ganglion (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is expressed in both the dorsal horn of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and spinal cord of primates, Japanese macaque monkeys, similar to rodents and Eulipotyphla.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRPR) have been identified as itch mediators in the spinal and trigeminal somatosensory systems in rodents. In primates, there are few reports of GRP/GRPR expression or function in the spinal sensory system and virtually nothing is known in the trigeminal system. The aim of the present study was to characterize GRP and GRPR in the trigeminal and spinal somatosensory system of Japanese macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>). cDNA encoding <i>GRP</i> was isolated from the macaque dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and exhibited an amino acid sequence that was highly conserved among mammals and especially in primates. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRP was expressed mainly in the small-sized trigeminal ganglion and DRG in adult macaque monkeys. Densely stained GRP-immunoreactive (ir) fibers were observed in superficial layers of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and the spinal cord. In contrast, GRP-ir fibers were rarely observed in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus and oral and interpolar divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. cDNA cloning, in situ hybridization, and Western blot revealed substantial expression of <i>GRPR</i> mRNA and GRPR protein in the macaque spinal dorsal horn and Sp5C. Our Western ligand blot and ligand derivative stain for GRPR revealed that GRP directly bound in the macaque Sp5C and spinal dorsal horn as reported in rodents. Finally, GRP-ir fibers were also detected in the human spinal dorsal horn. The spinal and trigeminal itch neural circuits labeled with GRP and GRPR appear to function also in primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Dynamic causal communication channels between neocortical areas</a></h4>

              
                How do brain regions influence each other? Javadzadeh and Hofer use a causal approach to study cortical interactions. They find that communication subspaces between areas—the channels by which they interact—are not static over time but re-organize rapidly over timescales as short as tens of milliseconds.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sequence and structural conservation reveal fingerprint residues in TRP channels</a></h4>

              
                TRP proteins are a large family of cation-selective channels, surpassed in variety only by voltage-gated potassium channels. Detailed molecular mechanisms governing how membrane voltage, ligand binding, or temperature can induce conformational changes promoting the open state in TRP channels are still a matter of debate. Aiming to unveil distinctive structural features common to the transmembrane domains within the TRP family, we performed phylogenetic reconstruction, sequence statistics, and structural analysis over a large set of TRP channel genes. Here we report an exceptionally conserved set of residues. This fingerprint is composed of twelve residues localized at equivalent three-dimensional positions in TRP channels from the different subtypes. Moreover, these amino acids are arranged in three groups, connected by a set of aromatics located at the core of the transmembrane structure. We hypothesize that differences in the connectivity between these different groups of residues harbors the apparent differences in coupling strategies used by TRP subgroups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endocytic trafficking promotes vacuolar enlargements for fast cell expansion rates in plants</a></h4>

              
                The vacuole has a space-filling function, allowing a particularly rapid plant cell expansion with very little increase in cytosolic content (Löfke et al., 2015; Scheuring et al., 2016; Dünser et al., 2019). Despite its importance for cell size determination in plants, very little is known about the mechanisms that define vacuolar size. Here, we show that the cellular and vacuolar size expansions are coordinated. By developing a pharmacological tool, we enabled the investigation of membrane delivery to the vacuole during cellular expansion. Our data reveal that endocytic membrane sorting from the plasma membrane to the vacuole is enhanced in the course of rapid root cell expansion. While this ‘compromise’ mechanism may theoretically at first decelerate cell surface enlargements, it fuels vacuolar expansion and, thereby, ensures the coordinated augmentation of vacuolar occupancy in dynamically expanding plant cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancestral reconstruction of duplicated signaling proteins reveals the evolution of signaling specificity</a></h4>

              
                Gene duplication is crucial to generating novel signaling pathways during evolution. However, it remains unclear how the redundant proteins produced by gene duplication ultimately acquire new interaction specificities to establish insulated paralogous signaling pathways. Here, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect and characterize a bacterial two-component signaling system that duplicated in a-proteobacteria. We determined the interaction specificities of the signaling proteins that existed before and immediately after this duplication event and then identified key mutations responsible for establishing specificity in the two systems. Just three mutations, in only two of the four interacting proteins, were sufficient to establish specificity of the extant systems. Some of these mutations weakened interactions between paralogous systems to limit crosstalk. However, others strengthened interactions within a system, indicating that the ancestral interaction, although functional, had the potential to be strengthened. Our work suggests that protein-protein interactions with such latent potential may be highly amenable to duplication and divergence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tyrosine phosphorylation tunes chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2 ion channel</a></h4>

              
                Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) is a multimodal ion channel implicated in diverse physiopathological processes. Its important involvement in immune responses has been suggested such as in the macrophages' phagocytosis process. However, the endogenous signaling cascades controlling the gating of TRPV2 remain to be understood. Here, we report that enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation remarkably alters the chemical and thermal sensitivities of TRPV2 endogenously expressed in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages. We identify that the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 mediates TRPV2 phosphorylation at the molecular sites Tyr(335), Tyr(471), and Tyr(525). JAK1 phosphorylation is required for maintaining TRPV2 activity and the phagocytic ability of macrophages. We further show that TRPV2 phosphorylation is dynamically balanced by protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1). PTPN1 inhibition increases TRPV2 phosphorylation, further reducing the activation temperature threshold. Our data thus unveil an intrinsic mechanism where the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation dynamic balance sets the basal chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2. Targeting this pathway will aid therapeutic interventions in physiopathological contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid presynaptic maturation in naturally regenerating axons</a></h4>

              
                Successful neuronal regeneration requires the re-establishment of synaptic connectivity. Crucial to this process is the reconstitution of presynaptic machinery responsible for controlling neurotransmitter release. In the mammalian adult CNS post-injury regeneration is usually only possible after extensive experimental intervention, and it is unknown how presynaptic function is re-established, let alone how it might be optimised to promote functional recovery. Here we addressed these questions by studying presynaptic maturation during a regenerative process that occurs entirely naturally. After toxin-induced injury, olfactory sensory neurons in the adult mouse olfactory epithelium can regenerate fully, sending axons to the brain to re-establish synaptic contact with postsynaptic partners in the olfactory bulb. Using electrophysiological recordings in acute slices, we found that after initial re-contact, functional connectivity in this system was rapidly established. Moreover, re-connecting presynaptic terminals had almost mature functional properties, including high release probability and a strong capacity for presynaptic inhibition. Release probability then matured quickly, rendering re-established terminals functionally indistinguishable from controls just one week after initial contact. These data show that successful synaptic regeneration in the adult mammalian brain is not quite a "plug-and-play" process; instead, almost-mature presynaptic terminals undergo a rapid phase of functional maturation to re-integrate into established target networks.

                Objective: Functional connectivity networks explain the different brain states during diverse motor, cognitive, and sensory functions. Extracting spatial network configurations and their temporal evolution is crucial for understanding the brain function during diverse behavioral tasks. Approach: In this study, we introduce the use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the dynamics of brain networks. We compared DMD with principal component analysis (PCA) using real magnetoencephalography (MEG) data during motor and memory tasks. Main Results: The framework generates dominant spatial brain networks and their time dynamics during simple tasks, such as button press and left-hand movement, as well as more complex tasks, such as picture naming and memory tasks. Our findings show that the DMD-based approach provides a better temporal resolution than the PCA-based approach. Significance: We believe that DMD has a very high potential for deciphering the spatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological brain network states during tasks.

                The brain has the extraordinary capacity to construct predictive models of the environment by internalizing statistical regularities in the sensory inputs. The resulting sensory expectations shape how we perceive and react to the world; at the neural level, this relates to decreased neural responses to expected than unexpected stimuli (expectation suppression). Crucially, expectations may need revision as context changes. However, existing research has often neglected this issue. Further, it is unclear whether contextual revisions apply selectively to expectations relevant to the task at hand, hence serving adaptive behaviour. The present fMRI study examined how contextual visual expectations spread throughout the cortical hierarchy as participants update their beliefs. We created a volatile environment with two state spaces presented over separate contexts and controlled by an independent contextualizing signal. Participants attended a training session before scanning to learn contextual temporal associations among pairs of object images. The fMRI experiment then tested for the emergence of contextual expectation suppression in two separate tasks, respectively with task-relevant and task-irrelevant expectations. Behavioural and neural effects of contextual expectation emerged progressively across the cortical hierarchy as participants attuned themselves to the context: expectation suppression appeared first in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex, followed by the ventral visual stream, up to early visual cortex. This applied selectively to task-relevant expectations. Taken together, the present results suggest that an insular and frontoparietal executive control network may guide the flexible deployment of contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behaviour in our complex and dynamic world.
