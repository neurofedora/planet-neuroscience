              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05099">Recovery of activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities in stroke brain networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Healthy brain networks usually show highly efficient information communication and self-sustained oscillation abilities. However, how the brain network structure affects these dynamics after an injury (stroke) is not very clear. The recovery of structure and dynamics of stroke brain networks over time is still not known precisely. Based on the analysis of a large number of strokes' brain network data, we show that stroke changes the network properties in connection weights, average degree, clustering, community, etc. Yet, they will recover gradually over time to some extent. We then adopt a simplified reaction-diffusion model to investigate stroke patients' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities. Our results reveal that the stroke slows the adoption time across different brain scales, indicating a weakened brain's activation propagation ability. In addition, we show that the lifetime of self-sustained oscillatory patterns at three months post-stroke patients' brains significantly departs from the healthy one. Finally, we examine the properties of core networks of self-sustained oscillatory patterns, in which the directed edges denote the main pathways of activation propagation. Our results demonstrate that the lifetime and recovery of self-sustaining patterns are related to the properties of core networks, and the properties in the post-stroke greatly vary from those in the healthy group. Most importantly, the strokes' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities significantly improve at one year post-stroke, driven by structural connection repair. This work may help us to understand the relationship between structure and function in brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07150">Adaptive behavior with stable synapses</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.07150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral changes in animals and humans, as a consequence of an error or a verbal instruction, can be extremely rapid. Improvement in behavioral performances are usually associated in machine learning and reinforcement learning to synaptic plasticity, and, in general, to changes and optimization of network parameters. However, such rapid changes are not coherent with the timescales of synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for that could be a dynamical network reconfiguration. In the last few years, similar capabilities have been observed in transformers, foundational architecture in the field of machine learning that are widely used in applications such as natural language and image processing. Transformers are capable of in-context learning, the ability to adapt and acquire new information dynamically within the context of the task or environment they are currently engaged in, without the need for significant changes to their underlying parameters. Building upon the notion of something unique within transformers enabling the emergence of this property, we claim that it could also be supported by input segregation and dendritic amplification, features extensively observed in biological networks. We propose an architecture composed of gain-modulated recurrent networks that excels at in-context learning, showing abilities inaccessible to standard networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01163">Domain Adaptation-Enhanced Searchlight: Enabling classification of brain states from visual perception to mental imagery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.01163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface research, accurately predicting imagined stimuli is crucial. This study investigates the effectiveness of Domain Adaptation (DA) in enhancing imagery prediction using primarily visual data from fMRI scans of 18 subjects. Initially, we train a baseline model on visual stimuli to predict imagined stimuli, utilizing data from 14 brain regions. We then develop several models to improve imagery prediction, comparing different DA methods. Our results demonstrate that DA significantly enhances imagery prediction in binary classification on our dataset, as well as in multiclass classification on a publicly available dataset. We then conduct a DA-enhanced searchlight analysis, followed by permutation-based statistical tests to identify brain regions where imagery decoding is consistently above chance across subjects. Our DA-enhanced searchlight predicts imagery contents in a highly distributed set of brain regions, including the visual cortex and the frontoparietal cortex, thereby outperforming standard cross-domain classification methods. The complete code and data for this paper have been made openly available for the use of the scientific community.

                arXiv:2501.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in wireless electroencephalography (EEG) technology promise to record brain-electrical activity in everyday situations. To better understand the relationship between brain activity and natural behavior, it is necessary to monitor human movement patterns. Here, we present a pocketable setup consisting of two smartphones to simultaneously capture human posture and EEG signals. We asked 26 basketball players to shoot 120 free throws each. First, we investigated whether our setup allows us to capture the readiness potential (RP) that precedes voluntary actions. Second, we investigated whether the RP differs between successful and unsuccessful free-throw attempts. The results confirmed the presence of the RP, but the amplitude of the RP was not related to shooting success. However, offline analysis of real-time human pose signals derived from a smartphone camera revealed pose differences between successful and unsuccessful shots for some individuals. We conclude that a highly portable, low-cost and lightweight acquisition setup, consisting of two smartphones and a head-mounted wireless EEG amplifier, is sufficient to monitor complex human movement patterns and associated brain dynamics outside the laboratory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06232">Range, not Independence, Drives Modularity in Biological Inspired Representation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired networks -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise their representation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise if their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand the mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal recordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results to suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant theory of flexible nonlinear classification. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04733">Unsupervised representation learning with Hebbian synaptic and structural plasticity in brain-like feedforward neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.04733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks that can capture key principles underlying brain computation offer exciting new opportunities for developing artificial intelligence and brain-like computing algorithms. Such networks remain biologically plausible while leveraging localized forms of synaptic learning rules and modular network architecture found in the neocortex. Compared to backprop-driven deep learning approches, they provide more suitable models for deployment of neuromorphic hardware and have greater potential for scalability on large-scale computing clusters. The development of such brain-like neural networks depends on having a learning procedure that can build effective internal representations from data. In this work, we introduce and evaluate a brain-like neural network model capable of unsupervised representation learning. It builds on the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), which has earlier been implemented as abstract as well as biophyscially detailed recurrent attractor neural networks explaining various cortical associative memory phenomena. Here we developed a feedforward BCPNN model to perform representation learning by incorporating a range of brain-like attributes derived from neocortical circuits such as cortical columns, divisive normalization, Hebbian synaptic plasticity, structural plasticity, sparse activity, and sparse patchy connectivity. The model was tested on a diverse set of popular machine learning benchmarks: grayscale images (MNIST, F-MNIST), RGB natural images (SVHN, CIFAR-10), QSAR (MUV, HIV), and malware detection (EMBER). The performance of the model when using a linear classifier to predict the class labels fared competitively with conventional multi-layer perceptrons and other state-of-the-art brain-like neural networks.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach aimed at overcoming existing challenges in the realm of local search algorithms. Our aim is to improve the decision process that takes place within a local search algorithm so as to make the best possible transitions in the neighborhood at each iteration. To improve this process, we propose to use a neural network that has the same input information as conventional local search algorithms. In this paper, which is an extension of the work [Goudet et al. 2024] presented at EvoCOP2024, we investigate different ways of representing this information so as to make the algorithm as efficient as possible but also robust to monotonic transformations of the problem objective function. To assess the efficiency of this approach, we develop an experimental setup centered around NK landscape problems, offering the flexibility to adjust problem size and ruggedness. This approach offers a promising avenue for the emergence of new local search algorithms and the improvement of their problem-solving capabilities for black-box problems.

                arXiv:2501.04761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata are computers, similar to Turing machines. The main difference is that Turing machines use a one-dimensional tape, whereas cellular automata use a two-dimensional grid. The best-known cellular automaton is the Game of Life, which is a universal computer. It belongs to a family of cellular automata with 262,144 members. Playing the Game of Life generally involves engineering; that is, assembling a device composed of various parts that are combined to achieve a specific intended result. Instead of engineering cellular automata, we propose evolving cellular automata. Evolution applies mutation and selection to a population of organisms. If a mutation increases the fitness of an organism, it may have many descendants, displacing the less fit organisms. Unlike engineering, evolution does not work towards an imagined goal. Evolution works towards increasing fitness, with no expectations about the specific form of the final result. Mutation, selection, and fitness yield structures that appear to be more organic and life-like than engineered structures. In our experiments, the patterns resulting from evolving cellular automata look much like the spots on leopards and the stripes on tigers.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04971">Self-Adaptive Ising Machines for Constrained Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines (IM) are physics-inspired alternatives to von Neumann architectures for solving hard optimization tasks. By mapping binary variables to coupled Ising spins, IMs can naturally solve unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems such as finding maximum cuts in graphs. However, despite their importance in practical applications, constrained problems remain challenging to solve for IMs that require large quadratic energy penalties to ensure the correspondence between energy ground states and constrained optimal solutions. To relax this requirement, we propose a self-adaptive IM that iteratively shapes its energy landscape using a Lagrange relaxation of constraints and avoids prior tuning of penalties. Using a probabilistic-bit (p-bit) IM emulated in software, we benchmark our algorithm with multidimensional knapsack problems (MKP) and quadratic knapsack problems (QKP), the latter being an Ising problem with linear constraints. For QKP with 300 variables, the proposed algorithm finds better solutions than state-of-the-art IMs such as Fujitsu's Digital Annealer and requires 7,500x fewer samples. Our results show that adapting the energy landscape during the search can speed up IMs for constrained optimization.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) often requires surgical intervention, such as craniotomy, to relieve mass lesions and pressure. The extent of hematoma evacuation significantly impacts patient outcomes. This study utilizes 3D Slicer software to analyse post-craniotomy hematoma volume changes and evaluate their prognostic significance in aSDH patients. Methods: Among 178 adult patients diagnosed with aSDH from January 2015 to December 2022, 64 underwent hematoma evacuation via craniotomy. Initial scans were performed within 24 h of trauma, followed by routine postoperative scans to assess residual hematoma. We conducted radiomic analysis of preoperative and postoperative volumes, surface area, Feret diameter, sphericity, flatness, and elongation. Clinical parameters, including SOFA score, APACHE score, pupillary response, comorbidities, age, anticoagulation status, and preoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, were also evaluated. Results: Changes in &amp;amp;Delta; surface area significantly correlated with 30-day outcomes (p = 0.03) and showed moderate predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.65). Patients with a &amp;amp;Delta; surface area &amp;amp;gt; 30,090 mm2 experienced poorer outcomes (OR = 6.66, p = 0.02). Significant features included preoperative surface area (p = 0.009), Feret diameter (p = 0.0012). In multivariate analysis, only the Feret diameter remained significant (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Postoperative &amp;amp;Delta; surface area is, among other variables, a strong predictor of 30-day outcomes, while in multivariate analysis, preoperative Feret diameter remains the only independent predictor. Radiomic analysis with 3D Slicer may enhance prognostic accuracy and inform tailored therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The study examined the relationships between specific Theory-of-Mind (ToM) dimensions, cognitive planning, and sleep duration in aging adults. Methods: The sample included 179 participants, comprising 46 cognitively healthy individuals, 75 diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), and 58 with non-amnestic (naMCI). The mean age of the participants was 70.23 years (SD = 4.74), with a mean educational attainment of 12.35 years (SD = 3.22) and gender distribution of 53 men and 126 women. ToM assessment included tasks measuring the understanding and interpretation of non-literal speech, proverbs and metaphors, as well as an emotion-recognition test. For cognitive planning, a Tower Test was utilized. Sleep duration was measured using actigraphy. Results: We identified significant differences in various ToM tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; performance between the groups, particularly in non-literal speech tasks and third-order ToM stories. The HC group consistently outperformed both MCI groups in these tasks, with aMCI showing higher performance than naMCI. Mediation analysis applied to examine potential direct and indirect effects of sleep duration on ToM tasks indicated that total sleep time had significant indirect effects through cognitive planning&amp;amp;mdash;mainly as rule violation total score&amp;amp;mdash;on specific ToM aspects. Hence, besides the effects of MCI pathologies and especially of naMCI, sleep duration seems also to be associated with ToM performance in aging via specific executive functioning decrements. Conclusions: The findings underscore the social implications of ToM deficits due to MCI and/or sleep duration decrease, particularly in naMCI older adults, as they can seriously impair their social interactions. Targeted interventions could improve emotional understanding, communication, and overall quality of life.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize people by their faces. Developmental prosopagnosia is the hereditary or congenital variant of the condition. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the assessment of developmental prosopagnosia in a clinical context, using a combination of commercially available clinical assessment tools and experimental tools described in the research literature. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of a man with Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient (ON) had experienced difficulties with face identity recognition throughout his life but believed they were caused by a lack of interest in others. Results: The neuropsychological assessment revealed varying degrees of difficulties primarily related to executive functions, attention, reaction time, and memory processes, as expected in a person with Tourette&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome and ADHD. In addition, ON reported severe problems with face recognition on a prosopagnosia questionnaire and demonstrated severely impaired performance on tests of face memory and face perception commonly used to diagnose prosopagnosia. Interestingly, he reported familial face recognition problems on the maternal side of the family, while tics and ADHD symptoms occurred on the paternal side. This suggests that, in this case, the conditions were likely inherited through different genetic pathways. Conclusions: Proper assessment of face recognition problems, which includes a broad spectrum of clinical assessment tools, could help patients develop awareness and acceptance of themselves and their difficulties, and could serve as a basis for the development of clinical interventions. While ON&amp;amp;rsquo;s DP, Tourette syndrome, and ADHD may have distinct genetic origins, impairment in face identity recognition has been observed across several neurodevelopmental conditions and is likely more common than currently thought.</p>

                <p>The full complement of ion channels which influence insect auditory mechanotransduction and the mechanisms by which their influence is exerted remain unclear. <I>Shal</I> (K<SUB>v</SUB>4), a <I>Shaker</I> family member encoding voltage-gated potassium channels in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, has been shown to localize to dendrites in some neuron types, suggesting the potential role of <I>Shal</I> in <I>Drosophila</I> hearing, including mechanotransduction. A GFP trap was used to visualize the localization of the <I>Shal</I> channel in Johnston's organ neurons responsible for hearing in the antenna. <I>Shal</I> protein was localized strongly to the cell body and inner dendritic segment of sensory neurons. It was also detectable in the sensory cilium, suggesting its involvement not only in general auditory function but specifically in mechanotransduction. Electrophysiological recordings to assess neural responses to auditory stimuli in mutant <I>Shal</I> flies revealed significant decreases in auditory responses. Laser Doppler vibrometer recordings indicated abnormal antennal free fluctuation frequencies in mutant lines, indicating an effect on active antennal tuning, and thus active transduction mechanisms. This suggests that <I>Shal</I> participates in coordinating energy-dependent antennal movements in <I>Drosophila</I> that are essential for tuning the antenna to courtship song frequencies.</p>

                <p>The social environment has long been recognized to play an important role in substance use, which is often modeled in rodents using operant conditioning. However, most operant chambers only accommodate one rodent at a time. We present PeerPub&mdash;a unique social operant chamber. PeerPub employs touch sensors to track the licking behavior on drinking spouts. When the number of licks meets a set reinforcement schedule, it dispenses a drop of solution with a fixed volume as a reward at the tip of the spout. A radio frequency identification (RFID) chip implanted in each rat&rsquo;s skull identifies it throughout the experiment. The system is managed by a Raspberry Pi computer. We evaluated PeerPub using Sprague Dawley rats in daily 1&nbsp;h sessions, where supersac (a glucose and saccharin solution) was provided under a fixed-ratio five schedule. We discovered that male rats consumed more supersac in dual rat conditions compared with single rat conditions. These findings illustrate PeerPub&rsquo;s effectiveness in modeling the interaction between motivated behavior and social context. We expect devices like PeerPub will help highlight the role of social environments in substance use disorder phenotypes.

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                Background The quality of registry based studies depends largely on the data accuracy of the registries. The Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) is a nationwide database comprising perinatal data digitally provided by different healthcare providers. Perined data are used for comparing outcomes across regions and healthcare institutions as well as for quality analyses and research purposes. However, little is known about the data quality of the Perined database. Therefore, this research protocol depicts our proposed study assessing the quality of Perined data compared to hospital records and case report forms (CRFs) that were part of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Methods In the planned comparison study data from Perined and the IRIS Study will be used. The IRIS study was a large cluster-randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes among Dutch low-risk pregnant women. A subsample of the IRIS study of neonates being at risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and their mothers will be used. Baseline demographic data were collected by midwives from participating women at inclusion (around 22 weeks’ gestation) using CRFs, and in-depth neonatal and maternal clinical data were retrieved from hospital records by trained research assistants. These latter IRIS study data were linked and compared to Perined data. Completeness of Perined data will be calculated for every variable. The reliability will be assessed as the percent of agreement between Perined and hospital record data or the CRF-based data. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for continuous variables, and Kappa and ‘Prevalence-and-Bias-Adjusted Kappa’ will be calculated for categorical variables. Discussion The results of the planned comparison study will provide users of Perined data insight in its data quality. This will serve as an example of the accuracy of registry based data used in maternal and neonatal care research.

                Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among children and adolescents is crucial for the prevention of HPV-related diseases later in life. However, HPV vaccination uptake remains suboptimal in this population. This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting parents and parent-adolescent dyads in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the impact of parent-directed and parent-adolescent dyad interventions on HPV vaccination uptake in children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Specific objectives include reviewing existing literature on parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions, assessing vaccination uptake, identifying influencing factors, and providing evidence-based recommendations for intervention development and implementation. Methods A systematic review will be conducted, encompassing literature published up to the present day. Various databases will be searched for relevant studies on parent-focused and parent-adolescent dyad interventions aimed at improving HPV vaccination uptake. Data extraction and analysis will be performed to assess the proportion of children and adolescents receiving HPV vaccination following interventions, factors influencing vaccination uptake, and completion rates of the recommended vaccine series. Results The review findings will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect size of interventions. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the results. Conclusion This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents. The findings will inform the development and implementation of targeted interventions to address barriers and improve vaccination coverage, ultimately reducing the burden of HPV-related diseases.

                Background Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in improving clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients has gained significant attention; however, its impact on long-term survival and recurrence rates remains under investigation. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of NAC on metastasis, recurrence rates, and overall survival in BC patients. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to assess differences between groups. Methods In this retrospective study, 46 Sudanese patients with locally advanced BC were consecutively collected attending Alsharif Specialized Hospital during the period from 2015 to 2016, comprising 28 patients who received NAC (case group) and 18 patients who underwent upfront surgery (control group). Data regarding demographics, histological types, treatment regimens, prognostic markers, survival, recurrence and metastasis were collected Results Most of patients in both groups were > 40 years old. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the predominant histological type observed. Notably, the metastasis rate was lower in the case group than in the control group (n=6; 21.4% vs. n=9; 50%, P = 0.043). However, the recurrence rates and overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.353 and P = 0.454, respectively). The estimated mean survival time was 74.1 months for the case group compared to 82.0 months for the control group, but without significant difference (log-rank P = 0.973). Conclusion While NAC appears to reduce metastasis rates in breast cancer patients, it does not significantly impact recurrence rates or overall survival. These results underscore the need for further research to explore additional factors that influence long-term outcomes of breast cancer management.

                Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for brain imaging, but conventional methods rely on qualitative contrast, are time-intensive, and prone to variability. Magnetic resonance finger printing (MRF) addresses these limitations by enabling fast, simultaneous mapping of multiple tissue properties like T1, T2. Using dynamic acquisition parameters and a precomputed signal dictionary, MRF provides robust, qualitative maps, improving diagnostic precision and expanding clinical and research applications in brain imaging. Methods Database searches were performed through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of science to identify relevant articles focusing on the application of MR finger printing in the adult brain. We utilized the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines to extract data from the selected studies. Results Nine articles were included in the final review, with a total sample size of 332 participants. In healthy brains, notable regional, sex, age, and hemispheric variations were identified, particularly in the corpus callosum and thalamus. MRF effectively differentiated meningioma subtypes, glioma grades, and IDH mutation status, with T2 values providing particularly predictive for glioma classification. In brain metastases, significant relaxometry differences were noted between normal and lesional tissues. For multiple sclerosis, MRF values correlated with clinical and disability measures, distinguishing relapsing-remitting secondary progressive forms. In traumatic brain injury, longitudinal T1 changes strongly correlated with clinical recovery, surpassing T2 values. Conclusions The systematic review highlighted MRD as a groundbreaking technique that enhances neurological diagnosis by simultaneously quantifying T1 and T2 relaxation times. With reduced acquisition times, MRF outperforms conventional MRI in detecting subtle pathologies, distinguishing properties, and providing reliable biomarkers.

                Background Good animal welfare is important ethically but also to ensure animals provide valid scientific models. Despite thousands of amphibians in research laboratories there is minimal quantitative evidence pertaining to their management and welfare. This study validated methods to non-invasively measure corticosterone, the amphibian ‘stress’ hormone, from tank water to provide a robust and reliable welfare assessment tool. Methods We report experiments (A) that evaluate parameters linked to the performance of our biochemical extraction methods for waterborne corticosterone and, importantly, associated sampling procedures. We evaluate appropriate sampling water type, sampling vessel, filtration methods, potential degradation of waterborne corticosterone over time and the impact of sampling procedures on animal corticosterone levels. We wanted to determine sampling parameters that yielded the least background corticosterone and had minimum negative impact on the animals. The second series of experiments (B) evaluated parameters linked to the biology of Xenopus, including the influence of circadian rhythm, sex and snout-vent length on waterborne corticosterone levels, since fundamental knowledge of a species’ biology is essential for designing robust experiments and in the interpretation of the results. Results We propose collecting corticosterone samples in deionised water in either plastic or glass containers. The filtering process does not impact the amount of corticosterone measured in the water sample. Levels of corticosterone collected in the water change over a 48-hr period so we advocate standardising time from hormone collection to storage at - 20 °C. Repeated transfer of frogs to sampling containers does not increase corticosterone, suggesting our methods are not cumulatively stressful. Corticosterone levels were not impacted by circadian phase, sex or snout-vent length. Conclusion We have developed and validated robust methods to quantify waterborne corticosterone. We hope they provide a template for researchers wishing to develop methods to measure waterborne corticosterone in aquatic amphibians.

                <p>by Xiaoyi Wang, Zhen Jin</p>

Human mobility between different regions is a major factor in large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases. Deep learning models incorporating infectious disease transmission dynamics for predicting the spread of multi-regional outbreaks due to human mobility have become a hot research topic. In this study, we incorporate the Graph Transformer Neural Network and graph learning mechanisms into a metapopulation SIR model to build a hybrid framework, Metapopulation Graph Transformer Neural Network (M-Graphormer), for high-dimensional parameter estimation and multi-regional epidemic prediction. The framework effectively solves the problem that existing models may lose some hidden spatial dependencies in the data when dealing with the dynamic graph structure of the network due to human mobility. We performed multi-wave infectious disease prediction in multiple regions based on real epidemic data. The results show that the framework is capable of performing high-dimensional parameter estimation and accurately predicting epidemic transmission dynamics in multiple regions even with low data quality. In addition, we retrospectively extrapolate the temporal evolution patterns of contact rate under different interventions implemented in different regions, reflecting the dynamics of intervention intensity and the need for flexibility in adjusting interventions in different regions. To provide early warning of infectious disease transmission, we retrospectively predicted the arrival time of infectious diseases using data from the early stages of outbreaks.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

Machine learning has become a powerful tool for computational analysis in the biomedical sciences, with its effectiveness significantly enhanced by integrating domain-specific knowledge. This integration has give rise to informed machine learning, in contrast to studies that lack domain knowledge and treat all variables equally (uninformed machine learning). While the application of informed machine learning to bioinformatics and health informatics datasets has become more seamless, the likelihood of errors has also increased. To address this drawback, we present eight guidelines outlining best practices for employing informed machine learning methods in biomedical sciences. These quick tips offer recommendations on various aspects of informed machine learning analysis, aiming to assist researchers in generating more robust, explainable, and dependable results. Even if we originally crafted these eight simple suggestions for novices, we believe they are deemed relevant for expert computational researchers as well.

                <p>by Amrit Bagchi, Bapi Sarker, Jialiang Zhang, Marcus Foston, Amit Pathak</p>

Cell collectives, like other motile entities, generate and use forces to move forward. Here, we ask whether environmental configurations alter this proportional force-speed relationship, since aligned extracellular matrix fibers are known to cause directed migration. We show that aligned fibers serve as active conduits for spatial propagation of cellular mechanotransduction through matrix exoskeleton, leading to efficient directed collective cell migration. Epithelial (MCF10A) cell clusters adhered to <i>soft</i> substrates with aligned collagen fibers (AF) migrate faster with much lesser traction forces, compared to random fibers (RF). Fiber alignment causes higher motility waves and transmission of normal stresses deeper into cell monolayer while minimizing shear stresses and increased cell-division based fluidization. By contrast, fiber randomization induces cellular jamming due to breakage in motility waves, disrupted transmission of normal stresses, and heightened shear driven flow. Using a novel motor-clutch model, we explain that such ‘force-effective’ fast migration phenotype occurs due to rapid stabilization of contractile forces at the migrating front, enabled by higher frictional forces arising from simultaneous compressive loading of parallel fiber-substrate connections. We also model ‘<i>haptotaxis</i>’ to show that increasing ligand connectivity (but not continuity) increases migration efficiency. According to our model, increased rate of front stabilization via higher resistance to substrate deformation is sufficient to capture ‘<i>durotaxis’</i>. Thus, our findings reveal a new paradigm wherein the rate of leading-edge stabilization determines the efficiency of supracellular collective cell migration.

                <p>by Kwang Su Kim, Masashi Iwamoto, Kosaku Kitagawa, Hyeongki Park, Sanae Hayashi, Senko Tsukuda, Takeshi Matsui, Masanori Atsukawa, Kentaro Matsuura, Natthaya Chuaypen, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Lena Allweiss, Takara Nishiyama, Naotoshi Nakamura, Yasuhisa Fujita, Eiryo Kawakami, Shinji Nakaoka, Masamichi Muramatsu, Kazuyuki Aihara, Takaji Wakita, Alan S.

Quantification of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a key for evaluating an elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in infected patients. However, quantifying cccDNA requires invasive methods such as a liver biopsy, which makes it impractical to access the dynamics of cccDNA in patients. Although HBV RNA and HBV core-related antigens (HBcrAg) have been proposed as surrogate markers for evaluating cccDNA activity, they do not necessarily estimate the amount of cccDNA. Here, we employed a recently developed multiscale mathematical model describing intra- and intercellular viral propagation and applied it in HBV-infected patients under treatment. We developed a model that can predict intracellular HBV dynamics by use of extracellular viral markers, including HBsAg, HBV DNA, and HBcrAg in peripheral blood. Importantly, the model prediction of the amount of cccDNA in patients over time was confirmed to be well correlated with the data for quantified cccDNA by paired liver biopsy. Thus, our method combining classic and emerging surrogate markers enables us to predict the decay dynamics of cccDNA in patients undergoing treatment.

                Background Glaucoma, the primary cause of irreversible blindness globally, mainly presents as primary open-angle glaucoma and is more common in sub-Saharan Africa. This chronic disease of the optic nerve often goes undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic early stages. Increased awareness and regular eye exams can help in early detection and management. Purpose/Objectives This study aims to comprehensively identify the existing literature on screening programs or interventions for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) at the primary healthcare level. Additionally, the study aims to outline the characteristics of these screening programs/interventions and emphasize the most successful programs that have been implemented at the primary healthcare level. Methods The scoping review will be conducted following the framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al. (2010) methodological enhancement for conducting a scoping review project. The search will cover peer-reviewed articles published in English between the inception and May 2024 from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and the WHO Global Database. The search on the EBSCOhost platform will include databases such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycInfo, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE with full text, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analyzed using QualCoder 1.9 version. The study findings will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and a checklist will be completed to ensure adherence to reporting guidelines. Conclusion This review will help identify research gaps in primary healthcare POAG screening programs and recommend effective interventions.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

                Background Radiological case reports summarize the imaging characteristics of individual cases to identify patterns and valuable lessons. Their writing can be guided by the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines. However, the impact of following these guidelines, or not following them, on the quality and efficiency of radiological case reports writing remain unclear. Objective To examine whether following the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines, or not following any reporting guidelines, affects the quality and writing efficiency of radiological case reports. Protocol The purpose of this protocol is to outline the background and objectives of this study, as well as the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT). We will design a three-arm, multicentre cRCT, targeting radiologists or radiology students from different medical institutions. The intervention include training on the CARE-radiology checklist; the second intervention involves training on the CARE checklist. The control group will follow standard procedures without any intervention. After the intervention, participants will be required to write a case report within a period of 10 days. The primary outcome measures will be the completeness and clarity of the case reports. Discussion This study aims to enhance the adherence of researchers to reporting guidelines for case reports through rigorous design. The results will be further explained and interpreted in the final trial outcomes. Registration This study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, with the registration number: ChiCTR2400089973.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-50/v1?src=rss">Impact of the season and prevalence of intestinal parasitosis at the Notre Dame de l’Espérance University Hospital Center [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Intestinal parasitoses are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Africa, with a prevalence of 42.18%. The tropical climate in the D.R. Congo provides parasites with an environment conducive to their proliferation. The prevalence rates of intestinal parasitoses remain poorly understood in the D.R. Congo. Objective This study aims to estimate the overall and specific prevalence of intestinal parasitosis and to determine an association between intestinal parasitosis and the season. Methods From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, patients for whom a direct stool examination was requested at the Notre Dame de l’Espérance University Hospital Center were included in this study. Stool samples were collected and examined under an optical microscope. Results During the period of the study, we recorded 187 patients aged 2 to 77 years. The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 75.40%. The specific prevalence rates for parasites were as follows: Entamoeba H., the most common, with a prevalence of 55.08%, followed by Trichomonas I. and Giardia L. with respective prevalence rates of 9.09% and 6.24%. Ascaris L. had a prevalence of 27.81%, followed by Schistosoma M., Ankylostoma D., and Enterobius V. with respective prevalence rates of 3.74%, 1.60%, and 1.07%. There was no association between the season and the overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis. Conclusion The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was higher during the dry season. There is no statistically valid association between the season and the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-49/v1?src=rss">Support Vector Machine-Based Prediction Model for Healthcare Workforce Transition Success Under Decentralization [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective To develop predictive models for healthcare workforce transition success under decentralization using Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis and identify key determinants across organizational support domains. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare personnel (n=430) who transferred from Ministry of Public Health facilities to Provincial Administrative Organizations in Thailand during 2023-2024. The SVM model evaluated 37 predictor variables spanning demographic characteristics, benefits, and welfare domains. Four kernel functions were compared to identify optimal model performance, and feature importance analysis was conducted to determine key predictors. Results The linear kernel demonstrated superior performance (accuracy: 71.43%, sensitivity: 49.02%, specificity: 85.37%) compared to other kernel functions. Analysis revealed five key predictors (feature weights >0.25): competitive compensation (0.427), career development opportunities (0.358), fair promotion processes (0.336), hazardous work compensation (0.285), and educational leave opportunities (0.252). While employee qualifications (0.236) emerged as a significant demographic predictor, organizational support factors, particularly financial incentives and professional development opportunities, showed stronger predictive power for transition success. Conclusions This study represents the first application of machine learning techniques to predict healthcare personnel transition success in decentralization contexts. The SVM model effectively identified critical factors influencing workforce transitions, emphasizing the importance of balanced organizational support mechanisms. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare administrators implementing decentralization policies, offering generalizable insights for workforce management during health system reforms.

                Fu et al. discover a non-metabolic function of TKT in gliomas. Mechanistically, TKT undergoes translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following chemotherapy. Nuclear TKT interacts with XRN2 to prevent excessive R-loop accumulation, while depletion of TKT leads to increased R-loop accumulation and genome instability, potentiating chemotherapy efficacy.

                Novak et al. show how Miro1 regulates mitochondrial transfer from the tumor microenvironment to mtDNA-deficient melanoma cells. The authors argue that delayed tumor formation observed in Miro1KO mice results from impaired mitochondrial transfer, which involves reduced microtubule association, disruption of the mitochondrial network, and TNT formation.

                RAS/ERK signaling is necessary for oocyte development but is turned off during the oocyte-to-embryo transition across species. Baek et al. show that aberrant reactivation of ERK in C. elegans leads to misregulation of PLK-1 and impairs embryogenesis, demonstrating that ERK must be turned off to ensure proper development.

                Kim et al. observed that IL-21 regulates B cell fate in a context-dependent manner. IL-21 induces apoptosis in naive B cells but promotes proliferation of activated B cells, especially IgG1+ cells. B-cell-specific IL-21 receptor deficiency impairs GC formation and IgG1 antibody production.

                Zhao et al. modulate adiponectin levels produced in hepatic stellate cells. Local expression of adiponectin in HSCs prevents the development of liver fibrosis, while the deletion of adiponectin in HSCs accelerates its development. An increase of PPARγ activity in HSCs partially recaptures the phenotype of adiponectin overexpression in HSCs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96784">Fractal cycles of sleep, a new aperiodic activity-based definition of sleep cycles</a></h4>

              
                Sleep cycles are defined as episodes of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep followed by an episode of REM sleep. Fractal or aperiodic neural activity is a well-established marker of arousal and sleep stages measured using electroencephalography. We introduce a new concept of ‘fractal cycles’ of sleep, defined as a time interval during which time series of fractal activity descend to their local minimum and ascend to the next local maximum. We assess correlations between fractal and classical (i.e. non-REM – REM) sleep cycle durations and study cycles with skipped REM sleep. The sample comprised 205 healthy adults, 21 children and adolescents and 111 patients with depression. We found that fractal and classical cycle durations (89±34 vs 90±25 min) correlated positively (<i>r</i>=0.5, p&lt;0.001). Children and adolescents had shorter fractal cycles than young adults (76±34 vs 94±32 min). The fractal cycle algorithm detected cycles with skipped REM sleep in 91–98% of cases. Medicated patients with depression showed longer fractal cycles compared to their unmedicated state (107±51 vs 92±38 min) and age-matched controls (104±49 vs 88±31 min). In conclusion, fractal cycles are an objective, quantifiable, continuous and biologically plausible way to display sleep neural activity and its cycles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95528">High-resolution awake mouse fMRI at 14 tesla</a></h4>

              
                High-resolution awake mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains challenging despite extensive efforts to address motion-induced artifacts and stress. This study introduces an implantable radio frequency (RF) surface coil design that minimizes image distortion caused by the air/tissue interface of mouse brains while simultaneously serving as a headpost for fixation during scanning. Furthermore, this study provides a thorough acclimation method used to accustom animals to the MRI environment minimizing motion-induced artifacts. Using a 14 T scanner, high-resolution fMRI enabled brain-wide functional mapping of visual and vibrissa stimulation at 100 µm×100 µm×200 µm resolution with a 2 s per frame sampling rate. Besides activated ascending visual and vibrissa pathways, robust blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex upon visual stimulation and spread through the ventral retrosplenial area (VRA) with vibrissa air-puff stimulation, demonstrating higher-order sensory processing in association cortices of awake mice. In particular, the rapid hemodynamic responses in VRA upon vibrissa stimulation showed a strong correlation with the hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortical areas. Cross-correlation analysis with designated VRA responses revealed early positive BOLD signals at the contralateral barrel cortex (BC) occurring 2 s prior to the air-puff in awake mice with repetitive stimulation, which was not detected using a randomized stimulation paradigm. This early BC activation indicated a learned anticipation through the vibrissa system and association cortices in awake mice under continuous exposure of repetitive air-puff stimulation. This work establishes a high-resolution awake mouse fMRI platform, enabling brain-wide functional mapping of sensory signal processing in higher association cortical areas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93183">A high-throughput platform for single-molecule tracking identifies drug interaction and cellular mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of cell physiology depends largely upon interactions of functionally distinct proteins and cellular components. These interactions may be transient or long-lived, but often affect protein motion. Measurement of protein dynamics within a cellular environment, particularly while perturbing protein function with small molecules, may enable dissection of key interactions and facilitate drug discovery; however, current approaches are limited by throughput with respect to data acquisition and analysis. As a result, studies using super-resolution imaging are typically drawing conclusions from tens of cells and a few experimental conditions tested. We addressed these limitations by developing a high-throughput single-molecule tracking (htSMT) platform for pharmacologic dissection of protein dynamics in living cells at an unprecedented scale (capable of imaging &gt;10<sup>6</sup> cells/day and screening &gt;10<sup>4</sup> compounds). We applied htSMT to measure the cellular dynamics of fluorescently tagged estrogen receptor (ER) and screened a diverse library to identify small molecules that perturbed ER function in real time. With this one experimental modality, we determined the potency, pathway selectivity, target engagement, and mechanism of action for identified hits. Kinetic htSMT experiments were capable of distinguishing between on-target and on-pathway modulators of ER signaling. Integrated pathway analysis recapitulated the network of known ER interaction partners and suggested potentially novel, kinase-mediated regulatory mechanisms. The sensitivity of htSMT revealed a new correlation between ER dynamics and the ability of ER antagonists to suppress cancer cell growth. Therefore, measuring protein motion at scale is a powerful method to investigate dynamic interactions among proteins and may facilitate the identification and characterization of novel therapeutics.

                Transcription factor partners can cooperatively bind to DNA composite elements to augment gene transcription. Here, we report a novel protein-DNA binding screening pipeline, termed Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE), that can systematically predict protein binding partners and DNA motif spacing preferences. Using SPICE, we successfully identified known composite elements, such as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs) and STAT5 tetramers, and also uncovered several novel binding partners, including JUN-IKZF1 composite elements. One such novel interaction was identified at CNS9, an upstream conserved noncoding region in the human <i>IL10</i> gene, which harbors a non-canonical IKZF1 binding site. We confirmed the cooperative binding of JUN and IKZF1 and showed that the activity of an <i>IL10</i>-luciferase reporter construct in primary B and T cells depended on both this site and the AP1 binding site within this composite element. Overall, our findings reveal an unappreciated global association of IKZF1 and AP1 and establish SPICE as a valuable new pipeline for predicting novel transcription binding complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98742">Nitric oxide modulates contrast suppression in a subset of mouse retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators have major influences on the regulation of neural circuit activity across the nervous system. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be a prominent neuromodulator in many circuits and has been extensively studied in the retina. Here, it has been associated with the regulation of light adaptation, gain control, and gap junctional coupling, but its effect on the retinal output, specifically on the different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is still poorly understood. In this study, we used two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings to measure light-evoked activity of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer in the ex vivo mouse retina. This approach allowed us to investigate the neuromodulatory effects of NO on a cell type-level. Our findings reveal that NO selectively modulates the suppression of temporal responses in a distinct subset of contrast-suppressed RGC types, increasing their activity without altering the spatial properties of their receptive fields. Given that under photopic conditions, NO release is triggered by quick changes in light levels, we propose that these RGC types signal fast contrast changes to higher visual regions. Remarkably, we found that about one-third of the RGC types, recorded using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, exhibited consistent, cell type-specific adaptational response changes throughout an experiment, independent of NO. By employing a sequential-recording paradigm, we could disentangle those additional adaptational response changes from drug-induced modulations. Taken together, our research highlights the selective neuromodulatory effects of NO on RGCs and emphasizes the need of considering non-pharmacological activity changes, like adaptation, in such study designs.

">Revealing hidden knowledge in amnestic mice</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia in which memory and cognitive decline is thought to arise from underlying neurodegeneration. These cognitive impairments, however, are transient when they first appear and can fluctuate across disease progression. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying fluctuations of performance in amnestic mice. We trained APP/PS1+ mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated learning of task contingencies (knowledge) from its more variable expression under reinforcement (performance). APP/PS1+ exhibited significant performance deficits compared to control mice. Using large-scale two-photon imaging of 6,216 excitatory neurons in 8 mice, we found that auditory cortical networks were more suppressed, less selective to the sensory cues, and exhibited aberrant higher-order encoding of reward prediction compared to control mice. A small sub-population of neurons, however, displayed the opposite phenotype, reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism. Volumetric analysis demonstrated that deficits were concentrated near A{beta} plaques. Strikingly, we found that these cortical deficits were reversed almost instantaneously on probe (non-reinforced) trials when APP/PS1+ performed as well as control mice, providing neural evidence for intact stimulus-action knowledge despite variable ongoing performance. A biologically-plausible reinforcement learning model recapitulated these results and showed that synaptic weights from sensory-to-decision neurons were preserved (i.e. intact stimulus-action knowledge) despite poor performance that was due to inadequate contextual scaling (i.e. impaired performance). Our results suggest that the amnestic phenotype is transient, contextual, and endogenously reversible, with the underlying neural circuits retaining the underlying stimulus-action associations. Thus, memory deficits commonly observed in amnestic mouse models, and potentially at early stages of dementia in humans, relate more to contextual drivers of performance rather than degeneration of the underlying memory traces.

                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (ASD/ID), but the neural mechanisms underlying its symptoms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the development of the head-direction (HD) system in a rat model of FXS (Fmr1-/y rats). Using high-density silicon probes, we recorded neuronal activity in the postsubiculum (PoSub), a cortical hub of the HD system, during exploration and sleep in juvenile and adult Fmr1-/y and wild-type (WT) rats. Juvenile Fmr1-/y rats exhibited enhanced HD tuning characterized by sharper directional tuning curves and improved stability of the HD signal in relation to the external environment. This enhancement was intrinsic to the HD circuit and persisted across behavioral and sleep states. However, by adulthood, HD tuning in Fmr1-/y rats became unstable, with increased drift in the allocentric reference frame despite intact intrinsic HD dynamics. These findings reveal a transient enhancement of spatial coding in the HD system of juvenile Fmr1-/y, followed by a degradation in adulthood, providing insights into network-level dysfunctions in FXS and their developmental trajectories. Overall, our work establishes the HD system as a valuable and tractable model for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Spherical code of retinal orientation-selectivity enables decoding in ensembled and retinotopic operation</a></h4>

              
                Selectivity to orientations of edges is seen at the earliest stages of visual processing, in retinal orientation-selective ganglion cells (OSGCs), thought to prefer vertical or horizontal orientation. However, as stationary edges are projected on the hemispherical retina as lines of longitude or latitude, how edge orientation is encoded, and decoded by the brain, is unknown. Here, by mapping the OS of thousands of OSGCs at known retinal locations in mice, we identified three OSGC types whose preferences match two longitudinal fields, and a fourth type matching two latitudinal fields, the members of each field-pair being non-orthogonal. A geometric decoder revealed that two OS sensors yield optimal orientation decoding when approaching the deviation from orthogonality we observed for OSGC field-pairs. Retinotopically-organized decoding generated type-specific variation in decoding efficiency across the visual field. OS tuning was greater in the dorsal retina, possibly reflecting an evolutionary adaptation to an environmental gradient of edges.

">Hippocampal-cortical connectivity relates to inter-individual differences and training gains in distinguishing similar memories</a></h4>

              
                Mnemonic discrimination (MD) is the ability to distinguish current experiences from similar memories. Research on the brain correlates of MD has focused on how regional neural responses are linked to MD. Here we go beyond this approach to investigate inter-regional functional connectivity patterns related to MD, its inter-individual variability and training-related improvement. Based on prior work we focused on medial temporal lobe (MTL), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual regions. We used fMRI to determine how functional connectivity patterns between these regions are related to MD before and after 2-weeks of web-based cognitive training. We found that hippocampal-PFC connectivity was negatively associated with interindividual variability in MD performance across two different tasks. Hippocampal-PFC connectivity decrease was also linked to interindividual variability in post-training MD improvement. Additionally, training led to increased connectivity from the lateral occipital cortex to the occipital pole area. Our results point to a hippocampal-PFC connectivity pattern which is a reliable, task-invariant, marker of MD performance. This pattern is further related to MD training gains providing causal evidence for its relevance in distinguishing similar memories. Overall, we show that hippocampal-PFC connectivity constitutes a neural resource for MD that enables training-related improvements and could be targeted in future research to enhance cognition.

">Physiological and molecular impairment of PV circuit homeostasis in mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                Circuit dysfunction in autism may involve a failure of homeostatic plasticity. To test this, we studied parvalbumin (PV) interneurons which exhibit rapid homeostatic plasticity of intrinsic excitability following whisker deprivation in mouse somatosensory cortex. Brief deprivation reduces PV excitability by increasing Kv1 current to increase PV spike threshold. We found that PV homeostatic plasticity is disrupted in Tsc2+/- and Fmr1-/- models of autism. In wildtype mice, deprivation elevates the transcription factor ER81 which drives Kcna1 transcription, increasing Kv1.1 protein in the axon initial segment and soma. These molecular signatures of homeostasis were absent in Tsc2+/- and Fmr1-/-. Whisker enrichment increased PV excitability, but not in Tsc2+/-, indicating that homeostasis is lost bidirectionally. Deprivation reduced feedforward L4-L2/3 inhibition in wildtype but not Tsc2+/- mice. Thus, two autism models show a convergent loss of PV circuit homeostasis at physiological and molecular levels, potentially contributing to sensory processing impairments.

">Human hippocampal ripples predict the alignment of experience to a grid-like schema</a></h4>

              
                Humans create internal cognitive maps that allow us to make inferences beyond direct experience. These maps often rely on hexagonal grid-cell-like neural codes, serving as a schema for two-dimensional (2D) spaces. Yet it remains unclear how new experiences become aligned with this schema, especially in non-spatial contexts. Here, we show that hippocampal ripples - brief bursts of neuronal activity during rest - predict the emergence of grid-like codes in a novel 2D inference task. We recorded intracranial neuronal activity in 42 epilepsy patients as they learned rank relationships among feature objects (for example, objects differing in 'magic' or 'speed'). After learning, these objects were combined to form 'compounds' occupying a 2D conceptual space defined by two feature dimensions. During learning, hippocampal ripple activity increased during pauses between trials, suggesting that ripples integrated newly acquired information offline. Subsequently, ripple activity during post-learning rest predicted the later emergence of grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a core region of the default mode network (DMN), when participants inferred unseen relationships among the compounds. Critically, coordination during rest between hippocampal ripples and DMN activity in the mPFC predicted participants' ability to infer complex relationships beyond direct memory retrieval. These findings provide the first direct evidence that hippocampal ripples, working with the DMN, align new experiences with a grid-like schema offline, transforming discrete learning events into structured knowledge that supports flexible and adaptive reasoning in human cognition.

">Two independent translocation modes drive neural stem cell dissemination into the human fetal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The strong size increase of the human neocortex is supported by the amplification and the basal translocation of a neural stem cell population, the basal radial glial cells (or bRG cells). Here, using live imaging of second trimester human fetal tissue and cortical organoids, we identify a two-step mode of translocation for bRG cell colonization of the human neocortex. bRG cells undergo a microtubule-dependent movement during interphase, called interphasic somal translocation (IST), and an acto-myosin dependent movement prior to cytokinesis, called mitotic somal translocation (MST). IST is controlled by the LINC complex that recruits the dynein motor and its activator LIS1 to the nuclear envelope for transport, and is altered in LIS1 patient organoids. MST occurs during prometaphase and is a mitotic spindle translocation event. It is controlled by the mitotic cell rounding molecular pathway, via ERMs and Vimentin, driving translocation. 85% of bRG cell translocation is due to IST, for a total movement of 0,67 mm per month of human fetal gestation. Our work identifies how bRG cells colonize the human fetal cortex, and further shows how these mechanisms are conserved in migrating glioblastoma cells.

">Temporal recurrence as a general mechanism toexplain neural responses in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of neural processing in the auditory cortex usually ignore that neurons have an internal memory: they characterize their responses from simple convolutions with a finite temporal window of arbitrary duration. To circumvent this limitation, we propose here a new, simple and fully recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture incorporating cutting-edge computational blocks from the deep learning community and constituting the first attempt to model auditory responses with deep RNNs. We evaluated the ability of this approach to fit neural responses from 8 publicly available datasets, spanning 3 animal species and 6 auditory brain areas, representing the largest compilation of this kind. Our recurrent models significantly outperform previous methods and a new Transformer-based architecture of our design on this task, suggesting that temporal recurrence is the key to explain auditory responses. Finally, we developed a novel interpretation technique to reverse-engineer any pretrained model, regardless of their stateful or stateless nature. Largely inspired by works from explainable artificial intelligence (xAI), our method suggests that auditory neurons have much longer memory (several seconds) than indicated by current STRF techniques. Together, these results highly motivate the use of deep RNNs within computational models of sensory neurons, as protean building blocks capable of assuming any function.

">Unlocking information alignment between interacting brains with EEG hyperscanning</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions shape our perception of the world as the people we interact with, and groups we belong to, influence how we interpret incoming information. Alignment between interacting individuals' sensory and cognitive processes plays a critical role in facilitating cooperation and communication in everyday joint activities. However, despite recent advances in hyperscanning techniques to measure the brain activity of multiple people simultaneously, the neural processes underlying this alignment remain unknown. Here, we leveraged Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) with electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning data to measure neural representations and uncover the emergence of information alignment between interacting individuals' brains during joint visual categorisation. We recorded EEG from 24 pairs of participants sitting back-to-back while they performed a 4-way categorisation task based on rules they first agreed upon together. The results revealed significant interbrain information alignment as early as 45 ms after stimulus presentation, lasting over hundreds of milliseconds. Importantly, early alignment between brains arose between 45 and 180 ms regardless of whether participants performed the task together or were randomly matched up a posteriori to form pseudo pairs, whereas alignment after 200 ms was only present for real pairs who previously formed the categories together. This result distinguishes alignment that was socially induced by pre-agreed and shared interpretation of the stimuli from alignment that was purely evoked by shared sensory responses due to participants seeing the same visual input. In addition, our results showed that socially induced alignment was an active and dynamic process, which strengthened over time with practice and reinforcement of shared agreements, but appeared to remain largely task specific with no transfer during passive viewing of the same stimuli. Together, these findings highlight distinct sensory evoked and socially induced processes underpinning human perception and interbrain information alignment during social interactions that can be effectively captured and disentangled with Interbrain RSA.

">Resting State connectivity patterns associated with trait anxiety in adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety symptoms can vary across different life stages, with a higher frequency during adolescence and early adulthood, increasing the risk of developing future anxiety disorders. To date, neuroscientific research on anxiety has primarily focused on adulthood, thus limiting our understanding of how anxiety may characterize earlier stages of life, and employing mostly univariate approaches, thus discounting large-scale alterations of the brain. One intriguing hypothesis is that adolescents with trait anxiety may display similar abnormalities shown by adults in brain regions ascribed to the Default Mode Network (DMN) associated with self-referential thinking, awareness, and rumination-related processes. The present study aims to expand our previous knowledge on this topic using a large sample of young individuals to uncover the resting-state connectivity patterns associated with trait anxiety in a network approach. To test our hypotheses, we analyzed the rs-fMRI images of 1263 adolescents (mean age 20.55 years) as well as their scores on anxiety trait. A significant association between trait anxiety and resting-state functional connectivity in two networks was found, with some regions overlapping with the Default Mode Network. The first network included regions such as the cingulate gyrus and the middle temporal gyri known to be involved in self-referential processing and emotional perception and control, both altered in anxiety disorders. The second network included the precuneus, possibly related to rumination that characterizes anxiety. Of note, the higher the trait anxiety, the lower the connectivity within both networks, suggesting abnormal self-referential processing, awareness, and emotion regulation abilities in adolescents with high anxiety trait. These findings provided a better understanding of the association between trait anxiety and brain rs-functional connectivity, and may pave the way for the development of potential biomarkers in adolescents with anxiety.

">Activity dependent Clustering of Neuronal L-Type Calcium Channels by CaMKII</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling pathways can be initiated by local increases of Ca2+ concentrations within a nanodomain close to the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (LTCC). However, molecular mechanisms controlling LTCC organization within the plasma membrane that help creation these localized signaling domains remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that neuronal depolarization increases CaV1.3 LTCC clustering in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our previous work showed that binding of the activated catalytic domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to an RKR motif in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CaV1.3 is required for LTCC-mediated E-T coupling. We tested whether multimeric CaMKII holoenzymes can bind simultaneously to co-expressed CaV1.3 1 subunits with two different epitope tags. Co-immunoprecipitation assays from HEK293T cell lysates revealed that CaMKII assembles multimeric CaV1.3 LTCC complexes in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner. CaMKII-dependent assembly of multi-CV1.3 complexes is further facilitated by co-expression of the CaMKII-binding LTCC {beta}2a subunit, relative to the {beta}3 subunit, which cannot bind directly to CaMKII. Moreover, clustering of surface localized CaV1.3 1 subunits in intact HEK293 cells was increased by pharmacological LTCC activation, but only in the presence of co-expressed wild-type CaMKII. Moreover, depolarization-induced clustering of surface-expressed CaV1.3 LTCCs in cultured hippocampal neurons was disrupted by suppressing the expression of CaMKII and CaMKII{beta} using shRNAs. The CaMKII-binding RKR motif is conserved in the N-terminal domain of CaV1.2 1 subunits and we found that activated CaMKII promoted the assembly of CaV1.2 homomeric complexes, as well as CaV1.3-CaV1.2 heteromeric complexes in vitro. Furthermore, neuronal depolarization enhanced the clustering of surface-expressed CaV1.2 LTCCs, and enhanced the colocalization of endogenous CaV1.2 LTCCs with surface-expressed CaV1.3, by CaMKII-dependent mechanisms. This work indicates that CaMKII activation-dependent LTCC clustering in the plasma membrane following neuronal depolarization may be essential for the initiation of a specific long-range signal to activate gene expression.

">Distinct roles of cortical layer 5 subtypes in associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior is critically dependent on associative learning, where environmental cues are linked with subsequent positive or negative outcomes. In mammals, primary neocortical sensory areas serve as pivotal nodes in this process, processing stimuli and distributing information to cortical and subcortical networks. Layer 5 (L5) of the cortex comprises two types of pyramidal projection neurons - intratelencephalic (IT) and extratelencephalic (ET) neurons - each with distinct downstream targets. Despite the crucial function of L5 as a main output node of the cortex, the specific contributions of these L5 neuronal subtypes to associative learning remain poorly understood. In the present study, by leveraging transgenic mouse lines, we distinguished IT and ET neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex and examined their roles in a whisker-based frequency-discrimination learning task. Longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging revealed distinct response characteristics between IT and ET neurons throughout learning. Interestingly, the activity of IT neurons hardly changed over the five days of learning, while the activity of ET neurons developed robustly. Furthermore, IT neurons appeared to show stimuli encoding from the beginning, whereas the ET neurons became increasingly responsive to stimuli associated with reward. Chemogenetic silencing of either IT or ET neurons both impaired learning, but in strikingly distinct ways, each associated with a different phase of learning. By modeling the response characteristics of IT and ET neurons using a reinforcement learning framework, we show that IT neurons primarily encode sensory stimuli, and their representations are critical for forming stimulus-reward associations. ET neurons instead represent the value of the stimulus, used for refining behavior. Thus, our results delineate the distinct roles of L5 IT and ET neurons, underscoring their integral and complementary contributions to associative learning.

">Learning-induced plasticity decreases cortical engram cell dendritic excitability during memory recall</a></h4>

              
                The ability to associate stimuli to create a memory is one of the most fundamental functions of the brain. Research from the past decade has revealed that memory is encoded in sparse neuronal networks active during learning called engram cells. Although the cortex is recognized as playing an important role in memory, the biophysical properties of cortical engram cells are largely unknown. To address this, we tagged engram cells in the auditory cortex during tone fear conditioning and compared their dendritic and somatic properties with neighbouring non-engram cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that tuft dendrites of engram cells had dampened, but synchronous, activity during recall. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings illustrated that engram cells were preferentially connected with neighbouring engram cells and had decreased excitability due to a transient increase in Ih current. Together, these findings reveal Ih-driven intrinsic plasticity which leads to specific information processing in engram cells.

">Ensemble priming via competitive inhibition: local mechanisms of sensory context storage and deviance detection in the neocortical column</a></h4>

              
                The process by which neocortical neurons and circuits amplify their response to an unexpected change in stimulus, often referred to as deviance detection (DD), has long been thought to be the product of specialized cell types and/or routing between mesoscopic brain areas. Here, we explore a different theory, whereby DD emerges from local network-level interactions within a neocortical column. We propose that deviance-driven neural dynamics can emerge through interactions between ensembles of neurons that have a fundamental inhibitory motif: competitive inhibition between reciprocally connected ensembles under modulation from feed-forward selective (dis)inhibition. Using this framework, we were able to simulate a variety of phenomena pertaining to the experimentally observed shifts in neural tuning across neurons, time, and stimulus history. Anchoring our approach in a variety of experimentally observed phenomena, we used computation modeling in two types of neural networks of vastly different levels of biophysical detail to test hypotheses on emergent dynamics and explore the robustness of underlying connectivity parameters. With a number of corollary predictions that can be tested in future in vivo studies, we show that ensemble priming via competitive inhibition under modulation from selective (dis)inhibition acts as a local mechanism for sensory context storage and that DD does not require specialized input from other brain areas---a novel theoretical paradigm that resolves previously confounding aspects of sensory encoding and predictive processing in the neocortex.

">Higher-order EEG microstate syntax and surrogate testing</a></h4>

              
                Higher-order syntax properties of EEG microstate sequences offer insight into the transition dynamics of functional brain networks. We here define higher-order syntax as microstate sequence properties that are not explained by the first-order transition matrix, and we postulate three requirements that surrogate data should fulfill to provide a null hypothesis for higher-order syntax tests. We then compare two general approaches to surrogate data generation that have been used in microstate research, (a) surrogates from a first-order Markov chain model, and, (b) surrogates obtained from sequence shuffling. There are two different ways of representing microstate sequences, and syntax analyses can be applied to both, continuous microstate sequences, where each time sample is assigned the nearest microstate cluster, or to jump sequences which record only non-identical transitions by removing adjacent duplicates. We show that jump sequences have at least first-order syntax properties, whereas continuous sequences allow for zero-order and first-order surrogates. Markov chain generated surrogates fulfill the three requirements, i.e. they preserve the microstate distribution and transition matrix, and have no higher-order properties. Jump sequence shuffling, on the other hand, yields first-order surrogates whose first-order parameters are markedly different from the original sequence. Using a large open-access resting-state EEG dataset we show that jump sequence shuffling almost certainly produces microstate word probabilities that are significantly different from first-order expected word frequencies, erroneously indicating higher-order syntax properties. Markov chain surrogates reproduce the expected word probabilities of first-order sequences and correctly reject higher-order syntax properties in these cases. We conclude that jump sequence shuffling does not produce adequate surrogates for higher-order syntax investigations. The proposed Markov chain generative method for surrogate data synthesis is computationally efficient and allows the generation of surrogate sequences of arbitrary length, whereas shuffling can lead to sequences that are shorter than the original sequence and have variable length. Sample code in Python and MATLAB is provided.

">Coordination of distinct sources of excitatory inputs enhances motion selectivity in the mouse visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sources innervate the visual thalamus to influence image-forming vision prior to the cortex, yet it remains unclear how non-retinal and retinal input coordinate to shape thalamic visual selectivity. Using dual-color two-photon calcium imaging in the thalamus of awake mice, we observed similar coarse-scale retinotopic organization between axons of superior colliculus neurons and retinal ganglion cells, both providing strong converging excitatory input to thalamic neurons. At a fine scale of ~10 m, collicular boutons often shared visual feature preferences with nearby retinal boutons. Inhibiting collicular input significantly suppressed visual responses in thalamic neurons and specifically reduced motion selectivity in neurons preferring nasal-to-temporal motion. The reduction in motion selectivity could be the result of silencing sharply tuned direction-selective colliculogeniculate input. These findings suggest that the thalamus is not merely a relay but selectively integrates inputs from multiple regions to build stimulus selectivity and shape the information transmitted to the cortex.

	<p>Acute vertigo or dizziness is a frequent presentation to the emergency department (ED), making up between 2.1% and 4.4% of all consultations. Given the nature of the ED where the priority is triage, diagnostic delays and misdiagnoses are common, with as many as a third of vertebrobasilar strokes presenting with acute vertigo or dizziness being missed. Here, we review diagnostic errors identified in the evaluation and treatment of the acutely dizzy patient and discuss strategies to overcome them. Lessons learned include focusing on structured history taking, asking about timing and triggers to inform a targeted examination, assessing subtle ocular motor findings (e.g., by use of HINTS(+)), and avoiding overreliance on brain imaging (including early magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted sequences [DWI-MRI]). Importantly, up to 20% of DWI-MRI may be false negatives if obtained within the first 24&amp;amp;ndash;48 h after symptom onset. Likewise, overreliance on focal neurologic findings to confirm a stroke diagnosis should be avoided because isolated dizziness, vertigo, or even unsteadiness may be the only symptoms in some patients with vertebrobasilar stroke. Furthermore, in patients with triggered episodic vestibular symptoms provocation maneuvers should be preferred over HINTS(+), and a potential diagnosis of stroke should not be immediately dismissed in younger patients presenting with a headache (where migraine may be more common), but the possibility of a vertebral artery dissection should be further evaluated. Importantly, moderate training of non-experts allows for significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy in the acutely dizzy patient and thus should be prioritized.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: A neurobiological framework of bi- or multilingual neurocognitive development must consider the following: (i) longitudinal behavioral and neural measures; (ii) brain developmental constraints across structure and function; and (iii) the development of global multilingual competence in a homogeneous social environment. In this study, we investigated whether multilingual competence yields early changes in executive attention control mechanisms and their underlying neural structures in the frontal&amp;amp;ndash;striatal system, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplemental area and the left caudate. Methods: We employed longitudinal neuroimaging and functional connectivity methods in a small group of multilingual children over two years. Results: We found that the dACC/preSMA is functionally influenced by changes in multilingual competence but not yet structurally adapted, while the left caudate, in a developmental stage, is influenced, adapts, and specializes due to multilingual experience. Furthermore, increases in multilingual competence strengthen connections between the dACC/preSMA, left caudate, and other structures of the cognitive control network, such as the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. Conclusions: These findings suggest that multilingual competence impacts brain &amp;amp;ldquo;adaptation&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;specialization&amp;amp;rdquo; during childhood. The results may provide insights and guide future research on experience-expectant and experience-dependent brain plasticity to explain the &amp;amp;ldquo;interaction&amp;amp;rdquo; between multilingualism and neurodevelopment.</p>

                <p>Status epilepticus (SE) links to high mortality and morbidity. Considering the neuroprotective property of baicalein (BA), we investigated its effects on post-SE neuronal injury via the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. Mice were subjected to SE modeling and BA interference, with seizure severity and learning and memory abilities evaluated. The histological changes, neurological injury and neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-positive cell number in hippocampal CA1 region, and cell death were assessed. Levels of the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)/gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pathway-related proteins, inflammatory factors, and Iba-1 + NLRP3+ and Iba-1 + GSDMD-N+ cells were determined. BA ameliorated post-SE cognitive dysfunction and neuronal injury in mice, as evidenced by shortened escape latency, increased number of crossing the target quadrant within 60&nbsp;s and the time staying in the target quadrant, alleviated hippocampal damage, increased viable cell number, decreased neuronal injury, and increased NSE-positive cells. Mechanistically, BA repressed microglial pyroptosis, reduced inflammatory factor release, and attenuated neuronal injury by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. The NLRP3 inhibitor exerted similar effects as BA on SE mice, while the NLRP3 activator partially reversed BA-improved post-SE neuronal injury in mice. Conjointly, BA reduced microglial pyroptosis in hippocampal CA1 area by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway, thereby ameliorating post-SE neuronal injury in mice.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A major obstacle in understanding the relationship between diet and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) lies in the subjectivity and the bias in traditional dietary intake assessment methods. Food diaries, 24-hour food recall interviews, and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) result in under- and over-reporting of nutrient and energy intake, compromising the accuracy of studies linking diet to NCDs. The emergence of image classification technology has facilitated a new approach to dietary intake assessment which addresses the subjective limitations associated with traditional self-reporting methods. Furthermore, a need to integrate multi-omics and advanced health analyses to comprehensively characterise NCD risk presents an opportunity to combine a range of technologies to better understand diet-induced NCD. Method This observational study will adopt an enhanced surveillance method, whereby we will utilise wearable cameras and activity monitors to record dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep. Participants will wear these for 3 separate one-week periods at home (with a 2 and 3-week break in between each period). At the end of each monitoring period, participants will attend a study visit at the clinical research facility, where they will undergo body composition assessments, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and autonomic nervous system health analysis using state-of-the-art technologies that measure Advanced Glycation End products (AGE) and accelerated photoplethysmography (APG). At the end of the first and last monitoring period, participants will also provide blood, urine, stool, and breath samples, and an in-depth interview will also be conducted during the final visit to assess participants’ perceptions towards the novel technologies. The study parameters will be integrated to advance our insights into how diet intricately influences the mechanisms underlying NCDs.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Additionally, advancements in long-read RNA sequencing are expected to drive the evolution of differential splicing tools, reducing the need for isoform deconvolution and prompting further innovation.

                <p>by José María Salazar Campos, Lena F. Burbulla, Sarah Jäkel</p>

The major pathological feature of Parkinson ‘s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease and most common movement disorder, is the predominant degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a part of the midbrain. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms of the origin of the disease remain unknown. While the disease was initially viewed as a purely neuronal disorder, results from single-cell transcriptomics have suggested that oligodendrocytes may play an important role in the early stages of Parkinson’s. Although these findings are of high relevance, particularly to the search for effective disease-modifying therapies, the actual functional role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson’s disease remains highly speculative and requires a concerted scientific effort to be better understood. This Unsolved Mystery discusses the limited understanding of oligodendrocytes in PD, highlighting unresolved questions regarding functional changes in oligodendroglia, the role of myelin in nigral dopaminergic neurons, the impact of the toxic environment, and the aggregation of alpha-synuclein within oligodendrocytes.

                <p>by Jeff Maltas, Anh Huynh, Kevin B. Wood</p>

As failure rates for traditional antimicrobial therapies escalate, recent focus has shifted to evolution-based therapies to slow resistance. Collateral sensitivity—the increased susceptibility to one drug associated with evolved resistance to a different drug—offers a potentially exploitable evolutionary constraint, but the manner in which collateral effects emerge over time is not well understood. Here, we use laboratory evolution in the opportunistic pathogen <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> to phenotypically characterize collateral profiles through evolutionary time. Specifically, we measure collateral profiles for 400 strain-antibiotic combinations over the course of 4 evolutionary time points as strains are selected in increasing concentrations of antibiotic. We find that at a global level—when results from all drugs are combined—collateral resistance dominates during early phases of adaptation, when resistance to the selecting drug is lower, while collateral sensitivity becomes increasingly likely with further selection. At the level of individual populations; however, the trends are idiosyncratic; for example, the frequency of collateral sensitivity to ceftriaxone increases over time in isolates selected by linezolid but decreases in isolates selected by ciprofloxacin. We then show experimentally how dynamic collateral sensitivity relationships can lead to time-dependent dosing windows that depend on finely timed switching between drugs. Finally, we develop a stochastic mathematical model based on a Markov decision process consistent with observed dynamic collateral profiles to show measurements across time are required to optimally constrain antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947">Cortical direction selectivity increases from the input to the output layers of visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weifeng Dai, Tian Wang, Yang Li, Yi Yang, Yange Zhang, Yujie Wu, Tingting Zhou, Hongbo Yu, Liang Li, Yizheng Wang, Gang Wang, Dajun Xing</p>

Sensitivity to motion direction is a feature of visual neurons that is essential for motion perception. Recent studies have suggested that direction selectivity is re-established at multiple stages throughout the visual hierarchy, which contradicts the traditional assumption that direction selectivity in later stages largely derives from that in earlier stages. By recording laminar responses in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats of both sexes, we aimed to understand how direction selectivity is processed and relayed across 2 successive stages: the input layers and the output layers within the early visual cortices. We found a strong relationship between the strength of direction selectivity in the output layers and the input layers, as well as the preservation of preferred directions across the input and output layers. Moreover, direction selectivity was enhanced in the output layers compared to the input layers, with the response strength maintained in the preferred direction but reduced in other directions and under blank stimuli. We identified a direction-tuned gain mechanism for interlaminar signal transmission, which likely originated from both feedforward connections across the input and output layers and recurrent connections within the output layers. This direction-tuned gain, coupled with nonlinearity, contributed to the enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers. Our findings suggest that direction selectivity in later cortical stages partially inherits characteristics from earlier cortical stages and is further refined by intracortical connections.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Interneurons (INs) play a crucial role in the regulation of neural activity within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region critically involved in executive functions and behavioral control. In recent preclinical studies, dysregulation of INs in the mPFC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of substance use disorder, characterized by vulnerability to chronic drug use. Here, we explore the diversity of mPFC INs and their connectivity and roles in vulnerability to addiction. We also discuss how these INs change over time with drug exposure. Finally, we focus on noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic approach for targeting INs in substance use disorder, highlighting its potential to restore neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-46/v1?src=rss">Fluimucil as a neuroprotective, is there anything new? Bibliometric study from 1996 to 2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Fluimucil, also known as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been used as a medicinal drug for treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Recent research has shown NAC’s potential as a neuroprotective agent, preventing oxidative damage and promoting neurodegenerative treatment. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of articles related to NAC use, identifying research trends, current trends, and correlations between research and institutions. The findings can help identify unpublished research and guide future research strategies. This research not only provides public interest in NAC research but also offers valuable insights for future research. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords fluimucil, nac, n-acetylcystein, and neuroprotective. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are Documents by Year, Documents by Author, Documents by Affiliations, Documents by country or territory, Documents by funding sponsor, Factorial Map Of The Documents With The Highest Contributes, Documents by Subject Area, Network Visualization, Overlay visualization of scopus database using Vosviewer, Density Visualization, Thematic Map, and Qualitative Analysis. Conclusions Research on the neuroprotective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or fluimucil has several limitations and strengths. It uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify research trends and mechanisms of NAC action. However, the data may be biased and the methodology may differ. The study has significant potential for future research, particularly in treating neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson and Alzheimer. It also contributes to the understanding of NAC mechanisms.

                Background Cervical spondylosis is the common degenerative disease of the vertebrae in adults which can lead to change in sagittal alignment of cervical spine. Radiograph and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used imaging modalities for measuring the sagittal parameters. However sagittal parameters measured using radiograph and MRI can be influence by patient positioning and imaging technique. The study aims to compare sagittal parameters measured using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and radiograph in cervical spondylosis patients. Methods The study was done retrospectively. 77 patients who underwent both MRI and radiograph were included in the study. The sagittal parameters such as Neck Tilt (NT), T1 slope (T1S), thoracic inlet angle (TIA), C2-C7 angle (C2-C7A) and C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (C2-C7 SVA) were measured on sagittal MRI and lateral cervical spine radiograph. Paired t-test was used to compare cervical sagittal measurements between MRI and radiography. Results The cervical sagittal parameters such as NT, T1S, TIA and C2-7 SVA showed significant difference between MRI and radiograph (p < 0.05). But C2-C7A did not show significant difference (p > 0.05) Conclusion The study concludes that MRI cannot be used as an alternative to cervical spine radiograph in spondylosis patient for measuring the sagittal balance as there was significant difference between sagittal parameters except C2-C7 A.

                The role of posture in spinal pain is unclear which might be linked to characteristics of postural outcome measures. This systematic scoping review mapped the clinical utility of postural outcome tools for spinal pain. Following Joanna Briggs Institute framework, twelve bibliographic databases were searched until 8th August 2023. Article selection, characterisation/mapping and synthesis using qualitative content analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. Clinical utility was defined by psychometric and clinimetric criteria. 85 eligible studies were identified from 89 publications. Twenty-eight distinct postural outcome tools plus bespoke measures were identified. Most tools were sophisticated computer-based electronic devices or complex time-consuming questionnaires, with limited applicability in non-occupational settings. Clinical utility domains most achieved were construct validity and inter/intra-rater reliability. Tools being underpinned by the biopsychosocial model of pain, sensitivity to clinical change, and predictive validity were the least achieved. Tools had limited clinical utility and were based on postural-structural-biomechanical pain model.

                Objectives Infectious diseases present significant challenges to global health security in contemporary, interconnected global environments. This study aimed to evaluate and compare health security performance in Western Asia (WA), with a focus on income group-based disparities and region-specific insights. Methods This study utilized the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) to assess health security across 17 WA countries categorized by income level. Health security indicators for 2019 and 2021 were analyzed using the D-CRITIC method to determine the relative importance of each indicator (Global Health Security Index, 2021): https://ghsindex.org/report-model/). A combined D-CRITIC-CoCoSo framework was employed to rank the countries, followed by K-means clustering for grading. The study also investigated correlations between financial allocation’s indicators and health security outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation. A comparative analysis elucidated regional disparities across income categories. Results This study highlights WA’s progress in health security by prioritizing foundational health systems, detection/reporting, rapid response, and risk management. From 2019 to 2021, priorities varied by income group, with high-income countries focusing on detection, upper-middle-income countries focusing on risk environments, and low-income countries focusing on prevention. While some nations demonstrated improvement, others, such as Armenia, experienced decline, revealing persistent vulnerabilities. This study revealed significant variability in health security capacity, with both progress and setbacks among countries in different clusters. High- and upper-middle-income countries, such as Qatar and Georgia, leverage investments and international partnerships to improve their rankings, while conflict-affected, low-resource countries, including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, face stagnation or decline. Strong correlations were observed between financial resource allocation indicators and health performance. Higher investments in countries like Armenia and Georgia led to significantly improved health outcomes, while minimal spending in Syria and Yemen weakened their resilience to health threats. Conclusion Disparities in health resilience persist, underscoring the need for equitable resource allocation and regional cooperation to enhance public health security.

                Background It is uncommon to develop vision-threatening orbital cellulitis with panophthalmitis during pregnancy. Typically, the reasons are trauma-related or endogenous. It requires immediate diagnosis and treatment, but this has proven difficult because of local and systemic medications’ safety and adverse effects during pregnancy. Globe salvage has a poor prognosis, with most patients undergoing enucleation or evisceration of the diseased eye. Case presentation We presented a 22-year-old woman in her third trimester of pregnancy who encountered orbital cellulitis with panophthalmitis caused by methicillin-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Despite rigorous intravenous and topical antibiotics, she underwent evisceration of the affected eye. However, the pregnancy, progressed without incident, with the delivery of a healthy baby at full-term. Conclusion Bacterial infection is uncommon during pregnancy, but may cause endogenous panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis, especially in immunosuppression and anemia, with a poor visual outcome.

                Background Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited countries relies primarily on bacteriological confirmation using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain on sputum or other representative samples. However, this method has low sensitivity due to suboptimal sampling and techniques. While AFB culture remains a gold standard for diagnosing TB and other mycobacterial infections, its limitations include slow turnaround time, and the requirement for specialized resources and expertise. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes are crucial in the pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation and immune reactions. We investigated the usefulness of the haematological parameters and their ratios, like the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratio (MLR), for diagnosing tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively grouped 114 patients with fever into those diagnosed with TB and control groups. We obtained their haematological data and calculated their derived ratios. The ratios obtained from the two groups were compared. Their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results Haematological parameters like MLR were higher in TB patients than in the control group. Although NLR was not significantly increased, MLR was significantly increased with p values <0.05. These tests had low sensitivity but high specificity. Conclusion Serum NLR and MLR emerge as valuable tools in TB diagnosis. Their simplicity and cost-effectiveness render them particularly suitable for screening and recurrence monitoring in rural and remote settings, thereby mitigating loss to follow-up.

                <p>Transient focal neurological episodes (TFNE), often associated with convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH), are common in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), but their pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. In six patients with unremitting TFNE, using high-resolution post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and vessel wall imaging (VWI), we found various combinations of transient leptomeningeal, parenchymal and vessel wall enhancement; in 5 of 6 the enhancement included regions corresponding anatomically to symptoms. Three patients had resolution of TFNE and enhancement (2 with corticosteroid treatment, 1 without). Our observations suggest that inflammation might contribute to the pathophysiology of CAA-related TFNE and cSAH, with potential wider relevance for the associated high risks of recurrent ICH in CAA more generally.

                Aging is inevitable. While healthy aging is the goal, old age is frequently accompanied by disheartening effects on physical function, cognition, and overall well-being. Additionally, while the causes of disease are multifactorial and dizzyingly complex, they tend to converge on a single, common, major risk factor: old age. As such, targeting aging itself (as opposed to only targeting disease pathophysiology once it emerges) should help delay the onset and progression of many disease states, including neurodegenerative diseases.

                Khalatyan et al. show that poxvirus protein synthesis becomes dependent on 40S and 60S subunit proteins that are normally dispensable for most cellular mRNAs. RACK1 facilitates ribosome customization through alterations in the 40S head swivel, while non-canonical late viral mRNA translation becomes more dependent on RPLP2, a subunit of the enigmatic P-stalk.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87522">Sibling similarity can reveal key insights into genetic architecture</a></h4>

              
                The use of siblings to infer the factors influencing complex traits has been a cornerstone of quantitative genetics. Here, we utilise siblings for a novel application: the inference of genetic architecture, specifically that relating to individuals with extreme trait values (e.g. in the top 1%). Inferring the genetic architecture most relevant to this group of individuals is important because they are at the greatest risk of disease and may be more likely to harbour rare variants of large effect due to natural selection. We develop a theoretical framework that derives expected distributions of sibling trait values based on an index sibling’s trait value, estimated trait heritability, and null assumptions that include infinitesimal genetic effects and environmental factors that are either controlled for or have combined Gaussian effects. This framework is then used to develop statistical tests powered to distinguish between trait tails characterised by common polygenic architecture from those that include substantial enrichments of de novo or rare variant (Mendelian) architecture. We apply our tests to UK Biobank data here, although we note that they can be used to infer genetic architecture in any cohort or health registry that includes siblings and their trait values, since these tests do not use genetic data. We describe how our approach has the potential to help disentangle the genetic and environmental causes of extreme trait values, and to improve the design and power of future sequencing studies to detect rare variants.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104759">Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) genome provides new insights into convergent evolution of caffeine biosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                Yerba mate (YM, <i>Ilex paraguariensis</i>) is an economically important crop marketed for the elaboration of mate, the third-most widely consumed caffeine-containing infusion worldwide. Here, we report the first genome assembly of this species, which has a total length of 1.06 Gb and contains 53,390 protein-coding genes. Comparative analyses revealed that the large YM genome size is partly due to a whole-genome duplication (Ip-α) during the early evolutionary history of <i>Ilex</i>, in addition to the hexaploidization event (γ) shared by core eudicots. Characterization of the genome allowed us to clone the genes encoding methyltransferase enzymes that catalyse multiple reactions required for caffeine production. To our surprise, this species has converged upon a different biochemical pathway compared to that of coffee and tea. In order to gain insight into the structural basis for the convergent enzyme activities, we obtained a crystal structure for the terminal enzyme in the pathway that forms caffeine. The structure reveals that convergent solutions have evolved for substrate positioning because different amino acid residues facilitate a different substrate orientation such that efficient methylation occurs in the independently evolved enzymes in YM and coffee. While our results show phylogenomic constraint limits the genes coopted for convergence of caffeine biosynthesis, the X-ray diffraction data suggest structural constraints are minimal for the convergent evolution of individual reactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95944">Psychological stress disturbs bone metabolism via miR-335-3p/Fos signaling in osteoclast</a></h4>

              
                It has been well validated that chronic psychological stress leads to bone loss, but the underlying mechanism remains unclarified. In this study, we established and analyzed the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice to investigate the miRNA-related pathogenic mechanism involved in psychological stress-induced osteoporosis. Our result found that these CUMS mice exhibited osteoporosis phenotype that is mainly attributed to the abnormal activities of osteoclasts. Subsequently, miRNA sequencing and other analysis showed that miR-335-3p, which is normally highly expressed in the brain, was significantly downregulated in the nucleus ambiguous, serum, and bone of the CUMS mice. Additionally, in vitro studies detected that miR-335-3p is important for osteoclast differentiation, with its direct targeting site in <i>Fos</i>. Further studies demonstrated FOS was upregulated in CUMS osteoclast, and the inhibition of FOS suppressed the accelerated osteoclastic differentiation, as well as the expression of osteoclastic genes, such as <i>Nfatc1, Acp5,</i> and <i>Mmp9</i>, in miR-335-3p-restrained osteoclasts. In conclusion, this work indicated that psychological stress may downregulate the miR-335-3p expression, which resulted in the accumulation of FOS and the upregulation of NFACT1 signaling pathway in osteoclasts, leading to its accelerated differentiation and abnormal activity. These results decipher a previously unrecognized paradigm that miRNA can act as a link between psychological stress and bone metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93413">Atlas of Fshr expression from novel reporter mice</a></h4>

              
                The FSH-FSHR pathway has been considered an essential regulator in reproductive development and fertility. But there has been emerging evidence of FSHR expression in extragonadal organs. This poses new questions and long-term debates regarding the physiological role of the FSH-FSHR, and underscores the need for reliable, in vivo analysis of FSHR expression in animal models. However, conventional methods have proven insufficient for examining FSHR expression due to several limitations. To address this challenge, we developed Fshr-ZsGreen reporter mice under the control of Fshr endogenous promoter using CRISPR-Cas9. With this novel genetic tool, we provide a reliable readout of Fshr expression at single-cell resolution level in vivo and in real time. Reporter animals were also subjected to additional analyses,to define the accurate expression profile of FSHR in gonadal and extragonadal organs/tissues. Our compelling results not only demonstrated Fshr expression in intragonadal tissues but also, strikingly, unveiled notably increased expression in Leydig cells, osteoblast lineage cells, endothelial cells in vascular structures, and epithelial cells in bronchi of the lung and renal tubes. The genetic decoding of the widespread pattern of Fshr expression highlights its physiological relevance beyond reproduction and fertility, and opens new avenues for therapeutic options for age-related disorders of the bones, lungs, kidneys, and hearts, among other tissues. Exploiting the power of the Fshr knockin reporter animals, this report provides the first comprehensive genetic record of the spatial distribution of FSHR expression, correcting a long-term misconception about Fshr expression and offering prospects for extensive exploration of FSH-FSHR biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100708">Complement 3a receptor 1 on macrophages and Kupffer cells is not required for the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease</a></h4>

              
                Together with obesity and type 2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing global epidemic. Activation of the complement system and infiltration of macrophages has been linked to progression of metabolic liver disease. The role of complement receptors in macrophage activation and recruitment in MASLD remains poorly understood. In human and mouse, <i>C3AR1</i> in the liver is expressed primarily in Kupffer cells, but is downregulated in humans with MASLD compared to obese controls. To test the role of complement 3a receptor (C3aR1) on macrophages and liver resident macrophages in MASLD, we generated mice deficient in C3aR1 on all macrophages (C3aR1-MφKO) or specifically in liver Kupffer cells (C3aR1-KpKO) and subjected them to a model of metabolic steatotic liver disease. We show that macrophages account for the vast majority of <i>C3ar1</i> expression in the liver. Overall, C3aR1-MφKO and C3aR1-KpKO mice have similar body weight gain without significant alterations in glucose homeostasis, hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, compared to controls on a MASLD-inducing diet. This study demonstrates that C3aR1 deletion in macrophages or Kupffer cells, the predominant liver cell type expressing <i>C3ar1</i>, has no significant effect on liver steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis in a dietary MASLD model.

                Calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 (CIB2) and CIB3 bind to transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) and TMC2, the pore-forming subunits of the inner-ear mechano-electrical transduction (MET) apparatus. These interactions have been proposed to be functionally relevant across mechanosensory organs and vertebrate species. Here, we show that both CIB2 and CIB3 can form heteromeric complexes with TMC1 and TMC2 and are integral for MET function in mouse cochlea and vestibular end organs as well as in zebrafish inner ear and lateral line. Our AlphaFold 2 models suggest that vertebrate CIB proteins can simultaneously interact with at least two cytoplasmic domains of TMC1 and TMC2 as validated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of TMC1 fragments interacting with CIB2 and CIB3. Molecular dynamics simulations of TMC1/2 complexes with CIB2/3 predict that TMCs are structurally stabilized by CIB proteins to form cation channels. Overall, our work demonstrates that intact CIB2/3 and TMC1/2 complexes are integral to hair-cell MET function in vertebrate mechanosensory epithelia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98661">Interneuron FGF13 regulates seizure susceptibility via a sodium channel-independent mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a class of devastating neurological disorders characterized by recurrent seizures and exacerbated by disruptions to excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, are commonly caused by mutations in ion channels. Disruption of, or variants in, <i>FGF13</i> were implicated as causal for a set of DEEs, but the underlying mechanisms were clouded because <i>FGF13</i> is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, <i>FGF13</i> undergoes extensive alternative splicing producing multiple isoforms with distinct functions, and the overall roles of FGF13 in neurons are incompletely cataloged. To overcome these challenges, we generated a set of novel cell-type-specific conditional knockout mice. Interneuron-targeted deletion of <i>Fgf13</i> led to perinatal mortality associated with extensive seizures and impaired the hippocampal inhibitory/excitatory balance while excitatory neuron-targeted deletion of <i>Fgf13</i> caused no detectable seizures and no survival deficits. While best studied as a voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>v</sub>) regulator, we observed no effect of <i>Fgf13</i> ablation in interneurons on Na<sub>v</sub>s but rather a marked reduction in K<sup>+</sup> channel currents. Re-expressing different <i>Fgf13</i> splice isoforms could partially rescue deficits in interneuron excitability and restore K<sup>+</sup> channel current amplitude. These results enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of <i>Fgf13-</i>related seizures and expand our understanding of FGF13 functions in different neuron subsets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92491">High-throughput tracking enables systematic phenotyping and drug repurposing in C. elegans disease models</a></h4>

              
                There are thousands of Mendelian diseases with more being discovered weekly and the majority have no approved treatments. To address this need, we require scalable approaches that are relatively inexpensive compared to traditional drug development. In the absence of a validated drug target, phenotypic screening in model organisms provides a route for identifying candidate treatments. Success requires a screenable phenotype. However, the right phenotype and assay may not be obvious for pleiotropic neuromuscular disorders. Here, we show that high-throughput imaging and quantitative phenotyping can be conducted systematically on a panel of <i>C. elegans</i> disease model strains. We used CRISPR genome-editing to create 25 worm models of human Mendelian diseases and phenotyped them using a single standardised assay. All but two strains were significantly different from wild-type controls in at least one feature. The observed phenotypes were diverse, but mutations of genes predicted to have related functions led to similar behavioural differences in worms. As a proof-of-concept, we performed a drug repurposing screen of an FDA-approved compound library, and identified two compounds that rescued the behavioural phenotype of a model of UNC80 deficiency. Our results show that a single assay to measure multiple phenotypes can be applied systematically to diverse Mendelian disease models. The relatively short time and low cost associated with creating and phenotyping multiple strains suggest that high-throughput worm tracking could provide a scalable approach to drug repurposing commensurate with the number of Mendelian diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93327">Neural evidence of functional compensation for fluid intelligence in healthy ageing</a></h4>

              
                Functional compensation is a common notion in the neuroscience of healthy ageing, whereby older adults are proposed to recruit additional brain activity to compensate for reduced cognitive function. However, whether this additional brain activity in older participants actually helps their cognitive performance remains debated. We examined brain activity and cognitive performance in a human lifespan sample (<i>N</i> = 223) while they performed a problem-solving task (based on Cattell’s test of fluid intelligence) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain univariate analysis revealed that activity in bilateral cuneal cortex for hard vs. easy problems increased both with age and with performance, even when adjusting for an estimate of age-related differences in cerebrovascular reactivity. Multivariate Bayesian decoding further demonstrated that age increased the likelihood that activation patterns in this cuneal region provided non-redundant information about the two task conditions, beyond that of the multiple demand network generally activated in this task. This constitutes some of the strongest evidence yet for functional compensation in healthy ageing, at least in this brain region during visual problem-solving.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100856">Multi-dimensional oscillatory activity of mouse GnRH neurons in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons represent the key output cells of the neural network controlling mammalian fertility. We used GCaMP fiber photometry to record the population activity of the GnRH neuron distal projections in the ventral arcuate nucleus where they merge before entering the median eminence to release GnRH into the portal vasculature. Recordings in freely behaving intact male and female mice revealed abrupt ~8 min duration increases in activity that correlated perfectly with the appearance of a subsequent pulse of luteinizing hormone (LH). The GnRH neuron dendrons also exhibited a low level of unchanging clustered, rapidly fluctuating baseline activity in males and throughout the estrous cycle in females. In female mice, a gradual increase in basal activity that exhibited ~80 min oscillations began in the afternoon of proestrus and lasted for 12 hr. This was associated with the onset of the LH surge that ended several hours before the fall in the GCaMP signal. Abrupt 8 min duration episodes of GCaMP activity continued to occur on top of the rising surge baseline before ceasing in estrus. These observations provide the first description of GnRH neuron activity in freely behaving animals. They demonstrate that three distinct patterns of oscillatory activity occur in GnRH neurons. These are comprised of low-level rapid baseline activity, abrupt 8 min duration oscillations that drive pulsatile gonadotropin secretion, and, in females, a gradual and very prolonged oscillating increase in activity responsible for the preovulatory LH surge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99904">Wavenumber-dependent transmission of subthreshold waves on electrical synapses network model of Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Recent experimental studies showed that electrically coupled neural networks like in mammalian inferior olive nucleus generate synchronized rhythmic activity by the subthreshold sinusoidal-like oscillations of the membrane voltage. Understanding the basic mechanism and its implication of such phenomena in the nervous system bears fundamental importance and requires preemptively the connectome information of a given nervous system. Inspired by these necessities of developing a theoretical and computational model to this end and, however, in the absence of connectome information for the inferior olive nucleus, here we investigated interference phenomena of the subthreshold oscillations in the reference system <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> for which the structural anatomical connectome was completely known recently. We evaluated how strongly the sinusoidal wave was transmitted between arbitrary two cells in the model network. The region of cell-pairs that are good at transmitting waves changed according to the wavenumber of the wave, for which we named a wavenumber-dependent transmission map. Also, we unraveled that (1) the transmission of all cell-pairs disappeared beyond a threshold wavenumber, (2) long distance and regular patterned transmission existed in the body-wall muscles part of the model network, and (3) major hub cell-pairs of the transmission were identified for many wavenumber conditions. A theoretical and computational model presented in this study provided fundamental insight for understanding how the multi-path constructive/destructive interference of the subthreshold oscillations propagating on electrically coupled neural networks could generate wavenumber-dependent synchronized rhythmic activity.

                The ever-increasing burden of psychiatric disorders and limitations of current treatments have fueled enormous interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Yet how psychedelics, such as psilocybin, produce lasting therapeutic effects is unclear. Using scRNA-sequencing we identify a type of deep layer near projecting neuron that is most robustly regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex of female mice 24h after psilocybin. We show that this cell-type specificity does not align with 5-HT2A receptor expression but is consistent with the integrated signaling via cell-type specific 5-HT receptor co-expression patterns. Cell-cell communication reveals that psilocybin also broadly suppresses GABAergic inhibition. Ultimately, psilocybin induces plasticity-related genes in subsets of excitatory neurons suggesting that psilocybin induces sustained increases in neuroplasticity in the mouse mPFC. Our findings point to L5/6NP neurons as a key mediator of psilocybin neuroplastic effects.

">The spinal premotor network driving scratching flexor and extensor alternation</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic motor behaviors are generated by neural networks termed central pattern generators (CPGs). Although locomotor CPGs have been extensively characterized, it remains unknown how the neuronal populations composing them interact to generate adaptive rhythms. We explored the non-linear cooperation dynamics among the three main populations of ipsilaterally projecting spinal CPG neurons - V1, V2a, V2b neurons - in scratch reflex rhythmogenesis. Ablation of all three neuronal subtypes reduced the oscillation frequency. Activation of excitatory V2a neurons enhanced the oscillation frequency, while activating inhibitory V1 neurons caused atonia. These findings required the development of a novel neuromechanical model that consists of flexor and extensor modules coupled via inhibition, in which rhythm in each module is generated by self-bursting excitatory populations and accelerated by intra-module inhibition. Inter-module inhibition coordinates the phases of flexor and extensor activity and slows the oscillations, while facilitation mechanisms in excitatory neurons explain the V2a activation-driven increase in frequency.

">Physiologically-relevant light exposure and light behaviour in Switzerland and Malaysia</a></h4>

              
                Light synchronises the internal clock with the external light-dark cycle. Keeping this alignment benefits health and prevents diseases. Quantifying light exposure is, therefore, vital for effective prevention. Since light exposure depends on photoperiod, culture, and behaviour, we investigated objective light exposure and individual light-related behaviour in Switzerland and Malaysia. In this observational field study, participants (N=39) wore a calibrated melanopic light logger at chest level for 30 consecutive days. At baseline and study end, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was assessed, and every 3 to 4 days, the Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA) was filled. Our pre-registered analyses reveal that participants in Switzerland experienced brighter days (+3.16 times the average mEDI) and spent more time (x1.9 times the duration) in daylight levels per hour of daylight, had ~1.5h later bright light exposure in the afternoon, and stayed over 1h longer in dim light conditions before bedtime. LEBA scores did not differ between Malaysia and Switzerland, and LEBA items were stable over time. LEBA items also correlated with objective light exposure variables in Switzerland but not Malaysia, with a medium effect size (range of absolute r=0.32-0.48). These results highlight cultural and geographical differences in light exposure. We showed that LEBA can be related to actual light exposure and is ecologically informative, but this varies by culture.

">Noise-induced hearing loss enhances Ca2+-dependent spontaneous bursting activity in lateralcochlear efferents</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages cochlear hair cells and triggers downstream changes in synaptic and electrical activity in multiple brain regions, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether or not noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system, a feedback pathway in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. We examined the effects of noise-induced hearing loss on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons. This spontaneous firing exhibits a characteristic burst pattern dependent on Ca2+ channels, and we therefore also examined the effects of noise-induced hearing loss on the function of these and other ion channels. The burst pattern was sustained by an interaction between inactivating Ca2+ currents contributed largely by L-type channels, and steady outward currents mediated by Ba2+-sensitive inwardly-rectifying and two-pore domain K+ channels. One week following exposure to loud broadband noise, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, likely as a result of an enhanced Ca2+ current. Additional effects of noise-induced hearing loss included alteration of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ currents and a small elevation of outward K+ currents. We propose that noise-induced hearing loss enhances efferent activity and may thus amplify the release of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (i.e., neuropeptides), potentially altering sensory coding within the damaged cochlea.

">Eye metrics are a marker of visual conscious awareness and neural processing in cerebral blindness</a></h4>

              
                Damage to the primary visual pathway can cause vision loss. Some cerebrally blind people retain degraded vision or sensations and can perform visually guided behaviors. These cases motivate investigation and debate on blind field conscious awareness and linked residual neural processing. A key challenge in this research is that subjective measures of blind field visual conscious awareness can be misleading. Alternatively, eye metrics, including pupil size and eye movements are promising objective markers of conscious awareness and brain activity. In this study, we examined stimulus-evoked changes in pupil size, blinking, and microsaccades in the sighted and blind field of cerebrally blind participants. Using standard analysis and innovative machine learning methods, our findings support that eye metrics can infer blind field conscious awareness, even when behavioral performance on a visual perception task indicated otherwise. Furthermore, these eye metrics were linked to blind field visual stimulus-evoked occipital cortical field potentials. These findings support recording eye metrics in cerebral blindness and highlight potential clinical applications, including tracking the recovery of conscious vision and visual neural processing.

">2-Deoxy-D-glucose chemical exchange-sensitive spin-lock MRI of cerebral glucose metabolism after stroke in the rat</a></h4>

              
                Rapid breakdown of cerebral glucose metabolism is a hallmark in stroke pathology. Metabolic activity delineates the penumbra from the infarct core, representing tissue that is potentially salvageable by therapeutic interventions. Tools to image dynamics of glucose and its spatial distribution could provide biomarkers of disease severity and of the success of therapeutic interventions. Here, we developed a new protocol to measure glucose metabolism in a rat model of stroke using chemical exchange-sensitive spin-lock (CESL) MRI of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG). We further implemented a protocol that combines 2DG-CESL-MRI with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and diffusion MRI. We found that 2DG-CESL-MRI provides a biomarker of disturbed glucose metabolism after stroke with high effect to noise ratios. This is the first study to investigate CESL MRI of 2DG in the context of metabolism imaging in rodent stroke.

">Modeling the acutely injured brain environment in vitro.</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge to study the regenerative potential of the injured brain is the limited access to this organ in vivo. To address this, we developed an innovative gliosis model that, although established in vitro, originates from a genuine injury in vivo. The model relies on reactive glia acquiring enhanced adhesion, facilitating their rapid adaptation to in vitro conditions, where it faithfully recapitulates key features of brain injury. These include a secretome associated with injury pathways, degenerative responses like neuronal death and neuroinflammation, and regenerative processes such as progenitor proliferation, recruitment and commitment to oligodendrocytes. Moreover, the exposure of adult glial cells to this culture medium recapitulates their acquisition of multipotency observed in both mouse and human injured brains. Finally, our approach allows studying glia-to-neuron reprogramming, a process challenging to tackle in vivo. Consequently, we present a novel tool for exploring stem cell dynamics and regenerative behaviors in CNS pathology.

">Behavioral and neural sound classification: Insights from natural and synthetic sounds</a></h4>

              
                Throughout the course of a day, human listeners encounter an immense variety of sounds in their environment. These are quickly transformed into mental representations of objects and events that guide subsequent cognition and behavior in the world. Previous studies using behavioral and temporally resolved neuroimaging methods have demonstrated the importance of certain acoustic qualities for distinguishing among different classes of sounds during the early time period following sound onset (noisiness, spectral envelope, spectrotemporal change over time, and change in fundamental frequency over time). However, this evidence is largely based on correlational studies of natural sounds. Thus, two additional behavioral (Experiment 1) and EEG (Experiment 2) studies further tested these results using a set of synthesized stimuli (interspersed among a new set of natural sounds) that explicitly manipulated previously identified acoustic dimensions. In addition to finding similar correlational results as previous work (using new natural stimuli and tasks), classification results for the synthesized acoustic feature manipulations reinforced the importance of aperiodicity, spectral envelope, spectral variability and fundamental frequency change for representations of superordinate sound-categories. Analyses of the synthesized stimuli suggest that aperiodicity is a particularly robust cue in distinguishing some categories and that speech is difficult to characterize within this framework (i.e., using these acoustic dimensions and synthetic feature manipulations). These results provide a deeper understanding of the neural and perceptual dynamics that support the recognition of behaviorally important categories of sound in the time windows soon after sound onset.

">Following the Robot's Lead: Predicting Human and Robot Movement from EEG in a Motor Learning HRI Task</a></h4>

              
                Human-robot interaction (HRI) offers unique opportunities to study the neuroscience of human motor control through controlled and reproducible sensory stimuli. In this study, we introduce an innovative neuroscience-HRI framework inspired by the Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task, that combines EEG with a task where a humanoid robot performs preprogrammed movement sequences that are mirrored by a human participant in real time. The use of a humanoid robot ensures precise and repeatable sensory-motor stimuli in the 3D peripersonal space of the participant, providing experimental conditions that may be challenging to replicate with traditional methods. Behavioral performance is assessed by measuring the temporal lag between human and robot movements, which decreases with training, reflecting motor sequence learning. Concurrently, EEG data from the human participant is analyzed to reveal neural correlates of learning and movement dynamics. Event-Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP) in theta, mu, and beta frequency bands demonstrate distinct patterns associated with rest, fixation, and movement. Furthermore, the ERSP changes over successive trials reflect the progression of sequence learning, highlighting the relationship between neural oscillations and motor learning. A Markov-Switching Linear Regression model further decodes EEG signals to predict movement parameters including both human and robot position and velocity in a time-resolved manner. Our findings highlight the potential of HRI as a robust platform for neuroscience research and underscore the value of EEG-based neural decoding in understanding motor sequence learning. This work suggests further advances for integrating robotics into neuroscience and rehabilitation research.

">Specificity Protein 1 is essential for the limb trajectory of ephrin-mediated spinal motor axons</a></h4>

              
                The precise organization of neural circuits requires highly specific axon guidance, facilitated by cell-surface guidance receptors on axonal growth cones that help neurons reach their target destinations. Despite a limited repertoire of known guidance receptors and ligands, neural systems achieve complex axonal networks, suggesting that additional regulatory mechanisms exist. One proposed strategy is the co-expression of ligands and their receptors on the same axons, allowing modulation of receptor responsiveness to guidance cues. To investigate this mechanism, we studied the spinal lateral motor column (LMC) motor neurons, which make a binary axon pathfinding decision toward limb targets. We hypothesized that specificity protein 1 (Sp1), a transcription factor, regulates ephrin expression in LMC neurons, thereby modulating receptor functions via cis-attenuation to ensure accurate axonal pathfinding. Our results show that Sp1 is indeed expressed in LMC neurons during critical axonal extension periods. Manipulating Sp1 activity disrupted LMC axon trajectory selection, and RNA-Seq analysis indicated that Sp1 regulates genes associated with axon guidance, including ephrins. We found that Sp1 knockdown affected ephrin/Eph cis-binding and trans-signaling, highlighting Sp1's role in controlling axonal projections through ephrin gene regulation. Additionally, coactivators p300 and CBP are essential for Sp1's regulatory function. These findings identify Sp1 as a key transcription factor in LMC neurons, essential for ephrin expression and ephrin/Eph-mediated axon guidance, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of neural circuit formation.

	<p>Background: Chronic postoperative pain (CPOP) is among the main consequences of surgical procedures, directly affecting the quality of life. Although many strategies have been used to treat this symptom, they are often ineffective. Thus, studies investigating CPOP-associated mechanisms may help to develop more effective treatment strategies. Therefore, the present study investigated the spinal participation of the transient potential receptor vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation during CPOP. Methods: In this study C57BL/6 male mice were used, and CPOP was induced by muscle retraction and incision. The nociceptive threshold was measured by the von Frey filament test. For pharmacological evaluation, TRPV1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors were administered intrathecally. TRPV1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting. Results: The results showed that CPOP increased TRPV1 and mTOR protein levels, and pretreatment with the specific inhibitors alleviated CPOP. In addition, pretreatment with the TRPV1 antagonist SB-366791 attenuated mTOR protein levels. Conclusions: The results suggest that TRPV1 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are involved in CPOP at the spinal level, and TRPV1 may activate mTOR during this process.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sustaining the human brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s hippocampus from atrophy throughout ageing is critical. Exercise is proven to be effective in promoting adaptive hippocampal plasticity, and the hippocampus has a bidirectional relationship with the physical environment. Therefore, this systematic review explores the effects of walking, a simple physical activity in the environment, on hippocampal formation volume changes for lifelong brain and cognitive health. Method: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies on humans published up to November 2022 examining hippocampal volume changes and walking. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale and ROBINS-I tool. A narrative synthesis explored walking factors associated with total, subregional, and hemisphere-specific hippocampal volume changes. Results: Overall, walking had positive effects on hippocampal volumes. Several studies found benefits of higher-intensity and greater amounts of walking for total hippocampal volume. The subiculum increased after low-intensity walking and nature exposure, while the parahippocampal gyrus benefited from vigorous intensity. The right hippocampus increased with spatial navigation during walking. No studies examined the effect of walking on the dentate gyrus. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights walking as a multifaceted variable that can lead to manifold adaptive hippocampal volume changes. These findings support the promotion of walking as a simple, effective strategy to enhance brain health and prevent cognitive decline, suggesting the design of physical environments with natural and biophilic characteristics and layouts with greater walkability and cognitive stimulation. Future research is encouraged to explore the hippocampal subregional changes instead of focusing on total hippocampal volume, since the hippocampal formation is multicompartmental and subfields respond differently to different walking-related variables.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: While most studies on the postoperative condition of patients with spinal cord tumors describe long-term outcomes, data are needed on immediate surgical outcomes demanding rehabilitation to make informed assessments for postoperative planning. The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting function and rehabilitative needs after intradural spinal tumor surgery. Methods: Eighty-five prospectively recruited patients underwent surgery for intradural intramedullary (ID-IM; n = 23) and extramedullary (ID-EM; n = 62) tumors. Neurological and functional status were assessed before surgery, after surgery, and at discharge using the modified McCormick scale (MMS), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale, Barthel index (BI), and the gait index (GI). Results: There were no significant predictors of early postoperative rehabilitation in the ID-IM group. In the ID-EM group, age, thoracic level, subtotal resection (STR), repeat surgery, and functional scale scores predicted the need for rehabilitation. In multivariable analysis, MMS (odds ratio (OR) 8.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.37&amp;amp;ndash;32.44) and STR (OR 13.00; 95%CI: 1.56&amp;amp;ndash;107.87) remained independent predictors of rehabilitation need (area under curve, 92%). Despite their younger age, most patients with ID-IM tumors, especially ependymomas, required rehabilitation but improved quickly (KPS, BI, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Among ID-EM tumors, meningiomas were characterized by poorer preoperative function and low gross total resection (GTR) rates, but did not deteriorate neurologically after surgery. Patients with schwannoma and ID-EM ependymomas achieved the highest GTR rate and had the best function both before and after surgery. Conclusions: These results may be useful for estimating early rehabilitation needs after intradural tumor surgery and counseling patients before surgery about the expected postoperative course.</p>

                Abstract Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when dealing with widespread metastatic disease.

                Background Better affordability of data plans and an increase in “budget” smartphones have resulted in an exponential rise in internet and smartphone users. The ease of access to sexually explicit material (SEM) coupled with adolescents’ impulsivity makes them prone to excessive SEM exposure and may affect the development of sexuality via the perceived realism of such content. This study was done to study the influence between problematic smartphone usage (PSU) and sexuality development among late adolescent boys. Methods One hundred and thirty-four adolescents aged 18-19 years, studying in a medical university, participated in this cross-sectional study. Smartphone Addiction Scale – short version (SAS-SV) to evaluate PSU and a content validated semi-structured proforma to evaluate gender identity, sexual orientation, sources of information on pubertal changes, and exposure to pornographic content was used. We expressed results as proportion and summary measures (Mean±SD), Chi-square test to find influence between PSU and adolescent sexuality development. Results We found a 45.5% prevalence of PSU. Among study participants, 88% were attracted to the opposite sex, 6% were attracted to the same-sex, and 6% were attracted to both sexes. Three per cent of participants liked wearing clothes of the opposite sex, 7.5% wanted to be members of the opposite sex, whereas 10.4% were not comfortable with their genitalia. They obtained information regarding pubertal changes from friends (85) and media (78). Many had exposure to pornographic content (90%), with the youngest being nine years old. Conclusion Nearly half of the late adolescents have PSU. Pornographic contents are accessed through Smartphones.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-40/v1?src=rss">A Questionnaire Dataset on Perceived Stress in Indian Higher Education Students during Emergency Remote Learning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sudden shift to Emergency Remote Learning, significantly impacting students’ mental health. This study visualizes and analyses various stressors contributing to stress levels among university students during Emergency Remote Learning and explores how different factors from environmental and instructional mediums contribute to their perceived stress. Method Data was collected through a cross-sectional survey using the Modified Perceived Stress Scale and an additional set of 20 Likert scale items on Emergency Remote Learning. One-sample t-tests were performed to assess the consistency of responses across questionnaire items, and correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between different stressors. Frequency distributions were also analyzed to capture the prevalence of stress levels across demographic, environmental, and instructional variables. Conclusion The study revealed that frequent thoughts about unaccomplished tasks were associated with high stress (14.12%). Other factors include feeling nervous and stressed, feeling things that are not going their way, and difficulties piling up significantly elevated stress levels. Items specific to Emergency Remote Learning revealed that a sudden shift to Remote Learning heavily influenced students’ mental well-being. Additionally, demographic analysis showed that students aged 21 experienced the highest stress levels. Living arrangements, internet connectivity, and the impact of COVID-19 on close affinities further contributed to stress. This study underscores the complexity of stress during Emergency Remote Learning. It emphasizes the need for institutions to address psychological and instructional factors to support students better during remote learning environments.

                <p>by Lucas Böttcher, Maria R. D’Orsogna, Tom Chou</p>

Gathering observational data for medical decision-making often involves uncertainties arising from both type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors. In this work, we develop a statistical model to study how medical decision-making can be improved by aggregating results from repeated diagnostic and screening tests. Our approach is relevant to not only clinical settings such as medical imaging, but also to public health, as highlighted by the need for rapid, cost-effective testing methods during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our model enables the development of testing protocols with an arbitrary number of tests, which can be customized to meet requirements for type I and type II errors. This allows us to adjust sensitivity and specificity according to application-specific needs. Additionally, we derive generalized Rogan–Gladen estimates of disease prevalence that account for an arbitrary number of tests with potentially different type I and type II errors. We also provide the corresponding uncertainty quantification.

                <p>by Diego Tec-Campos, Juan D. Tibocha-Bonilla, Celina Jiang, Anurag Passi, Deepan Thiruppathy, Cristal Zuñiga, Camila Posadas, Alejandro Zepeda, Karsten Zengler</p>

The denitrifying bacterium <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T, a common member of microbial communities in wastewater treatment facilities, can produce different compounds from a range of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In these different conditions, <i>Thauera</i> modifies its metabolism to produce different compounds that influence the microbial community. In particular, <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T produces different exopolysaccharides with floc-forming properties, impacting the physical disposition of wastewater consortia and the efficiency of nutrient assimilation by the microbial community. Under N-limiting conditions, <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T decreases its growth rate and accelerates the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate-related (PHA) compounds including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which plays a fundamental role as C and energy storage in this β-proteobacterium. However, the metabolic mechanisms employed by <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T to assimilate and catabolize many of the different C and N sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions remain unknown. Systems biology approaches such as genome-scale metabolic modeling have been successfully used to unveil complex metabolic mechanisms for various microorganisms. Here, we developed a comprehensive metabolic model (M-model) for <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T (<i>i</i>Thauera861), consisting of 1,744 metabolites, 2,384 reactions, and 861 genes. We validated the model experimentally using over 70 different C and N sources under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. <i>i</i>Thauera861 achieved a prediction accuracy of 95% for growth on various C and N sources and close to 85% for assimilation of aromatic compounds under denitrifying conditions. The M-model was subsequently deployed to determine the effects of substrates, oxygen presence, and the C:N ratio on the production of PHB and exopolysaccharides (EPS), showing the highest polymer yields are achieved with nucleotides and amino acids under aerobic conditions. This comprehensive M-model will help reveal the metabolic processes by which this ubiquitous species influences communities in wastewater treatment systems and natural environments.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012725">Prioritization of causal genes from genome-wide association studies by Bayesian data integration across loci</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zeinab Mousavi, Marios Arvanitis, ThuyVy Duong, Jennifer A. Brody, Alexis Battle, Nona Sotoodehnia, Ali Shojaie, Dan E. Arking, Joel S. Bader</p>

Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants, usually single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with human traits, including disease and disease risk. These variants (or causal variants in linkage disequilibrium with them) usually affect the regulation or function of a nearby gene. A GWAS locus can span many genes, however, and prioritizing which gene or genes in a locus are most likely to be causal remains a challenge. Better prioritization and prediction of causal genes could reveal disease mechanisms and suggest interventions.
Results: We describe a new Bayesian method, termed SigNet for significance networks, that combines information both within and across loci to identify the most likely causal gene at each locus. The SigNet method builds on existing methods that focus on individual loci with evidence from gene distance and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) by sharing information across loci using protein-protein and gene regulatory interaction network data. In an application to cardiac electrophysiology with 226 GWAS loci, only 46 (20%) have within-locus evidence from Mendelian genes, protein-coding changes, or colocalization with eQTL signals. At the remaining 180 loci lacking functional information, SigNet selects 56 genes other than the minimum distance gene, equal to 31% of the information-poor loci and 25% of the GWAS loci overall. Assessment by pathway enrichment demonstrates improved performance by SigNet. Review of individual loci shows literature evidence for genes selected by SigNet, including <i>PMP22</i> as a novel causal gene candidate.

                <p>by Asgeir Kobro-Flatmoen, Stig W. Omholt</p>

Numerous studies of the human brain supported by experimental results from rodent and cell models point to a central role for intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a rat model used to study AD, it was recently shown that in layer II neurons of the anteriolateral entorhinal cortex expressing high levels of the glycoprotein reelin (Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons), reelin and Aβ engage in a direct protein–protein interaction. If reelin functions as a sink for intracellular Aβ and if the binding to reelin makes Aβ physiologically inert, it implies that reelin can prevent the neuron from being exposed to the harmful effects typically associated with increased levels of oligomeric Aβ. Considering that reelin expression is extraordinarily high in Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons compared to most other cortical neurons, such a protective role appears to be very difficult to reconcile with the fact that this subset of ECLII neurons is clearly a major cradle for the onset of AD. Here, we show that this conundrum can be resolved if Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons have a higher maximum production capacity of Aβ than neurons expressing low levels of reelin, and we provide a rationale for why this difference has evolved.
