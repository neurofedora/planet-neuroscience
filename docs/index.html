                Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive malignancy usually described in the abdomen and pelvis of adolescent males but rarely in the chest. A 71-year-old male presented with chest pain and was found to have pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. He underwent pericardiocentesis and pericardial window. Pericardial fluid and cardiac biopsy results confirmed DSRCT. The patient received the P6 protocol with a good but brief response. He had multiple hospitalizations in the following months for pericardial fluid recollection. Repeat imaging showed mediastinal metastasis. He is currently undergoing second-line chemotherapy treatment. We describe a unique case of primary DSRCT invading the pericardium and myocardium and exhibiting extensive mediastinal metastasis. This is the fourth report of cardiac DSRCT in the literature.

	<p>The human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been traditionally associated with decision-making under risk. Neuroimaging studies of such decision-making processes have largely focused on patients with vmPFC lesions or pathological gambling behavior, leading to a relative paucity of work focusing on the structural variability of the vmPFC in healthy individuals. To address this, we developed a decision-making task that allowed healthy players to choose to participate in either low stakes or high-stakes gambling on a trial-by-trial basis, and computed a metric that indexes the propensity for engaging in gambles with greater potential payoffs. We leveraged voxel-based morphometric analyses to examine the association between prefrontal gray matter volume and individual differences in the propensity for seeking high-risk/high-reward situations. Our analyses showed that vmPFC gray matter volume was inversely correlated with an increased tendency for engaging in high-stakes gambling. These results converge with findings from functional neuroimaging and brain lesion studies of vmPFC, and further extend them to show that normative variability in brain structure could also underpin risk-taking behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Uniform and Isotropic Cytoskeletal Tiling Fills Dendritic Spines</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Dendritic spines are submicron, subcellular compartments whose shape is defined by actin filaments and associated proteins. Accurately mapping the cytoskeleton is a challenge, given the small size of its components. It remains unclear whether the actin-associated structures analyzed in dendritic spines of neurons <I>in vitro</I> apply to dendritic spines of intact, mature neurons <I>in situ.</I> Here, we combined advanced preparative methods with multitilt serial section electron microscopy (EM) tomography and computational analysis to reveal the full three-dimensional (3D) internal architecture of spines in the intact brains of male mice at nanometer resolution. We compared hippocampal (CA1) pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells in terms of the length distribution and connectivity of filaments, their branching-angles and absolute orientations, and the elementary loops formed by the network. Despite differences in shape and size across spines and between spine heads and necks, the internal organization was remarkably similar in both neuron types and largely homogeneous throughout the spine volume. In the tortuous mesh of highly branched and interconnected filaments, branches exhibited no preferred orientation except in the immediate vicinity of the cell membrane. We found that new filaments preferentially split off from the convex side of a bending filament, consistent with the behavior of Arp2/3-mediated branching of actin under mechanical deformation. Based on the quantitative analysis, the spine cytoskeleton is likely subject to considerable mechanical force <I>in situ</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Musical Meter Induces Interbrain Synchronization during Interpersonal Coordination</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Music induces people to coordinate with one another. Here, we conduct two experiments to examine the underlying mechanism of the interbrain synchronization (IBS) that is induced by interpersonal coordination when people are exposed to musical beat and meter. In experiment 1, brain signals at the frontal cortex were recorded simultaneously from two participants of a dyad by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, while each tapped their fingers to aural feedback from their partner (coordination task) or from themselves (independence task) with and without the musical meter. The results showed enhanced IBS at the left-middle frontal cortex in case of the coordination task with musical beat and meter. The IBS was significantly correlated with the participants performance in terms of coordination. In experiment 2, we further examined the IBS while the participants coordinated their behaviors in various metrical contexts, such as strong and weak meters (i.e., high/low loudness of acoustically accenting beats). The results showed that strong meters elicited higher IBS at the middle frontal cortex than weak meters. These findings reveal that the musical beat and meter can affect brain-to-brain coupling in action coordination between people, and provide insights into the interbrain mechanism underlying the effects of music on cooperation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Activity monitoring of stroke patients by physiotherapist and caregivers in a hospital setting [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Activity monitoring is a necessary technique to ensure stroke survivors’ activity levels in the hospital are within optimal levels as this is important for enhanced motor recovery. However, this could be time-consuming for healthcare professionals like physiotherapists. Activity monitoring by caregivers could be an alternate option. Therefore, our aim was to compare the activity monitoring of stroke survivors by caregivers and physiotherapists in a hospital setting. Methods: An observation study was carried out in the neuroscience ward in a tertiary care hospital among 17 stroke survivors. Physiotherapist and caregivers were instructed to use an activity log chart that was developed during previous research conducted by the same authors for observing the activities performed by the patients every 15 minutes from 8 AM to 5 PM. Data collected were analysed using Stata 15. Kappa statistics were carried out to determine the agreement of the observations between the two raters. Results: A total of 10 male and seven female caregivers of stroke survivors with a mean age of 40.11 ± 9.2 years participated in the study. A total of 272 observations of caregivers were in agreement with that of the physiotherapist. Inter-rater Kappa statistics showed 60% agreement between the physiotherapist and the caregivers, while the multi-rater Kappa for different time points did not show agreement (Kappa value <0.1). Conclusions: There was moderate agreement between the physiotherapist and caregiver for activity monitoring of stroke survivors. This suggests behavioural mapping by caregivers may be a potential alternative solution in healthcare settings.

                Background: Maternal mental status has been thought to be affected by the delivery modes. We examined the relation between delivery modes and the mental status of women who delivered at our institute in Japan. Methods: Data were collected from the medical charts of 643 primiparous women without a history of mental disorders who delivered singleton babies and underwent a 1-month postpartum check-up at our institute from September 2018 to June 2019. The maternal mental status was examined based on the scores of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Mother-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS). Results: The rate of high scores of the EPDS and the MIBS in women choosing elective cesarean section were higher than in women with vaginal delivery and emergency cesarean section. Conclusion: Mental health care may be necessary for women choosing elective cesarean section.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">iPiDA-GCN: Identification of piRNA-disease associations based on Graph Convolutional Network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jialu Hou, Hang Wei, Bin Liu</p>
Motivation <p>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a critical role in the progression of various diseases. Accurately identifying the associations between piRNAs and diseases is important for diagnosing and prognosticating diseases. Although some computational methods have been proposed to detect piRNA-disease associations, it is challenging for these methods to effectively capture nonlinear and complex relationships between piRNAs and diseases because of the limited training data and insufficient association representation.</p> Results <p>With the growth of piRNA-disease association data, it is possible to design a more complex machine learning method to solve this problem. In this study, we propose a computational method called iPiDA-GCN for piRNA-disease association identification based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The iPiDA-GCN predictor constructs the graphs based on piRNA sequence information, disease semantic information and known piRNA-disease associations. Two GCNs (Asso-GCN and Sim-GCN) are used to extract the features of both piRNAs and diseases by capturing the association patterns from piRNA-disease interaction network and two similarity networks. GCNs can capture complex network structure information from these networks, and learn discriminative features. Finally, the full connection networks and inner production are utilized as the output module to predict piRNA-disease association scores. Experimental results demonstrate that iPiDA-GCN achieves better performance than the other state-of-the-art methods, benefitted from the discriminative features extracted by Asso-GCN and Sim-GCN. The iPiDA-GCN predictor is able to detect new piRNA-disease associations to reveal the potential pathogenesis at the RNA level. The data and source code are available at http://bliulab.net/iPiDA-GCN/.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational modeling of color perception with biologically plausible spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hadar Cohen-Duwek, Hamutal Slovin, Elishai Ezra Tsur</p>

Biologically plausible computational modeling of visual perception has the potential to link high-level visual experiences to their underlying neurons’ spiking dynamic. In this work, we propose a neuromorphic (brain-inspired) Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-driven model for the reconstruction of colorful images from retinal inputs. We compared our results to experimentally obtained V1 neuronal activity maps in a macaque monkey using voltage-sensitive dye imaging and used the model to demonstrate and critically explore color constancy, color assimilation, and ambiguous color perception. Our parametric implementation allows critical evaluation of visual phenomena in a single biologically plausible computational framework. It uses a parametrized combination of high and low pass image filtering and SNN-based filling-in Poisson processes to provide adequate color image perception while accounting for differences in individual perception.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Venus: An efficient virus infection detection and fusion site discovery method using single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Che Yu Lee, Yuhang Chen, Ziheng Duan, Min Xu, Matthew Girgenti, Ke Xu, Mark Gerstein, Jing Zhang</p>

Early and accurate detection of viruses in clinical and environmental samples is essential for effective public healthcare, treatment, and therapeutics. While PCR detects potential pathogens with high sensitivity, it is difficult to scale and requires knowledge of the exact sequence of the pathogen. With the advent of next-gen single-cell sequencing, it is now possible to scrutinize viral transcriptomics at the finest possible resolution–cells. This newfound ability to investigate individual cells opens new avenues to understand viral pathophysiology with unprecedented resolution. To leverage this ability, we propose an efficient and accurate computational pipeline, named Venus, for virus detection and integration site discovery in both single-cell and bulk-tissue RNA-seq data. Specifically, Venus addresses two main questions: whether a tissue/cell type is infected by viruses or a virus of interest? And if infected, whether and where has the virus inserted itself into the human genome? Our analysis can be broken into two parts–validation and discovery. Firstly, for validation, we applied Venus on well-studied viral datasets, such as HBV- hepatocellular carcinoma and HIV-infection treated with antiretroviral therapy. Secondly, for discovery, we analyzed datasets such as HIV-infected neurological patients and deeply sequenced T-cells. We detected viral transcripts in the novel target of the brain and high-confidence integration sites in immune cells. In conclusion, here we describe Venus, a publicly available software which we believe will be a valuable virus investigation tool for the scientific community at large.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Unsupervised machine learning predicts future sexual behaviour and sexually transmitted infections among HIV-positive men who have sex with men</a></h4>

Roth, Patrick Schmid, Enos Bernasconi, Huldrych F. Günthard, Andri Rauch, Roger D. Kouyos, Luisa Salazar-Vizcaya, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study </p>

Machine learning is increasingly introduced into medical fields, yet there is limited evidence for its benefit over more commonly used statistical methods in epidemiological studies. We introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework for longitudinal features and evaluate it using sexual behaviour data from the last 20 years from over 3’700 participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). We use hierarchical clustering to find subgroups of men who have sex with men in the SHCS with similar sexual behaviour up to May 2017, and apply regression to test whether these clusters enhance predictions of sexual behaviour or sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) after May 2017 beyond what can be predicted with conventional parameters. We find that behavioural clusters enhance model performance according to likelihood ratio test, Akaike information criterion and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for all outcomes studied, and according to Bayesian information criterion for five out of ten outcomes, with particularly good performance for predicting future sexual behaviour and recurrent STIs. We thus assess a methodology that can be used as an alternative means for creating exposure categories from longitudinal data in epidemiological models, and can contribute to the understanding of time-varying risk factors.

                <p>by Eric Cramer, Maisa Ziadni, Kristen Hymel Scherrer, Sean Mackey, Ming-Chih Kao</p>

Body maps are commonly used to capture the location of a patient’s pain and thus reflect the extent of pain throughout the body. With increasing electronic capture body map information, there is an emerging need for clinic- and research-ready tools capable of visualizing this data on individual and mass scales. Here we propose CHOIRBM, an extensible and modular R package and companion web application built on the grammar of graphics system. CHOIRBM provides functions that simplify the process of analyzing and plotting patient body map data integrated from the CHOIR Body Map (CBM) at both individual patient and large-dataset levels. CHOIRBM is built on the popular R graphics package, ggplot2, which facilitates further development and addition of functionality by the open-source development community as future requirements arise. The CHOIRBM package is distributed under the terms of the MIT license and is available on CRAN. The development version of the package with the latest functions may be installed from GitHub. Example analysis using CHOIRBM demonstrates the functionality of the modular R package and highlights both the clinical and research utility of efficiently producing CBM visualizations.

The cerebral cortex is organized in cortical layers that differ in their cellular density, composition, and wiring. Cortical laminar architecture is also readily revealed by staining for cytochrome oxidase—the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has been hypothesized that a high-density band of cytochrome oxidase in cortical layer IV reflects higher oxygen consumption under baseline (unstimulated) conditions. Here, we tested the above hypothesis using direct measurements of the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> (pO<sub>2</sub>) in cortical tissue by means of 2-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM). We revisited our previously developed method for extraction of the cerebral metabolic rate of O<sub>2</sub> (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) based on 2-photon pO<sub>2</sub> measurements around diving arterioles and applied this method to estimate baseline CMRO<sub>2</sub> in awake mice across cortical layers. To our surprise, our results revealed a decrease in baseline CMRO<sub>2</sub> from layer I to layer IV. This decrease of CMRO<sub>2</sub> with cortical depth was paralleled by an increase in tissue oxygenation. Higher baseline oxygenation and cytochrome density in layer IV may serve as an O<sub>2</sub> reserve during surges of neuronal activity or certain metabolically active brain states rather than reflecting baseline energy needs. Our study provides to our knowledge the first quantification of microscopically resolved CMRO<sub>2</sub> across cortical layers as a step towards better understanding of brain energy metabolism.

                Background In addition to the cardiorespiratory, muscular, and neurological manifestations, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) alters patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL), induces a large variety of psychiatric manifestations, and reduces mobility and motor activity. Several studies have raised the impact of a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) on social disadvantage (e.g., HRQoL, anxiety, depression) and physical activity of COVID-19 patients, but very few have been performed in low-income countries. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a PRP on post-COVID-19 HRQoL, hospital anxiety and depression (HAD), and physical activity in Tunisian post-COVID19-patients. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in an outpatient care setting. Patients with post-COVID-19 were included. They completed an interview (including three questionnaires) before and after a PRP (three sessions/week for four weeks, each session was 70 minutes in duration, PRP items: aerobic cycle endurance, strength training, and education). The VQ11 questionnaire assessed functional dimension, psychological dimension, relational dimension, and total score; HAD appraised depression and anxiety; and Voorrips physical activity assessed daily activity, physical activity, leisure activity, and total scores. Data were expressed as mean±standard deviation in PRP change (PRP change=after-PRP values − before-PRP values). Results In total, 14 moderate to severe post-COVID-19 patients (61±4 years) were included. The PRP significantly improved the i) functional, psychological, and relational dimensions, and the VQ11 total score by 1.79±1.58 (p=0.0033), 2.00±2.15 (p=0.0108), 1.57±1.50 (p=0.0077), and 5.36±3.97 (p=0.0015), respectively; ii) HAD anxiety and depression scores by 2.07±2.40 (p=0.0076), and 2.57±3.08 (p=0.0058); and iii) physical activity and total scores by 1.75±2.44 (p=0.0251), and 1.78±2.65 (p=0.0341), respectively. Conclusion The PRP improved HRQoL, HAD, and physical activity of Tunisian post-COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in vulvar cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory immune checkpoint seems to have a significant prognostic impact in the evolution of certain cancers such as bronchopulmonary cancer, breast cancer, lymphomas etc. Indeed, it has been suggested that PD-L1 expression was associated with a worse prognosis due to its immunosuppressive activity within tumor tissue. Currently, the evaluation of the expression of these biomarkers is of increasing interest in gynecological cancers. Hence, we proposed to study the expression of PDL1 in vulvar cancer. Our aims were to study the expression profile of PD-L1 in vulvar cancer by immunohistochemistry and to correlate its expression with overall and relapse-free survival rates. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted at the pathological anatomy and cytology department of the Saleh Azaiez Institute, Tunis, Tunisia involving 55 patients followed for vulvar cancer over a period of 13 years from 2008 to 2021. Clinicopathologic data was collected from medical records and pathology reports. Results: PD-L1 expression in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma was observed in 44% of cases. This expression was noted in 33% of cases in tumor cells and in 11% of cases in lymphocytes. The median follow-up period was 40 months. During this period, 30% of patients relapsed. For all recurrence cases, 77% were during the first two years. The overall survival rate was 68.4% at two years and 50.3% at five years. The recurrence-free survival rate was 63.8% at five years. Overall survival as well as recurrence-free survival were more reduced in the case of PD-L1 expression. However, this difference was not significant (p=0.07). Conclusions: These results, although insufficient, emphasize the prognostic value that PDL1 could play in vulvar cancer as described in the literature. Despite the low numbers and the unavailability of data for some cases, our results encourage carrying out this work on larger populations.

                Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs. sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on glycemic control and blood lipid profile at preoperative (baseline), three and six months after surgery. Methods: In a prospective non-randomized design, 32 participants, SG (n = 11) and RYGB (n = 21) completed the study. Results: Results showed that fasting blood glucose (FBG) and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were significantly reduced from 113.55±30.18 mg/dL at baseline to 93.6±14.81 mg/dL at three months post operation following SG (p = 0.006). In addition, HbA1C decreased significantly in both groups at baseline, three- and six-months post operation (SG 6.41± 0.96, 5.4±0.36 and 5.28±0.57 % (p = 0.022) and RYGB 5.91± 0.94, 5.11± 0.57 and 4.96± 0.55% (p<0.001) respectively). Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were restored significantly in both groups at 6 months compared to three months post-surgery (SG 41.2± 9.99, 38.67±4.85 and 45.36± 6.22 (p = 0.023) and RYGB 42.67± 9.97, 36.58± 6.06 and 43.03± 6.66 (p =0.003) respectively), whereas there is no significant different in low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. Conclusions: Both bariatric surgery (SG and RYGB) improved glycemic control and blood lipid profile. Trial registration: The trial is registered with Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR20210429004) April 29, 2021.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Suicide in the geriatric population of South East Asia - contexts and attributes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Suicide in the geriatric population is a significant problem. Increasing age, living alone, having a psychiatric illness and medical comorbidities have been identified as risk factors for suicide among the elderly population. The elderly population in South East Asia is rapidly growing and the number of elderly people with mental illness and/or medical comorbidities is also increasing. The factors and attributes of suicide may vary from region to region due to socio-cultural and geographic diversities. Understanding these factors may help in planning suicide prevention strategies for the elderly population. There is a dearth of studies assessing the demography, risk factors for, and prevention of suicide among the elderly population in South East Asia. We tried to observe and explain the challenging paradigms to excerpt attributes and the context of geriatric suicide. It is observed in this review that lack of social integration or interaction along with some psychiatric disorders leads to suicidal ideation and completed suicide in the elderly. South East Asia has unique characteristics in several aspects like religious and cultural diversity, poverty, unemployment, demographic structure of the region, migration, natural disasters and calamities, political environment, poor policy implementation, and easy access to suicide means (e.g. pesticides). Primary care physicians, specialized mental health support, gate-keeper training, means restriction, raising awareness, supportive family environment, and dedicated call centers could be potential areas for suicide prevention among the elderly people of the region.  Further studies are warranted to formulate effective suicide prevention strategies.

                Background: Today, people use plants to treat various types of diseases and improve human health. One of the medicinal plants is the Betadine plant (Jatropha multifida L.). Betadine plants have many functions, especially the sap, leaves, fruit and seeds. The compound contents in Betadine stem sap, which is efficacious as an antimicrobial, are saponins, tannins, flavonoids and labaditin. One of the bacteria that cause infection is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These bacteria can cause opportunistic and nosocomial infections. Methods: This study was a true experimental laboratory with a post-test only control group design. This study used Betadine stem sap extract with concentrations of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, gentamicin cream 10% as positive control, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution as negative control. This study used the Kirby-Bauer diffusion method and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown on nutrient agar media, then incubated for 24 hours and calculated using calipers. Research data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA test. Results: The highest inhibition zone was group 50% (12.725 ± 0.2500 mm) while the lowest inhibition zone was group 100% (8.675 ± 0.5620 mm). Conclusions: Betadine stem extract had antibacterial activity in inhibiting the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, with the 50% concentration being the most effective in inhibiting the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The peritumoral brain zone in glioblastoma: where we are and where we are going</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and invasive primary brain tumor. Current therapies are not curative, and patients' outcomes remain poor with an overall survival of 20.9 months after surgery. The typical growing pattern of GBM develops by infiltrating the surrounding apparent normal brain tissue within which the recurrence is expected to appear in the majority of cases. Thus, in the last decades, an increased interest has developed to investigate the cellular and molecular interactions between GBM and the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) bordering the tumor tissue. The aim of this review is to provide up-to-date knowledge about the oncogenic properties of the PBZ to highlight possible druggable targets for more effective treatment of GBM by limiting the formation of recurrence, which is almost inevitable in the majority of patients. Starting from the description of the cellular components, passing through the illustration of the molecular profiles, we finally focused on more clinical aspects, represented by imaging and radiological details. The complete picture that emerges from this review could provide new input for future investigations aimed at identifying new effective strategies to eradicate this still incurable tumor.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">CircSeqAlignTk: An R package for end-to-end analysis of RNA-seq data for circular genomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has now become one of the standard tools for studying biological mechanisms at the transcriptome level. Advances in RNA-seq technology have led to the emergence of a large number of publicly available tools for RNA-seq data analysis. Most of them target linear genome sequences although it is necessary to study organisms with circular genome sequences. For example, by studying the infection mechanisms of viroids which comprise 246–401 nucleotides circular RNAs and target plants, tremendous economic and agricultural damage may be prevented. Unfortunately, using the available tools to construct workflows for the analysis of circular genome sequences is difficult, especially for non-bioinformaticians. To overcome this limitation, we present CircSeqAlignTk, an easy-to-use and richly documented R package. CircSeqAlignTk performs end-to-end RNA-seq data analysis, from alignment to the visualization of circular genome sequences, through a series of functions. Additionally, it implements a function to generate synthetic sequencing data that mimics real RNA-seq data obtained from biological experiments. CircSeqAlignTk not only provides an easy-to-use analysis interface for novice users but also allows developers to evaluate the performance of alignment tools and new workflows.

                Sorscher et al. investigate RNNs trained to path integrate and use pattern formation theory to explain when, why and how such networks develop hexagonal grid cells, finding nonnegative firing rates and center-surround outputs are essential. Additional analyses demonstrate trained RNNs fit neural responses better than hand-designed models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Z-REX uncovers a bifurcation in function of Keap1 paralogs</a></h4>

              
                Studying electrophile signaling is marred by difficulties in parsing changes in pathway flux attributable to on-target, vis-à-vis off-target, modifications. By combining bolus dosing, knockdown, and Z-REX-a tool investigating on-target/on-pathway electrophile signaling, we document that electrophile labeling of one zebrafish-Keap1-paralog (zKeap1b) stimulates Nrf2- driven antioxidant response (AR) signaling (like the human-ortholog). Conversely, zKeap1a is a dominant-negative regulator of electrophile-promoted Nrf2-signaling, and itself is nonpermissive for electrophile-induced Nrf2-upregulation. This behavior is recapitulated in human cells, wherein following electrophile treatment: (1) zKeap1b-transfected cells are permissive for augmented AR-signaling through reduced zKeap1b-Nrf2 binding; (2) zKeap1a-transfected cells are non-permissive for AR-upregulation, as zKeap1a-Nrf2 binding capacity remains unaltered; (3) 1:1 ZKeap1a:zKeap1b-transfected cells show no Nrf2-release from the Keap1-complex, rendering these cells unable to upregulate AR. We identified a zKeap1a-specific point-mutation (C273I) responsible for zKeap1a's behavior. Human-Keap1(C273I), of known diminished Nrf2-regulatory capacity, dominantly muted electrophile-induced Nrf2-signaling. These studies highlight divergent and interdependent <i>electrophile signaling</i> behaviors, despite conserved <i>electrophile sensing</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visual and motor signatures of locomotion dynamically shape apopulation code for feature detection in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Natural vision is dynamic: as an animal moves, its visual input changes dramatically. How can the visual system reliably extract local features from an input dominated by self-generated signals? In Drosophila, diverse local visual features are represented by a group of projection neurons with distinct tuning properties. Here we describe a connectome-based volumetric imaging strategy to measure visually evoked neural activity across this population. We show that local visual features are jointly represented across the population, and that a shared gain factor improves trial-to-trial coding fidelity. A subset of these neurons, tuned to small objects, is modulated by two independent signals associated with self-movement, a motor-related signal and a visual motion signal associated with rotation of the animal. These two inputs adjust the sensitivity of these feature detectors across the locomotor cycle, selectively reducing their gain during saccades and restoring it during intersaccadic intervals. This work reveals a strategy for reliable feature detection during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diversification dynamics in the Neotropics through time, clades and biogeographic regions</a></h4>

              
                The origins and evolution of the outstanding Neotropical biodiversity are a matter of intense debate. A comprehensive understanding is hindered by the lack of deep-time comparative data across wide phylogenetic and ecological contexts. Here, we quantify the prevailing diversification trajectories and drivers of Neotropical diversification in a sample of 150 phylogenies (12,512 species) of seed plants and tetrapods, and assess their variation across Neotropical regions and taxa. Analyses indicate that Neotropical diversity has mostly expanded through time (70% of the clades), while scenarios of saturated and declining diversity account for 21% and 9% of Neotropical diversity, respectively. Five biogeographic areas are identified as distinctive units of long-term Neotropical evolution, including Pan-Amazonia, the Dry Diagonal, and Bahama-Antilles. Diversification dynamics do not differ across these areas, suggesting no geographic structure in long-term Neotropical diversification. In contrast, diversification dynamics differ across taxa: plant diversity mostly expanded through time (88%), while a substantial fraction (43%) of tetrapod diversity accumulated at a slower pace or declined toward the present. These opposite evolutionary patterns may reflect different capacities for plants and tetrapods to cope with past climate changes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Excitatory and inhibitory D-serine binding to the NMDA receptor</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) uniquely require binding of two different neurotransmitter agonists for synaptic transmission. D-serine and glycine bind to one subunit, GluN1, while glutamate binds to the other, GluN2. These agonists bind to the receptor’s bi-lobed ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which close around the agonist during receptor activation. To better understand the unexplored mechanisms by which D-serine contributes to receptor activation, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the GluN1/GluN2A LBD dimer with free D-serine and glutamate agonists. Surprisingly, we observed D-serine binding to both GluN1 and GluN2A LBDs, suggesting that D-serine competes with glutamate for binding to GluN2A. This mechanism is confirmed by our electrophysiology experiments, which show that D-serine is indeed inhibitory at high concentrations. Although free energy calculations indicate that D-serine stabilizes the closed GluN2A LBD, its inhibitory behavior suggests that it either does not remain bound long enough or does not generate sufficient force for ion channel gating. We developed a workflow using pathway similarity analysis to identify groups of residues working together to promote binding. These conformation-dependent pathways were not significantly impacted by the presence of N-linked glycans, which act primarily by interacting with the LBD bottom lobe to stabilize the closed LBD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analyzing the brainstem circuits for respiratory chemosensitivity in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of systemic PCO<sub>2</sub> is a life-preserving homeostatic mechanism. In the medulla oblongata, the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and rostral medullary Raphe are proposed as CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensory nuclei mediating adaptive respiratory changes. Hypercapnia also induces active expiration, an adaptive change thought to be controlled by the lateral parafacial region (pF<sub>L</sub>). Here we use GCaMP6 expression and head-mounted mini-microscopes to image Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in these nuclei in awake adult mice during hypercapnia. Activity in the pF<sub>L</sub> supports its role as a homogenous neuronal population that drives active expiration. Our data show that chemosensory responses in the RTN and Raphe differ in their temporal characteristics and sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>, raising the possibility these nuclei act in a coordinated way to generate adaptive ventilatory responses to hypercapnia. Our analysis revises the understanding of chemosensory control in awake adult mouse and paves the way to understanding how breathing is coordinated with complex non-ventilatory behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Covalent disruptor of YAP-TEAD association suppresses defective hippo signaling</a></h4>

              
                The transcription factor TEAD, together with its coactivator YAP/TAZ, is a key transcriptional modulator of the Hippo pathway. Activation of TEAD transcription by YAP has been implicated in a number of malignancies, and this complex represents a promising target for drug discovery. However, both YAP and its extensive binding interfaces to TEAD have been difficult to address using small molecules, mainly due to a lack of druggable pockets. TEAD is post-translationally modified by palmitoylation that targets a conserved cysteine at a central pocket, which provides an opportunity to develop cysteine-directed covalent small molecules for TEAD inhibition. Here, we employed covalent fragment screening approach followed by structure-based design to develop an irreversible TEAD inhibitor MYF-03-69. Using a range of <i>in vitro</i> and cell-based assays we demonstrated that through a covalent binding with TEAD palmitate pocket, MYF-03-69 disrupts YAP-TEAD association, suppresses TEAD transcriptional activity and inhibits cell growth of Hippo signaling defective malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Further, a cell viability screening with a panel of 903 cancer cell lines indicated a high correlation between TEAD-YAP dependency and the sensitivity to MYF-03-69. Transcription profiling identified the upregulation of proapoptotic <i>BMF</i> gene in cancer cells that are sensitive to TEAD inhibition. Further optimization of MYF-03-69 led to an <i>in vivo</i> compatible compound MYF-03-176, which shows strong antitumor efficacy in MPM mouse xenograft model via oral administration. Taken together, we disclosed a story of the development of covalent TEAD inhibitors and its high therapeutic potential for clinic treatment for the cancers that are driven by TEAD-YAP alteration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Wide-ranging consequences of priority effects governed by an overarching factor</a></h4>

              
                Priority effects, where arrival order and initial relative abundance modulate local species interactions, can exert taxonomic, functional, and evolutionary influences on ecological communities by driving them to alternative states. It remains unclear if these wide-ranging consequences of priority effects can be explained systematically by a common underlying factor. Here, we identify such a factor in an empirical system. In a series of field and laboratory studies, we focus on how pH affects nectar-colonizing microbes and their interactions with plants and pollinators. In a field survey, we found that nectar microbial communities in a hummingbird-pollinated shrub, <i>Diplacus</i> (formerly <i>Mimulus</i>) <i>aurantiacus</i>, exhibited abundance patterns indicative of alternative stable states that emerge through domination by either bacteria or yeasts within individual flowers. In addition, nectar pH varied among <i>D. aurantiacus</i> flowers in a manner that is consistent with the existence of these alternative stable states. In laboratory experiments, <i>Acinetobacter nectaris</i>, the bacterium most commonly found in <i>D. aurantiacus</i> nectar, exerted a strongly negative priority effect against <i>Metschnikowia reukaufii</i>, the most common nectar-specialist yeast, by reducing nectar pH. This priority effect likely explains the mutually exclusive pattern of dominance found in the field survey. Furthermore, experimental evolution simulating hummingbird-assisted dispersal between flowers revealed that <i>M. reukaufii</i> could evolve rapidly to improve resistance against the priority effect if constantly exposed to <i>A. nectaris</i>-induced pH reduction. Finally, in a field experiment, we found that low nectar pH could reduce nectar consumption by hummingbirds, suggesting functional consequences of the pH-driven priority effect for plant reproduction. Taken together, these results show that it is possible to identify an overarching factor that governs the eco-evolutionary dynamics of priority effects across multiple levels of biological organization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autoantibody discovery across monogenic, acquired, and COVID19-associated autoimmunity with scalable PhIP-Seq</a></h4>

              
                Phage Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) allows for unbiased, proteome-wide autoantibody discovery across a variety of disease settings, with identification of disease-specific autoantigens providing new insight into previously poorly understood forms of immune dysregulation. Despite several successful implementations of PhIP-Seq for autoantigen discovery, including our previous work (Vazquez et al. 2020), current protocols are inherently difficult to scale to accommodate large cohorts of cases and importantly, healthy controls. Here, we develop and validate a high throughput extension of PhIP-seq in various etiologies of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including APS1, IPEX, RAG1/2 deficiency, Kawasaki Disease (KD), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), and finally, mild and severe forms of COVID19. We demonstrate that these scaled datasets enable machine-learning approaches that result in robust prediction of disease status, as well as the ability to detect both known and novel autoantigens, such as PDYN in APS1 patients, and intestinally expressed proteins BEST4 and BTNL8 in IPEX patients. Remarkably, BEST4 antibodies were also found in 2 patients with RAG1/2 deficiency, one of whom had very early onset IBD. Scaled PhIP-Seq examination of both MIS-C and KD demonstrated rare, overlapping antigens, including CGNL1, as well as several strongly enriched putative pneumonia-associated antigens in severe COVID19, including the endosomal protein EEA1. Together, scaled PhIP-Seq provides a valuable tool for broadly assessing both rare and common autoantigen overlap between autoimmune diseases of varying origins and etiologies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Kap-β2/Transportin mediates β-catenin nuclear transport in Wnt signaling</a></h4>

              
                Wnt signaling is essential for many aspects of embryonic development including the formation of the primary embryonic axis. In addition, excessive Wnt signaling drives multiple diseases including cancer highlighting its importance for disease pathogenesis. β-catenin is a key effector in this pathway that translocates into the nucleus and activates Wnt responsive genes. However, due to our lack of understanding of β-catenin nuclear transport, therapeutic modulation of Wnt signaling has been challenging. Here, we took an unconventional approach to address this long-standing question by exploiting a heterologous model system, the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, which contains a conserved nuclear transport machinery. In contrast to prior work, we demonstrate that β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus in a Ran dependent manner, suggesting the use of a nuclear transport receptor (NTR). Indeed, a systematic and conditional inhibition of NTRs revealed that only Kap104, the orthologue of Kap-β2/Transportin-1 (TNPO1), was required for β-catenin nuclear import. We further demonstrate direct binding between TNPO1 and β-catenin that is mediated by a conserved PY-NLS. Finally, using <i>Xenopus</i> secondary axis and TCF/LEF reporter assays, we demonstrate that our results in yeast can be directly translated to vertebrates. By elucidating the NLS in β-catenin and its cognate NTR, our study suggests new therapeutic targets for a host of human diseases caused by excessive Wnt signaling. Indeed, we demonstrate that a small chimeric peptide designed to target TNPO1 can reduce Wnt signaling as a first step towards therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational similarity learning reveals a graded multi-dimensional semantic space in the human anterior temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuro-cognitive models of semantic memory have proposed that the ventral anterior temporal lobes (vATLs) encode a graded, distributed, and multidimensional semantic space--yet neuroimaging studies seeking brain regions that encode semantic structure rarely identify these areas. In computer simulations we show that this discrepancy may arise from limitations of a commonly-used multivariate analysis, and introduce a new approach, representational similarity learning (RSL), that resolves these. We then use RSL to decode semantic structure from ECoG data collected from the vATL cortical surface while participants named line drawings of common items. The results reveal a graded, multi-dimensional semantic space encoded in neural activity across the vATL, which evolves over time and simultaneously expresses both broad and finer-grained semantic structure amongst animate and inanimate concepts. The work thus resolves the apparent discrepancy within the semantic cognition literature and suggests a new approach to discovering representational structure in neural data more generally.

                Neuroinflammation is an important hallmark in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Experimental evidence has highlighted a role of microglia in the modulation of motor neuron degeneration. However, the exact contribution of microglia to both sporadic and genetic forms of ALS is still unclear. We generated single nuclei profiles of spinal cord and motor cortex from sporadic and C9orf72 ALS patients, as well as controls. We particularly focused on the transcriptomic responses of both microglia and astrocytes. We confirmed that C9orf72 is highly expressed in microglia and shows a diminished expression in carriers of the hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE). This resulted in an impaired response to disease, with specific deficits in phagocytic and lysosomal transcriptional pathways. Astrocytes also displayed a dysregulated response in C9orf72 ALS patients, remaining in a homeostatic state. This suggests that C9orf72 HRE alters a coordinated glial response, which ultimately would increase the risk for developing ALS. Our results indicate that C9orf72 HRE results in a selective microglial loss-of-function, likely impairing microglial-astrocyte communication and preventing a global glial response. This is relevant as it indicates that sporadic and familial forms of ALS may present a different cellular substrate, which is of great importance for patient stratification and treatment.

                How the brain stores and retrieves memories is an important unsolved problem in neuroscience. It is commonly believed that memories are represented in the brain by distinct patterns of neural activity. Attractor dynamics has been proposed as one of the theoretical frameworks for learning and memory in neural networks. However, most of the prior theoretical work typically assumes that the neural network consists of fully-connected, binary neurons and that neuronal representations of memories are uncorrelated. In this paper, we propose a model consisting of continuously varying, rate-based, sparse neural network with a local learning rule which stores correlated patterns organized into multiple uncorrelated classes. We perform analytical calculations to compute maximum storage capacity and basin of attraction. It is found that increasing pattern correlation decreases storage capacity, and increasing the memory load decreases basin of attraction. We also study rate-based and spiking based neural network with separate excitatory and inhibitory populations and tight EI balance. Recent experimental work indicates that piriform cortex exhibits attractor dynamics and possibly stores hierarchically correlated patterns. So, we consider this work as a model for olfactory memory storage.

                Slow cortical oscillations play a crucial role in processing the speech envelope, which is perceived atypically by children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and developmental dyslexia. Here we use electroencephalography (EEG) and natural speech listening paradigms to identify neural processing patterns that characterize dyslexic versus DLD children. Using a story listening paradigm, we show that atypical power dynamics and phase-amplitude coupling between delta and theta oscillations characterize dyslexic and DLD children groups, respectively. We further identify EEG common spatial patterns (CSP) during speech listening across delta, theta and beta oscillations describing dyslexic versus DLD children. A linear classifier using four delta-band CSP variables predicted dyslexia status (0.77 AUC). Crucially, these spatial patterns also identified children with dyslexia in a rhythmic syllable task EEG, suggesting a core developmental deficit in neural processing of speech rhythm. These findings suggest that there are distinct atypical neurocognitive mechanisms underlying dyslexia and DLD.

                Neuronal activity during experience is thought to induce plastic changes within the hippocampal network which underlie memory formation, although the extent and details of such changes in vivo remain unclear. Here, we employed a temporally precise marker of neuronal activity, CaMPARI2, to label active CA1 hippocampal neurons in vivo, followed by immediate acute slice preparation and electrophysiological quantification of synaptic properties. Recently active neurons in the superficial sublayer of stratum pyramidale displayed larger post-synaptic responses at excitatory synapses from area CA3, with no change in pre-synaptic release probability. In contrast, in vivo activity weakened both pre- and post-synaptic excitatory weights onto pyramidal cells in the deep sublayer. In vivo activity of deep and superficial neurons within sharp-wave ripples was bidirectionally changed across experience, consistent with the observed changes in synaptic weights. These findings reveal novel, fundamental mechanisms through which the hippocampal network is modified by experience to store information.

                Reductions in response control (greater reaction time variability and commission error rate) are consistently observed in those diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous research suggests these reductions arise from a dysregulation of large-scale cortical networks. Here, we extended our understanding of this cortical-network/response-control pathway important to the neurobiology of ADHD. First, we assessed how dynamic changes in three resting-state EEG network properties thought to be relevant to ADHD (phase-synchronization, modularity, oscillatory power) covaried with response control during a simple perceptual decision-making task in 112 children/adolescents (aged 8-16) with and without formal ADHD diagnoses. Second, we tested whether these associations differed in males and females who were matched in age, ADHD-status and ADHD- subtype. We found that changes in oscillatory power (as opposed to phase-synchrony and modularity) are most related with response control, and that this relationship is stronger in ADHD compared to controls. Specifically, a tendency to dwell in an electrophysiological state characterized by high alpha/beta power (8-12/13-30Hz) and low delta/theta power (1-3/4-7Hz) supported response control, particularly in those with ADHD. Time in this state might reflect an increased initiation of alpha-suppression mechanisms, recruited by those with ADHD to suppress processing unfavourable to response control. We also found marginally significant evidence that this relationship is stronger in males compared to females, suggesting a distinct etiology for response control in the female presentation of ADHD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Convergent escape behavior from distinct visual processing of impending collision in fish and grasshoppers</a></h4>

              
                In animal species ranging from invertebrate to mammals, visually guided escape behaviors have been studied using looming stimuli, the two-dimensional expanding projection on a screen of an object approaching on a collision course at constant speed. The peak firing rate or membrane potential of neurons responding to looming stimuli often tracks a fixed threshold angular size of the approaching stimulus that contributes to the triggering of escape behaviors. To study whether this result holds more generally, we designed stimuli that simulate acceleration or deceleration over the course of object approach on a collision course. Under these conditions, we found that collision detecting neurons in grasshoppers were sensitive to acceleration whereas the triggering of escape behaviors was less so. In contrast, neurons in goldfish identified indirectly through the characteristic features of the escape behaviors they trigger, showed little sensitivity to acceleration. This closely mirrored a broader lack of sensitivity to acceleration of the goldfish escape behavior. Thus, although the sensory coding of simulated colliding stimuli with non-zero acceleration likely differs in grasshoppers and goldfish, the triggering of escape behaviors converges towards similar characteristics. Approaching stimuli with non-zero acceleration may help refine our understanding of neural computations underlying escape behaviors in a broad range of animal species.

                Neurons in the rabbit inferior colliculus (IC) are selective for the direction of fast frequency chirps (frequency sweeps) contained in Schroeder-Harmonic Complexes (SCHR). This selectivity may point to a feature sensitivity to fast chirp direction and velocity in the IC shared by all mammals. Here, we introduce a novel stimulus consisting of Aperiodic Random Chirps (ARC) to distinguish neurons' sensitivity to chirp direction and velocity from the confounding periodicity of SCHR stimuli. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were made in the IC of five Dutch-belted rabbits. SCHR stimuli were presented at a range of velocities and periodicities. Corresponding ARC stimuli and sinsuoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) noise were also presented. The prevalence of direction selectivity and direction bias of selectivity to chirps in SCHR and ARC responses was quantified, revealing that the majority of IC neurons (90.3%) are selective to chirp direction. Additionally, although this selectivity was biased for negative SCHR chirp directions, neurons with both positive and negative biases for every SCHR and ARC condition were observed. Modulation-transfer-function type was not significantly related to chirp selectivity, but characteristic frequency was related to both the prevalence of direction selectivity and direction bias of chirp responses. Responses to ARC and SAM noise stimuli were used as input to a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict SCHR responses rates, based on the premise that ARC and SAM noise responses correspond to neurons' velocity and periodicity response profiles, respectively. The results of the GLM analysis reveal that velocity-terms represented a substantial percentage of the total explainable variance, over 50% for some neurons. We discuss how chirp direction and velocity sensitivity may have implications for midbrain-level encoding of speech.

                The cortical column is one of the fundamental computational circuits in the brain. In order to understand the role neurons in different layers of this circuit play in cortical function it is necessary to identify the boundaries that separate the laminar compartments. While histological approaches can reveal ground truth they are not a practical means of identifying cortical layers in vivo. The gold standard for identifying laminar compartments in electrophysiological recordings is current-source density (CSD) analysis. However, laminar CSD analysis requires averaging across reliably evoked responses that target the input layer in cortex, which may be difficult to generate in less well studied cortical regions. Further the analysis can be susceptible to noise on individual channels resulting in errors in assigning laminar boundaries. Here, we have analyzed linear array recordings in multiple cortical areas in both the common marmoset and the rhesus macaque. We describe a pattern of laminar spike-field phase relationships that reliably identifies the transition between input and deep layers in cortical recordings from multiple cortical areas in two different non-human primate species. This measure corresponds well to estimates of the location of the input layer using CSDs, but does not require averaging or specific evoked activity. Laminar identity can be estimated rapidly with as little as a minute of ongoing data and is invariant to many experimental parameters. This method may serve to validate CSD measurements that might otherwise be unreliable or to estimate laminar boundaries when other methods are not practical.

                Neuromorphic processing systems implementing spiking neural networks with mixed signal analog/digital electronic circuits and/or memristive devices represent a promising technology for edge computing applications that require low power, low latency, and that cannot connect to the cloud for off-line processing, either due to lack of connectivity or for privacy concerns. However these circuits are typically noisy and imprecise, because they are affected by device to device variability, and operate with extremely small currents. So achieving reliable computation and high accuracy following this approach is still an open challenge that has hampered progress on one hand and limited widespread adoption of this technology on the other. By construction, these hardware processing systems have many constraints that are biologically plausible, such as heterogeneity and non-negativity of parameters. More and more evidence is showing that applying such constraints to artificial neural networks, including those used in artificial intelligence, promotes robustness in learning and improves their reliability. Here we delve even more in neuroscience and present network-level brain-inspired strategies that further improve reliability and robustness in these neuromorphic systems: we quantify, with chip measurements, to what extent population averaging is effective in reducing variability in neural responses, we demonstrate experimentally how the neural coding strategies of cortical models allow silicon neurons to produce reliable signal representations, and show how to robustly implement essential computational primitives, such as selective amplification, signal restoration, working memory, and relational networks, exploiting such strategies. We argue that these strategies can be instrumental for guiding the design of robust and reliable ultra-low power electronic neural processing systems implemented using noisy and imprecise computing substrates such as subthreshold neuromorphic circuits and emerging memory technologies.

                Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been suggested to be associated with impairment of model-based behavioral control. Meanwhile, recent work suggested shorter memory trace for negative than positive prediction errors (PEs) in OCD. Relation between these two suggestions remains unclear. Based on the properties of cortico-basal ganglia pathways, we modeled human as agent having a combination of successor representation (SR)-based system that enables model-based-like control and individual representation (IR)-based system that only hosts model-free control. We show that if the SR- and IR-based systems learn mainly from positive and negative PEs, respectively, agent can develop obsession-compulsion cycle, similarly to the agent with memory trace imbalance in the previous study. Fitting of behavior of such an opponent SR+IR agent in the two-stage decision task resulted in smaller weights for model-based control than the SR-only agent. These results reconcile the previous suggestions about OCD, raising a possibility that opponent learning in model-based/free controls underlies obsession-compulsion. Moreover, together with a recent suggestion that the opponent SR+IR combination actually performs well in certain dynamic environments and its cortico-striatal implementation appears consistent with various findings, this possibility explains why human is prone to OCD and even healthy people tended to show shorter memory trace for negative PEs.

                Schroeder-phase harmonic tone complexes have a flat temporal envelope and either rising or falling instantaneous frequency sweeps within F0 periods, depending on the polarity of the phase-scaling parameter C. Human thresholds for detection of a pure-tone target added to a Schroeder HTC can be 10-15 dB lower for the positive Schroeder (downward-sweeping) compared to negative (upward-sweeping), potentially due to the impulse response of the basilar membrane though this hypothesis remains controversial. Specifically, the upward-gliding impulse response observed empirically in several studies is expected to produce a peakier envelope response for positive Schroeder HTCs, thereby reducing masking compared to negative Schroeder HTCs. Birds provide an interesting animal model for studying Schroeder masking because prior studies suggest less behavioral threshold difference between Schroeder maskers of opposite polarity. However, neurophysiological mechanisms have not been explored and previous behavioral studies mostly used Schroeder HTCs with relatively low F0s. To gain further insight into underlying Schroeder masking mechanisms, we performed operant-conditioning experiments in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a parakeet species, using a wide range of F0 and C values. Awake neurophysiological recordings in the avian inferior colliculus, a major envelope processing station in the midbrain, characterized neural encoding of behavioral test stimuli. Behavioral Schroeder masking thresholds increased with increasing F0 and showed minimal difference between opposite Schroeder polarities for all conditions, similar to prior studies in this and other bird species. Neural recordings showed prominent temporal and average-rate-based encoding of Schroeder F0, and in many neurons, marked response asymmetries between opposite Schroeder polarities. While response bias varied considerably across neurons, average bias of the population shifted from negative to positive with increasing characteristic frequency, with a breakpoint at ~2-3 kHz. Response bias was weakly associated with lower Schroeder-masked tone detection of neurons for the 400-Hz F0 only. These results challenge the common assumption that a peakier masker response results in a lower threshold for target tone detection with this paradigm.

                Human mutations in the gene encoding the solute carrier (SLC) 6A17 caused intellectual disability (ID). The physiological role of SLC6A17 and pathogenesis of Slc6a17-based-ID were both unclear. Here we report learning deficits in SLC6A17 knockout and point mutants. Biochemistry, proteomics and electron microscopy (EM) support SLC6A17 protein localization in synaptic vesicles (SVs). Chemical analysis of SVs by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed glutamine (Gln) in SVs containing SLC6A17. Virally mediated overexpression of SLC6A17 increased Gln in SVs. Either genetic or virally mediated targeting of SLC6A17 reduced Gln in SVs. One ID mutation caused SLC6A17 mislocalization while the other caused defective Gln transport. Multidisciplinary approaches with 7 types of genetically modified mice have uncovered Gln as a new molecule in SVs, established the necessary and sufficient roles of SLC6A17 in Gln transport into SVs, and suggested SV Gln decrease as the key pathogenetic mechanism in human ID.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semantic object processing is modulated by prior scene context</a></h4>

              
                We typically encounter objects in a context, for example, a sofa in a living room or a car in the street, and this context influences how we recognize objects. Objects that are congruent with a scene context are recognised faster and more accurately than objects that are incongruent. Furthermore, objects that are incongruent with a scene elicit a stronger negativity of the N300/N400 EEG component compared to objects that are congruent with the scene. However, exactly how context modulates access to semantic object information is unknown. Here, we used a modelling-based approach with EEG to directly test how context influences the processing of semantic object information. Using representational similarity analysis, we first asked whether EEG patterns dissociated objects in congruent or incongruent scenes, finding that representational differences between the conditions emerged towards 300 ms. Next, we tested the relationship between EEG patterns and a semantic model based on property norms, revealing that the processing of semantic information for both conditions started around 150 ms, while after around 275 ms, semantic effects were stronger and lasted longer for objects in incongruent scenes compared to objects in congruent scenes. The timing of these effects overlapped with known N300/N400, suggesting previous congruency effects might be explained by differences in processing semantic object information. This suggests that scene contexts can provide a prior expectation about what kind of objects could appear, which might allow for more efficient semantic processing if the object is congruent with the scene, and extended semantic effects for incongruent objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A non-human primate model with Alzheimer's disease-like pathology induced by hippocampal overexpression of human tau</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most burdening diseases of the century with no disease-modifying treatment yet. Non-human primates (NHPs) share genetic, anatomical and physiological similarities with humans, making them an ideal model for investigating the pathogenesis and therapeutics of AD. However, the applications of NHPs in AD research have been hindered by the paucity of spontaneous or induced monkey models for AD due to their long generation time, ethical considerations and technical challenges in making genetically modified monkeys. Here we developed an AD-like NHP model by overexpressing human tau in bilateral hippocampi of adult rhesus macaque monkeys. We evaluated the pathological features of these monkeys with immunostaining, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and behavioral tests. We demonstrated that after hippocampal overexpression of human tau, the rhesus macaque monkeys displayed multiple pathological features of AD, including neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuronal loss, hippocampal atrophy, neuroinflammation, A{beta} clearance deficit, blood vessel damage and cognitive decline. This work establishes a human tau-induced AD-like NHP model that may facilitate mechanistic studies and therapeutic treatments for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of sensorineural hearing loss on formant-frequency discrimination: Measurements and models</a></h4>

              
                In the response of the healthy ear to a harmonic sound, auditory-nerve rate functions fluctuate at the fundamental frequency, f0. The amplitude of these fluctuations varies along the tonotopic axis. Neural fluctuation (NF) amplitudes encode spectral peaks, including formant frequencies of vowels, because responses of inner-hair-cells (IHCs) tuned near spectral peaks are captured (or dominated) by a single harmonic, resulting in lower fluctuation amplitudes than responses of IHCs tuned between spectral peaks. This NF code is robust across a wide range of sound levels and in background noise. The NF profile is converted into a rate-place representation in the auditory midbrain, wherein neurons are sensitive to low-frequency fluctuations. The NF code is vulnerable to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) because capture depends upon saturation of IHCs, and thus the interaction of cochlear gain with IHC transduction. In this study, formant-frequency discrimination limens (DLFFs) were estimated for listeners with normal hearing or mild to moderate SNHL. The difficulty of the task was modulated by varying formant bandwidth to modulate the contrast in the NF profile. The formants were either aligned with harmonic frequencies or placed between harmonics. Formant frequencies were 600 and 2000 Hz, in the range of first and second formants of several vowels. Results were compared to predictions from model auditory-nerve (AN) and inferior colliculus (IC) neurons, with listeners audiograms used to individualize the AN model. Correlations between DLFFs, audiometric thresholds near the formant frequencies, age, and scores on the Quick speech-in-noise test are reported. SNHL had a strong effect on DLFF for the second formant frequency (F2), but relatively small effect on DLFF for the first formant. The IC model provided good predictions of elevated listener thresholds to F2 as a function of SNHL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Approaching object acceleration differentially affects the predictions of neuronal collision-avoidance models</a></h4>

              
                The processing of visual information for collision avoidance has been investigated at the biophysical level in several model systems. In grasshoppers, the {eta} model captures reasonably well the visual processing performed by an identified neuron called the lobular giant movement detector (LGMD) as it tracks approaching objects. Similar phenomenological models have been used to describe either the firing rate or the membrane potential of neurons responsible for visually-guided collision avoidance in other animals. In goldfish, the {kappa} model has been proposed to describe the Mauthner cell, an identified neuron involved in startle escape responses. In the vinegar fly, a third model was developed for the giant fiber neuron, which trigger last resort escapes immediately before an impending collision. One key property of these models is their prediction that peak neuronal responses occur a fixed delay after the simulated approaching object reaches a threshold angular size on the retina. This prediction is valid for simulated objects approaching at a constant speed. We tested whether it remains valid when approaching objects accelerate. After characterizing and comparing the models' responses to accelerating and constant speed stimuli, we find that the prediction holds true for the {kappa} and the giant fiber model, but not for the {eta} model. These results suggest that acceleration in the approach trajectory of an object may help distinguish and further constrain the neuronal computations required for collision avoidance in grasshoppers, fish, and vinegar flies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different integration of conflicting motion signals in perception and eye movements during object tracking</a></h4>

              
                The processing of visual motion signals is pivotal to accurate sensorimotor control: to successfully intercept an object in motion the brain needs to take into account the object's velocity together with neural and motor delays. Here we test the effect of a target's motion on perception, saccade, and pursuit responses, collecting all three measures together on each trial. Motion information may have different effects on these three processes (Simoncini et al., 2012; Spering et al., 2011). Our comparison across the three different systems make use of a moving target that contains a second motion signal unrelated to its displacement (the double-drift stimulus). We presented peripheral moving apertures filled with noise that either drifted orthogonally to the aperture's direction, dramatically affecting its perceived direction of motion (Tse and Hsieh, 2006; Lisi and Cavanagh, 2015; Shapiro et al., 2010), or that varied dynamically with no net motion. Participants were asked to saccade to and track these targets with their gaze as soon as they appeared (Rashbass, 1961) and then to report their direction. In the trials with internal motion, the target disappeared at saccade onset so that the first 100 ms or so of the post-saccadic pursuit response was driven uniquely by peripheral information gathered before saccade onset. This provided independent measures of perceptual, pursuit and saccadic responses to the double-drift stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis. There was nevertheless a strong dissociation between saccadic responses on one hand and and perceptual and pursuit responses on the other. We conclude that the dissociation between perception and saccadic eye movements in the localization of moving objects (Lisi and Cavanagh, 2015) does not involve different processing of motion signals but rather a difference in how motion signals are combined with target position.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Highlight Results, Don't Hide Them: Enhance interpretation, reduce biases and improve reproducibility</a></h4>

              
                Most neuroimaging studies display results that represent only a tiny fraction of the collected data. While it is conventional to present "only the significant results" to the reader, here we suggest that this practice has several negative consequences for both reproducibility and understanding. This practice hides away most of the results of the dataset and leads to problems of selection bias and irreproducibility, both of which have been recognized as major issues in neuroimaging studies recently. Opaque, all-or-nothing thresholding, even if well-intentioned, places undue influence on arbitrary filter values, hinders clear communication of scientific results, wastes data, is antithetical to good scientific practice, and leads to conceptual inconsistencies. It is also inconsistent with the properties of the acquired data and the underlying biology being studied. Instead of presenting only a few statistically significant locations and hiding away the remaining results, we propose that studies should "highlight" the former while also showing as much as possible of the rest. This is distinct from but complementary to utilizing data sharing repositories: the initial presentation of results has an enormous impact on the interpretation of a study. We present practical examples for voxelwise, regionwise and cross-study analyses using publicly available data that was analyzed previously by 70 teams (NARPS; Botvinik-Nezer, et al., 2020), showing that it is possible to balance the goals of displaying a full set of results with providing the reader reasonably concise and "digestible" findings. In particular, the highlighting approach sheds useful light on the kind of variability present among the NARPS teams' results, which is primarily a varied strength of agreement rather than disagreement. Using a meta-analysis built on the informative "highlighting" approach shows this relative agreement, while one using the standard "hiding" approach does not. We describe how this simple but powerful change in practice-focusing on highlighting results, rather than hiding all but the strongest ones-can help address many large concerns within the field, or at least to provide more complete information about them. We include a list of practical suggestions for results reporting to improve reproducibility, cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual awareness during the attentional blink is determined by representational similarity</a></h4>

              
                Our visual perception seems effortless, but the brain has a limited processing capacity which curtails the amount of sensory information that can be brought into conscious awareness at any moment in time. A widely studied exemplar of this limitation is the attentional blink (AB), in which observers are unable to report the second of two rapidly sequential targets if it appears within 200-500 ms of the first. Despite the apparent ubiquity of the AB effect, its computational and neurophysiological underpinnings have remained elusive. Here we propose a simple computational model of temporal attention that unifies the AB with spatial and feature-based attention. We took a novel, integrative approach involving human psychophysics and functional brain imaging, along with neuronal recordings in mice to test this model. Specifically, we demonstrate that the AB only arises when visual targets have dissimilar representations in the brain but is absent when both targets have the same representation. Similarity in this context can be determined either by elementary features such as edge orientation, or by acquired, high-level factors such as numerical or alphabetical order. In this parsimonious model of the AB, attention to an initial target establishes a perceptual filter that is tuned to its unique representation in the brain. Subsequent items that match the filter remain available for conscious report, whereas those that do not match elude awareness altogether.

                Morphometric studies have provided crucial insights into the skull anatomy of commonly used wildtype (WT) laboratory mice strains such as the C57BL/6. With the increasing use of transgenic (TG) animals in neuroscience research, it is important to determine whether the results from morphometric studies performed on WT strains can be extended to TG strains derived from these WT strains. We report a new computer vision-based analysis pipeline for surveying mouse skull morphology using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) scans. We applied this pipeline to study and compare eight cohorts of adult mice from two strains, including both male and female mice at two age points. We found that the overall skull morphology was generally conserved between cohorts, with only 13% of landmark distance differences reaching statistical significance. In addition, we surveyed the dorsal skull bone thickness differences between cohorts. We observed significantly thicker dorsal, parietal, and/or interparietal bones in WT, male, or older mice for 53% of thickness comparisons. This knowledge of dorsal skull bone thickness has potential implications for surgical planning through skull imaging and has applications in automating cranial microsurgeries on mice.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized neuropathologically by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Vascular pathology caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (HP) is hypothesised to exacerbate AD pathology and has emerged as an increasing cause of age-related cognitive impairment. In this study we examined the effects of gradual cerebral HP on cognitive dysfunction, A{beta} pathology, microgliosis, and cortical network dynamics in C57BL/6J mice and a single App knock-in mouse model of AD (AppNL-G-F). We performed unilateral common carotid artery gradual occlusion (UCAgO) in two-month-old mice using an ameroid constrictor. At 4 months of age, animals were tested in a behavioral battery consisting of tests of spatial learning and memory (Morris water task), recognition memory (novel object recognition task), and motor coordination (balance beam). Following behavioural testing, in vivo mesoscale wide-field voltage imaging was done to assess cortical functional connectivity and sensory-evoked cortical activity, and brains were harvested for pathology characterization using immunohistochemistry. We found that UCAgO reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the occluded hemisphere (OH), however, subtle behavioural deficits were observed due to HP. A dissociative effect of HP was observed in resting-state functional connectivity analysis, where HP led to hyper-connectivity in C57 mice and hypo-connectivity in App mice. Interestingly, sensory stimulation of limbs contralateral to OH revealed hyper-cortical activations in the non-occluded hemisphere of C57 HP mice, however, hypo-cortical activations were observed in App HP mice. Furthermore, we found that the UCAgO increased cortical and hippocampal microgliosis in both hemispheres of C57 and App mice, a bilateral increase in A{beta} deposition was only observed in App mice. These results suggest that gradual cerebral HP leads to cortical network alterations in AD, which is partly mediated via activation of microglia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic manipulation of second messengers in neurons and cardiomyocytes with microbial rhodopsins and adenylyl cyclase</a></h4>

              
                Even though microbial photosensitive proteins have been used for optogenetics, their use should be optimized to precisely control second messengers in vivo. We exploited GtCCR4 and KnChR, cation channelrhodopsins from algae, BeGC1, a guanylyl cyclase rhodopsin from a fungus, and photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) from cyanobacteria (OaPAC) or bacteria (bPAC), to control cell functions in zebrafish. Optical activation of GtCCR4 and KnChR in the hindbrain reticulospinal V2a neurons, which are involved in locomotion, immediately induced swimming behavior, whereas activation of BeGC1 or PACs was achieved at a short latency. KnChR had the highest locomotion-inducing activity of all the channelrhodopsins examined. Activation of GtCCR4 and KnChR in cardiomyocytes induced cardiac arrest, whereas activation of bPAC gradually induced bradycardia. KnChR activation led to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in the heart, suggesting that depolarization caused cardiac arrest. These data suggest that these optogenetic tools can be used to reveal the roles of second messengers in various cell types in vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory-nerve Model including Efferent Dynamic Gain Control with Inputs from Cochlear Nucleus and Inferior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                The focus of most existing auditory models is on the afferent system. The auditory efferent system contains descending projections from several levels of the auditory pathway, from the auditory cortex to the brainstem, that control gain in the cochlea. We developed a model with a time-varying, gain-control signal from the efferent system that includes sub-cortical ascending and descending neural pathways. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent stage of the model receives excitatory projections from both fluctuation-sensitive neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) and wide-dynamic-range neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN). The response of the model MOC stage controlled cochlear gain dynamically. Changes in the rates of IC neurons in awake rabbit to long-duration amplitude-modulated (AM) noise were employed to adjust the parameters of the proposed model. In response to AM stimuli, physiological response rates of most IC neurons with band-enhanced (BE) modulation transfer functions (MTFs) increased over a time course consistent with the dynamics of the MOC efferent feedback. The time constant of the MOC model that best matched the IC physiology was compared to available descriptions of the MOC. Responses of the proposed subcortical model to AM noise simulate the trend of increasing rate over time, while the model without the efferent system did not show this trend.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Homotopic local-global parcellation of the human cerebral cortex from resting-state functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state fMRI is commonly used to derive brain parcellations, which are widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpreting human neuroscience studies. We previously developed a model that integrates local and global approaches for estimating areal-level cortical parcellations. The resulting local-global parcellations are often referred to as the Schaefer parcellations. However, the lack of homotopic correspondence between left and right Schaefer parcels has limited their use for brain lateralization studies. Here, we extend our previous model to derive homotopic areal-level parcellations. Using resting-fMRI and task-fMRI across diverse scanners, acquisition protocols, preprocessing and demographics, we show that the resulting homotopic parcellations are as homogeneous as the Schaefer parcellations, while being more homogeneous than five publicly available parcellations. Furthermore, weaker correlations between homotopic parcels are associated with greater lateralization in resting network organization, as well as lateralization in language and motor task activation. Finally, the homotopic parcellations agree with the boundaries of a number of cortical areas estimated from histology and visuotopic fMRI, while capturing sub-areal (e.g., somatotopic and visuotopic) features. Overall, these results suggest that the homotopic local- global parcellations represent neurobiologically meaningful subdivisions of the human cerebral cortex and will be a useful resource for future studies. Multi-resolution parcellations estimated from 1479 participants are publicly available (GITHUB_LINK).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior information differentially affects discrimination decisions and subjective confidence reports</a></h4>

              
                According to Bayesian models, both decisions and confidence are based on the same precision-weighted integration of prior expectations ("priors") and incoming information ("likelihoods"). This assumes that priors are integrated optimally and equally in decisions and confidence, which has not been tested. In two experiments, we quantitatively assessed how priors inform both decisions and confidence. With a gamified dual-decision task we controlled the strength of priors and likelihoods to create pairs of conditions that were matched in posterior information, but differed on whether the prior or likelihood was more informative. We found that priors were underweighted in discrimination decisions, but used to a greater extent in confidence about those decisions, and this was not due to differences in processing time. With a Bayesian model we quantified the weighting parameters for the prior at both levels, and confirmed that priors are more optimally used in explicit confidence, even when underused in decisions.

                G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit extracellular signals into the cell depending on the type of G protein. To analyze the functions of GPCR signaling, we developed optogenetic tools using animal G protein-coupled bistable rhodopsins that can be controlled into active and inactive states by light irradiation. We expressed Gq- and Gi/o-coupled bistable rhodopsins in hindbrain reticulospinal V2a neurons, which are involved in locomotion, or in cardiomyocytes of zebrafish. Light stimulation of the reticulospinal V2a neurons expressing Gq-coupled spider Rh1 resulted in an increase in the level of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and evoked swimming behavior. Light stimulation of cardiomyocytes expressing the Gi/o-coupled mosquito Opn3, pufferfish TMT opsin, or lamprey parapinopsin induced cardiac arrest, and the effect was suppressed by treatment with pertussis toxin or barium, suggesting that Gi/o-dependent regulation of inwardrectifier K+ channels controls cardiac function. These data indicate that these rhodopsins are useful for optogenetic control of GPCR-mediated signaling in neurons and cardiomyocytes in vivo.

                Emerging research supports a role of the insula in human cognition. Here, we used intracranial EEG to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics in the insula during a verbal working memory (vWM) task. We found robust effects for theta, beta, and high frequency activity (HFA) during probe presentation requiring a decision. Theta and beta band activity showed differential involvement across left and right insulae while sequential HFA modulations were observed along the anteroposterior axis. HFA in anterior insula tracked decision making and subsequent HFA was observed in posterior insula after the behavioral response. Our results provide electrophysiological evidence of engagement of different insula subregions in both decision-making and response monitoring during vWM and expand our knowledge of the role of the insula in complex human behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adding meaning to memories: How parietal cortex combines semantic content with episodic experience</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies of human memory have consistently found that univariate responses in parietal cortex track episodic experience with stimuli (whether stimuli are "old" or "new"). More recently, pattern-based fMRI studies have shown that parietal cortex also carries information about the semantic content of remembered experiences. However, it is not well understood how memory-based and content-based signals are integrated within parietal cortex. Here, we used voxel-wise encoding models and a recognition memory task to predict the fMRI activity patterns evoked by complex natural scene images based on (a) the episodic history and (b) the semantic content of each image. Models were generated and compared across distinct subregions of parietal cortex and for occipitotemporal cortex. We show that parietal and occipitotemporal regions each encode memory and content information, but they differ in how they combine this information. Among parietal subregions, angular gyrus was characterized by robust and overlapping effects of memory and content. Moreover, subject-specific semantic tuning functions revealed that successful recognition shifted the amplitude of tuning functions in angular gyrus but did not change the selectivity of tuning. In other words, effects of memory and content were additive in angular gyrus. This pattern of data contrasted with occipitotemporal cortex where memory and content effects were interactive: memory effects were preferentially expressed by voxels tuned to the content of a remembered image. Collectively, these findings provide unique insight into how parietal cortex combines information about episodic memory and semantic content.

                The dorsal striatum (DS) mediates the selection of actions for reward acquisition necessary for survival. Striatal pathology contributes to several neuropsychiatric conditions, including aberrant selection of actions for specific rewards in addiction. A major source of glutamate driving striatal activity is the rostral intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (rILN). Yet, the information that is relayed to the striatum to support action selection is unknown. Here we discovered that rILN neurons projecting to the DS integrated information from several subcortical and cortical sources and that these rILN-to-DS neurons stably signaled at two time points in mice performing an action sequence task reinforced by sucrose reward: action initiation and reward acquisition. In vivo activation of this pathway increased the number of successful trials whereas inhibition decreased the number of successful trials. These findings illuminate a role for the rostral intralaminar nuclear complex in reinforcing actions.

	<p>Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is the most common form of hydrocephalus in the adult population, and is often treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage using a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Symptoms of iNPH include gait impairment, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence. The pathophysiology behind the symptoms of iNPH is still unknown, and no reliable biomarkers have been established to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible use of the oxysterols as biomarkers in this disease. CSF levels of the oxysterols 24S- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, as well as the major metabolite of 27-hydroxycholesterol, 7 alpha hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid (7HOCA), were measured in iNPH-patients before and after treatment with a VP-shunt. Corresponding measurements were also performed in healthy controls. VP-shunt treatment significantly increased the levels of 7HOCA and 24S-hydroxycholesterol in CSF (p = 0.014 and p = 0.037, respectively). The results are discussed in relation to the beneficial effects of VP-shunt treatment. Furthermore, the possibility that CSF drainage may reduce an inhibitory effect of transiently increased pressure on the metabolic capacity of neuronal cells in the brain is discussed. This capacity includes the elimination of cholesterol by the 24S-hydroxylase mechanisms.</p>

	<p>There is large intersubject variability in cerebrovascular hemodynamic and systemic physiological responses induced by a verbal fluency task (VFT) under colored light exposure (CLE). We hypothesized that machine learning would enable us to classify the response patterns and provide new insights into the common response patterns between subjects. In total, 32 healthy subjects (15 men and 17 women, age: 25.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.3 years) were exposed to two different light colors (red vs. blue) in a randomized cross-over study design for 9 min while performing a VFT. We used the systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) approach to measure cerebrovascular hemodynamics and oxygenation at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VC) concurrently with systemic physiological parameters. We found that subjects were suitably classified by unsupervised machine learning into different groups according to the changes in the following parameters: end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial oxygen saturation, skin conductance, oxygenated hemoglobin in the VC, and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the PFC. With hard clustering methods, three and five different groups of subjects were found for the blue and red light exposure, respectively. Our results highlight the fact that humans show specific reactivity types to the CLE-VFT experimental paradigm.</p>

	<p>In the last decade, the number of postural studies in humans, in particular on deficits in postural control in patients, has increased. In the present article, we review studies on postural control with a particular focus on the role of foot and visual inputs in a quiet postural stance. A search and synthesis of articles identified through the electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, PubMed, and ResearchGate published until 2021 was performed. The aim of this review is to provide reference values for further studies dealing with postural control in both healthy and pathologic subjects and to encourage the development of suitable protocols that take into account the specificity of the different systems responsible for controlling human balance.</p>

	<p>Action processing is crucial for sports activities. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study investigated whether semantics were activated in action processing and, if so, whether semantic activation was modulated by action duration. Badminton athletes were recruited to finish a lexical decision task following an action-semantic priming paradigm, in which short (400 ms) or long (1000 ms) action videos served as primes, and semantically congruent or incongruent action words served as targets. The ERP results showed a P300 effect, that is, larger P300 amplitudes were observed for targets primed by semantically incongruent action videos than for targets primed by semantically congruent action videos, only when the action videos were long and not when the action videos were short. Moreover, a late positive component (LPC) was only sensitive to action duration, showing that the targets primed by long action videos elicited larger LPC amplitudes compared to the targets primed by short action videos. These results suggested that semantics could be activated in action processing and that semantic activation was modulated by action duration, supporting a link between the language system and action processing.</p>

	<p>Facial nerve (FN) injury can lead to debilitating and permanent facial paresis/paralysis (FP), where facial muscles progressively lose tone, atrophy, and ultimately reduce to scar tissue. Despite considerable efforts in the recent decades, therapies for FP still possess high failure rates and provide inadequate recovery of muscle function. In this pilot study, we used a feline model to demonstrate the potential for chronically implanted multichannel dual-cuff electrodes (MCE) to selectively stimulate injured facial nerves at low current intensities to avoid stimulus-induced neural injury. Selective facial muscle activation was achieved over six months after FN injury and MCE implantation in two domestic shorthaired cats (Felis catus). Through utilization of bipolar stimulation, specific muscles were activated at significantly lower electrical currents than was achievable with single channel stimulation. Moreover, interval increases in subthreshold current intensities using bipolar stimulation enabled a graded EMG voltage response while maintaining muscle selectivity. Histological examination of neural tissue at implant sites showed no appreciable signs of stimulation-induced nerve injury. Thus, by selectively activating facial musculature six months following initial FN injury and MCE implantation, we demonstrated the potential for our neural stimulator system to be safely and effectively applied to the chronic setting, with implications for FP treatment.</p>

	<p>Chanting is practiced in many religious and secular traditions and involves rhythmic vocalization or mental repetition of a sound or phrase. This study examined how chanting relates to cognitive function, altered states, and quality of life across a wide range of traditions. A global survey was used to assess experiences during chanting including flow states, mystical experiences, mindfulness, and mind wandering. Further, attributes of chanting were assessed to determine their association with altered states and cognitive benefits, and whether psychological correlates of chanting are associated with quality of life. Responses were analyzed from 456 English speaking participants who regularly chant across 32 countries and various chanting traditions. Results revealed that different aspects of chanting were associated with distinctive experiential outcomes. Stronger intentionality (devotion, intention, sound) and higher chanting engagement (experience, practice duration, regularity) were associated with altered states and cognitive benefits. Participants whose main practice was call and response chanting reported higher scores of mystical experiences. Participants whose main practice was repetitive prayer reported lower mind wandering. Lastly, intentionality and engagement were associated with quality of life indirectly through altered states and cognitive benefits. This research sheds new light on the phenomenology and psychological consequences of chanting across a range of practices and traditions.</p>

	<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has been utilized widely in populations with brain lesions, such as stroke patients. The tES-generated electric field (EF) within the brain is considered as one of the most important factors for physiological effects. However, it is still unclear how brain lesions may influence EF distribution induced by tES. In this case study, we reported in vivo measurements of EF in one epilepsy participant with brain lesions during different tES montages. With the in vivo EF data measured by implanted stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, the simulation model was investigated and validated. Our results demonstrate that the prediction ability of the current simulation model may be degraded in the lesioned human brain.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to explore the core knowledge topics and future research trends in neuroscience in the field of education (NIE). In this study, we have explored the diffusion of neuroscience and different neuroscience methods (e.g., electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, eye tracking) through and within education fields. A total of 549 existing scholarly articles and 25,886 references on neuroscience in the field of education (NIE) from the Web of Science Core Collection databases were examined during the following two periods: 1995&amp;amp;ndash;2013 and 2014&amp;amp;ndash;2022. The science mapping software Vosviewer and Bibliometrix were employed for data analysis and visualization of relevant literature. Furthermore, performance analysis, collaboration network analysis, co-citation network analysis, and strategic diagram analysis were conducted to systematically sort out the core knowledge in NIE. The results showed that children and cognitive neuroscience, students and medical education, emotion and empathy, and education and brain are the core intellectual themes of current research in NIE. Curriculum reform and children&amp;amp;rsquo;s skill development have remained central research issues in NIE, and several topics on pediatric research are emerging. The core intellectual themes of NIE revealed in this study can help scholars to better understand NIE, save research time, and explore a new research question. To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the earliest documents to outline the NIE core intellectual themes and identify the research opportunities emerging in the field.</p>

	<p>In the event of an acute ischemic stroke, saving the penumbra is the most important aspect of early treatment. The rapid and accurate identification of ischemic penumbra plays a key role in its comprehensive treatment. At present, the identification method and evaluation standard of ischemic penumbra have not been unified. Numerous pieces of software identifying ischemic penumbra have been developed, such as rapid processing of perfusion and diffusion (RAPID), Sphere, Vitrea, and computed tomography perfusion+ (CTP+). The RAPID software, analyzing and integrating multi-mode image data (mainly based on perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) or computed tomography perfusion (CTP) images, shows good performance in identifying ischemic penumbra and has been utilized for the assessment of ischemic penumbra in many ischemic stroke clinical studies, achieving good outcomes and promoting the transition from &amp;amp;ldquo;time window&amp;amp;rdquo; to &amp;amp;ldquo;tissue window&amp;amp;rdquo; in the treatment of early stage AIS. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the RAPID software and its accuracy in evaluating ischemic penumbra, this paper reviews the background and development of the RAPID software, summarizes the published acute cerebral infarction trials using the RAPID software, generalizes the threshold parameters in different time windows, and further discusses its application and limitations.</p>

	<p>Surgical removal of tumors of the atrium is challenging due to their deep location, vascularization, and to their complex three-dimensional relationships with the highly functional white matter fibers of the region. To assess the feasibility and the effectiveness of the ipsilateral interhemispheric transprecuneus approach (IITA) for tumors involving the atrium and the posterior third of the temporal horn, a retrospective chart review of all patients who had undergone a surgical treatment for intraventricular tumors between January 2008 and January 2017 was performed, and the step-by-step approach is described. Ten patients affected by lesions of the atrium of the lateral ventricle underwent surgical treatment, seven of which were approached through the IITA. The mean age was 42.8 years (range 6&amp;amp;ndash;63 years). The symptoms presented included severe, drug-resistant headache (90%), lateral homonymous hemianopsia (50%), seizures (30%), and speech disturbances (30%). Histological examinations revealed seven patients with meningioma (70%), one with a metastasis (10%), one with a choroid plexus papilloma (10%) and one with a cavernoma (10%). In all cases, a gross total removal was obtained. All patients had a significant improvement in their headache. Two patients experienced a worsening of the pre-operative visual disturbances, while two patients had a significant improvement. No patients without pre-operative visual disturbances described a post-operative worsening of visual symptoms. The IITA represents a feasible approach for tumors of the atrium. The three-quarter prone position facilitates the enlargement of the interhemispheric fissure by increasing the working angle and facilitating the exposure of the lateral wall of the atrium.</p>

	<p>Decision making (DM) is the ability to choose among multiple options, considering external and internal variables and identifying potential paths of action that need to be assessed. Some brain areas involved in decision making are also implicated in pain processing, such as in fibromyalgia (FM). FM is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and cognitive difficulties. We conducted a systematic review with the aim of identifying articles that evaluated DM in people with fibromyalgia, highlighting the main assessment tools. This work was conducted according to the PRISMA statement by consulting six online databases and providing a quality assessment of each search that met the inclusion criteria. In line with the limited interest in this in the scientific landscape to date, we found nine studies that evaluated the performance of DM in patients with FM; furthermore, we discovered that only certain types of DM were tested. The importance of our work lies in shedding light on a cognitive ability that is often undervalued in the scientific landscape but essential in everyday life. This review can serve as a starting point for further studies to clarify the relationship between DM and FM, improving understanding of the topic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Regulation of Diacylglycerol Content in Olfactory Neurons Determines Forgetting or Retrieval of Olfactory Memory in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Proper management of memories by forgetting and retrieval is essential for animals to adapt their behavior to changing environments. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying forgetting, we use olfactory learning to an attractive odorant, diacetyl, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> hermaphrodites as a model. In this learning paradigm, the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway in AWC sensory neurons accelerates forgetting of the olfactory memory, which is stored as a sensory memory trace in AWA sensory neurons. Our genetic screening revealed that increased neuronal diacylglycerol in the olfactory neuronal circuit, by mutations in diacylglycerol kinase-1, <I>egl-30</I> or <I>goa-1</I>, Gq and Go type G-proteins, suppresses the forgetting defect in the behavior of <I>tir-1</I> mutants, although the calcium imaging analyses of the olfactory neurons revealed that the sensory memory trace to the odorant was maintained. In contrast, the expression of a gain-of-function <I>goa-1</I> gene exclusively in AWC neurons caused a forgetting defect in behavior, although their sensory memory trace declined. Furthermore, the behavioral analysis of animals applied with diacylglycerol analog and measurement of diacylglycerol content by fluorescent imaging suggested that diacylglycerol content in AWC is important for the proper forgetting. These findings raise a possibility that diacylglycerol signaling plays a crucial role in determining whether to forget or to recall in olfactory learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Forgetting and retrieval are important processes for proper management of memories, although the mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely unclear. We found that, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, diacylglycerol signaling works in a forgetting mechanism downstream of TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. Mutations that change diacylglycerol content in the olfactory neurons affect behavioral forgetting, although they did not alter the sensory memory trace. This suggests that diacylglycerol in specific neurons may determine the occurrence of retrieving, rather than modifying, the memory traces. Consistent with this hypothesis, application of diacylglycerol analog to animals suggests that diacylglycerol content until memory acquisition decides whether to retrieve or to forget the memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Axon Initial Segments Are Required for Efficient Motor Neuron Axon Regeneration and Functional Recovery of Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The axon initial segment (AIS) generates action potentials and maintains neuronal polarity by regulating the differential trafficking and distribution of proteins, transport vesicles, and organelles. Injury and disease can disrupt the AIS, and the subsequent loss of clustered ion channels and polarity mechanisms may alter neuronal excitability and function. However, the impact of AIS disruption on axon regeneration after injury is unknown. We generated male and female mice with AIS-deficient multipolar motor neurons by deleting AnkyrinG, the master scaffolding protein required for AIS assembly and maintenance. We found that after nerve crush, neuromuscular junction reinnervation was significantly delayed in AIS-deficient motor neurons compared with control mice. In contrast, loss of AnkyrinG from pseudo-unipolar sensory neurons did not impair axon regeneration into the intraepidermal nerve fiber layer. Even after AIS-deficient motor neurons reinnervated the neuromuscular junction, they failed to functionally recover because of reduced synaptic vesicle protein 2 at presynaptic terminals. In addition, mRNA trafficking was disrupted in AIS-deficient axons. Our results show that, after nerve injury, an intact AIS is essential for efficient regeneration and functional recovery of axons in multipolar motor neurons. Our results also suggest that loss of polarity in AIS-deficient motor neurons impairs the delivery of axonal proteins, mRNAs, and other cargoes necessary for regeneration. Thus, therapeutic strategies for axon regeneration must consider preservation or reassembly of the AIS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disruption of the axon initial segment is a common event after nervous system injury. For multipolar motor neurons, we show that axon initial segments are essential for axon regeneration and functional recovery after injury. Our results may help explain injuries where axon regeneration fails, and suggest strategies to promote more efficient axon regeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{micro}-Opioid Receptor Activation Reduces Glutamate Release in the PreBo&#x0308;tzinger Complex in Organotypic Slice Cultures</a></h4>

              
                <p>The inspiratory rhythm generator, located in the brainstem preBo&#x0308;tzinger complex (preBo&#x0308;tC), is dependent on glutamatergic signaling and is affected profoundly by opioids. Here, we used organotypic slice cultures of the newborn mouse brainstem of either sex in combination with genetically encoded sensors for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA to visualize Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling during spontaneous rhythm and in the presence of DAMGO. During spontaneous rhythm, the glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR.A184S revealed punctate synapse-like fluorescent signals along dendrites and somas in the preBo&#x0308;tC with decay times that were prolonged by the glutamate uptake blocker (TFB-TBOA). The GABA sensor iGABASnFR showed a more diffuse fluorescent signal during spontaneous rhythm. Rhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and glutamate transients had an inverse relationship between the spontaneous burst frequency and the burst amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glutamate signals. A similar inverse relationship was observed when bath applied DAMGO reduced spontaneous burst frequency and increased the burst amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA transient signals. However, a hypoxic challenge reduced both burst frequency and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude. Using a cocktail that blocked glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic transmission to indirectly measure the release of glutamate/GABA in response to an electrical stimulus, we found that DAMGO reduces the release of glutamate in the preBo&#x0308;tC but has no effect on GABA release. This suggest that the opioid mediated slowing of respiratory rhythm involves presynaptic reduction of glutamate release, which would impact the ability of the network to engage in recurrent excitation, and may result in the opioid-induced slowing of inspiratory rhythm.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioids slow down breathing rhythm by affecting neurons in the preBo&#x0308;tzinger complex (preBo&#x0308;tC) and other brainstem regions. Here, we used cultured slices of the preBo&#x0308;tC to better understand this effect by optically recording Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA transients during preBo&#x0308;tC activity. Spontaneous rhythm showed an inverse relationship between burst frequency and burst amplitude in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glutamate signals. Application of the opioid DAMGO slowed the rhythm, with a concomitant increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA signals. When rhythm was blocked pharmacologically, DAMGO reduced the presynaptic release of glutamate, but not GABA. These data suggest the mechanism of action of opioids involves presynaptic reduction of glutamate release, which may play an important role in the opioid-induced slowing of inspiratory rhythm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Tail of the Mouse Striatum Contains a Novel Large Type of GABAergic Neuron Incorporated in a Unique Disinhibitory Pathway That Relays Auditory Signals to Subcortical Nuclei</a></h4>

              
                <p>The most caudal part of the striatum in rodents, the tail of the striatum (TS), has many features that distinguish it from the rostral striatum, such as its biased distributions of dopamine receptor subtypes, lack of striosomes and matrix compartmentalization, and involvement in sound-driven behaviors. However, information regarding the TS is still limited. We demonstrate in this article that the TS of the male mouse contains GABAergic neurons of a novel type that were detected immunohistochemically with the neurofilament marker SMI-32. Their somata were larger than cholinergic giant aspiny neurons, were located in a narrow space adjacent to the globus pallidus (GP), and extended long dendrites laterally toward the intermediate division (ID) of the trilaminar part of the TS, the region targeted by axons from the primary auditory cortex (A1). Although vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive cortical axon terminals rarely contacted these TS large (TSL) neurons, glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive and enkephalin-immunoreactive boutons densely covered somata and dendrites of TSL neurons, forming symmetrical synapses. Analyses of GAD67-CrePR knock-in mice revealed that these axonal boutons originated from nearby medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the ID. All MSNs examined in the ID in turn received inputs from the A1. Retrograde tracers injected into the rostral zona incerta and ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus labeled somata of TSL neurons. TSL neurons share many morphological features with GP neurons, but their strategically located dendrites receive inputs from closely located MSNs in the ID, suggesting faster responses than distant GP neurons to facilitate auditory-evoked, prompt disinhibition in their targets.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study describes a newly found population of neurons in the mouse striatum, the brain region responsible for appropriate behaviors. They are large GABAergic neurons located in the most caudal part of the striatum [tail of the striatum (TS)]. These TS large (TSL) neurons extended dendrites toward a particular region of the TS where axons from the primary auditory cortex (A1) terminated. These dendrites received direct synaptic inputs heavily from nearby GABAergic neurons of the striatum that in turn received inputs from the A1. TSL neurons sent axons to two subcortical regions outside basal ganglia, one of which is related to arousal. Specialized connectivity of TSL neurons suggests prompt disinhibitory actions on their targets to facilitate sound-evoked characteristic behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Organization of Cortical and Thalamic Input to Inhibitory Neurons in Mouse Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intracortical inhibition in motor cortex (M1) regulates movement and motor learning. If cortical and thalamic inputs target different inhibitory cell types in different layers, then these afferents may play different roles in regulating M1 output. Using mice of both sexes, we quantified input to two main classes of M1 interneurons, parvalbumin+ (PV+) cells and somatostatin+ (SOM+) cells, using monosynaptic rabies tracing. We then compared anatomic and functional connectivity based on synaptic strength from sensory cortex and thalamus. Functionally, each input innervated M1 interneurons with a unique laminar profile. Different interneuron types were excited in a distinct, complementary manner, suggesting feedforward inhibition proceeds selectively via distinct circuits. Specifically, somatosensory cortex (S1) inputs primarily targeted PV+ neurons in upper layers (L2/3) but SOM+ neurons in middle layers (L5). Somatosensory thalamus [posterior nucleus (PO)] inputs targeted PV+ neurons in middle layers (L5). In contrast to sensory cortical areas, thalamic input to SOM+ neurons was equivalent to that of PV+ neurons. Thus, long-range excitatory inputs target inhibitory neurons in an area and a cell type-specific manner, which contrasts with input to neighboring pyramidal cells. In contrast to feedforward inhibition providing generic inhibitory tone in cortex, circuits are selectively organized to recruit inhibition matched to incoming excitatory circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> M1 integrates sensory information and frontal cortical inputs to plan and control movements. Although inputs to excitatory cells are described, the synaptic circuits by which these inputs drive specific types of M1 interneurons are unknown. Anatomical results with rabies tracing and physiological quantification of synaptic strength shows that two main classes of inhibitory cells (PV+ and SOM+ interneurons) both receive substantial cortical and thalamic input, in contrast to interneurons in sensory areas (where thalamic input strongly prefers PV+ interneurons). Further, each input studied targets PV+ and SOM+ interneurons in a different fashion, suggesting that separate, specific circuits exist for recruitment of feedforward inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pharmacological Manipulations of Physiological Arousal and Sleep-Like Slow Waves Modulate Sustained Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sustained attention describes our ability to keep a constant focus on a given task. This ability is modulated by our physiological state of arousal. Although lapses of sustained attention have been linked with dysregulations of arousal, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unclear. An emerging body of work proposes that the intrusion during wakefulness of sleep-like slow waves, a marker of the transition toward sleep, could mechanistically account for attentional lapses. This study aimed to expose, via pharmacological manipulations of the monoamine system, the relationship between the occurrence of sleep-like slow waves and the behavioral consequences of sustained attention failures. In a double-blind, randomized-control trial, 32 healthy human male participants received methylphenidate, atomoxetine, citalopram or placebo during four separate experimental sessions. During each session, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure neural activity while participants completed a visual task requiring sustained attention. Methylphenidate, which increases wake-promoting dopamine and noradrenaline across cortical and subcortical areas, improved behavioral performance whereas atomoxetine, which increases dopamine and noradrenaline predominantly over frontal cortices, led to more impulsive responses. Additionally, citalopram, which increases sleep-promoting serotonin, led to more missed trials. Based on EEG recording, citalopram was also associated with an increase in sleep-like slow waves. Importantly, compared with a classical marker of arousal such as &alpha; power, only slow waves differentially predicted both misses and faster responses in a region-specific fashion. These results suggest that a decrease in arousal can lead to local sleep intrusions during wakefulness which could be mechanistically linked to impulsivity and sluggishness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated whether the modulation of attention and arousal could not only share the same neuromodulatory pathways but also rely on similar neuronal mechanisms; for example, the intrusion of sleep-like activity within wakefulness. To do so, we pharmacologically manipulated noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin in a four-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled trial and examined the consequences on behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) indices of attention and arousal. We showed that sleep-like slow waves can predict opposite behavioral signatures: impulsivity and sluggishness. Slow waves may be a candidate mechanism for the occurrence of attentional lapses since the relationship between slow-wave occurrence and performance is region-specific and the consequences of these local sleep intrusions are in line with the cognitive functions carried by the underlying brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociation between Attention-Dependent and Spatially Specific Illusory Shape Responses within the Topographic Areas of the Posterior Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human visual system consists of multiple topographic maps that extend from the early visual cortex (EVC) along the dorsal and ventral processing streams. Responses to illusory shapes within these maps have been demonstrated in the ventral stream areas, in particular the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Recently, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) of the dorsal stream has been linked to the processing of illusory shapes defined by motion. It remains unclear whether the topographically organized parietal areas also respond to stationary illusory shapes, which would suggest their generic role in representing illusory content. In the current study we measured brain responses using fMRI while 30 human participants (12 male) observed flickering inducers around the fixation task. The inducers either formed an illusory diamond in the center, a triangle in the left or right hemifield, or were inverted such that no illusory figure was formed. We compared responses of parietal regions IPS0-IPS5 and SPL1 to each illusory figure with the nonillusory condition. To determine the role of attentional modulation on illusory shape responses we manipulated the difficulty of the fixation task. Our results show that all IPS areas responded to illusory shapes. The more posterior areas IPS0&ndash;IPS3 additionally displayed a preference toward contralateral shapes, while the more anterior areas IPS4 and IPS5 showed response attenuation with increased task difficulty. We suggest that the IPS can represent illusory content generated not only by moving, but also by stationary stimuli, and that there is a functional dissociation between attention-dependent anterior and spatially specific posterior topographic maps.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The traditional view of the ventral visual pathway being solely responsible for representation of objects has recently been challenged by demonstrating illusory shape representation within the dorsal visual pathway with moving bistable stimuli. Our results provide evidence for the dorsal stream contribution to representing not only moving, but also stationary illusory shapes. Our results also show a functional subdivision along the topographic maps, with spatially specific shape responses in the more posterior, and attention-dependent responses in the more anterior areas. These findings have implications for our understanding of the relationship between attention and grouping in healthy individuals and neuropsychological patients. Furthermore, IPS areas should be considered in theoretical accounts and models of how subjective content is generated in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Representation of Intraoral Olfactory and Gustatory Signals by the Mediodorsal Thalamus in Alert Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mediodorsal thalamus is a multimodal region involved in a variety of cognitive behaviors, including olfactory attention, odor discrimination, and the hedonic perception of flavors. Although the mediodorsal thalamus forms connections with principal regions of the olfactory and gustatory networks, its role in processing olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth remains unclear. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the mediodorsal thalamus of behaving female rats during the intraoral delivery of individual odors, individual tastes, and odor-taste mixtures. Our results are the first to demonstrate that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus dynamically encode chemosensory signals originating from the mouth. This chemoselective population is broadly tuned, exhibits excited and suppressed responses, and responds to odor-taste mixtures differently than an odor or taste alone. Furthermore, a subset of chemoselective neurons encodes the palatability-related features of tastes and may represent associations between previously experienced odor-taste pairs. Our results further demonstrate the multidimensionality of the mediodorsal thalamus and provide additional evidence of its involvement in processing chemosensory information important for ingestive behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The perception of food relies on the concurrent processing of olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth. The mediodorsal thalamus is a higher-order thalamic nucleus involved in a variety of chemosensory-dependent behaviors and connects the olfactory and gustatory cortices with the prefrontal cortex. However, it is unknown how neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus process intraoral chemosensory signals. Using tetrode recordings in alert rats, our results are the first to show that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus dynamically represent olfactory and gustatory signals from the mouth. Our findings are consistent with the mediodorsal thalamus being a key node between sensory and prefrontal cortical areas for processing chemosensory information underlying ingestive behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Glutamatergic Claustrum-Anterior Cingulate Cortex Circuit for Visceral Pain Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic visceral pain is a major challenge for both patients and health providers. Although the central sensitization of the brain is thought to play an important role in the development of visceral pain, the detailed neural circuits remain largely unknown. Using a well-established chronic visceral hypersensitivity model induced by neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) in male mice, we identified a distinct pathway whereby the claustrum (CL) glutamatergic neuron projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is critical for visceral pain but not for CFA-evoked inflammatory pain. By a combination of <I>in vivo</I> circuit-dissecting extracellular electrophysiological approaches and visceral pain related electromyographic (EMG) recordings, we demonstrated that optogenetic inhibition of CL glutamatergic activity suppressed the ACC neural activity and visceral hypersensitivity of NMD mice whereas selective activation of CL glutamatergic activity enhanced the ACC neural activity and evoked visceral pain of control mice. Further, optogenetic studies demonstrate a causal link between such neuronal activity and visceral pain behaviors. Chemogenetic activation or inhibition of ACC neural activities reversed the effects of optogenetic manipulation of CL neural activities on visceral pain responses. Importantly, molecular detection showed that NMD significantly enhances the expression of NMDA receptors and activated CaMKII&alpha; in the ACC postsynaptic density (PSD) region. Together, our data establish a functional role for CL-&gt;ACC glutamatergic neurons in gating visceral pain, thus providing a potential treatment strategy for visceral pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Studies have shown that sensitization of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in chronic pain. However, it is as yet unknown whether there is a specific brain region and a distinct neural circuit that helps the ACC to distinguish visceral and somatic pain. The present study demonstrates that claustrum (CL) glutamatergic neurons maybe responding to colorectal distention (CRD) rather than somatic stimulation and that a CL glutamatergic projection to ACC glutamatergic neuron regulates visceral pain in mice. Furthermore, excessive NMDA receptors and overactive CaMKII&alpha; in the ACC postsynaptic density (PSD) region were observed in mice with chronic visceral pain. Together, these findings reveal a novel neural circuity underlying the central sensitization of chronic visceral pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">AQP4-A25Q Point Mutation in Mice Depolymerizes Orthogonal Arrays of Particles and Decreases Polarized Expression of AQP4 Protein in Astrocytic Endfeet at the Blood-Brain Barrier</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is characterized by the formation of orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) comprising its M1 and M23 isoforms in the plasma membrane. However, the biological importance of OAP formation is obscure. Here, we developed an OAP depolymerization male mouse model by transgenic knock-in of an AQP4-A25Q mutation. Analyses of the mutant brain tissue using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, super-resolution imaging, and immunogold electron microscopy revealed remarkably reduced OAP structures and glial endfeet localization of the AQP4-A25Q mutant protein without effects on its overall mRNA and protein expression. <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice showed better survival and neurologic deficit scores when cerebral edema was induced by water intoxication or middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion. The brain water content and swelling of pericapillary astrocytic endfeet processes in <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice were significantly reduced, functionally supporting decreased AQP4 protein expression at the blood&ndash;brain barrier. The infarct volume and neuronal damage were also reduced in <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice in the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion model. Astrocyte activation in the brain was alleviated in <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice, which may be associated with decreased cell swelling. We conclude that the OAP structure of AQP4 plays a key role in its polarized expression in astrocytic endfeet processes at the blood&ndash;brain barrier. Therefore, our study provided new insights into intervention of cerebral cellular edema caused by stroke and traumatic brain injury through regulating AQP4 OAP formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is characterized by orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) comprising the M1 and M23 isoforms in the membrane. Here, an OAP depolymerization male mouse model induced by AQP4-A25Q mutation was first established, and the functions of OAP depolymerization in cerebral edema have been studied. The results revealed that AQP4 lost its OAP structure without affecting AQP4 mRNA and protein levels in AQP4-A25Q mice. AQP4-A25Q mutation mice has neuroprotective effects on cerebral edema induced by water intoxication and middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion through relieving the activation of astrocytes and suppressed microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. We concluded that the OAP structure of AQP4 plays a key role in its polarized expression in astrocytic endfeet processes at the blood&ndash;brain barrier.

                <p>Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is a diabetes complication experienced by many patients. Ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) neurons are essential mediators of the descending pain modulation system, yet the role of vlPAG astrocytes in DNP remains unclear. The present study applied a multidimensional approach to elucidate the role of these astrocytes in DNP. We verified the activation of astrocytes in different regions of the PAG in male DNP-model rats. We found that only astrocytes in the vlPAG exhibited increased growth. Furthermore, we described differences in vlPAG astrocyte activity at different time points during DNP progression. After the 14th day of modeling, vlPAG astrocytes exhibited obvious activation and morphologic changes. Furthermore, activation of Gq-designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (Gq-DREADDs) in vlPAG astrocytes in naive male rats induced neuropathic pain-like symptoms and pain-related aversion, whereas activation of Gi-DREADDs in vlPAG astrocytes in male DNP-model rats alleviated sensations of pain and promoted pain-related preference behavior. Thus, bidirectional manipulation of vlPAG astrocytes revealed their potential to regulate pain. Surprisingly, activation of Gi-DREADDs in vlPAG astrocytes also mitigated anxiety-like behavior induced by DNP. Thus, our results provide direct support for the hypothesis that vlPAG astrocytes regulate diabetes-associated neuropathic pain and concomitant anxiety-like behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many studies examined the association between the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and neuropathic pain. However, few studies have focused on the role of vlPAG astrocytes in diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and DNP-related emotional changes. This work confirmed the role of vlPAG astrocytes in DNP by applying a more direct and robust approach. We used chemogenetics to bidirectionally manipulate the activity of vlPAG astrocytes and revealed that vlPAG astrocytes regulate DNP and pain-related behavior. In addition, we discovered that activation of Gi-designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug in vlPAG astrocytes alleviated anxiety-like behavior induced by DNP. Together, these findings provide new insights into DNP and concomitant anxiety-like behavior and supply new therapeutic targets for treating DNP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Progressively Decreased HCN1 Channels Results in Cone Morphological Defects in Diabetic Retinopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Historically, diabetic retinopathy has been recognized as a vascular disease. Recent clinical evidence suggests the initiation of diabetic retinopathy with neuropathy rather than microangiopathy. However, the molecular mechanism that drives diabetic retinopathy-associated neuropathy remains mostly unexplored. Here, we reported progressive diabetic retinopathy defects in blood glucose levels, shortening of cone segments and uncoupled appearance of retinal vascular abnormalities from <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I> zebrafish to glucose-treated <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I> zebrafish of both sexes. Further single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed cones as the most vulnerable retinal neuron type that underwent three developmentally progressive cell states (States 1-3), predominantly present in WT animals, <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I>, and glucose-treated <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I>, respectively. Mechanistically, the expression of <I>hcn1</I> was progressively decreased in cones during its transition from State 1 to State 3. Furthermore, genetic <I>hcn1</I> disruption resulted in similar cone segment defects found in the diabetic retinopathy model, suggesting the involvement of progressive <I>hcn1</I> reduction in diabetic retinopathy-associated cone defects. Thus, our study provided a vertebrate retina model representing progressive diabetic retinopathy defects and further gained new mechanistic insights into the cone morphologic defects as an early neuropathy in diabetic retinopathy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We create a vertebrate retina model representing the progressive diabetic retinopathy-associated defects using zebrafish. Further systematic single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals two novel cell states of cones in response to different levels of higher glucose and the progressive decrease of HCN1 channels as a mechanism underlying cone defects in diabetic retinopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Enhanced mosquito vectorial capacity underlies the Cape Verde Zika epidemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noah H. Rose, Stéphanie Dabo, Silvânia da Veiga Leal, Massamba Sylla, Cheikh T. Diagne, Oumar Faye, Ousmane Faye, Amadou A. Sall, Carolyn S. McBride, Louis Lambrechts</p>

The explosive emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) across the Pacific and Americas since 2007 was associated with hundreds of thousands of human cases and severe outcomes, including congenital microcephaly caused by ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Although ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda, Africa has so far been exempt from large-scale ZIKV epidemics, despite widespread susceptibility among African human populations. A possible explanation for this pattern is natural variation among populations of the primary vector of ZIKV, the mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. Globally invasive populations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> outside of Africa are considered effective ZIKV vectors because they are human specialists with high intrinsic ZIKV susceptibility, whereas African populations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> across the species’ native range are predominantly generalists with low intrinsic ZIKV susceptibility, making them less likely to spread viruses in the human population. We test this idea by studying a notable exception to the patterns observed across most of Africa: Cape Verde experienced a large ZIKV outbreak in 2015 to 2016. We find that local <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> in Cape Verde have substantial human-specialist ancestry, show a robust behavioral preference for human hosts, and exhibit increased susceptibility to ZIKV infection, consistent with a key role for variation among mosquito populations in ZIKV epidemiology. These findings suggest that similar human-specialist populations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> in the nearby Sahel region of West Africa, which may be expanding in response to rapid urbanization, could serve as effective vectors for ZIKV in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Global genome decompaction leads to stochastic activation of gene expression as a first step toward fate commitment in human hematopoietic cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Romuald Parmentier, Laëtitia Racine, Alice Moussy, Sophie Chantalat, Ravi Sudharshan, Nan Papili Gao, Daniel Stockholm, Guillaume Corre, Geneviève Fourel, Jean-François Deleuze, Rudiyanto Gunawan, Andras Paldi</p>

When human cord blood–derived CD34+ cells are induced to differentiate, they undergo rapid and dynamic morphological and molecular transformations that are critical for fate commitment. In particular, the cells pass through a transitory phase known as “multilineage-primed” state. These cells are characterized by a mixed gene expression profile, different in each cell, with the coexpression of many genes characteristic for concurrent cell lineages. The aim of our study is to understand the mechanisms of the establishment and the exit from this transitory state. We investigated this issue using single-cell RNA sequencing and ATAC-seq. Two phases were detected. The first phase is a rapid and global chromatin decompaction that makes most of the gene promoters in the genome accessible for transcription. It results 24 h later in enhanced and pervasive transcription of the genome leading to the concomitant increase in the cell-to-cell variability of transcriptional profiles. The second phase is the exit from the multilineage-primed phase marked by a slow chromatin closure and a subsequent overall down-regulation of gene transcription. This process is selective and results in the emergence of coherent expression profiles corresponding to distinct cell subpopulations. The typical time scale of these events spans 48 to 72 h. These observations suggest that the nonspecificity of genome decompaction is the condition for the generation of a highly variable multilineage expression profile. The nonspecific phase is followed by specific regulatory actions that stabilize and maintain the activity of key genes, while the rest of the genome becomes repressed again by the chromatin recompaction. Thus, the initiation of differentiation is reminiscent of a constrained optimization process that associates the spontaneous generation of gene expression diversity to subsequent regulatory actions that maintain the activity of some genes, while the rest of the genome sinks back to the repressive closed chromatin state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Shared biophysical mechanisms determine early biofilm architecture development across different bacterial species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hannah Jeckel, Francisco Díaz-Pascual, Dominic J. Skinner, Boya Song, Eva Jiménez-Siebert, Kerstin Strenger, Eric Jelli, Sanika Vaidya, Jörn Dunkel, Knut Drescher</p>

Bacterial biofilms are among the most abundant multicellular structures on Earth and play essential roles in a wide range of ecological, medical, and industrial processes. However, general principles that govern the emergence of biofilm architecture across different species remain unknown. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and statistical analysis to identify shared biophysical mechanisms that determine early biofilm architecture development at the single-cell level, for the species <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> grown as microcolonies in flow chambers. Our data-driven analysis reveals that despite the many molecular differences between these species, the biofilm architecture differences can be described by only 2 control parameters: cellular aspect ratio and cell density. Further experiments using single-species mutants for which the cell aspect ratio and the cell density are systematically varied, and mechanistic simulations show that tuning these 2 control parameters reproduces biofilm architectures of different species. Altogether, our results show that biofilm microcolony architecture is determined by mechanical cell–cell interactions, which are conserved across different species.

                Background: Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most prevalent consequence of diabetes mellitus, and it has a significant impact on the patient's health. This study aims to evaluate effects of antigravity treadmill training on gait and balance in patients with DPN. Methods: The study included 45 males with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group (n=23) or the control group (n=22). For a period of 12 weeks, the experimental group received antigravity treadmill training (75% weight bearing, 30 min per session, three times per week) combined with traditional physical therapy. During the same time period, the control group received only traditional physical therapy. The Biodex Balance System was used to assess postural stability indices, while the GAITRite Walkway System was used to assess spatiotemporal gait parameters. All measurements were obtained before and at the end of the study after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: The mean values of all measured variables improved significantly in both groups (P<0.05), with the experimental group showing significantly greater improvements than the control group. The post-treatment gait parameters (i.e., step length, step time, double support time, velocity, and cadence) were 61.3 cm, 0.49 sec, 0.25 sec, 83.09 cm/sec, and 99.78 steps/min as well as 56.14 cm, 0.55 sec, 0.29 sec, 75.73 cm/sec, and 88.14 steps/min for the experimental and control group, respectively. The post-treatment overall stability index was 0.32 and 0.70 for the experimental and control group, respectively. Conclusions: Antigravity treadmill training in combination with traditional physical therapy appears to be superior to traditional physical therapy alone in terms of gait and balance training. As a result, the antigravity treadmill has been found to be an effective device for the rehabilitation of DPN patients.

                Objective: To estimate the association between the academic, personal, and work characteristics and scientific production of professors at a private university of Lima, Peru, in 2021. Methods: We undertook an observational, analytical, and cross-sectional study. The sample included 322 professors through simple random sampling. Two questionnaires were administered. The first gathered personal, academic, and work characteristics; while the second evaluated scientific production. The chi-squared test was used, with a significance level of p<0,05, to evaluate the association between the different characteristics and scientific production. A multiple logistic regression was analyzed through the Stepwise method to evaluate the relationship between the variables of exposure and scientific production. We calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: We analyzed 322 professors, 59,6% were male. Scientific production was associated with being registered in Renacyt (PR = 5,52; 95% CI: 2,14 to 4,23; p = <0.001), having a doctoral degree (PR = 2,45; 95% CI: 1,60 to 3,85; p = <0.001), having been a thesis advisor (PR = 3,83; 95% CI: 1,45 to 5,66; p = <0.001), having facilities to conduct research at the workplace (PR = 1,58; 95% CI: 1,12 to 2,47; p = 0.006), and having received training by the university (PR = 1,99; 95% CI: 1,55 to 2,56; p = 0,001). Conclusions: Scientific production was associated with being registered in Renacyt, having a doctoral degree, having been a thesis advisor, having facilities to conduct research at the workplace, and having being trained in research by the university. Hence, evaluation systems and the monitoring of university quality standards should be strengthened. In addition, it is necessary to undertake wider scope studies in order to enhance the strategies that promote professors’ research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community social responsibility of continued and appropriate use of silver amalgam as dental restorative material in southern India: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Yet, many organisations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. Percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analysed using Students-t test and Chi-square test.  Results: The majority of dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions: In spite of satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that a majority of practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world, infecting millions and causing economic disruption on an unprecedented scale. While everyone is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable communities are at the greatest risk. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between digital financial services (DFS), gender, and the vulnerability of informal settlement dwellers to COVID-19. Methods: We sampled a total of 2,697 households from 101 informal settlements across eleven out of sixteen administrative regions of Ghana. The regions were selected based on the relative severity of the pandemic, and the associated national lockdown regulations. Results: Adopting the multiple regression analytical technique, the results reveal three main findings: First, we observe that males in informal settlements are more likely to be exposed to infected people or a person who died from COVID-19 than females. However, women are more likely to be vulnerable to the pandemic than men as vulnerable populations have a higher susceptibility to pandemics due to less capacity to implement preparedness and response strategies due to disparities in their societal status. Finally, we find that the vulnerability of informal dwellers is moderated by the use of digital financial services. Conclusions: Our results provide policy implications for authorities designing policies to address vulnerability to pandemics in poor informal settlements in Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Olfactory Neuron Prokineticin‐2 as a Potential Target in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to outline the dynamics of prokineticin-2 pathway in relation to clinical-pathological features of Parkinson's disease by examining olfactory neurons of patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty-eight patients (26 de novo, newly diagnosed) and 31 sex/age-matched healthy controls underwent noninvasive mucosa brushing for olfactory neurons collection, and standard clinical assessment. Gene expression levels of prokineticin-2, prokineticin-2 receptors type 1 and 2, and prokineticin-2-long peptide were measured in olfactory neurons by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR); moreover, the prokineticin-2 protein and α-synuclein species (total and oligomeric) were quantified by immunofluorescence staining.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 expression was significantly increased in Parkinson's disease. De novo patients had higher prokineticin-2 levels, directly correlated with Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III motor score. In addition, oligomeric α-synuclein was higher in Parkinson's disease and directly correlated with prokineticin-2 protein levels. Total α-synuclein did not differ between patients and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 is a chemokine showing neuroprotective effects in experimental models of Parkinson's disease, but translational proof of its role in patients is still lacking. Here, we used olfactory neurons as the ideal tissue to analyze molecular stages of neurodegeneration in vivo, providing unprecedented evidence that the prokineticin-2 pathway is activated in patients with Parkinson's disease. Specifically, prokineticin-2 expression in olfactory neurons was higher at early disease stages, proportional to motor severity, and associated with oligomeric α-synuclein accumulation. These data, consistently with preclinical findings, support prokineticin-2 as a candidate target in Parkinson's disease, and validate reliability of olfactory neurons to reflect pathological changes of the disease.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Magnetic Resonance Images Implicate That Glymphatic Alterations Mediate Cognitive Dysfunction in Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The glymphatic system cleans amyloid and tau proteins from the brain in animal studies of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, there is no direct evidence showing this in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n = 50, 62.6 ± 5.4 years old, 36 women) with AD and normal controls underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and neuropsychological evaluation. Whole-brain glymphatic activity was measured by diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>ALPS-indexes showed negative correlations with deposition of amyloid and tau on PET images and positive correlations with cognitive scores even after adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and <i>APOE4</i> genotype covariates in multiple AD-related brain regions (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that ALPS-index acted as a significant mediator between regional standardized uptake value ratios of amyloid and tau images and cognitive dysfunction even after correcting for multiple covariates in AD-related brain regions. These regions are responsible for attention, memory, and executive function, which are vulnerable to sleep deprivation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system activity may act as a significant mediator in AD-related cognitive dysfunction even after adjusting for multiple covariates and gray matter volumes. ALPS-index may provide useful disease progression or treatment biomarkers for patients with AD as an indicator of modulation of glymphatic activity. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Here, we report the generation and comprehensive characterization of a knockin mouse model for the hotspot p.Arg87Cys variant of the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2</i>) gene, which was recently identified in individuals diagnosed with West syndrome, a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice recapitulated many neurological and neurobehavioral phenotypes of the patients, including spasmlike movements, microcephaly, and impaired social communication. Age-progressive cytoarchitectural disorganization and gliosis were also identified in the hippocampus of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice. Beyond identifying a decrease in CYFIP2 protein levels in the <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>

                fMRI has been increasingly used to study brain function in domestic dogs trained to lie still in MRI scanners. These studies highlight both similarities and differences between dogs and humans when presented with the same stimuli, raising intriguing questions about the concept of functional homologies in a coevolved species that shares the human environment.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Large-scale, closed-loop interrogation of neural circuits underlying cognition</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive functions are increasingly understood to involve coordinated activity patterns between multiple brain regions, and their disruption by neuropsychiatric disorders is similarly complex. Closed-loop neurostimulation can directly modulate neural signals with temporal and spatial precision. How to leverage such an approach to effectively identify and target distributed neural networks implicated in mediating cognition remains unclear. We review current conceptual and technical advances in this area, proposing that devices that enable large-scale acquisition, integrated processing, and multiregion, arbitrary waveform stimulation will be critical for mechanistically driven manipulation of cognitive processes in physiological and pathological brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Descending neuron population dynamics during odor-evoked and spontaneous limb-dependent behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering how the brain regulates motor circuits to control complex behaviors is an important, long-standing challenge in neuroscience. In the fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, this is coordinated by a population of ~ 1100 descending neurons (DNs). Activating only a few DNs is known to be sufficient to drive complex behaviors like walking and grooming. However, what additional role the larger population of DNs plays during natural behaviors remains largely unknown. For example, they may modulate core behavioral commands or comprise parallel pathways that are engaged depending on sensory context. We evaluated these possibilities by recording populations of nearly 100 DNs in individual tethered flies while they generated limb-dependent behaviors, including walking and grooming. We found that the largest fraction of recorded DNs encode walking while fewer are active during head grooming and resting. A large fraction of walk-encoding DNs encode turning and far fewer weakly encode speed. Although odor context does not determine which behavior-encoding DNs are recruited, a few DNs encode odors rather than behaviors. Lastly, we illustrate how one can identify individual neurons from DN population recordings by using their spatial, functional, and morphological properties. These results set the stage for a comprehensive, population-level understanding of how the brain’s descending signals regulate complex motor actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary shaping of human brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is distinct from those of other species in terms of size, organization, and connectivity. How do structural evolutionary differences drive patterns of neural activity enabling brain function? Here, we combine brain imaging and biophysical modeling to show that the anatomical wiring of the human brain distinctly shapes neural dynamics. This shaping is characterized by a narrower distribution of dynamic ranges across brain regions compared with that of chimpanzees, our closest living primate relatives. We find that such a narrow dynamic range distribution supports faster integration between regions, particularly in transmodal systems. Conversely, a broad dynamic range distribution as seen in chimpanzees facilitates brain processes relying more on neural interactions within specialized local brain systems. These findings suggest that human brain dynamics have evolved to foster rapid associative processes in service of complex cognitive functions and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid reconstruction of neural circuits using tissue expansion and light sheet microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Brain function is mediated by the physiological coordination of a vast, intricately connected network of molecular and cellular components. The physiological properties of neural network components can be quantified with high throughput. The ability to assess many animals per study has been critical in relating physiological properties to behavior. By contrast, the synaptic structure of neural circuits is presently quantifiable only with low throughput. This low throughput hampers efforts to understand how variations in network structure relate to variations in behavior. For neuroanatomical reconstruction there is a methodological gulf between electron-microscopic (EM) methods, which yield dense connectomes at considerable expense and low throughput, and light-microscopic (LM) methods, which provide molecular and cell-type specificity at high throughput but without synaptic resolution. To bridge this gulf, we developed a high-throughput analysis pipeline and imaging protocol using tissue expansion and light sheet microscopy (ExLLSM) to rapidly reconstruct selected circuits across many animals with single-synapse resolution and molecular contrast. Using <i>Drosophila</i> to validate this approach, we demonstrate that it yields synaptic counts similar to those obtained by EM, enables synaptic connectivity to be compared across sex and experience, and can be used to correlate structural connectivity, functional connectivity, and behavior. This approach fills a critical methodological gap in studying variability in the structure and function of neural circuits across individuals within and between species.

                The little skate <i>Leucoraja erinacea</i>, a cartilaginous fish, displays pelvic fin driven walking-like behavior using genetic programs and neuronal subtypes similar to those of land vertebrates. However, mechanistic studies on little skate motor circuit development have been limited, due to a lack of high-quality reference genome. Here, we generated an assembly of the little skate genome, with precise gene annotation and structures, which allowed post-genome analysis of spinal motor neurons (MNs) essential for locomotion. Through interspecies comparison of mouse, skate and chicken MN transcriptomes, shared and divergent gene expression profiles were identified. Comparison of accessible chromatin regions between mouse and skate MNs predicted shared transcription factor (TF) motifs with divergent ones, which could be used for achieving differential regulation of MN-expressed genes. A greater number of TF motif predictions were observed in MN-expressed genes in mouse than in little skate. These findings suggest conserved and divergent molecular mechanisms controlling MN development of vertebrates during evolution, which might contribute to intricate gene regulatory networks in the emergence of a more sophisticated motor system in tetrapods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consistent Under-reporting of Task Details in Motor Imagery Research</a></h4>

              
                Motor Imagery is a subject of longstanding scientific interest. However, critical details of motor imagery protocols are not always reported in full, hampering direct replication and translation of this work. The present review provides a quantitative assessment of the prevalence of under reporting in the recent motor imagery literature. Publications from the years 2018-2020 were examined, with 695 meeting the inclusion criteria for further examination. Of these studies, 64% (445/695) did not provide information about the modality of motor imagery (i.e.,kinesthetic, visual, or a mixture of both) used in the study. When visual or mixed imagery was specified, the details of the visual perspective to be used (i.e., first person, third person, or combinations of both) were not reported in 24% (25/103) of studies. Further analysis indicated that studies using questionnaires to assess motor imagery reported more information than those that did not. We conclude that studies using motor imagery consistently under-report key details of their protocols, which poses a significant problem for understanding, replicating, and translating motor imagery effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Taxonomy of Seizure Spread Patterns, Speed of Spread, and Associations With Structural Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Although seizure detection algorithms are widely used to localize seizure onset on intracranial EEG in epilepsy patients, relatively few studies focus on seizure activity beyond the seizure onset zone to direct treatment of surgical patients with epilepsy. To address this gap, we develop and compare fully automated deep learning algorithms to detect seizure activity on single channels, effectively quantifying spread when deployed across multiple channels. Across 275 seizures in 71 patients, we discover that the extent of seizure spread across the brain and the timing of seizure spread between temporal lobe regions is associated with both surgical outcomes and the brain's structural connectivity between temporal lobes. Finally, we uncover a hierarchical structure of seizure spread patterns highlighting the relationship between clusters of seizures. Collectively, these findings underscore the broad utility in quantifying seizure activity past seizure onset to identify novel mechanisms of seizure evolution and its relationship to potential seizure freedom.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A computational account of need states, reward and wanting</a></h4>

              
                Needing is related to deprivation of something biologically significant, and wanting is linked to reward prediction and dopamine and usually has more power on behavioral activation than need states alone. The interaction and independence between needing and wanting in terms of brain functioning is not so defined, and it is unclear why sometimes there is association and sometimes dissociation between them. To investigate this question, we used a computational approach. In this approach needing is related to a deviation from preferred states that living things tend to occupy in order to reduce entropy, while wanting is related to precision over policy leading to rewards. We found that: (1) when need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states is enhanced independently of wanting (reward prediction), showing a dissociation between needing and wanting. We also found that (2) when need states increase, precision (i.e. saliency) of the reward leading to the preferred state is also increased, suggesting that need can amplify the value of a reward and its wanting. This led to the development of a model showing how needing is dissociated from wanting in that the tendency to be in a preferred state is independent of prediction of reward; and how needing can amplify wanting, by attributing saliency to relevant reward prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal integration is a robust feature of perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Making informed decisions in noisy environments requires integrating sensory information over time. However, recent work has suggested that it may be difficult to determine whether an animal's decision-making strategy relies on evidence integration or not. In particular, strategies based on extrema-detection or random snapshots of the evidence stream may be difficult or even impossible to distinguish from classic evidence integration. Moreover, such non-integration strategies might be surprisingly common in experiments that aimed to study decisions based on integration. To determine whether temporal integration is central to perceptual decision making, we developed a new model-based approach for comparing temporal integration against alternative "non-integration" strategies for tasks in which the sensory signal is composed of discrete stimulus samples. We applied these methods to behavioral data from monkeys, rats, and humans performing a variety of sensory decision making tasks. In all species and tasks, we found converging evidence in favor of temporal integration. First, in all observers across studies, the integration model better accounted for standard behavioral statistics such as psychometric curves and psychophysical kernels. Second, we found that sensory samples with large evidence do not contribute disproportionately to subject choices, as predicted by an extrema-detection strategy. Finally, we provide a direct confirmation of temporal integration by showing that the sum of both early and late evidence contributed to observer decisions. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence suggesting that temporal integration is an ubiquitous feature in mammalian perceptual decision-making. Our study also highlights the benefits of using experimental paradigms where the temporal stream of sensory evidence is controlled explicitly by the experimenter, and known precisely by the analyst, to characterize the temporal properties of the decision process.

	<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) as well as noradrenaline (NA) are key modulators of various fundamental brain functions including the control of appetite. While manipulations that alter brain serotoninergic signaling clearly affect body weight, studies implicating 5-HT transporters and NA transporters (5-HTT and NAT, respectively) as a main drug treatment target for human obesity have not been conclusive. The aim of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to investigate how these central transporters are associated with changes of body weight after 6 months of dietary intervention or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in order to assess whether 5-HTT as well as NAT availability can predict weight loss and consequently treatment success. The study population consisted of two study cohorts using either the 5-HTT-selective radiotracer [11C]DASB to measure 5-HTT availability or the NAT-selective radiotracer [11C]MRB to assess NAT availability. Each group included non-obesity healthy participants, patients with severe obesity (body mass index, BMI, &amp;amp;gt;35 kg/m2) following a conservative dietary program (diet) and patients undergoing RYGB surgery within a 6-month follow-up. Overall, changes in BMI were not associated with changes of both 5-HTT and NAT availability, while 5-HTT availability in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) prior to intervention was associated with substantial BMI reduction after RYGB surgery and inversely related with modest BMI reduction after diet. Taken together, the data of our study indicate that 5-HTT and NAT are involved in the pathomechanism of obesity and have the potential to serve as predictors of treatment outcomes.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA) can be caused by the hyper activation of neuro-endocrine responses to stress. Among other endocrine factors and hypothalamic dysfunctions, the psychophysiological stress response can very frequently lead to an inhibition of the gonadal&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of neurovegetative activation in a group of young women affected by this condition. (2) Methods: Twenty-five women (mean age = 21.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.34) with FHA were consecutively recruited. Information on psycho-physiological distress was collected through a Psychopathological assessment (with the administration of three psychometric tests) and the Psychophysiological Stress Profile (PSP). Their data were compared with a control group. (3) Results: In the PSP, the patients displayed significantly higher values compared to controls in terms of the parameters of muscle tension (sEMG), skin conductance (SCL/SCR), heart rate (HR), and peripheral temperature (PT). Furthermore, autonomic hyper-activation at rest, marked reactivity to stress, and reduced recovery were seen. Moreover, a condition characterized by psychological distress (anxiety and somatic complaints, depressed and irritable mood, obsessive-compulsive traits) emerged. (4) Conclusions: The results highlight autonomic hyper-activation in FHA, which is also associated with psychological distress. Considering that FHA is a condition that affects multiple systems between mind and body, a multimodal, multidimensional, and multidisciplinary assessment of stress is becoming an emerging need.</p>

	<p>Background: After deep brain stimulation (DBS), hiccups as a complication may lead to extreme fatigue, sleep deprivation, or affected prognosis. Currently, the causes and risk factors of postoperative hiccups are unclear. In this study, we investigated the risk factors for hiccups after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) under general anesthesia. Methods: We retrospectively included patients who underwent STN DBS in the study, and collected data of demographic characteristics, clinical evaluations, and medications. According to the occurrence of hiccups within seven days after operation, the patients were divided into a hiccups group and non-hiccups group. The potentially involved risk factors for postoperative hiccups were statistically analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 191 patients were included in the study, of which 34 (17.80%) had postoperative transient persistent hiccups. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis showed that male, higher body mass index (BMI), smoker, Hoehn and Yahr stage (off), preoperative use of amantadine, hypnotic, Hamilton anxiety scale and Hamilton depression scale scores, and postoperative limited noninfectious peri-electrode edema in deep white matter were suspected risk factors for postoperative hiccups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.1). In binary multivariate logistic regression analysis, male (compared to female, OR 14.00; 95% CI, 1.74&amp;amp;ndash;112.43), postoperative limited noninfectious peri-electrode edema in deep white matter (OR, 7.63; 95% CI, 1.37&amp;amp;ndash;42.37), preoperative use of amantadine (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.08&amp;amp;ndash;12.28), and higher BMI (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.46&amp;amp;ndash;8.36) were independent risk factors for postoperative hiccups. Conclusions: This study is the first report about the risk factors of hiccups after STN DBS under general anesthesia for PD patients. The study suggests that male, higher BMI, preoperative use of amantadine, and postoperative limited noninfectious peri-electrode edema in deep white matter are independent risk factors for postoperative hiccups of STN-DBS for PD patients. Most hiccups after STN-DBS for PD patients were transient and self-limiting.</p>

	<p>Nasal obstruction is believed to play a significant role in the pathophysiology and management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, controversy remains about the ability of isolated nasal surgery to improve OSA. The objective of this systematic review is to give an updated overview of the literature on whether isolated nasal surgery can improve OSA subjectively (Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)) and/or objectively (polysomnography (PSG)). Methods: A systematic review was performed searching the electronic databases PubMed, Embase.com (accessed on 20 June 2022&amp;amp;#65289;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 20 June 2022. Eligible studies were reviewed for methodological quality using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the included studies reported no significant reduction in the apnea&amp;amp;ndash;hypopnea index (AHI) after isolated nasal surgery in patients with OSA. The meta-analysis suggests that the AHI slightly decreases after nasal surgery. The ESS was significantly lower after nasal surgery in eighteen studies. Conclusion: Based on the present analysis of objective outcomes, isolated nasal surgery did not improve the AHI significantly in the majority of the studies. The meta-analysis suggests a slight decrease in AHI after nasal surgery, but this reduction is not clinically relevant in terms of treatment success. Isolated nasal surgery should therefore not be recommended as a first-line treatment for OSA. Because of high study heterogeneity, these results should be interpreted with caution. Isolated nasal surgery can possibly improve OSA subjectively. Perhaps only OSA patients with complaints of nasal obstruction or OSA patients experiencing difficulty with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance would benefit from isolated nasal surgery.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are attracting increasing attention. Nevertheless, the risk factors for CMBs remain poorly identified, and the relationship between CMBs and cognitive impairment is still up for debate; (2) Objective: The present study analyzed the risk factors for CMBs and probed into the potential correlations between the presence, number, and location of CMBs and cognition; (3) Methods: This study enrolled 406 subjects who underwent both brain 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scans and cognitive testing. Spearman correlation was used to assess the relationship between the number of CMBs and cognition. Multiple linear regression was utilized to analyze the relationship between the regions of CMBs and each cognitive domain; (4) Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis results showed that age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.045, 95% confidence interval (95%CI; 1.009, 1.082)), smoking (OR = 3.604, 95%CI (1.995, 6.509)), hypertension (OR = 3.607, 95%CI (2.204, 5.901)), total cholesterol (OR = 0.611, 95%CI (0.467, 0.799)), and Amyloid-&amp;amp;beta;1-42 (A&amp;amp;beta;1-42) (OR = 1.028, 95%CI (1.018, 1.037)) were the influencing factors of CMBs. Education years (OR = 0.959, 95%CI (0.930, 0.988)), white matter lesions (OR = 2.687, 95%CI (1.782, 4.051)), and CMBs (OR = 21.246, 95%CI (5.728, 21.576)) were the risk factors for cognitive impairment. Hypertension increased the probability of deep CMBs (OR = 12.54, 95%CI (2.21, 71.28)), while A&amp;amp;beta;1-42 elevated the probability of lobar CMBs (OR = 1.02, 95%CI (1.00, 1.03)). There was a linear correlation between the number of CMBs and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.756, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, CMBs in each region were not related to specific cognitive domains (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), except CMBs in the mixed group that were negatively correlated with attention (OR = &amp;amp;minus;0.669, 95%CI (&amp;amp;minus;0.034, &amp;amp;minus;5.270)); (5) Conclusions: Taken together, serum A&amp;amp;beta;1-42 levels are related to the presence of CMBs. Cognitive impairment is correlated with the number of CMBs rather than their region. These findings suggest that CMBs play a role in cognitive impairment and that CMBs mark the presence of diffuse vascular injury and neurodegenerative brain damage.</p>

	<p>With aging comes degradation of bimanual movement performance. A hallmark feature of bimanual movements is movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD), an attenuation in the amplitude of beta oscillations associated with sensorimotor activation. Here, we investigated MRBD in 39 healthy adults (20 younger and 19 older adults) in frontal, central, and parietal regions across both hemispheres, during the planning and execution of a bimanual tracking task. Task accuracy decreased with age and during more difficult conditions when both hands had to move at different relative speeds. MRBD was mostly situated in the central region, and increased in older versus younger adults during movement execution but not planning. Irrespective of age, motor planning and execution were associated with increased MRBD in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Notably, right central MRBD during motor planning was associated with bimanual task performance, particularly in older adults. Specifically, persons who demonstrated high MRBD during motor planning performed better on the bimanual tracking task. Our results highlight the importance of lateralized MRBD during motor planning, thereby shining new light on previous research and providing a promising avenue for future interventions.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Cerebral autoregulation is altered during acute mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion. However, it is unknown how a history of concussion can impact cerebral haemodynamic activity during a task that elicits an autoregulatory response. (2) Methods: We assessed cerebral haemodynamic activity in those with a history of three or more concussions. The study included 44 retired athletes with concussion history and 25 control participants. We recorded participants&amp;amp;rsquo; relative changes in right and left pre-frontal cortex oxygenation collected by near-infrared spectroscopy and continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure measured by finger photoplethysmography. Participants completed a 5-min seated rest followed by a 5-min repeated squat (10-s) stand (10-s) maneuver (0.05 Hz) to elicit a cerebral autoregulatory response. Wavelet transformation was applied to the collected signals, allowing separation into cardiac interval I (0.6 to 2 Hz), respiratory interval II (0.145 to 0.6 Hz), and smooth muscle cell interval III (0.052 to 0.145 Hz). (3) Results: Significant increases at cardiac interval I were found for the wavelet amplitude of oxy-haemoglobin and haemoglobin difference at the right pre-frontal cortex. No significant difference was found at the left pre-frontal cortex or the blood pressure wavelet amplitudes. (4) Conclusion: Contributions from cardiac activity to the pre-frontal cortex oxygenation are elevated when eliciting dynamic cerebral autoregulation in those with a history of three or more concussions.</p>

	<p>Background: Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is damage to the optic nerve that is caused by external violence to the optic nerve during cranial and facial trauma. This kind of injury may result in impaired vision, has a high risk of blindness, and significantly impairs the neurological function of the patient. The treatment of TON is controversial, and many different approaches have been suggested. No one is considered best because the traumatic mechanism is not clear. Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical features of 37 patients diagnosed with TON without light perception who were treated at the Ninth People&#039;s Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine were investigated. A comparison was made between the patient&#039;s visual results before and after therapy. In addition, using a multifactorial linear regression model, the independent risk variables for the degree of improvement in visual acuity (IDVA) following surgery were determined. Results: After the operation, 17 people&#039;s visual acuity (VA) was lightless, 20 people&#039;s visual acuity was improved, and 13 people&#039;s visual acuity reached the standard of decerebrate. The efficiency of total optic nerve decompression was 54.1%, and the unblinded rate was 35.1%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that fractures of the optic canal and orbit were independent predictors of postoperative VA and IDVA. Conclusions: Total optic canal decompression may efficiently and safely enhance the vision of patients who have TON. Patients with TON who do not have fractures of the optic canal and orbit prior to decompression had a more favorable surgical prognosis.</p>

	<p>The regulation of surface tension (ST) by surfactants plays an important role in the human respiratory system but is largely unexplored in brain homeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in ST in relation to surfactant proteins (SPs) in children with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). CSF samples from 93 patients were analyzed for ST with a force tensiometer and SP-A-D and -G with ELISA assays. Patients belonged to six groups: (i) IVH before primary intervention (PI), (ii) IVH 4&amp;amp;ndash;28 days after PI, (iii) IVH 44&amp;amp;ndash;357 days after PI, (iv) hydrocephalus, (v) sepsis and (vi) controls. We found indirect correlations and significant differences in ST and SPs (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; except for SP-C, p = 0.007). Post hoc analyses showed significantly decreased ST in IVH patients before PI compared with patients with hydrocephalus, sepsis or controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but it increased in IVH patients over time. All SPs were significantly elevated when comparing IVH patients before PI with controls (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; except for SP-C, p = 0.003). Children suffering from IVH displayed an increase in SPs and a decrease in ST as coping mechanisms to preserve CSF flow. The increase in ST over time could serve as prognostic marker for the healing process.</p>

	<p>We evaluated the association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and executive function (EF) in young adults and the mediating effects of GMV on this relationship. This study involved 217 college students. An incremental load exercise program was used to evaluate VO2max. EF was estimated by the Flanker task, the 2-back task, and the more-odd shifting task, while structural magnetic resonance and region-based morphometry (RBM) were used to analyze GMV. The high CRF group had a shorter updating reaction time (RT) (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). CRF was positively correlated with the right orbital part of the middle frontal gyrus (ORBmid.R) GMV (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). ORBmid.R GMV was negatively correlated with updating RT (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). Model 4 in SPSS was used to assess the mediating effects of ORBmid.R GMV between CRF and updating RT. ORBmid.R GMV was established to have a partially mediating role between CRF and updating RT, which accounted for 19.6% of the total effect value. These findings indicate that the negative correlation between CRF and EF was significant, and ORBmid.R GMV played a mediating role in the relationship between CRF and EF, providing new evidence toward comprehensively revealing that CRF promotes EF performance.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have recently been proposed as promising biomarkers in different immune-mediated disorders. We evaluated the plasma levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and their tissue inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in a patients&amp;amp;rsquo; cohort with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: Plasma concentrations of MMP-9, MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were evaluated in 14 patients with generalized MG and 13 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The severity of disease was assessed by the modified Osserman classification. Results: Compared to the healthy subjects, MG patients had increased plasma concentrations of MMP-9, but reduced plasma levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-1. MG patients also showed a positive correlation between MMP-2 concentrations and disease severity. An increase in MMP-9 levels and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio and a decrease in MMP-2 levels and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio were detected in patients with generalized MG. Higher levels of MMP-2 correlated with greater disease severity. Discussion: Our preliminary findings suggest that MMPs and TIMPs could play a role in the pathogenesis of MG and might be associated with the risk of clinical deterioration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are macrophage-like cells exerting determinant roles in neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress processes during brain regeneration. We used zebrafish as a model of brain plasticity and repair. First, by performing L-plastin (Lcp1) immunohistochemistry and using transgenic Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:GFP</i>) or Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:mCherry</i>) fish, we analyzed the distribution of microglia/immune cells in the whole brain. Specific regional differences were evidenced in terms of microglia/immune cell density and morphology (elongated, branched, highly branched, and amoeboid). Taking advantage of Tg(<i>fli:GFP</i>) and Tg(<i>GFAP::GFP)</i> enabling the detection of endothelial cells and neural stem cells (NSCs), we highlighted the association of elongated microglia/immune cells with blood vessels and rounded/amoeboid microglia with NSCs. Second, after telencephalic injury, we showed that L-plastin cells were still abundantly present at 5 days post-lesion (dpl) and were associated with regenerative neurogenesis. Finally, RNA-sequencing analysis from injured telencephalon (5 dpl) confirmed the upregulation of microglia/immune cell markers and highlighted a significant increase of genes involved in oxidative stress <i>(nox2</i>, <i>nrf2a</i>, and <i>gsr)</i>. The analysis of antioxidant activities at 5 dpl also revealed an upregulation of superoxide dismutase and persistent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in the injured telencephalon. Also, microglia/immune cells were shown to be a source of oxidative stress at 5 dpl. Overall, our data provide a better characterization of microglia/immune cell distribution in the healthy zebrafish brain, highlighting some evolutionarily conserved features with mammals. They also emphasize that 5 days after injury, microglia/immune cells are still activated and are associated to a persistent redox imbalance. Together, these data raise the question of the role of oxidative stress in regenerative neurogenesis in zebrafish.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In vitro evaluation of ruminal digestibility and fermentation characteristics of local feedstuff-based beef cattle ration [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Consumption of local feedstuff Neptunia plena L. Benth and Leersia hexandra Swartz as a ration by the animal subject is expected to promote cost efficiency and production, as well as provide essential nutrition needs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), ammonia (NH3) production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in beef cattle. Methods: Feed and rumen inoculum samples were prepared and analyzed for their proximate contents. There were five treatment groups based on the diet received by beef cattle, namely: T1 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 100 %); T2 (Neptunia plena L. Benth 100%); T3 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 15% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth 15% + 70 % Other Feedstuffs); T4 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 20% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth 20% + 60% Other Feedstuffs); T5 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 25% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth 25% + 50% Other Feedstuffs). In vitro approaches were used to determine the DMD, OMD, NH3 production, and VFA in beef cattle. The data were analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of 95%, and a Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results: The results showed that the highest DMD (P<0.05) was derived from T 5 (56.47%), followed by T 4 (56.45%) and T 3 (55.90%). T 5=62.40% significantly (P<0.05) generated the highest OMD followed by T 4=61.95% and T 3=60.82%. This treatment had the highest NH 3 value, namely 5.02 mM, compared with T 3=4.55 mM, T 4=4.50 mM, T 2=4.22 mM, and T 1=3.99 mM. Furthermore, T5 had the highest VFA (P<0.05) compared with T 4, T 3, T 2, and T 1 with the value of 150.5, 133.0, 130.5, 130.0, and 123.5 mM, respectively. Conclusions: The local feedstuff-based ration contributed to beef cattle production.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Indigenous astronomical knowledge based seasonal weather forecast: evidence from Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Indigenous knowledge is still widely used by communities around the world to overcome social-ecological challenges. Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia have been searching for future weather phenomena using their indigenous knowledge. This study examines indigenous knowledge-based seasonal weather forecasts through using observable physical and temporal patterns of astronomic objects. Data were generated through using focus group discussion, experimental knowledgeable groups and direct observation in the year 2021. The finding reveals that Borana Oromo pastoralists commonly define physical and temporal outlooks of the Moon that are changed and/ or displayed periodically within a range of varying contexts. The observation of the Moon features have been offering sufficient lapse time in a more than/within ahead of a season/ and is relatively more accurate than the other traditional forecasting objects. The study showed that both temporal and spatial dimensions of the forecasting were actually happened in Ganna (March to May rainfall), Adolessa dry season (June to September) and Hgayya rainfall (October to November) seasons of 2021. This indigenous weather forecasting practices are still regularly used in every livelihood decision making process. However, this indigenous weather knowledge of Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia is not yet mainstreamed in the formal institutional structures. Curtailments of mobility, severity of drought, weakening of traditional institution, leaving of traditional life style and death of the knowledgeable elders are the major factors that are challenging the potential effects of the indigenous weather forecasting indicators of the features of moon in the study area.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors affecting the family development index in Indonesia: a cross-sectional survey in Aceh, a region with a 30 year armed conflict experience [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Family development index needs to be measured to ensure that the government has made optimal efforts to provide happiness to the families and to develop strategies in family development in a region with unique conditions. The objective of this study was to assess the family development index and its associated determinants in Aceh province, a region implementing Syariah Law in Indonesia with 30 years of armed conflict experience. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all regencies in Aceh. The study was a part of the Indonesian National Population and Family Planning Board project. The survey included one individual from each household that was selected randomly. Family development index was measured using a questionnaire consisting of 15 questions. The plausible determinants were collected and assessed through a face-to-face interview. The family development index was dichotomized using 85% cut-off into good and poor. A two-step logistic regression was used to determine the associated determinants. Results: A total of 10,000 households were included in the final analysis. 86.6% had a good family development index, with the highest in Sabang (97.6%) and the lowest index in Aceh Singkil (76.6%), respectively. A multivariate analysis indicated that the regency, marital status, educational qualification, ownership of health insurance, ownership of childbirth certificate, quality of the house (the type of floor, the source of electricity, the source of drinking water and the type of toilet facility) were associated with the family development index. Conclusion: Despite Aceh being one of the less developed provinces in Indonesia with long armed conflict experience, our data suggest that the family development index is relatively high and the index is influenced both by economic and non-economic determinants. To further improve the family development index, it is critical to develop both economic and non-economic components in the region and in the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlation of cervical progesterone levels to plasma progesterone levels in normal pregnancy and preterm labor: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The theory of “functional progesterone withdrawal” explains the role of progesterone prior to delivery. Previous studies mentioned the existence of progesterone regulation in the cervix that plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the cervix and cervical ripening. Cervical progesterone levels relate to activities of progesterone at the cervix, compared to its amount in circulation. The objective of this study was to measure cervical mucus progesterone levels and its correlation to plasma progesterone levels in pregnancy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in January-September 2010 at Persahabatan Hospital. The subjects were pregnant women in the 28th – 34th weeks of gestational age. In total, 72 subjects who met the criteria were divided into normal pregnancy group and preterm labor group. The cervical and plasma progesterone levels were measured using The Advia Centaur® Progesterone kit, which is a commercial immunoassay with direct chemiluminescence method. Results: There was a positive correlation (r=0.539) between cervical progesterone levels with plasma progesterone levels in the preterm labor group. There was no correlation between cervical progesterone levels with plasma progesterone levels in the normal pregnancy group. Conclusion:  This study showed that cervical progesterone levels could be measured through cervical mucus. A significant positive correlation was found by this study between cervical progesterone levels and plasma progesterone levels in the preterm labor group.  This study is expected to provide new insights for understanding the metabolism and the role of progesterone in maintaining cervical integrity during pregnancy, and its relation to prevention of preterm birth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paediatric critical COVID-19: clinical features and outcomes during five waves. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Data reported from several countries show that both children and adolescents accounted for less than 2% of symptomatic cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study objective was to describe the clinical characteristics of children admitted to Tunisian paediatric intensive care units (PICU). Methods: This was a single centre observational retrospective study conducted in the PICU of the Farhat Hached tertiary teaching hospital in Sousse, Tunisia during the period from the March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. We included all children aged from one month to 15 years with recent severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Infection was confirmed by the positivity of reverse transcriptase either for SARS-CoV2 or with presence of IgM antibodies. We included severe and critical forms of COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Results: 26 patients were included. 16 (61%) were one year old or younger. 18 patients (69.2%) were male. The median age in our research series was six months [1-156 months]. 17 (65.3%) patients had morbidities including mainly cardiac and neurological diseases. Fever (88.4%) and tachypnea (80.8%) were the most common clinical signs. Leukocytosis, high level of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, troponin, and pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels were found in 17, 8, 10, 6, and 10 cases respectively. Seven patients were initially treated with high-flow nasal cannula and didn't need escalation. Three were intubated. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in six cases. Antibiotics and corticosteroids were used in 84% and 42.3% of children. The median paediatric intensive care unit length-of-stay was 10.9 days. There were six deaths. Conclusion: Paediatricians should be vigilant to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children admitted in PICU. Special attention should be allocated to infants under one year of age, of the male gender, and for children with comorbidities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Laboratory risk factors for mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several studies have reported clinical characteristics and risk factors for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19.4–6 However, data exclusively from the ICU especially in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) remain lacking. This study aimed to explore risk factors associated with mortality based on laboratory parameters at hospital admission in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study. Data from the electronic medical records were collected retrospectively from all severe and critical COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission in two designated COVID-19 hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors associated with ICU mortality. The model performance was evaluated by the area under curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: There were 334 patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 included in the statistical analysis. The ICU mortality rate was 75.1%, with 251 patients died in the hospital. Independent risk factors associated mortality including white blood cell count >13.9 x109/L (OR=2.41; 95% CI, 1.15-5.06, p=0.02), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio >10.7 (OR=2.20; 95% CI, 1.20 – 4.03, p=0.011), and creatinine >0.8 mg/dL (OR=3.55; 95% CI, 2.05 – 6.17, p<0.001). The model yielded an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.659-0.780, p<0.0001) for predicting ICU mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: White blood cell, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and serum creatinine on hospital admission are significant predictors of mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. The ICU mortality rate during the second wave of the pandemic in this study was high.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer in health care quality improvements. A second systematic review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traditionally, EB-CPGs have been believed to mainly improve the quality and consistency of health care, but this claim must be conclusively proven. We used the Donabedian three-dimensional model (structure, process, and patient outcomes) to assess improvements in the quality of medical care derived from implementing EB-CPGs. This study corresponds to the second systematic review carried out as a series of studies on different clinical issues that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the EB-CPG for improving the quality of care. Methods: We followed the methods described by the Cochrane Handbook and presented a descriptive analysis because of the high heterogeneity found across the included studies. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EBSCO Host databases, as well as the grey literature, between 1990 and April 2021. No language restrictions were applied. Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were selected. Results: Of the total of 364 interventions included in the eleven RCTs evaluated, 11 (3%) were related to healthcare structure, 51 (14%) to the healthcare delivery process and 302 (83%) to patient outcomes. Regarding the impact of using the EB-CPGs, in 303 interventions (83%), there were no significant differences between the control and experimental groups. In 4 interventions (1%), the result favoured the control and intervention groups in 57 of the interventions (16%). Conclusions: Our study showed that EB-CPGs slightly enhanced the quality of health care in the three dimensions described by Donabedian. Future RCTs should improve their design and methodological rigour by considering the certainty of the evidence supporting the EB-CPGs recommendations. In that context, broader analyses could be performed, having more concise hypotheses for further research. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020205594
