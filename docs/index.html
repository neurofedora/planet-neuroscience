              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcription, structure, and organoids translate time across the lifespan of humans and great apes</a></h4>

              
                How the neural structures supporting human cognition develop and arose in evolution is an enduring question of interest. Yet, we still lack appropriate procedures to align ages across primates, and this lacuna has hindered progress in understanding the evolution of biological programs. We generated a dataset of unprecedented size consisting of 573 time points from abrupt and gradual changes in behavior, anatomy, and transcription across human and 8 non-human primate species. We included time points from diverse human populations to capture within-species variation in the generation of cross-species age alignments. We also extracted corresponding ages from organoids. The identification of corresponding ages across the lifespan of 8 primate species, including apes (e.g., orangutans, gorillas) and monkeys (i.e., marmosets, macaques) reveal that some biological pathways are extended in humans compared with some non-human primates. Particularly, the human lifespan is unusually extended relative to studied nonhuman primates demonstrating that very old age is a phase of life in humans that does not map to other studied primate species. More generally, our work prompts a reevaluation in the choice of a model system to understand aging given very old age in humans is a period of life with a clear counterpart in great apes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neuropeptidergic connectome of C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Efforts are currently ongoing to map synaptic wiring diagrams or connectomes in order to understand the neural basis of brain function. However, chemical synapses represent only one type of functionally important neuronal connection; in particular, extrasynaptic, "wireless" signaling by neuropeptides is widespread and plays essential roles in all nervous systems. By integrating single-cell anatomical and gene expression datasets with comprehensive biochemical analysis of receptor-ligand interactions, we have generated a draft connectome of neuropeptide signaling in the C. elegans nervous system. This neuropeptide connectome is characterized by a high connection density, extended signaling cascades, autocrine foci, and a decentralized topology, with a large, highly interconnected core containing three constituent communities sharing similar patterns of input connectivity. Intriguingly, several of the most important nodes in this connectome are little-studied neurons that are specialized for peptidergic neuromodulation. We anticipate that the C. elegans neuropeptidergic connectome will serve as a prototype to understand basic organizational principles of neuroendocrine signaling networks.

                A role for axon guidance genes in the adult nervous system has not been fully elucidated. We performed an RNAi screen against guidance genes in the adult Drosophila melanogaster nervous system and identified fourteen genes required for adult survival and normal motility. Additionally, we show that adult expression of Semaphorins and Plexins in motoneurons is necessary for neuronal survival, indicating that guidance genes have critical functions in the mature nervous system.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is now well-established that the hippocampal CA2 region plays an important role in social recognition memory in adult mice. The CA2 is also important for the earliest social memories, including those that mice have for their mothers and littermates, which manifest themselves as a social preference for familiarity over novelty. The role of the CA2 in the development of social memory for recently encountered same-age conspecifics, that is, peers, has not been previously reported. Here, we used a direct social interaction test to characterize the emergence of novelty preference for peers during development and found that at the end of the second postnatal week, pups begin to significantly prefer novel over familiar peers. Using chemogenetic inhibition at this time, we showed that CA2 activity is necessary for the emergence of novelty preference and for the ability to distinguish never encountered from recently encountered peers. In adulthood, the CA2 region is known to integrate a large number of inputs from various sources, many of which participate in social recognition memory, but previous studies have not determined whether these afferents are present at adult levels by the end of the second postnatal week. To explore the development of CA2 inputs, we used immunolabeling and retrograde adenovirus circuit tracing and found that, by the end of the second postnatal week, the CA2 is innervated by many regions, including the dentate gyrus, supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, the lateral entorhinal cortex, and the median raphe nucleus. Using retroviral labeling of postnatally generated granule cells in the dentate gyrus, we found that mossy fiber projections to the CA2 mature faster during development than those generated in adulthood. Together, our findings indicate that the CA2 is partially mature in afferent connectivity by the end of the second postnatal week, connections that likely facilitate the emergence of social recognition memory and preference for novel peers.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding functional correlations between the activities of neuron populations is vital for the analysis of neuronal networks. Analyzing large-scale neuroimaging data obtained from hundreds of neurons simultaneously poses significant visualization challenges. We developed V-NeuroStack, a novel network visualization tool to visualize data obtained using calcium imaging of spontaneous activity of neurons in a mouse brain slice as well as in vivo using two-photon imaging. V-NeuroStack creates 3D time stacks by stacking 2D time frames for a time-series dataset. It provides a web interface to explore and analyze data using both 3D and 2D visualization techniques. Previous attempts to analyze such data have been limited by the tools available to visualize large numbers of correlated activity traces. V-NeuroStack's 3D view is used to explore patterns in dynamic large-scale correlations between neurons over time. The 2D view is used to examine any timestep of interest in greater detail. Furthermore, a dual-line graph provides the ability to explore the raw and first-derivative values of activity from an individual or a functional cluster of neurons. V-NeuroStack can scale to datasets with at least a few thousand temporal snapshots. It can potentially support future advancements in in vitro and in vivo data capturing techniques to bring forth novel hypotheses by allowing unambiguous visualization of massive patterns in neuronal activity data.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the role of contour integration in visual inference</a></h4>

              
                Under difficult viewing conditions, the brain's visual system uses a variety of recurrent modulatory mechanisms to augment feed-forward processing. One resulting phenomenon is contour integration, which occurs in the primary visual (V1) cortex and strengthens neural responses to edges if they belong to a larger smooth contour. Computational models have contributed to an understanding of the circuit mechanisms of contour integration, but less is known about its role in visual perception. To address this gap, we embedded a biologically grounded model of contour integration in a task-driven artificial neural network, and trained it using a gradient-descent variant. We used this model to explore how brain-like contour integration may be optimized for high-level visual objectives as well as its potential roles in perception. When the model was trained to detect contours in a background of random edges, a task commonly used to examine contour integration in the brain, it closely mirrored the brain in terms of behavior, neural responses, and lateral connection patterns. When trained on natural images, the model enhanced weaker contours and distinguished whether two points lay on the same vs. different contours. The model learnt robust features that generalized well to out-of-training-distribution stimuli. Surprisingly, and in contrast with the synthetic task, a parameter-matched control network without recurrence performed the same or better than the model on the natural-image tasks. Thus a contour integration mechanism is not essential to perform these more naturalistic contour-related tasks. Finally, the best performance in all tasks was achieved by a modified contour integration model that did not distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-specific activation of microglial genes in a mouse model of AD</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that increases its prevalence with age. AD is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive function, leading to dementia. The conventional pathological hallmarks of AD include deposition of amyloid plaque, aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles, and sustained inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed that immune responses play an important role in AD progression. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies of the AD mouse model identified the disease-associated microglia (DAM) population during AD progression, where the pro-inflammatory activity was mediated by Trem2. However, the time points and nature of DAM activation remain largely unknown. Here, we compared the time-result bulk sequencing andsingle nuclei RNA sequencing data in a mouse model of AD. We identified an age-dependent activation of Trem2 targeted immune-related genes. We showed that Trem2 affected DAM activation at an early stage (4-8 months) rather than the late stage (12-16 months). Our results highlight an age-dependent change in the Trem2-linked immune response in AD.

                Background: Choroid plexus (ChP) enlargement has been described in first-episode psychosis and psychosis spectrum disorders, but whether ChP enlargement occurs before disease onset is unknown. This study investigated whether ChP volume is enlarged in individuals with clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis and whether these changes are related to clinical, cortical, and plasma analyte measures. Methods: Clinical and neuroimaging data from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS2) was used for analysis. A total of 509 participants (169 controls, 340 CHR) were recruited across 8 sites. Conversion status was determined until 2-years of follow-up, with 36 patients developing psychosis. The lateral ventricle ChP was manually segmented from all available baseline brain scans. A subsample of 84 participants (31 controls, 53 CHR) had plasma analyte and neuroimaging data. Results: Compared to controls, CHR overall (d=0.22, p=0.017) and converters (d=0.21, p=0.041) demonstrated higher ChP volumes, but not nonconverters. In CHR, greater ChP volume correlated with lower cortical (r=-0.22, p<0.001) and subcortical gray matter volume (r=-0.21, p<0.001), total white matter volume (r=-0.28,p<0.001), and larger lateral ventricle volume (r=0.63,p<0.001). In CHR, greater ChP volume, but not lateral ventricle volume, correlated with higher C3 (r=0.39, p=0.005) and TSH (r=0.31, p=0.026), and lower MMP7 (r=-0.30, p=0.032) and UMOD (r=-0.33, p=0.019). Conclusions and Relevance: CHR and converters to psychosis demonstrated significantly larger ChP volumes compared to controls. ChP enlargement was associated with cortical volume reduction and increased peripheral inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that the ChP may be a key biomarker in psychosis disease onset and conversion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-regulated growth of motoneurons at the neuromuscular junction is mediated by NADPH oxidases</a></h4>

              
                Neurons respond to changes in the levels of activity they experience in a variety of ways, including structural changes at pre- and postsynaptic terminals. An essential plasticity signal required for such activity-regulated structural adjustments are reactive oxygen species (ROS). To identify sources of activity-regulated ROS required for structural plasticity in vivo we used the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction as a highly tractable experimental model system. For adjustments of presynaptic motor terminals, we found a requirement for both NADPH oxidases, Nox and Dual Oxidase (Duox), that are encoded in the Drosophila genome. This contrasts with the postsynaptic dendrites from which Nox is excluded. NADPH oxidases generate ROS to the extracellular space. Here, we show that two aquaporins, Bib and Drip, are necessary ROS conduits in the presynaptic motoneuron for activity regulated, NADPH oxidase dependent changes in presynaptic motoneuron terminal growth. Our data further suggest that different aspects of neuronal activity-regulated structural changes might be regulated by different ROS sources: changes in bouton number require both NADPH oxidases, while activity-regulated changes in the number of active zones might be modulated by other sources of ROS. Overall, our results show NADPH oxidases as important enzymes for mediating activity-regulated plasticity adjustments in neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Primary motor cortex drives expressive facial movements related to reward processing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals exhibit expressive facial movements in a wide range of behavioral contexts. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain enigmatic. In reward-based learning tasks, mice make expressive movements with their whiskers and nose at the timings of reward expectation and acquisition. Here we show that optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons (oDAS) as a reward is sufficient to induce such expressive movements. Pavlovian conditioning with a sensory cue and oDAS elicited both cue-locked (reward-expecting) and oDAS-aligned (reward-acquiring) orofacial movements. Inhibition or knock-out of dopamine D1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens inhibited oDAS-induced motion but spared cue-locked motion. Silencing the whisker primary motor cortex (wM1) abolished both oDAS-induced and cue-locked orofacial movements. We found specific neuronal populations in wM1 representing either oDAS-aligned or cue-locked whisker movements. Thus, reward-acquiring and reward-expecting facial movements are driven by accumbal D1 receptor-dependent and -independent neuronal mechanisms, respectively, both dominantly regulated by wM1 activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Routing States Transition During Oscillatory Bursts and Attention States</a></h4>

              
                Neural information routing relies on spatiotemporal activity dynamics across interconnected brain areas. However, it remains unclear how routing states emerge at fast spiking timescales and interact with the slower activity dynamics of larger networks during cognitive processes. Here, we show that localized neural spiking events generate long-range directional routing states with spiking activity in distant brain areas that dynamically switch or amplify during oscillatory bursts, selective attention, and decision-making. Computational modeling and neural recordings from lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and striatum of nonhuman primates revealed that cross-areal, directional routing states arise within ~20 ms around spikes of single neurons. On average, LPFC spikes led activity in the ACC and striatum by few milliseconds. The routing state was amplified during LPFC beta bursts between the LPFC and striatum and switched direction during ACC theta bursts between ACC and LPFC. Selective attention amplified the lead of these theta-specific lead-ensembles in the ACC, while decision-making amplified the lead of ACC and LPFC spiking output over the striatum. Notably, the fast lead/lag relationships of cross-areal neuronal ensembles that were modulated by attention states or decision-making predicted firing rate dynamics of their neurons during those functional states at slower timescales.

                Learning to associate a cue with its aversive consequence enables animals to prevent harm. Associative conditioning relies on activity within the cerebellum, but little is known about how changes in synaptic inputs to its output neurons shape their membrane potential dynamics during learning. Here we studied these changes in inputs using whole-cell and juxtasomal recordings of cerebellar nucleus neurons in awake mice during eyeblink conditioning and doing post-learning structural analysis. We identified changes in mossy fiber- and Purkinje cell-, but not climbing fiber-, inputs, leading to changes in subthreshold processing that correlate with the level and direction of the conditioned eyelid movements. These changes appear sufficient, as optogenetic stimulation of the inputs evoke incremental eyelid closures over the course of conditioning. Our data reveal how electrophysiological and structural modifications at the level of synaptic inputs to cerebellar output neurons facilitate conditioning of eyelid movements.

                In recent years, multiple neuroimaging studies have utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxometry to visualize and explore the intricate laminar microstructure of the cerebral cortex, which is considered a unique anatomical mark of the development, function, connectivity, and even various pathologies of the brain. T1 relaxometry has successfully delineated laminar components across the cortex, expanding its applicability from solely a direct measure of myelin content to an indirect measure of cortical cytoarchitecture. However, analyzing the resulting laminar dataset is no simple task due to its multidimensionality and geometric complexity: six cortical laminar components, representing the regionally varying microstructure of the cortex, are dispersed across a triangulated surface, representing the intricate and tortuous geometry of the cortex. In this study we implement an adaptation of an algorithm that clusters cell omics profiles using their spatial organization to cluster multidimensional surface-based microstructural data in the cortex. The correspondence of the results with an established atlas of cytoarchitectonic features provides further validation of the T1 imaging framework for cortical laminar composition analysis and highlights the role of MRI neuroimaging as a probe of tissue microstructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical tracking of continuous speech under bimodal divided attention</a></h4>

              
                Speech processing often occurs amidst competing inputs from other modalities, e.g., listening to the radio while driving. We examined the extent to which dividing attention between auditory and visual modalities (bimodal divided attention) impacts neural processing of natural continuous speech from acoustic to linguistic levels of representation. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses when human participants performed a challenging primary visual task, imposing low or high cognitive load while listening to audiobook stories as a secondary task. The two dual-task conditions were contrasted with an auditory single-task condition in which participants attended to stories while ignoring visual stimuli. Behaviorally, the high load dual-task condition was associated with lower speech comprehension accuracy relative to the other two conditions. We fitted multivariate temporal response function encoding models to predict EEG responses from acoustic and linguistic speech features at different representation levels, including auditory spectrograms and information-theoretic models of sublexical-, word-form-, and sentence-level representations. Neural tracking of most acoustic and linguistic features remained unchanged with increasing dual-task load, despite unambiguous behavioral and neural evidence of the high load dual-task condition being more demanding. Compared to the auditory single-task condition, dual-task conditions selectively reduced neural tracking of only some acoustic and linguistic features, mainly at latencies >200 ms, while earlier latencies were surprisingly unaffected. These findings indicate that behavioral effects of bimodal divided attention on continuous speech processing occur not due to impaired early sensory representations but likely at later cognitive processing stages. Crossmodal attention-related mechanisms may not be uniform across different speech processing levels.

                The increase of brain neuron number in relation with brain size is currently considered to be the major evolutionary path to high cognitive power in amniotes. However, how changes in neuron density did contribute to the evolution of the information-processing capacity of the brain remains unanswered. High neuron densities are seen as the main reason why the fovea located at the optical center of the retina is responsible for sharp vision in birds and primates. The emergence of foveal vision is considered as a breakthrough innovation in visual system evolution. We found that neuron densities in the largest visual center of the midbrain, i.e., the optic tectum, are two to four times higher in modern birds with one or two foveae compared to birds deprived of this specialty. Interspecies comparisons enabled us to identify elements of a hitherto unknown developmental process set up by foveate birds for increasing neuron density in the upper layers of their optic tectum. The progenitor cells that generate these neurons proliferate in a ventricular zone that can expand only radially. In this particular context, the number of cells in ontogenetic columns increases, thereby setting the conditions for higher cell densities in the upper layers once neurons did migrate.

                Quantification of individual cells' morphology and their distribution at the whole brain scale is essential to understand the structure and diversity of cell types. Despite recent technological advances, especially single cell labeling and whole brain imaging, for many prevailing animal models, it is exceedingly challenging to reuse similar technologies to study human brains. Here we propose Adaptive Cell Tomography (ACTomography), a low-cost, high-throughput, high-efficacy tomography approach, based on adaptive targeting of individual cells suitable for human-brain scale modeling of single neurons to characterize their 3-D structures, statistical distributions, and extensible for other cellular features. Specifically, we established a platform to inject dyes into cortical neurons in surgical tissues of 18 patients with brain tumors or other conditions and 1 donated fresh postmortem brain. We collected 3-D images of 1746 cortical neurons, of which 852 neurons were subsequentially reconstructed to quantify their local dendritic morphology, and mapped to standard atlases both computationally and semantically. In our data, human neurons are more diverse across brain regions than by subject age or gender. The strong stereotypy within cohorts of brain regions allows generating a statistical tensor-field of neuron morphology to characterize 3-D anatomical modularity of a human brain.

                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is functionally closely related with the insula and the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC). Extensive work on their functional relationships has led to the salience network theory and advanced understanding of value-based learning and decision making. However, the anatomical connections between the ACC and the two regions remain unknown in the human brain. Despite the anatomical ground truth established by nonhuman primate (NHP) tract-tracing, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has not seen success identifying homologous pathways in humans. In this study we show that the negative finding does not reflect a cross-species discrepancy but rather a technical issue. We used NHP dMRI as a bridge to compare the ground-truth pathways in NHPs and dMRI-derived pathways in humans. The insight from NHP data helped pinpoint a bias in fiber orientation distribution functions (fODFs) caused by the disproportion of anterior-posterior vs. medial-lateral fibers in the human brain. Guided by this information, we successfully recovered the ACC-insula and ACC-vlPFC pathways that followed the same trajectories as in the NHP dMRI and tract-tracing data. Our findings provide an anatomical basis for the functional interactions among the ACC, the insula and the vlPFC.

                This study investigated how proactive and reactive cognitive control processing in the brain was associated with habitual sleep health. BOLD fMRI data was acquired from 81 healthy adults with normal sleep (41 females, age 20.96 - 39.58 years) during a test of cognitive control ("Not-X CPT"). Sleep health was assessed in the week before MRI scanning, using both objective (actigraphy) and self-report measures. Multiple measures indicating poorer sleep health - including later/more variable sleep timing, later chronotype preference, more insomnia symptoms and lower sleep efficiency - were associated with stronger and more widespread BOLD activations (adjusted for age, sex, education, and fMRI task performance). Poorer sleep health was predominantly associated with stronger reactive cognitive control activation, indicating an overall "hyper-reactive" brain state. Analysis of time-on-task effects showed that, with longer time on task, poorer sleep health was predominantly associated with increased proactive cognitive control activation, indicating recruitment of more neural resources over time. Finally, shorter objective sleep duration was associated with poorer task performance and lower BOLD activation with time on task. In conclusion, even in normal sleepers, relatively poorer sleep health is associated with altered cognitive control processing, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms and / or inefficient neural processing.

                Stress is prevalent in the lives of those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and influences SUD outcomes. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms through which stress promotes drug use is important for the development of effective SUD interventions. We have developed a model wherein exposure to a stressor, uncontrollable electric footshock, daily at the time of cocaine self-administration (SA) escalates intake in male rats. Here we test the hypothesis that stress-induced escalation of cocaine SA is the result of persistent recruitment of endocannabinoid signaling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/inf, i.v.) during 2-h sessions comprised of four 30-min SA components separated by 5-min shock sequences or 5-min shock-free periods for 14 days. Footshock produced an escalation of cocaine SA that persisted following shock removal. Systemic administration of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) antagonist, AM251, attenuated cocaine intake only in rats with a history of stress. This effect was localized to the mesolimbic system, as intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) micro-infusions of AM251 also attenuated cocaine intake only in stress-escalated rats. Cocaine SA, regardless of stress history, increases CB1R binding site density in the VTA, but not NAc shell. Following extinction, cocaine-primed reinstatement (10 mg/kg, ip) was increased in rats with prior footshock during SA. AM251 attenuated reinstatement only in rats with a stress history. Altogether, these data suggest that repeated stress at the time of cocaine use recruits endocannabinoid signaling in mesolimbic regions to escalate intake and heighten relapse susceptibility.

                Consumption of highly palatable foods is thought to be influenced by the central reward circuits that control both the hedonic component (liking) of food and the motivation (wanting) to eat it. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain center implicated in these processes, contains two main populations: D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons. The precise contribution of these cells to these reward-associated behaviors is still unresolved and establishing a causal relationship between activation of each neuronal subtype and its effect on motivated behaviors has proven challenging. To understand the forces underlying eating behavior that may lead to overconsumption, we assessed liking and wanting in separate sets of experiments. First, in a free palatable food consumption paradigm, we analyzed licking microstructure to demonstrate that both NAc D1 and D2 cell activity are more strongly correlated with liking than wanting. Second, we evaluated motivation to retrieve a reward (wanting) in an operant task. Both NAc D1 and D2 cell activity encoded motivation during the reward-approach phase, after the cue and before consumption. Lastly, we show that opto-excitation of NAc D1 cells, but not D2 cells, intensifies incentive motivation to overconsume the optostimulation-paired palatable food in a two-bottle choice task. This demonstrates an important role for NAc D1 cells in preference formation and promoting consumption of palatable foods. Our results suggest a fundamental difference: NAc D1 cells promote reinforced behaviors under an operant paradigm or a Pavlovian association task. In contrast, NAc D2 cells are essential for initiating retrieval of palatable food but, once consumed, reduced activity of these cells allows prolonged eating episodes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unified control of temporal and spatial scales of sensorimotor behavior through neuromodulation of short-term synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators such as dopamine have been shown to modulate short-term synaptic plasticity (STP). Here we propose that the neuromodulation of STP provides a general mechanism to scale neural dynamics and motor outputs in time and space. We trained RNNs that incorporated STP to produce complex motor trajectories-handwritten digits-with different temporal (speed) and spatial (size) scales. The learned dynamics underwent temporal and spatial scaling when higher synaptic release probabilities corresponded to higher speed/size. Neuromodulation of STP enhanced temporal or spatial generalization compared to weight modulation alone. The model accounted for the data of two experimental studies involving flexible sensorimotor timing. Our results address a long-standing debate regarding the role of dopamine in timing and predict novel mechanisms by which dopamine may slow down neural dynamics and thus slow 'clock' speed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonhuman primates exploit the prior assumption that the visual world is vertical</a></h4>

              
                When human subjects tilt their heads in dark surroundings, the noisiness of vestibular information impedes precise reports on objects orientation with respect to earth vertical axis. This difficulty is mitigated if a vertical visual background is available. Tilted visual backgrounds induce feelings of head tilt in subjects who are in fact upright. This is often explained as a result of the brain resorting to the prior assumption that natural visual backgrounds are vertical. Here, we tested whether monkeys show comparable perceptual mechanisms. To this end we trained two monkeys to align a visual arrow to a vertical reference line that had variable luminance across trials, while including a large, clearly visible background square whose orientation changed from trial to trial. On around 20% of all trials, the vertical reference line was left out to measure the subjective visual vertical (SVV). When the frame was upright, the monkeys SVV was aligned with the gravitational vertical. In accordance with the perceptual reports of humans, however, when the frame was tilted, it induced an illusion of head tilt as indicated by a bias in SVV towards the frame orientation. Thus all primates exploit the prior assumption that the visual world is vertical.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell RNA-seq reveals alterations in peripheral CX3CR1 and nonclassical monocytes in familial tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging evidence from mouse models is beginning to elucidate the brain's immune response to tau pathology, but little is known about the nature of this response in humans. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent tau pathology and the local inflammatory response within the brain influence the broader immune system. Methods: To address these questions, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from carriers of pathogenic variants in MAPT, the gene encoding tau. Results: Analysis of ~181,000 individual PBMC transcriptomes from MAPT pathogenic variant carriers (n = 8) and healthy non-carrier controls (n = 8) demonstrated striking differential expression in monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. We observed a marked reduction in the expression of CX3CR1 - the gene encoding the fractalkine receptor that is known to modulate tau pathology in mouse models - in monocytes and NK cells. We also observed a significant reduction in the abundance of nonclassical monocytes and dysregulated expression of nonclassical monocyte marker genes, including FCGR3A. Finally, we identified reductions in TMEM176A and TMEM176B, genes thought to be involved in the inflammatory response in human microglia. We confirmed differential expression of select biologically relevant genes dysregulated in our scRNA-seq data using droplet digital PCR as an orthogonal technique for quantitative validation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that human peripheral immune cell expression and abundance are modulated by tau-associated pathophysiologic changes. CX3CR1 and nonclassical monocytes in particular will be a focus of future work exploring the role of these peripheral signals in additional tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual Occlusions Result in Phase Synchrony Within Multiple Brain Regions Involved in Sensory Processing and Balance Control</a></h4>

              
                There is a need to develop appropriate balance training interventions to minimize the risk of falls. Recently, we found that intermittent visual occlusions can substantially improve the effectiveness and retention of balance beam walking practice (Symeonidou and Ferris 2022). We sought to determine how the intermittent visual occlusions affect electrocortical activity during beam walking. We hypothesized that areas involved in sensorimotor processing and balance control would demonstrate spectral power changes and inter-trial coherence modulations after loss and restoration of vision. Ten healthy young adults practiced walking on a treadmill-mounted balance beam while wearing high-density EEG and experiencing reoccurring visual occlusions. Results revealed spectral power fluctuations and inter-trial coherence changes in the visual, occipital, temporal, and sensorimotor cortex as well as the posterior parietal cortex and the anterior cingulate. We observed a prolonged alpha increase in the occipital, temporal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal cortex after the occlusion onset. In contrast, the anterior cingulate showed a strong alpha and theta increase after the occlusion offset. We observed transient phase synchrony in the alpha, theta, and beta bands within the sensory, posterior parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices immediately after occlusion onset and offset. Our results provide support for cross-modal phase resetting and enhanced processing in areas involved in sensory processing and balance control as an explanation for increased long-term balance improvement when training with intermittent visual occlusions. Our training intervention could be implemented in senior and rehabilitation centers, improving the quality of life of elderly and neurologically impaired individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The auditory cortex of bats has a better signal to noise ratio and lower inter-trial variability in response to stimuli trains than mice</a></h4>

              
                The brains of black 6 mice (Mus musculus) and Seba's short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata) weigh roughly the same and share the mammalian neocortical laminar architecture. Bats have highly developed sonar calls and social communication and are an excellent neuroethological animal model for auditory research. Mice are olfactory and somatosensory specialists and are used frequently in auditory neuroscience, particularly for their advantage of standardization and genetic tools. Investigating their potentially different general auditory processing principles would advance our understanding of how the ecological needs of a species shape the development and function of the mammalian nervous system. We compared two existing datasets, recorded with linear multichannel electrodes down the depth of the primary auditory cortex (A1) while awake, across both species while presenting repetitive stimulus trains with different frequencies (~5 and ~40 Hz). We found that while there are similarities between cortical response profiles in bats and mice, there was a better signal to noise ratio in bats under these conditions, which allowed for a clearer following response to stimuli trains. This was most evident at higher frequency trains, where bats had stronger response amplitude suppression to consecutive stimuli. Phase coherence was far stronger in bats during stimulus response, indicating less phase variability in bats across individual trials. These results show that although both species share cortical laminar organization, there are structural differences in relative depth of layers. Better signal to noise ratio in bats could represent specialization for faster temporal processing shaped by their individual ecological niches.

	<p>Autism is a spectrum disorder that occurs globally with increasing numbers of children and adults being identified with this condition. Although rates are higher in more affluent nations, the bulk of people with autism reside in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). However, most do not have access to timely and appropriate support. The types of services delivered in high income countries are often ill-suited to the needs and resources of LMICs. Rather alternative forms of provision need to be devised. In common with other public health initiatives, these should be family-focused and community based, with suitably qualified and experienced leaders who in turn train and supervise a cadre of knowledgeable support workers drawn from local communities and cultures. As well as providing personalized, home-based guidance to people with autism and to their primary carers, regular group-based advocacy and training activities are undertaken in partnership with available mainstream services such as schools and social services. The principles and operations of these new forms of services are described in this paper albeit with an acknowledgment of their limitations. In recent decades, the cost-effectiveness of these approaches have been demonstrated with other chronic illnesses and disabling conditions in LMICs but their extension to autism has barely begun. More affluent countries are being forced to adopt similar strategies in response to the increased numbers of people identified with autism. A transformation in research strategies is essential to building better international support for persons with autism.</p>

	<p>Narcolepsy is a chronic, long-term neurological disorder characterized by a decreased ability to regulate sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake cycles. Some clinical symptoms enter into differential diagnosis with other neurological diseases. Excessive daytime sleepiness and brief involuntary sleep episodes are the main clinical symptoms. The majority of people with narcolepsy experience cataplexy, which is a loss of muscle tone. Many people experience neurological complications such as sleep cycle disruption, hallucinations or sleep paralysis. Because of the associated neurological conditions, the exact pathophysiology of narcolepsy is unknown. The differential diagnosis is essential because relatively clinical symptoms of narcolepsy are easy to diagnose when all symptoms are present, but it becomes much more complicated when sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is episodic or absent. Treatment is tailored to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s symptoms and clinical diagnosis. To facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and to better understand the neuropathological mechanisms of this sleep disorder, this review summarizes current knowledge on narcolepsy, in particular, genetic and non-genetic associations of narcolepsy, the pathophysiology up to the inflammatory response, the neuromorphological hallmarks of narcolepsy, and possible links with other diseases, such as diabetes, ischemic stroke and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. This review also reports all of the most recent updated research and therapeutic advances in narcolepsy. There have been significant advances in highlighting the pathogenesis of narcolepsy, with substantial evidence for an autoimmune response against hypocretin neurons; however, there are some gaps that need to be filled. To treat narcolepsy, more research should be focused on identifying molecular targets and novel autoantigens. In addition to therapeutic advances, standardized criteria for narcolepsy and diagnostic measures are widely accepted, but they may be reviewed and updated in the future with comprehension. Tailored treatment to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s symptoms and clinical diagnosis and future treatment modalities with hypocretin agonists, GABA agonists, histamine receptor antagonists and immunomodulatory drugs should be aimed at addressing the underlying cause of narcolepsy.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary central nervous system malignant tumors. With the development of targeted sequencing and proteomic profiling technology, some new tumor types have been established and a series of novel molecular markers have also been identified. The 2021 updated World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors first mentioned the classification of adult glioma and pediatric glioma based on the molecular diagnosis. Thus, we used single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to explore the diversity and similarities in the occurrence and development of adult and pediatric types. ASTN2, which primarily encodes astrotactin, has been reported to be dysregulated in various neurodevelopmental disorders. Although some studies have demonstrated that ASTN2 plays an important role in glial-guided neuronal migration, there are no studies about its impact on glioblastoma cell migration. Subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ASTN2 to be a hub gene of a cell cluster which had a poor effect on clinical prognosis. Eventually, a western blot assay and a wound-healing assay first confirmed that ASTN2 expression in glioblastoma cell lines is higher than that in normal human astrocytes and affects the migration ability of glioblastoma cells, making it a potential therapeutic target.</p>

                <h2>Summary for Social Media</h2>
<p>@AliciaCastongu2, @FazalZaidi9, @oozaidat, @Mouhammad_Jumaa</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful predictive tools in the field stroke. Here, we examine the predictive accuracy of ML models for predicting functional outcomes using 24-hour post-treatment characteristics in the Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke (STRATIS) Registry.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ML models, adaptive boost, random forest (RF), classification and regression trees (CART), C5.0 decision tree (C5.0), support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and logistic regression (LR), and traditional LR models were used to predict 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2). Twenty-four-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was examined as a continuous or dichotomous variable in all models. Model accuracy was assessed using the area under characteristic curve (AUC).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 24-hour NIHSS score was a top-predictor of functional outcome in all models. ML models using the continuous 24-hour NIHSS scored showed moderate-to-good predictive performance (range mean AUC: 0.76–0.92); however, RF (AUC: 0.92 ± 0.028) outperformed all ML models, except LASSO (AUC: 0.89 ± 0.023, <i>p</i> = 0.0958). Importantly, RF demonstrated a significantly higher predictive value than LR (AUC: 0.87 ± 0.031, <i>p</i> = 0.048) and traditional LR (AUC: 85 ± 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.035) when using the 24-hour continuous NIHSS score. Predictive accuracy was similar between the 24-hour NIHSS score dichotomous and continuous ML models.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this substudy, we found similar predictive accuracy for functional outcome when using the 24-hour NIHSS score as a continuous or dichotomous variable in ML models. ML models had moderate-to-good predictive accuracy, with RF outperforming LR models. External validation of these ML models is warranted. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Social and vocal complexity in bottlenose dolphins</a></h4>

              
                Bottlenose dolphins are highly social, renowned for their vocal flexibility, and possess highly enlarged brains relative to their body size. Here, we discuss some of the defining features of bottlenose dolphin social and vocal complexity and place this in the context of their cognitive evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amygdalostriatal transition zone neurons encode sustained valence to direct conditioned behaviors</a></h4>

              
                In order to respond appropriately to threats in the environment, the brain must rapidly determine whether a stimulus is important and whether it is positive or negative, and then use that information to direct behavioral responses. Neurons in the amygdala have long been implicated in valence encoding and in fear responses to threatening stimuli, but show transient firing responses in response to these stimuli that do not match the timescales of associated behavioral responses. For decades, there has been a logical gap in how behavioral responses could be mediated without an ensemble representation of the internal state of valence that has rapid onset, high signal-to-noise, and is sustained for the duration of the behavioral state. Here, we present the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) as a missing piece of this highly conserved process that is of paramount importance for survival, which does exactly this: represents an internal state (e.g. fear) that can be expressed in multiple motor outputs (e.g. freezing or escape). The ASt is anatomically positioned as a 'shortcut' to connect the corticolimbic system (important for evaluation) with the basal ganglia (important for action selection) with the inputs of the amygdala and the outputs of the striatum - ideally poised for evaluating and responding to environmental threats. From in vivo cellular resolution recordings that include both electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we find that ASt neurons are unique in that they are sparse coding, extremely high signal-to-noise, and also maintain a sustained response for negative valence stimuli for the duration of the defensive behavior - a rare but essential combination. We further show that photostimulation of the ASt is sufficient to drive freezing and avoidance behaviors. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ RNA labelling we generate a comprehensive profile of cell types and gene expression in the ASt, and find the ASt is genetically distinct from adjacent striatal and amygdalar structures. We also find that the ASt has a greater proportion of neurons expressing Drd2 than neurons expressing Drd1a, a unique feature compared to other regions of the striatum. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we show that that this Drd2+ population robustly encodes stimuli of negative valence, and in loss-of-function experiments find that optogenetic inhibition of Drd2+ ASt neurons causes a striking reduction in cue-conditioned fear responses. Together, our findings identify the ASt as a previously-unappreciated critical missing link for encoding learned associations and directing ongoing behavior.

	<p>The heat-sink effect and thermal damage of conventional thermal ablative technologies can be minimized by irreversible electroporation (IRE), which results in clear ablative boundaries and conservation of blood vessels, facilitating maximal safe surgical resection for glioblastoma. Although much comparative data about the death forms in IRE have been published, the comprehensive genetic regulatory mechanism for apoptosis, among other forms of regulatory cell death (RCD), remains elusive. We investigated the electric field intensity threshold for apoptosis/necrosis (YO-PRO-1/PI co-staining) of the U251 human malignant glioma cell line with stepwise increased uniform field intensity. Time course samples (0&amp;amp;ndash;6 h) of apoptosis induction and sham treatment were collected for transcriptome sequencing. Sequencing showed that transcription factor AP-1 and its target gene Bim (Bcl2l11), related to the signaling pathway, played a major role in the apoptosis of glioma after IRE. The sequencing results were confirmed by qPCR and Western blot. We also found that the transcription changes also implicated three other forms of RCD: autophagy, necroptosis, and immunogenic cell death (ICD), in addition to apoptosis. These together imply that IRE possibly mediates apoptosis by the AP-1-Bim pathway, causes mixed RCD simultaneously, and has the potential to aid in the generation of a systemic antitumor immune response.</p>

	<p>For the clinical assessment of motor speech disorders (MSDs) in French, the MonPaGe-2.0.s protocol has been shown to be sensitive enough to diagnose mild MSD based on a combination of acoustic and perceptive scores. Here, we go a step further by investigating whether these scores&amp;amp;mdash;which capture deviance on intelligibility, articulation, voice, speech rate, maximum phonation time, prosody, diadochokinetic rate&amp;amp;mdash;contribute to the differential diagnosis of MSDs. To this aim, we trained decision trees for two-class automatic classification of different pairs of MSD subtypes based on seven deviance scores that are computed in MonPaGe-2.0.s against matched normative data. We included 60 speakers with mild to moderate MSD from six neuropathologies (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Wilson, Parkinson and Kennedy disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, post-stroke apraxia of speech). The two-class classifications relied mainly on deviance scores from four speech dimensions and predicted with over 85% accuracy the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s correct clinical category for ataxic, hypokinetic and flaccid dysarthria; classification of the other groups (apraxia of speech and mixed dysarthria) was slightly lower (79% to 82%). Although not perfect and only tested on small cohorts so far, the classification with deviance scores based on clinically informed features seems promising for MSD assessment and classification.</p>

	<p>Nontraumatic anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS) is an extremely rare clinical condition in pediatric populations with a mostly unknown underlying etiology. Here we discuss the case of a previously healthy 14-year-old girl presenting with sudden onset acute flaccid paralysis to the emergency department. A spinal STIR/DWI MRI revealed hyperintensities extending from cervical vertebrae C3-6, consistent with the diagnosis of ASAS. In order to determine any precipitating causes of ASAS, we also extensively investigated established potential risk factors for ASAS in our patient and noticed that she had a marked folate deficiency requiring folic acid supplementation to prevent future episodes of ASAS as well as to repair the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s injured spinal cord. Interestingly, the patient did not display elevated levels of homocysteine nor did she possess the three pathogenic MTHFR mutations characteristic of ASAS. Although her folate deficiency did not cause responsive hyperhomocysteinemia, and she did not have pathogenic MTHFR mutations that impair the function of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in folate cycle, we suggest that isolated folate deficiency may play a role in adolescent cases of ASAS that, once identified, would require prompt identification and early intervention to improve the prognosis of these patients.</p>

	<p>Our objective is to analyze the difference of microelectrode recording (MER) during awake and asleep subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and the necessity of MER during &amp;amp;ldquo;Asleep DBS&amp;amp;rdquo; under general anesthesia (GA). The differences in MER, target accuracy, and prognosis under different anesthesia methods were analyzed. Additionally, the MER length was compared with the postoperative electrode length by electrode reconstruction and measurement. The MER length of two groups was 5.48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.39 mm in the local anesthesia (LA) group and 4.38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.43 mm in the GA group, with a statistical significance between the two groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The MER length of the LA group was longer than its postoperative electrode length (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), however, there was no significant difference between the MER length and postoperative electrode length in the GA group (p = 0.61). There were also no significant differences in the postoperative electrode length, target accuracy, and postoperative primary and secondary outcome scores between the two groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). These results demonstrate that &amp;amp;ldquo;Asleep DBS&amp;amp;rdquo; under GA is comparable to &amp;amp;ldquo;Awake DBS&amp;amp;rdquo; under LA. GA has influences on MER during surgery, but typical STN discharges can still be recorded. MER is not an unnecessary surgical procedure.</p>

	<p>Decision making is a complex process involving various parts of the brain which are active during different times. It is challenging to measure externally the exact instant when any given region becomes active during the decision-making process. Here, we propose the development and validation of an algorithm to extract and visualize the dynamic functional brain activation information from the observed fMRI data. We propose the use of a regularized deconvolution model to simultaneously map various activation regions within the brain and track how different activation regions changes with time, thus providing both spatial and temporal brain activation information. The proposed technique was validated using simulated data and then applied to a simple decision-making task for identification of various brain regions involved in different stages of decision making. Using the results of the dynamic activation for the decision-making task, we were able to identify key brain regions involved in some of the phases of decision making. The visualization aspect of the algorithm allows us to actually see the flow of activation (and deactivation) in the form of a motion picture. The dynamic estimate may aid in understanding the causality of activation between various brain regions in a better way in future fMRI brain studies.</p>

	<p>Depression is frequent in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients, but the evidence for many antidepressant agents to treat it in PD is insufficient. The aim of the present prospective open-label single-arm study (VOPARK, an open-label study of the effectiveness and safety of VOrtioxetine in PARKinson&amp;amp;acute;s disease patients with depression) was to analyze the effectiveness of vortioxetine on depressive symptoms in PD patients with major depression. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline (VB) at the end of the observational period (12 weeks &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 days; V12w) in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) total score. At VB, all patients had a HAM-D17 total score &amp;amp;ge;16. A total of 30 patients (age 66.23 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.27; 73.3% males) were included between February 2021 (first patient, 12/FEB/21) and March 2022 (last patient, 14/MAR/22). At 12 weeks, 27 patients completed the follow-up (90%). The total HAM-D17 total score was reduced by 52.7% (from 21.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.75 at VB to 10.44 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.54 at V12w; Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size = &amp;amp;minus;2.5; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and the response and remission rates were 50% and 43.3%, respectively. Apathy (Apathy Scale; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), cognition (PD-Cognitive Rating Scale; p = 0.007), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale; p = 0.014), and quality of life (PDQ-39 (p = 0.001) and EUROHIS-QOL8 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001)) improved at 3 weeks as well. A total of 11 adverse events in 10 patients (33.3%) were reported, one of which was severe (vomiting related to vortioxetine with full recovery after drug withdrawal). Vortioxetine was safe and well tolerated and improved depressive symptoms and other non-motor symptoms in PD patients.</p>

	<p>Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) is a common mental health disorder, manifesting with a range of chronic and debilitating symptoms, including impaired social functioning, unstable mood, and risky impulsive or self-injurious behaviour. Whilst the exact aetiology has not been fully elucidated, implicated factors seem to include genetic factors, environmental causes such as trauma, and neurotransmitter deficits. The literature suggests that impaired functioning of the endocannabinoid system in key brain regions responsible for emotional processing and stress response may underlie the manifestation of EUPD symptoms. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines state that &amp;amp;ldquo;no drugs have established efficacy in treating or managing EUPD&amp;amp;rdquo;, and yet, patients are commonly prescribed medication which includes antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilisers. Here we present a case series of seven participants diagnosed with EUPD and treated with cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs). Participants were given an initial assessment and followed up one month after CBMPs prescription. Improvement in symptoms was assessed by the completion of ratified rating scales by the participant and psychiatrist. Our results indicate that CBMPs were effective and well tolerated, as six participants reported a noticeable improvement in their symptoms and functioning. Although promising, further research is needed to ascertain the long-term tolerability, efficacy, and dosing strategy for CBMPs in EUPD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Running wheels for mice residing in the home cage are useful for the continuous measurement of locomotor activity for studies testing exercise interventions or exercise-induced effects on brain and metabolism. Here, we have developed an open source, printable, open-faced running wheel that is automated to collect locomotor information such as distance traveled, wheel direction, and velocity that can be binned into epochs over 24 h or multiple days. This system allows for remote data collection to avoid human interference in mouse behavioral experiments. We tested this system in an activity-based anorexia procedure. Using these wheels, we replicate previous findings that food restriction augments wheel-running activity.</p>

                In 2020 we published Liftoff, which was the first standalone tool specifically designed for transferring gene annotations between genome assemblies of the same or closely related species. While the gene content is expected to be very similar in closely related genomes, the differences may be biologically consequential, and a computational method to extract all gene-related differences should prove useful in the analysis of such genomes. Here we present LiftoffTools, a toolkit to automate the detection and analysis of gene sequence variants, synteny, and gene copy number changes.  We provide a description of the toolkit and an example of its use comparing genes mapped between two human genome assemblies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Parameterized syncmer schemes improve long-read mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Abhinav Dutta, David Pellow, Ron Shamir</p>
Motivation <p>Sequencing long reads presents novel challenges to mapping. One such challenge is low sequence similarity between the reads and the reference, due to high sequencing error and mutation rates. This occurs, e.g., in a cancer tumor, or due to differences between strains of viruses or bacteria. A key idea in mapping algorithms is to sketch sequences with their minimizers. Recently, syncmers were introduced as an alternative sketching method that is more robust to mutations and sequencing errors.</p> Results <p>We introduce parameterized syncmer schemes (PSS), a generalization of syncmers, and provide a theoretical analysis for multi-parameter schemes. By combining PSS with downsampling or minimizers we can achieve any desired compression and window guarantee. We implemented the use of PSS in the popular minimap2 and Winnowmap2 mappers. In tests on simulated and real long read data from a variety of genomes, the PSS-based algorithms, with scheme parameters selected on the basis of our theoretical analysis, reduced unmapped reads by 20-60% at high compression while usually using less memory. The advantage was more pronounced at low sequence identity. At sequence identity of 75% and medium compression, PSS-minimap had only 37% as many unmapped reads, and 8% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped. Even at lower compression and error rates, PSS-based mapping mapped more reads than the original minimizer-based mappers as well as mappers using the original syncmer schemes. We conclude that using PSS can improve mapping of long reads in a wide range of settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reaction-diffusion models in weighted and directed connectomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oliver Schmitt, Christian Nitzsche, Peter Eipert, Vishnu Prathapan, Marc-Thorsten Hütt, Claus Hilgetag</p>

Connectomes represent comprehensive descriptions of neural connections in a nervous system to better understand and model central brain function and peripheral processing of afferent and efferent neural signals. Connectomes can be considered as a distinctive and necessary structural component alongside glial, vascular, neurochemical, and metabolic networks of the nervous systems of higher organisms that are required for the control of body functions and interaction with the environment. They are carriers of functional epiphenomena such as planning behavior and cognition, which are based on the processing of highly dynamic neural signaling patterns. In this study, we examine more detailed connectomes with edge weighting and orientation properties, in which reciprocal neuronal connections are also considered. Diffusion processes are a further necessary condition for generating dynamic bioelectric patterns in connectomes. Based on our high-precision connectome data, we investigate different diffusion-reaction models to study the propagation of dynamic concentration patterns in control and lesioned connectomes. Therefore, differential equations for modeling diffusion were combined with well-known reaction terms to allow the use of connection weights, connectivity orientation and spatial distances.
Three reaction-diffusion systems Gray-Scott, Gierer-Meinhardt and Mimura-Murray were investigated. For this purpose, implicit solvers were implemented in a numerically stable reaction-diffusion system within the framework of <i>neuroVIISAS</i>. The implemented reaction-diffusion systems were applied to a subconnectome which shapes the mechanosensitive pathway that is strongly affected in the multiple sclerosis demyelination disease. It was found that demyelination modeling by connectivity weight modulation changes the oscillations of the target region, i.e. the primary somatosensory cortex, of the mechanosensitive pathway.
In conclusion, a new application of reaction-diffusion systems to weighted and directed connectomes has been realized. Because the implementation were performed in the <i>neuroVIISAS</i> framework many possibilities for the study of dynamic reaction-diffusion processes in empirical connectomes as well as specific randomized network models are available now.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Separability of Human Motor Memories during reaching adaptation with force cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frédéric Crevecoeur, James Mathew, Philippe Lefèvre</p>

Judging by the breadth of our motor repertoire during daily activities, it is clear that learning different tasks is a hallmark of the human motor system. However, for reaching adaptation to different force fields, the conditions under which this is possible in laboratory settings have remained a challenging question. Previous work has shown that independent movement representations or goals enabled dual adaptation. Considering the importance of force feedback during limb control, here we hypothesised that independent cues delivered by means of background loads could support simultaneous adaptation to various velocity-dependent force fields, for identical kinematic plan and movement goal. We demonstrate in a series of experiments that indeed healthy adults can adapt to opposite force fields, independently of the direction of the background force cue. However, when the cue and force field were in the same direction but differed by heir magnitude, the formation of different motor representations was still observed but the associated mechanism was subject to increased interference. Finally, we highlight that this paradigm allows dissociating trial-by-trial adaptation from online feedback adaptation, as these two mechanisms are associated with different time scales that can be identified reliably and reproduced in a computational model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Creating and sustaining collaborative multi-institutional industry site visit programs: a toolkit [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As more early career scientists enter into diverse career pathways, visiting local companies or organizations can support their exploration of these paths. As an efficient way to facilitate this, we developed a collaborative regional site visit program: the Enhancing Local Industry Transitions through Exploration (ELITE) Consortium.  Consortium members arrange half-day visits to local industry sites, thus providing companies and trainees the opportunity to meet and identify potential professional and career opportunities. Three different training institutions worked cooperatively in the development and maintenance of the program. The ELITE Consortium was developed with eight phased steps; guidelines and operating procedures were created for each of these steps and are provided along with sample materials for institutions interested in building similar programs. Methods: Prior to fully developing the program, trainee interests were evaluated via questionnaire. During program implementation and thereafter, program directors tracked attendance and collected career outcome data from publicly available sources to identify first job positions after training. Regression analyses and chi-squared analyses were used to examine site visit matches and career outcome data. Results: Analyses suggest a positive impact of site visits on postdoctoral and graduate trainees’ career outcomes at companies or institutions that match a similar sector (e.g., for-profit) and type (e.g., biotech, pharmaceutical, contract research organization). Despite a small sample size, evidence suggests an especially positive impact on trainees who organize site visits to companies compared with those who simply participate. Conclusions: The ELITE Consortium was successful in helping trainees explore and identify a multitude of career paths. Trainees attained employment either directly or in related companies and institutions visited by ELITE participants. The joint, three-institution, flexible nature of the ELITE Consortium positively impacts the program’s sustainability and reach. The toolkit provided here will help other institutions to replicate and adapt the program with minimal effort.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The paucity of longitudinal natural history studies in <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy remains a barrier to clinical trials. We have completed a longitudinal natural history study in patients with <i>MPZ</i> neuropathies across 13 sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Change in Charcot–Marie–Tooth Examination Score (CMTES) and Rasch modified CMTES (CMTES-R) were evaluated using longitudinal regression over a 5-year period in subjects with <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy. Data from 139 patients with <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The average baseline CMTES and CMTES-R were 10.84 (standard deviation [SD] = 6.0, range = 0–28) and 14.60 (SD = 7.56, range = 0–32), respectively. A mixed regression model showed significant change in CMTES at years 2–5 (mean change from baseline of 0.87 points at 2 years, <i>p</i> = 0.008). Subgroup analysis revealed greater change in CMTES at 2 years in subjects with axonal as compared to demyelinating neuropathy (mean change of 1.30 points [<i>p</i> = 0.016] vs 0.06 points [<i>p</i> = 0.889]). Patients with a moderate baseline neuropathy severity also showed more notable change, by estimate, than those with mild or severe neuropathy (mean 2-year change of 1.14 for baseline CMTES 8–14 [<i>p</i> = 0.025] vs −0.03 for baseline CMTES 0–7 [<i>p</i> = 0.958] and 0.25 for baseline CMTES ≥ 15 [<i>p</i> = 0.6897]). The progression in patients harboring specific <i>MPZ</i> mutations was highly variable.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CMTES is sensitive to change over time in adult patients with axonal but not demyelinating forms of <i>MPZ</i> neuropathy. Change in CMTES was greatest in patients with moderate baseline disease severity. These findings will inform future clinical trials of <i>MPZ</i> neuropathies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive malignancy usually described in the abdomen and pelvis of adolescent males but rarely in the chest. A 71-year-old male presented with chest pain and was found to have pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. He underwent pericardiocentesis and pericardial window. Pericardial fluid and cardiac biopsy results confirmed DSRCT. The patient received the P6 protocol with a good but brief response. He had multiple hospitalizations in the following months for pericardial fluid recollection. Repeat imaging showed mediastinal metastasis. He is currently undergoing second-line chemotherapy treatment. We describe a unique case of primary DSRCT invading the pericardium and myocardium and exhibiting extensive mediastinal metastasis. This is the fourth report of cardiac DSRCT in the literature.

                Diverse inhibitory neurons in the mammalian brain shape circuit connectivity and dynamics through mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Inhibitory plasticity can establish excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, control neuronal firing, and affect local calcium concentration, hence regulating neuronal activity at the network, single neuron, and dendritic level. Computational models can synthesize multiple experimental results and provide insight into how inhibitory plasticity controls circuit dynamics and sculpts connectivity by identifying phenomenological learning rules amenable to mathematical analysis.

                Interactions between the enteric nervous system (ENS), immune system, and gut microbiota regulate intestinal homeostasis in adults, but their development and role(s) in early life are relatively underexplored. In early life, these interactions are dynamic, because the mucosal immune system, microbiota, and the ENS are developing and influencing each other. Moreover, disrupting gut microbiota and gut immune system development, and potentially ENS development, by early-life antibiotic exposure increases the risk of diseases affecting the gut.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-throughput automated methods for classical and operant conditioning of Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Learning which stimuli (classical conditioning) or which actions (operant conditioning) predict rewards or punishments can improve chances of survival. However, the circuit mechanisms that underlie distinct types of associative learning are still not fully understood. Automated, high-throughput paradigms for studying different types of associative learning, combined with manipulation of specific neurons in freely behaving animals, can help advance this field. The Drosophila melanogaster larva is a tractable model system for studying the circuit basis of behaviour, but many forms of associative learning have not yet been demonstrated in this animal. Here, we developed a high-throughput (i. e. multi-larva) training system that combines real-time behaviour detection of freely moving larvae with targeted opto- and thermogenetic stimulation of tracked animals. Both stimuli are controlled in either open- or closed-loop, and delivered with high temporal and spatial precision. Using this tracker, we show for the first time that Drosophila larvae can perform classical conditioning with no overlap between sensory stimuli (i. e. trace conditioning). We also demonstrate that larvae are capable of operant conditioning by inducing a bend direction preference through optogenetic activation of reward-encoding serotonergic neurons. Our results extend the known associative learning capacities of Drosophila larvae. Our automated training rig will facilitate the study of many different forms of associative learning and the identification of the neural circuits that underpin them.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmental response in gene expression and DNA methylation reveals factors influencing the adaptive potential of Arabidopsis lyrata</a></h4>

              
                Understanding what factors influence plastic and genetic variation is valuable for predicting how organisms respond to changes in the selective environment. Here, using gene expression and DNA methylation as molecular phenotypes, we study environmentally induced variation among <i>Arabidopsis lyrata</i> plants grown at lowland and alpine field sites. Our results show that gene expression is highly plastic, as many more genes are differentially expressed between the field sites than between populations. These environmentally responsive genes evolve under strong selective constraint – the strength of purifying selection on the coding sequence is high, while the rate of adaptive evolution is low. We find, however, that positive selection on cis-regulatory variants has likely contributed to the maintenance of genetically variable environmental responses, but such variants segregate only between distantly related populations. In contrast to gene expression, DNA methylation at genic regions is largely insensitive to the environment, and plastic methylation changes are not associated with differential gene expression. Besides genes, we detect environmental effects at transposable elements (TEs): TEs at the high-altitude field site have higher expression and methylation levels, suggestive of a broad-scale TE activation. Compared to the lowland population, plants native to the alpine environment harbor an excess of recent TE insertions, and we observe that specific TE families are enriched within environmentally responsive genes. Our findings provide insight into selective forces shaping plastic and genetic variation. We also highlight how plastic responses at TEs can rapidly create novel heritable variation in stressful conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Osteocytes regulate senescence of bone and bone marrow</a></h4>

              
                The skeletal system contains a series of sophisticated cellular lineages arisen from the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), that determine the homeostasis of bone and bone marrow. Here we reasoned that osteocyte may exert a function in regulation of these lineage cell specifications and tissue homeostasis. Using a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes by the expression of diphtheria toxin subunit &#x1D6FC; (DTA) in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) positive osteocytes, we demonstrated that partial ablation of DMP1 positive osteocytes caused severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan in these animals. Osteocytes reduction altered mesenchymal lineage commitment resulting in impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogensis. Single cell RNA sequencing further revealed that hematopoietic lineage was mobilized towards myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils and monocytes, while the lymphopoiesis was impaired with reduced B cells in the osteocyte ablation mice. The acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteoprogenic and myeloid lineage cells was the underlying cause. Together, we showed that osteocytes play critical roles in regulation of lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow through mediation of senescence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A cryogenic, coincident fluorescence, electron and ion beam microscope</a></h4>

              
                Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) combined with sub-tomogram averaging, allows in-situ visualization and structure determination of macromolecular complexes at sub-nanometre resolution. Cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) micromachining is used to prepare a thin lamella-shaped sample out of a frozen-hydrated cell for cryo-ET imaging, but standard cryo-FIB fabrication is blind to the precise location of the structure or proteins of interest. Fluorescence-guided focused ion beam (FIB) milling at target locations requires multiple sample transfers prone to contamination, and relocation and registration accuracy is often insufficient for 3D targeting. Here, we present in-situ fluorescence microscopy-guided FIB fabrication of a frozen-hydrated lamella to address this problem: we built a coincident 3-beam cryogenic correlative microscope by retrofitting a compact cryogenic microcooler, custom positioning stage, and an inverted widefield fluorescence microscope (FM) on an existing focused ion-beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). We show FM controlled targeting at every milling step in the lamella fabrication process, validated with transmission electron microscope (TEM) tomogram reconstructions of the target regions. The ability to check the lamella during and after the milling process results in a higher success rate in the fabrication process and will increase the throughput of fabrication for lamellae suitable for high-resolution imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Computational model of the full-length TSH receptor</a></h4>

              
                The receptor for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSHR), a GPCR, is of particular interest as the primary antigen in autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) caused by stimulating TSHR antibodies.  To date, only one domain of the extracellular region of the TSHR has been crystallized.  We have run a 1000ns Molecular Dynamic simulation on a model of the entire TSHR generated by merging the extracellular region of the receptor, obtained using artificial intelligence, with our recent homology model of the transmembrane domain, embedded it in a lipid membrane solvated it with water and counterions. The simulations showed that the structure of the transmembrane and leucine-rich domains were remarkably constant while the linking region (LR), known more commonly as the 'hinge region', showed significant flexibility, forming several transient secondary structural elements. Furthermore, the relative orientation of the leucine-rich domain with the rest of the receptor was also seen to be variable. These data suggest that this linker region is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). Furthermore, preliminary data simulating the full TSHR model complexed with its ligand (TSH) showed that (a) there is a strong affinity between the linker region and TSH ligand and (b) the association of the linker region and the TSH ligand reduces the structural fluctuations in the linker region. This full-length model illustrates the importance of the linker region in responding to ligand binding and lays the foundation for studies of pathologic TSHR autoantibodies complexed with the TSHR to give further insight into their interaction with the flexible linker region.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent maintenance of both veridical and transformed working memory representations</a></h4>

              
                In a dynamic environment, the already limited information that human working memory can maintain needs to be constantly updated to optimally guide behaviour. Indeed, previous studies showed that working memory representations are continuously being transformed during delay periods leading up to a response. This goes hand-in-hand with the removal of task-irrelevant items. However, does such removal also include veridical, original stimuli, as they were prior to transformation? Here we aimed to assess the neural representation of task-relevant transformed representations, compared to the no-longer-relevant veridical representations they originated from. We applied multivariate pattern analysis to electroencephalographic data during maintenance of orientation gratings with and without mental rotation. During maintenance, we perturbed the representational network by means of a visual impulse stimulus, and were thus able to successfully decode veridical as well as imaginary, transformed orientation gratings from impulse-driven activity. On the one hand, the impulse response reflected only task-relevant (cued), but not task-irrelevant (uncued) items, suggesting that the latter were quickly discarded from working memory. By contrast, even though the original cued orientation gratings were also no longer task-relevant after mental rotation, these items continued to be represented next to the rotated ones, in different representational formats. This seemingly inefficient use of scarce working memory capacity was associated with reduced probe response times and may thus serve to increase precision and flexibility in guiding behaviour in dynamic environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LTP-like noninvasive striatal brain stimulation enhances striatal activity and motor skill learning in humans</a></h4>

              
                The stimulation of deep brain structures has thus far been possible only with invasive methods. Transcranial electrical temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) is a novel, noninvasive technology that might overcome this limitation. The initial proof-of-concept was obtained through modeling, physics experiments and rodent models. Here, we show for the first time successful noninvasive neuromodulation of the striatum via tTIS in humans using computational modeling, fMRI studies and behavioral evaluations. Theta-burst patterned, LTP-like striatal tTIS increased activity in the striatum and associated motor network. Furthermore, striatal tTIS enhanced motor learning capacity, especially in healthy older participants, who have lower natural learning capacity than younger subjects. These findings suggest exciting methods for noninvasively targeting deep brain structures in humans, thus enhancing our understanding of their functional roles. Moreover, our results lay the groundwork for innovative, noninvasive treatment strategies for brain disorders, in which deep brain structures play key pathophysiological roles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity During Methamphetamine Cued Relapse</a></h4>

              
                Relapse to drug seeking involves transient synaptic remodeling that occurs in response to drug associated cues. This remodeling includes activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to initiate catalytic signaling in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). We hypothesized that MMP activity would be increased in the NAcore during cue-induced methamphetamine (meth) seeking in a rat model of meth use and relapse. Male and female rats had indwelling jugular catheters and bilateral intracranial cannula targeting the NAcore surgically implanted. Following recovery, rats underwent meth or saline self-administration (6hr/day for 15 days) in which active lever responding was paired with a light+tone stimulus complex, followed by home cage abstinence. Testing occurred after 7 or 30 days of abstinence. On test day, rats were microinjected with a FITC-quenched gelatin substrate that fluoresces following cleavage by MMPs, allowing for the quantification of gelatinase activity by MMP-2 and -9 during cued relapse testing. MMP-2,9 activity was significantly increased in the NAcore by meth cues presentation after 7 and 30 days of abstinence, indicating that remodeling by MMPs occurs during presentation of meth associated cues. Surprisingly, while cue-induced seeking increased between days 7 and 30, suggesting behavioral incubation, MMP-2,9 activity did not increase. These findings indicate that while MMP activation is elicited during meth cue-induced seeking, MMP activation did not parallel the behavioral incubation that occurs during extended drug abstinence.

                The neural mechanisms underlying brain functions are extremely complicated. Brain dynamics modeling is an indispensable tool for elucidating these mechanisms by modeling the dynamics of the neural circuits that execute brain functions. To ease and facilitate brain dynamics modeling, a general-purpose programming framework is needed to enable users to freely define neural models across multiple scales; efficiently simulate, train, and analyze model dynamics; and conveniently extend new modeling approaches. By utilizing the advanced just-in-time (JIT) compilation, we developed BrainPy. BrainPy provides a rich infrastructure tailored for brain dynamics programming, which supports an integrated platform for brain dynamics model building, simulation, training, and analysis. Models in BrainPy can be JIT compiled into binary instructions for multiple devices (including CPU, GPU, and TPU) to achieve a high running performance comparable to native C or CUDA. Moreover, BrainPy features an extensible architecture allowing easy expansion of new infrastructure, utilities, and machine learning approaches.

                GABAB receptor (GBR) activation inhibits neurotransmitter release in axon terminals in the brain, except in medial habenula (MHb) terminals, which show robust potentiation. However, mechanisms underlying this enigmatic potentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that GBR activation induces a transition from tonic to phasic release accompanied by a 4-fold increase in readily releasable pool (RRP) size in MHb terminals, mirrored by a similar increase in the docked vesicle number at the presynaptic active zone (AZ). The tonic and phasic release vesicles have distinct coupling distances. We identified two vesicle-associated molecules, synaptoporin and CAPS2, selectively involved in tonic and phasic release, respectively. Synaptoporin mediates augmentation of tonic release and CAPS2 stabilizes readily releasable vesicles during phasic release. A newly developed Flash and Freeze-fracture method revealed selective recruitment of CAPS2 to the AZ during phasic release. Thus, we propose a novel two-pool mechanism underlying the GBR-mediated potentiation of release from MHb terminals.

                Circadian regulation of autonomic reflex pathways pairs physiological function with the daily light cycle. The brainstem nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a key candidate for rhythmic control of the autonomic nervous system. Here we investigated circadian regulation of NTS neurotransmission and synaptic throughput using patch-clamp electrophysiology in brainstem slices from mice. We found that spontaneous quantal glutamate release on to NTS neurons showed strong circadian rhythmicity, with the highest rate of release during the light phase and the lowest in the dark, that were sufficient to drive day / night differences in constitutive postsynaptic action potential firing. In contrast, afferent-evoked action potential throughput was enhanced during the dark and diminished in the light. Afferent-driven synchronous release pathways showed a similar decrease in release probability that did not explain the enhanced synaptic throughput during the night. However, analysis of postsynaptic membrane properties revealed diurnal changes in conductance; which, when coupled with the circadian changes in glutamate release pathways, tuned synaptic throughput between the light and dark phases. These coordinated pre- / postsynaptic changes encode nuanced control over synaptic performance and pair NTS action potential firing and vagal throughput with time of day.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variability of wheel running behavior in mice is dependent on housing, sex, and genetic background</a></h4>

              
                Environmental enrichment (EE) has been increasingly used to enhance and support the physiological fitness and natural behavior of research animals. For mice, which are known to be highly active nocturnal animals that live in large social groups, the introduction of running wheels is a particularly promising approach in EE. When wheels are introduced to their home cage, mice increase their nocturnal locomotion activity by orders of magnitude. However, little is known about how mice share such a readily adopted EE. Here, we studied wheel running in single-housed and group-housed mice. We hypothesized that group-housed mice will compete over the scarce resource of a running wheel leading to a change in overall wheel usage compared to single-housed mice that have exclusive wheel access. We measured wheel locomotion in two strains of single-housed and group-housed mice over multiple 24h periods at sub-second temporal resolution using a custom-designed data acquisition system. We observed both sex- and housing-specific differences in wheel usage. In single-housed C57Bl/6 mice, mice ran at consistent speeds and females ran larger distances. In group housing, periods of slow locomotion speeds as well as speed transitions emerged with fewer breaks in wheel usage. This group effect was less pronounced in a genetic mouse model (parvalbumin-Cre on C57Bl/6 background). Our results demonstrate a change in wheel usage during group housing which supports competition over EE resources while enhancing overall locomotion in mice.

                Norepinephrine (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) project widely throughout the central nervous system, playing critical roles in arousal and mood, as well as various components of cognition including attention, learning, and memory. The LC-NE system is also implicated in multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, LC-NE neurons are highly sensitive to degeneration in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Despite the clinical importance of the brain region and the prominent role of LC-NE neurons in a variety of brain and behavioral functions, a detailed molecular characterization of the LC is lacking. Here, we used a combination of spatially-resolved transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize the molecular landscape of the LC region and the transcriptomic profile of LC-NE neurons in the human brain. We provide a freely accessible resource of these data in web-accessible formats.

                Secreted semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) and semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) exhibit remarkably distinct effects on deep layer excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons; Sema3F mediates dendritic spine pruning, whereas Sema3A promotes the elaboration of basal dendrites. Sema3F and Sema3A signal through distinct holoreceptors that include neuropilin-2 (Nrp-2)/plexinA3 (PlexA3) and neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1)/PlexA4, respectively. We find that Nrp-2 and Nrp-1 are S-palmitoylated in cortical neurons and that palmitoylation of select Nrp-2 cysteines is required for its proper subcellular localization and also for Sema3F/Nrp-2-dependent dendritic spine pruning in cortical neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we show that the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC15 is required for Nrp-2 palmitoylation and Sema3F/Nrp-2-dependent dendritic spine pruning, but it is dispensable for Nrp-1 palmitoylation and Sema3A/Nrp-1-dependent basal dendritic elaboration. Therefore, palmitoyl acyltransferase-substrate specificity is essential for establishing compartmentalized neuronal structure and functional responses to extrinsic guidance cues.

                Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family that mediates cell adhesion and synaptic specification. Genetic studies have linked Ptprd to several neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), opioid abuse disorder, and antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of either pediatric obsessive-compulsive traits, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), have identified loci near Ptprd as genome-wide significant, or strongly suggestive for this trait. We assessed Ptprd wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HT), and knockout (KO) mice for behavioral dimensions that are altered in OCD, including anxiety and exploration (open field test, dig test), perseverative behavior (splash-induced grooming, spatial d), sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition), and home cage goal-directed behavior (nest building). No effect of genotype was observed in any measure of the open field test, dig test, or splash test. However, Ptprd KO mice of both sexes showed impairments in nest building behavior. Finally, female, but not male, Ptprd KO mice showed deficits in prepulse inhibition, an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that is reduced in female, but not male, OCD patients. Our results indicate that constitutive lack of Ptprd may contribute to the development of certain domains that are altered OCD, including goal-directed behavior, and reduced sensorimotor gating specifically in females.

                Mutations in the SNCA gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinsons disease (PD), with progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and accumulation of aggregates of alpha-synuclein. However, the sequence of molecular events that proceed from the SNCA mutation during development, to its end stage pathology is unknown. Utilising human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with SNCA mutations, we resolved the temporal sequence of pathophysiological events that occur during neuronal differentiation in order to discover the early, and likely causative, events in synucleinopathies. We adapted a small molecule-based protocol that generates highly enriched midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons (>80%). We characterised their molecular identity using single-cell RNA sequencing and their functional identity through the synthesis and secretion of dopamine, the ability to generate action potentials, and form functional synapses and networks. RNA velocity analyses confirmed the developmental transcriptomic trajectory of midbrain neural precursors into mDA neurons using our approach, and identified key driver genes in mDA neuronal development. To characterise the synucleinopathy, we adopted super-resolution methods to determine the number, size and structure of aggregates in SNCA-mutant mDA neurons. At one week of differentiation, prior to maturation to mDA neurons of molecular and functional identity, we demonstrate the formation of small aggregates; specifically, beta-sheet rich oligomeric aggregates, in SNCA-mutant midbrain immature neurons. The aggregation progresses over time to accumulate phosphorylated aggregates, and later fibrillar aggregates. When the midbrain neurons were functional, we observed evidence of impaired physiological calcium signalling, with raised basal calcium, and impairments in cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium efflux. Once midbrain identity fully developed, SNCA-mutant neurons exhibited bioenergetic impairments, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. During the maturation of mDA neurons, upregulation of mitophagy and autophagy occured, and ultimately these multiple cellular stresses lead to an increase in cell death by six weeks post-differentiation. Our differentiation paradigm generates an efficient model for studying disease mechanisms in PD, and highlights that protein misfolding to generate intraneuronal oligomers is one of the earliest critical events driving disease in human neurons, rather than a late-stage hallmark of the disease.

                Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a key modulator of excitatory synaptic transmission, gene expression, learning and memory. Mutations in the CAMK2A gene, which encodes CaMKII alpha and is highly expressed in multiple regions in the forebrain, have been recently linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Our lab generated and characterized a knock-in (KI) mutant mouse with a glutamate-183 to valine (E183V) CaMKII alpha mutation detected in several children diagnosed with ASD or ID. The E183V mutation reduces CaMKII activity and expression levels but the contributions of these two changes to the ASD-related behavioral phenotypes of these mice are unclear. Therefore, we performed side-by-side comparisons of the behavioral phenotypes of CaMKII alpha E183V-KI mice with two other mutant mouse lines with either a complete loss of CaMKII alpha expression (CaMKII alpha Null mice) or reduced kinase activity (due to a threonine-286 to alanine mutation that abrogates autophosphorylation at this site) with no significant change in expression levels (CaMKII alpha T286A-KI mice). In all three lines, homozygous mutant mice displayed increased stereotypic jumping behavior and hyperactivity, without alterations in anxiety or social interactions. Interestingly, homozygous mutant mice in all three lines also displayed a substantial reduction in tactile sensitivity using the Von Frey filament test. Together, these data suggest that reductions of either CaMKII alpha expression or activity in mice disrupted normal motor and sensory functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assistive loading promotes goal-directed tuning of stretch reflex gains</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary movements are prepared before they are executed. Preparatory activity has been observed across the CNS and recently documented in first order neurons of the human PNS i.e., in muscle spindles. The changes seen in these sensory organs suggest that the independent modulation of stretch reflex gains may represent an important component of movement preparation. The aim of the current study was to further investigate the preparatory modulation of short- and long-latency stretch reflex responses ('SLR' and 'LLR') of the dominant upper limb. Specifically, we investigated how different target parameters (target distance and direction) affect the preparatory tuning of stretch reflex gains in the context of goal-directed reaching, and whether any such tuning depends on preparation duration and the direction of background loads. We found that target distance produced only small variations in reflex gains. In contrast, both SLR and LLR gains were strongly modulated as a function of target direction, in a manner that facilitated the upcoming voluntary movement. This goal-directed tuning of SLR and LLR gains was present or enhanced when the preparatory delay was sufficiently long (>250 ms) and the homonymous muscle was unloaded i.e., when a background load was first applied in the direction of homonymous muscle action (assistive loading). The results extend further support for a relatively slow-evolving process in reach preparation that functions to modulate reflexive muscle stiffness, likely via the independent control of fusimotor neurons. Such control can augment voluntary goal-directed movement and is triggered or enhanced when the homonymous muscle is unloaded.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biological Sex Influences the Contribution of Sign-Tracking and Anxiety-Like Behaviour toward Remifentanil Self-Administration</a></h4>

              
                Most people sample addictive drugs, but use becomes disordered in only a small minority. Two important factors that influence susceptibility to addiction are individual differences in personality traits and biological sex. The influence of traits on addiction-like behaviour is well characterized in preclinical models of cocaine self-administration, but less is understood in regards to opioids. How biological sex influences trait susceptibility to opioid self-administration is likewise less studied than psychostimulants. Thus, we sought to elucidate how biological sex and several addiction-relevant traits interact with the propensity to self-administer the opioid remifentanil. We first screened female (n=19) and male (n=19) rats for four addiction-relevant traits: impulsivity, novelty place-preference, anxiety-like behaviour, and attribution of incentive value to reward cues. Rats were then trained to self-administer remifentanil in a conflict model of drug self-administration. Rats had to endure a mild electric shock to access the response manipulandum that triggered an intravenous infusion of remifentanil. In male rats, high anxiety-like behaviour was positively correlated with the number of drug infusions if the shock level was low or completely absent. In females, sign-tracking was predictive of greater resistance to punishment during drug seeking; an effect that was mediated by anxiety-like behaviour. Females consumed more remifentanil under all conditions, and their drug seeking persisted in the face of significantly greater current than males. These findings demonstrate that the influence of behavioural traits over the propensity to self-administer opioids is dependent upon biological sex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissecting the functional contributions of different neuronal subtypes in the dorsal striatum to perseverative behaviour in ephrin-A2/A5-/- mice</a></h4>

              
                Overreliance on habit is linked with disorders such as drug addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder and there is increasing interest in the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to alter neuronal activity in the relevant pathways and reduce relapse or accelerated shift towards habit formation. Here we studied the brains of ephrin-A2A5-/- mice, which previously showed perseverative behaviour in progressive-ratio tasks, associated with low cellular activity in nucleus accumbens. We investigated if rTMS treatment had altered the hierarchical recruitment of brain regions from ventral to dorsal striatum associated with abnormal habit formation in these mice. Brain sections of mice that underwent progressive-ratio tasks with and without LI-rTMS were taken from a previous study. Striatal regions were stained for neuronal activation with c-Fos and for medium spiny neurons with DARPP32. Qualitative analysis was carried out for other neuronal subtypes in the striatum - GABAergic, parvalbumin-expressing and cholinergic interneurons. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found neuronal activity in ephrin-A2A5-/- mice still reflected goal-directed behaviour. However, we saw that the dorsolateral striatum contributed more to total striatal activity in untreated ephrin-A2/A5-/- mice. This supported our hypothesis that ephrin-A2/A5-/- mice have greater c-Fos activity in habit-associated striatal regions. LI-rTMS in ephrin-A2A5-/- mice also appeared to delay the shift from goal-directed to habitual behaviour as suggested by increased activation in dorsomedial striatum and nucleus accumbens.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortically-evoked movement in humans reflects history of prior executions, not plan for upcoming movement</a></h4>

              
                Human motor behavior involves planning and execution, but we often perform some actions more frequently. Experimentally manipulating the probability distribution of a movement through intensive repetition toward a certain direction causes physiological bias toward that direction, which can be cortically-evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, because movement execution and plan histories were indistinguishable to date, to what extent TMS-evoked biases are due to more frequently executed movement, or recent planning of movement, is unclear. Here, we use novel experimentation to separately manipulate recent history of movement plans and execution, and probe the effects of this on physiological biases using TMS, and on default plan for goal-directed actions using a behavioral timed-response task. At baseline, physiological biases shared similar low-level kinematic properties (direction) to default plan for upcoming movement. However, when recent movement execution history was manipulated via thumb movement repetitions toward a specific direction, we found a significant effect on physiological biases, but not plan-based goal-directed movement. To further determine if physiological biases reflect ongoing motor planning, we biased movement plan history by increasing the likelihood of a specific target location, and found a significant effect on the default plan for goal-directed movements. However, TMS-evoked movement during the preparation period did not become biased toward the most frequent plan. This suggests that physiological biases provide a readout of the default state of M1 population activity in the movement-related space, but not ongoing neural activation in the planning-related space, potentially ruling out relevance of cortically-evoked physiological biases to voluntary movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drug Reinforcement Impairs Cognitive Flexibility by Inhibiting Striatal Cholinergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms underlying the reduction in cognitive flexibility associated with reinforcement of addictive substance use are unknown. This reinforcement is mediated by substance-induced synaptic plasticity in direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs) that project to the substantia nigra (SNr). Cognitive flexibility is mediated by cholinergic interneurons (CINs), which receive extensive local inhibition from the striatum. Here, we report that cocaine or alcohol administration caused a long-lasting potentiation of local inhibitory dMSN-->CIN transmission in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a brain region critical for goal-directed behavior and cognitive flexibility. This dMSN-->CIN potentiation reduced CIN firing activity. Furthermore, chemogenetic and time-locked optogenetic inhibition of DMS CINs suppressed cognitive flexibility in an instrumental reversal learning task. Importantly, rabies-mediated tracing and physiological studies revealed that SNr-projecting dMSNs, which mediate reinforcement, sent axonal collaterals to inhibit DMS CINs, which mediate flexibility. Our findings demonstrate that the local inhibitory dMSN-->CIN circuit mediates a reinforcement-induced reduction in cognitive flexibility.

                Background: European local ancestry (ELA) surrounding APOE4 is associated with a higher risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD) compared to African local ancestry (ALA). We previously demonstrated significantly higher APOE4 expression in ELA vs ALA in the frontal cortex of APOE4/4 AD patients. Differences in chromatin accessibility could contribute to these differences in APOE4 expression. Methods: We performed single nuclei Assays for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) and single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from frozen frontal cortex of six ALA and six ELA AD patients, all homozygous for local ancestry and APOE4. Results: We demonstrated that APOE4, including its promoter area, has greater chromatin accessibility in ELA vs ALA astrocytes. This increased accessibility in ELA astrocytes extended genome wide. Genes with increased accessibility and expression in ELA in astrocytes were enriched for synaptic function, cholesterol processing and astrocyte reactivity. Conclusion: Our results suggest that increased chromatin accessibility of APOE4 in astrocyte with the ELA contributes to the observed elevated APOE4 expression, corresponding to the increased AD risk in ELA vs ALA APOE4/4 carriers.

                Tractography is a powerful method to represent the structural connectivity of the brain white matter. Nevertheless, the comparison of these data structures between two individuals is still an open challenge because of their complexity, e.g. digital representation of millions of fibers as polylines. The scientific community spent a meaningful effort to develop new methods of white matter registration aiming to take advantage of diffusion MRI models. Despite the effort to improve the registration of the white matter, little is known about the effect of the registration on tractogram alignment. The main issue for an empirical evaluation is the lack of ground truth, e.g. a sample of data where the correct alignment is validated by experts. This work aims to overcome this drawback by proposing an evaluation framework based on the matching of homologous fiber structures, e.g. known neuroanatomical bundles. The contribution is a quantitative comparison of how the most representative methods of white matter registration affect tractogram alignment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The influence of familiarity on the neural coding of face sex</a></h4>

              
                In behaviour, humans have been shown to represent the sex of faces categorically when the faces are familiar to them. This leads to them judging faces crossing the category boundary (i.e. from male to female) as more different than faces that are within the same category. In this study, we investigated how faces of different sexes are encoded in the brain, and how familiarity changes the neural coding of sex. We recorded participants' brain activity using fMRI while they viewed both familiar and unfamiliar faces that were morphed in their sex characteristics (i.e. between male and female). Participants viewed pairs of faces that were either identical, or differed in their sex morph level, with or without a categorical change in perceived sex (i.e. crossing the perceived male/female category boundary). This allowed us to disentangle physical and categorical neural coding of face sex, and to investigate if neural coding of face categories was enhanced by face familiarity. Our results show that the sex of familiar, but not unfamiliar, faces was encoded categorically in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex as well as in the right intraparietal sulcus. In contrast, the fusiform face area showed a sensitivity to the physical changes in the sex of faces that was unaffected by face familiarity. The occipital face area showed its highest responses to faces towards the ends of the sex morph continuum (i.e. the most male or most female faces), and these responses were also unaffected by face familiarity. These results suggest that there is a dissociation between the brain regions encoding physical and categorical representations of face sex, with occipital and fusiform face regions encoding physical face sex properties and frontal and parietal regions encoding high-level categorical face sex representations that are linked to face identity.

                In this paper, the authors report simulations analogous to cross-modal integration which can be modeled by thinking of large (in terms of numbers of axons) axon tracts with distinctly demarcated subsets of axons. In such a tract, when the demarcated regions are separately stimulated they fire in response to the stimulation. Due to extracellular current-based coupling, at a later time, unstimulated axons also begin to cross-talk. The simulation graphical result, though on a faster time scale, is analogous to the multi-channel MEG recordings of "AV-(A+V)" obtained by Shams et. al. When the coupling parameter is weakened, this cross-talk disappears. In Shams et. al., the appearance and disappearance of cross-talk are related to the perception of an illusory flash by the subject. Our extrapolated conclusion is that ephaptic coupling might be a part of the mechanism for cross-talk between brain regions mediating, say, audio and visual- processing. We also study noisy ephaptic coupling and additionally do a comparative study with the Kuramoto model, which yields insight into the exact and detailed mechanism of ephaptic synchronization.

                Human single-unit studies currently rely on neurosurgical procedures that provide only limited brain coverage and on recording devices that do not integrate easily into established surgical routines. Here, we report reliable and robust acute multi-channel recordings with broad cortical access using planar microelectrode arrays (MEA) implanted intracortically in awake brain surgery. We provide a comprehensive characterization of extracellular neuronal activity acquired intraoperatively in tumor patients with large open craniotomies. MEA implantation was fast, safe and yielded high-quality signals at the microcircuit, local field potential level, and at the cellular, single-unit level. Recording from parietal association cortex, a region previously unexplored in human single-unit studies, we demonstrate applications on these complementary spatial scales and describe travelling waves of oscillatory activity as well as single-neuron and neuronal population responses during numerical cognition including operations with uniquely human number symbols. Intraoperative MEA recordings are practicable and can be scaled up to explore cellular and microcircuit mechanisms of a wide range of human brain functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overcoming the Blood-Brain Barrier for Gene Therapy via Systemic Administration of GSH-Responsive Silica Nanocapsules</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR genome editing has demonstrated great potential to treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain-targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which represents a substantial challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics. In this study, we created a library of GSH-responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) and screened them for brain targeting via systemic delivery of nucleic acids and CRISPR genome editors. In vivo studies demonstrated that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and RVG peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain-wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein) targeting both exogenous genes (i.e., Ai14 stop cassette) and disease-relevant endogenous genes (i.e., App and Th genes) in Ai14 reporter mice and wild-type mice, respectively. In particular, we observed up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (App) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild-type mice. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration and segregation in the brain as a cognitive flexibility during tasks and rest</a></h4>

              
                To flexibly respond to a continuously changing environment, the human brain must be able to flexibly switch amongst many demanding cognitive tasks. The flexibility inside the brain is enabled by integrating and segregating information in large-scale functional networks over time. In this study, we used graph theory metrics prior to clustering to identify two brain states, segregated and integrated, in 100 healthy adults selected from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset at rest and during six cognitive tasks. Furthermore, we explored two-dimensional (2D) latent space revealed by a deep autoencoder. In the latent space, the integrated state occupied less space compared with the segregated state. After binning the latent space, we obtained entropy from the probability for each data point of being in the bin. The integrated state showed lower entropy than the segregated state, and the rest modality showed higher entropy in both states compared with tasks. We also found that modularity and global efficiency are good measures for distinguishing between tasks and rest in both states. Overall, the study shows that integration and segregation are present in rest and in task modalities, while integration serves as information compression and segregation as information specialisation. These characteristics ensure the necessary cognitive flexibility to learn new tasks with deep proficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Daily Artificial Gravity is Associated with Greater Neural Efficiency during Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Altered vestibular signaling and body unloading in microgravity results in sensory reweighting and adaptation. Microgravity effects are well-replicated in head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR). Artificial gravity (AG) is a potential countermeasure to mitigate effects of microgravity. We examined the effectiveness of daily AG for mitigating brain and/or behavioral changes in 60 days of HDBR. One group received AG for 30 minutes daily (AG; n=16) and a control group spent the same time in HDBR but received no AG (CTRL; n=8). All participants performed a sensorimotor adaptation task 5 times during fMRI scanning: twice prior to HDBR twice during HDBR, and once following HDBR. The AG group showed similar behavioral adaptation effects compared with the CTRLs. We identified decreased brain activation in the AG group from pre to late HDBR in the cerebellum for the task baseline portion and in the thalamus, calcarine, cuneus, premotor cortices, and superior frontal gyrus in the AG group during the early adaptation phase. The two groups also exhibited differential brain-behavior correlations. Together, these results suggest that AG may result in a reduced recruitment of brain activity for basic motor processes and sensorimotor adaptation. These effects may stem from somatosensory and vestibular stimulation from AG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A subpopulation of peripheral sensory neurons expressing the Mas-related G Protein-Coupled Receptor d (Mrgprd) generates pain hypersensitivity in painful diabetic neuropathy.</a></h4>

              
                Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is one of the most common and intractable complications of diabetes. PDN is characterized by neuropathic pain accompanied by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor hyperexcitability, axonal degeneration, and loss of cutaneous innervation. However, the complete molecular profile underlying the hyper-excitable cellular phenotype of DRG nociceptors in PDN has not been elucidated. This gap in our knowledge is a critical barrier to developing effective, mechanism-based, and disease-modifying therapeutic approaches which are urgently needed to relieve the symptoms of PDN. Using single-cell RNA sequencing we demonstrated an increased expression of the Mas-related G Protein- Coupled Receptor d (Mrgprd) in a subpopulation of DRG neurons in the well-established High-Fat Diet (HFD) mouse model of PDN. In vivo calcium imaging allowed us to demonstrate that activation of Mrgprd receptors expressed by cutaneous afferents produced DRG neuron hyper-excitability and oscillatory calcium waves. Furthermore, Mrgprd-positive cutaneous afferents persist in diabetic mice skin. Importantly, limiting Mrgprd signaling or Mrgprd-positive DRG neuron excitability, reversed mechanical allodynia in the HFD mouse model of PDN. Taken together, our data highlights a key role of Mrgprd-mediated DRG neuron excitability in the generation and maintenance of neuropathic pain in a mouse model of PDN. Hence, we propose Mrgprd as a promising accessible target for developing effective therapeutics currently unavailable for treating neuropathic pain in PDN. Furthermore, understanding which DRG neurons cell type is mediating mechanical allodynia in PDN is of fundamental importance to our basic understanding of somatosensation and may provide an important way forward for identifying cell-type-specific therapeutics to optimize neuropathic pain treatment and nerve regeneration in PDN.

                The astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis entails that glycolytically derived pyruvate in astrocytes is converted to lactate instead of being catabolized in mitochondria. The mechanism of this metabolic rewiring is unclear. Here we show that astrocytes of the adult human neocortex and hippocampal formation do not express mitochondrial proteins critical for performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to a detectable degree, including cytochrome c and complex IV. Without OXPHOS, human brain astrocytes are bound to produce lactate to avoid interruption of glycolysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elevated estradiol during a hormone simulated pseudopregnancy decreases sleep and increases hypothalamic activation in female Syrian hamsters</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disruptions are a common occurrence during the peripartum period. While physical and environmental factors associated with pregnancy and newborn care account for some sleep disruptions, there is evidence that peripartum fluctuations in estrogens may independently impact sleep. We therefore used a hormone-simulated pseudopregnancy in female Syrian hamsters to test the hypothesis that pregnancy-like increases in estradiol decrease sleep in the absence of other factors. Adult female Syrian hamsters were ovariectomized and given daily hormone injections that simulate estradiol levels during early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and the postpartum period. Home cage video recordings were captured at seven timepoints and videos were analyzed for actigraphy. During ''late pregnancy,'' total sleep time and sleep efficiency were decreased in hormone-treated animals during the white light period compared to vehicle controls. During both ''early pregnancy'' and ''late pregnancy,'' locomotion was increased in the white light period for hormone-treated animals; this change continued into the ''postpartum period'' for animals who continued to receive estradiol treatment, but not for animals who were withdrawn from estradiol. At the conclusion of the experiment, animals were euthanized and cFos expression was quantified in the ventral lateral preoptic area (VLPO) and lateral hypothalamus (LH). Animals who continued to receive high levels of estradiol during the ''postpartum'' period had significantly more cFos in the VLPO and LH than animals who were withdrawn from hormones or vehicle controls. Together, these data suggest that increased levels of estradiol during pregnancy are associated with sleep suppression which may be mediated by increased activation of hypothalamic nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The circadian clock conveys thermal and photoperiodic cues to modulate EYES ABSENT via the neuropeptide PDF to regulate seasonal physiology</a></h4>

              
                Organisms adapt to seasonal changes in photoperiod and temperature to survive; however, the mechanisms by which these signals are integrated in the brain are poorly understood. We previously reported that EYES ABSENT (EYA) in Drosophila shows higher levels in cold temperature or short photoperiod, and genetic ablation of eya in the fly brain inhibits reproductive dormancy, suggesting that EYA promotes winter physiology. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which EYA senses seasonal cues are unclear. Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF) is a neuropeptide important for photoentrainment and regulation of circadian output rhythms. Interestingly, PDF also regulates reproductive dormancy, suggesting that it may mediate the function of the circadian clock in modulating seasonal physiology. In this study, we investigated the role of PDF signaling in mediating the impact of EYA on seasonal biology. First, we subjected flies to different photoperiodic and temperature regimes and observed that PDF abundance is lower in cold and short days, compared to warm and long days. Interestingly, the response of PDF to seasonal cues is opposite of what was observed for EYA. We then determined the potential for PDF to convey seasonal cues and modulate EYA function in seasonality by assessing coexpression of EYA and PDF receptor. Our results indicated that PDF receptor (PDFR) is indeed coexpressed with EYA in the fly brain, including in the circadian clock neuronal network and neurons in the pars intercerebralis. We then manipulated PDF signaling in eya+ cells to show that PDF modulates seasonal adaptations in daily activity rhythm and ovary development via EYA-dependent and independent mechanisms. At the molecular level, manipulating PDF signaling impacted EYA protein abundance. Specifically, we showed that protein kinase A (PKA), an effector of PDF signaling, phosphorylates EYA and promotes its degradation. This explains the opposite responses of PDF and EYA abundance to changes in seasonal cues. In summary, our results support a model in which PDF signaling negatively modulates EYA levels to regulate seasonal physiology, linking the circadian clock to the modulation of seasonal adaptations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta phase specific modulation of hippocampal memory neurons</a></h4>

              
                The theta rhythm, a quasi-periodic 4-10 Hz oscillation, is observed during memory processing in the hippocampus, with different phases of theta hypothesized to separate independent streams of information related to the encoding and recall of memories. At the cellular level, the discovery of hippocampal memory cells (engram neurons), as well as the modulation of memory recall through optogenetic activation of these cells, has provided evidence that certain memories are stored, in part, in a sparse ensemble of neurons in the hippocampus. In previous research, however, engram reactivation has been carried out using open loop stimulation at fixed frequencies; the relationship between engram neuron reactivation and ongoing network oscillations has not been taken into consideration. To address this concern, we implemented a closed-loop reactivation of engram neurons that enabled phase-specific stimulation relative to theta oscillations in the local field potential. Using this real-time approach, we tested the impact of activating engram neurons during the peak (encoding phase) and trough (recall phase) of theta oscillations. Consistent with previously hypothesized functions of theta oscillations in memory function, we show that stimulating engram neurons at the trough of theta is more effective in eliciting behavioral recall than either fixed frequency stimulation or stimulation at the peak of theta. Moreover, phase-specific trough stimulation is accompanied by an increase in the coupling between gamma and theta oscillations in CA1 hippocampus. Oure results provide a causal link between phasespecific activation of engram cells and the behavioral expression of memory.

	<p>The human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been traditionally associated with decision-making under risk. Neuroimaging studies of such decision-making processes have largely focused on patients with vmPFC lesions or pathological gambling behavior, leading to a relative paucity of work focusing on the structural variability of the vmPFC in healthy individuals. To address this, we developed a decision-making task that allowed healthy players to choose to participate in either low stakes or high-stakes gambling on a trial-by-trial basis, and computed a metric that indexes the propensity for engaging in gambles with greater potential payoffs. We leveraged voxel-based morphometric analyses to examine the association between prefrontal gray matter volume and individual differences in the propensity for seeking high-risk/high-reward situations. Our analyses showed that vmPFC gray matter volume was inversely correlated with an increased tendency for engaging in high-stakes gambling. These results converge with findings from functional neuroimaging and brain lesion studies of vmPFC, and further extend them to show that normative variability in brain structure could also underpin risk-taking behavior.</p>

	<p>In modern warfare, operators of radar equipment are confronted with a large amount of information in a short period of time that they must process to make decisions. Such conditions often lead to human error, resulting in the loss of the best operational opportunities and putting themselves at a disadvantage. To address this issue, in this paper, we presents three intuitive designs for radar display interface icons, namely image schema, stereotypes, and expert intuition. Based on event-related potential techniques and eye-movement techniques, a modified sample delay matching task experimental paradigm is used to investigate the advantages and mechanisms of three intuitionistic designs with varying time pressures and numbers of tasks. The experimental results showed: (1) When representing the attributes of a target, image schema are most suitable for expressing the motion attributes of the target, such as speed and height, whereas stereotypes are most suitable for expressing fixed attributes, such as target threat. (2) Tasks with high time pressure are more difficult, leading to higher error rates; the reaction time of a single task should be no less than 4000 ms. (3) When multiple attributes of the target need to be observed at the same time, the same type of expression should be used. (4) Rational use of color to represent the target attributes can effectively reduce the cognitive load of people searching for the target.</p>

	<p>Metacognition has only scarcely been investigated in brain tumor patients. It is unclear if and how the tumor-lesioned brain might be able to maintain an adequate sense-of-self. As cortical midline structures (CMS) are regarded as essential for self-referential mental activity, we investigated resting-state fMRI connectivity (FC) of CMS to the default-mode network (DMN) and to the whole brain, comparing glioma patients and matched controls. Subjects furthermore performed a trait judgement (TJ), a trait recall task (TR), and neuropsychological testing. In the TJ, adjectives had to be ascribed as self- or non-self-describing, assessing the self-serving effect (SSE), a normally observed bias for positive traits. In the TR, the mnemic neglect effect (MNE), a memory advantage for positive traits, was tested. The groups were compared and partial correlations between FC and test metrics were analyzed. Although patients were significantly impaired in terms of verbal memory, groups did not differ in the SSE or the MNE results, showing preserved metacognitive abilities in patients. FC of CMS to the DMN was maintained, but was significantly decreased to whole brain in the patients. FC of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) to whole brain was correlated with the MNE in patients. Preserving the DMPFC in therapeutic interventions might be relevant for maintaining self-related verbal information processing in the memory domain in glioma patients.</p>

	<p>The current study aimed to investigate attentional processing differences for circumscribed interest (CI) and non-CI objects in young Chinese children with autism spectrum condition (ASC) and typically developing (TD) controls. In Experiment 1, a visual preference task explored attentional allocation to cartoon CI and non-CI materials between the two groups. We found that ASC children (n = 22, 4.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.59 years) exhibited a preference for CI-related objects compared to non-CI objects, and this effect was absent in the TD children (n = 22, 5.14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.44 years). Experiment 2 utilized the traditional gap-overlap paradigm (GOP) to investigate attentional disengagement from CI or non-CI items in both groups (ASC: n = 20, 5.92 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.13 years; TD: n = 25, 5.77 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.77 years). There were no group or stimulus interactions in this study. Experiment 3 adopted a modified GOP (MGOP) to further explore disengagement in the two groups (ASC: n = 20, 5.54 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.95 years; TD: n = 24, 5.75 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.52 years), and the results suggested that exogenous disengagement performance was preserved in the ASC group, but the children with ASC exhibited increased endogenous attentional disengagement compared to TD peers. Moreover, endogenous disengagement was influenced further in the presence of CI-related objects in the ASC children. The current results have implications for understanding how the nature of engagement and disengagement processes can contribute to differences in the development of core cognitive skills in young children with ASC.</p>

	<p>The present study examined the evolution of the behavioral performance, subjectively perceived difficulty, and hemodynamic activity of the prefrontal cortex as a function of cognitive load during two different cognitive tasks tapping executive functions. Additionally, it investigated the relationships between these behavioral, subjective, and neuroimaging data. Nineteen right-handed young adults (18&amp;amp;ndash;22 years) were scanned using continuous-wave functional near-infrared spectroscopy during the performance of n-back and random number generation tasks in three cognitive load conditions. Four emitter and four receptor optodes were fixed bilaterally over the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to record the hemodynamic changes. A self-reported scale measured the perceived difficulty. The findings of this study showed that an increasing cognitive load deteriorated the behavioral performance and increased the perceived difficulty. The hemodynamic activity increased parametrically for the three cognitive loads of the random number generation task and in a two-back and three-back compared to a one-back condition. In addition, the hemodynamic activity was specifically greater in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex than in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for both cognitive tasks (random number generation and n-back tasks). Finally, the results highlighted some links between cerebral oxygenation and the behavioral performance, but not the subjectively perceived difficulty. Our results suggest that cognitive load affects the executive performance and perceived difficulty and that fNIRS can be used to specify the prefrontal cortex&amp;amp;rsquo;s implications for executive tasks involving inhibition and working memory updating.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Dendritic spines are submicron, subcellular compartments whose shape is defined by actin filaments and associated proteins. Accurately mapping the cytoskeleton is a challenge, given the small size of its components. It remains unclear whether the actin-associated structures analyzed in dendritic spines of neurons <I>in vitro</I> apply to dendritic spines of intact, mature neurons <I>in situ.</I> Here, we combined advanced preparative methods with multitilt serial section electron microscopy (EM) tomography and computational analysis to reveal the full three-dimensional (3D) internal architecture of spines in the intact brains of male mice at nanometer resolution. We compared hippocampal (CA1) pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells in terms of the length distribution and connectivity of filaments, their branching-angles and absolute orientations, and the elementary loops formed by the network. Despite differences in shape and size across spines and between spine heads and necks, the internal organization was remarkably similar in both neuron types and largely homogeneous throughout the spine volume. In the tortuous mesh of highly branched and interconnected filaments, branches exhibited no preferred orientation except in the immediate vicinity of the cell membrane. We found that new filaments preferentially split off from the convex side of a bending filament, consistent with the behavior of Arp2/3-mediated branching of actin under mechanical deformation. Based on the quantitative analysis, the spine cytoskeleton is likely subject to considerable mechanical force <I>in situ</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Musical Meter Induces Interbrain Synchronization during Interpersonal Coordination</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Music induces people to coordinate with one another. Here, we conduct two experiments to examine the underlying mechanism of the interbrain synchronization (IBS) that is induced by interpersonal coordination when people are exposed to musical beat and meter. In experiment 1, brain signals at the frontal cortex were recorded simultaneously from two participants of a dyad by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, while each tapped their fingers to aural feedback from their partner (coordination task) or from themselves (independence task) with and without the musical meter. The results showed enhanced IBS at the left-middle frontal cortex in case of the coordination task with musical beat and meter. The IBS was significantly correlated with the participants performance in terms of coordination. In experiment 2, we further examined the IBS while the participants coordinated their behaviors in various metrical contexts, such as strong and weak meters (i.e., high/low loudness of acoustically accenting beats). The results showed that strong meters elicited higher IBS at the middle frontal cortex than weak meters. These findings reveal that the musical beat and meter can affect brain-to-brain coupling in action coordination between people, and provide insights into the interbrain mechanism underlying the effects of music on cooperation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Activity monitoring of stroke patients by physiotherapist and caregivers in a hospital setting [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Activity monitoring is a necessary technique to ensure stroke survivors’ activity levels in the hospital are within optimal levels as this is important for enhanced motor recovery. However, this could be time-consuming for healthcare professionals like physiotherapists. Activity monitoring by caregivers could be an alternate option. Therefore, our aim was to compare the activity monitoring of stroke survivors by caregivers and physiotherapists in a hospital setting. Methods: An observation study was carried out in the neuroscience ward in a tertiary care hospital among 17 stroke survivors. Physiotherapist and caregivers were instructed to use an activity log chart that was developed during previous research conducted by the same authors for observing the activities performed by the patients every 15 minutes from 8 AM to 5 PM. Data collected were analysed using Stata 15. Kappa statistics were carried out to determine the agreement of the observations between the two raters. Results: A total of 10 male and seven female caregivers of stroke survivors with a mean age of 40.11 ± 9.2 years participated in the study. A total of 272 observations of caregivers were in agreement with that of the physiotherapist. Inter-rater Kappa statistics showed 60% agreement between the physiotherapist and the caregivers, while the multi-rater Kappa for different time points did not show agreement (Kappa value <0.1). Conclusions: There was moderate agreement between the physiotherapist and caregiver for activity monitoring of stroke survivors. This suggests behavioural mapping by caregivers may be a potential alternative solution in healthcare settings.

                Background: Maternal mental status has been thought to be affected by the delivery modes. We examined the relation between delivery modes and the mental status of women who delivered at our institute in Japan. Methods: Data were collected from the medical charts of 643 primiparous women without a history of mental disorders who delivered singleton babies and underwent a 1-month postpartum check-up at our institute from September 2018 to June 2019. The maternal mental status was examined based on the scores of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Mother-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS). Results: The rate of high scores of the EPDS and the MIBS in women choosing elective cesarean section were higher than in women with vaginal delivery and emergency cesarean section. Conclusion: Mental health care may be necessary for women choosing elective cesarean section.

                <p>by Jialu Hou, Hang Wei, Bin Liu</p>
Motivation <p>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a critical role in the progression of various diseases. Accurately identifying the associations between piRNAs and diseases is important for diagnosing and prognosticating diseases. Although some computational methods have been proposed to detect piRNA-disease associations, it is challenging for these methods to effectively capture nonlinear and complex relationships between piRNAs and diseases because of the limited training data and insufficient association representation.</p> Results <p>With the growth of piRNA-disease association data, it is possible to design a more complex machine learning method to solve this problem. In this study, we propose a computational method called iPiDA-GCN for piRNA-disease association identification based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The iPiDA-GCN predictor constructs the graphs based on piRNA sequence information, disease semantic information and known piRNA-disease associations. Two GCNs (Asso-GCN and Sim-GCN) are used to extract the features of both piRNAs and diseases by capturing the association patterns from piRNA-disease interaction network and two similarity networks. GCNs can capture complex network structure information from these networks, and learn discriminative features. Finally, the full connection networks and inner production are utilized as the output module to predict piRNA-disease association scores. Experimental results demonstrate that iPiDA-GCN achieves better performance than the other state-of-the-art methods, benefitted from the discriminative features extracted by Asso-GCN and Sim-GCN. The iPiDA-GCN predictor is able to detect new piRNA-disease associations to reveal the potential pathogenesis at the RNA level. The data and source code are available at http://bliulab.net/iPiDA-GCN/.</p>

                <p>by Hadar Cohen-Duwek, Hamutal Slovin, Elishai Ezra Tsur</p>

Biologically plausible computational modeling of visual perception has the potential to link high-level visual experiences to their underlying neurons’ spiking dynamic. In this work, we propose a neuromorphic (brain-inspired) Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-driven model for the reconstruction of colorful images from retinal inputs. We compared our results to experimentally obtained V1 neuronal activity maps in a macaque monkey using voltage-sensitive dye imaging and used the model to demonstrate and critically explore color constancy, color assimilation, and ambiguous color perception. Our parametric implementation allows critical evaluation of visual phenomena in a single biologically plausible computational framework. It uses a parametrized combination of high and low pass image filtering and SNN-based filling-in Poisson processes to provide adequate color image perception while accounting for differences in individual perception.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Venus: An efficient virus infection detection and fusion site discovery method using single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Che Yu Lee, Yuhang Chen, Ziheng Duan, Min Xu, Matthew Girgenti, Ke Xu, Mark Gerstein, Jing Zhang</p>

Early and accurate detection of viruses in clinical and environmental samples is essential for effective public healthcare, treatment, and therapeutics. While PCR detects potential pathogens with high sensitivity, it is difficult to scale and requires knowledge of the exact sequence of the pathogen. With the advent of next-gen single-cell sequencing, it is now possible to scrutinize viral transcriptomics at the finest possible resolution–cells. This newfound ability to investigate individual cells opens new avenues to understand viral pathophysiology with unprecedented resolution. To leverage this ability, we propose an efficient and accurate computational pipeline, named Venus, for virus detection and integration site discovery in both single-cell and bulk-tissue RNA-seq data. Specifically, Venus addresses two main questions: whether a tissue/cell type is infected by viruses or a virus of interest? And if infected, whether and where has the virus inserted itself into the human genome? Our analysis can be broken into two parts–validation and discovery. Firstly, for validation, we applied Venus on well-studied viral datasets, such as HBV- hepatocellular carcinoma and HIV-infection treated with antiretroviral therapy. Secondly, for discovery, we analyzed datasets such as HIV-infected neurological patients and deeply sequenced T-cells. We detected viral transcripts in the novel target of the brain and high-confidence integration sites in immune cells. In conclusion, here we describe Venus, a publicly available software which we believe will be a valuable virus investigation tool for the scientific community at large.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Unsupervised machine learning predicts future sexual behaviour and sexually transmitted infections among HIV-positive men who have sex with men</a></h4>

Roth, Patrick Schmid, Enos Bernasconi, Huldrych F. Günthard, Andri Rauch, Roger D. Kouyos, Luisa Salazar-Vizcaya, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study </p>

Machine learning is increasingly introduced into medical fields, yet there is limited evidence for its benefit over more commonly used statistical methods in epidemiological studies. We introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework for longitudinal features and evaluate it using sexual behaviour data from the last 20 years from over 3’700 participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). We use hierarchical clustering to find subgroups of men who have sex with men in the SHCS with similar sexual behaviour up to May 2017, and apply regression to test whether these clusters enhance predictions of sexual behaviour or sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) after May 2017 beyond what can be predicted with conventional parameters. We find that behavioural clusters enhance model performance according to likelihood ratio test, Akaike information criterion and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for all outcomes studied, and according to Bayesian information criterion for five out of ten outcomes, with particularly good performance for predicting future sexual behaviour and recurrent STIs. We thus assess a methodology that can be used as an alternative means for creating exposure categories from longitudinal data in epidemiological models, and can contribute to the understanding of time-varying risk factors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CHOIRBM: An R package for exploratory data analysis and interactive visualization of pain patient body map data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric Cramer, Maisa Ziadni, Kristen Hymel Scherrer, Sean Mackey, Ming-Chih Kao</p>

Body maps are commonly used to capture the location of a patient’s pain and thus reflect the extent of pain throughout the body. With increasing electronic capture body map information, there is an emerging need for clinic- and research-ready tools capable of visualizing this data on individual and mass scales. Here we propose CHOIRBM, an extensible and modular R package and companion web application built on the grammar of graphics system. CHOIRBM provides functions that simplify the process of analyzing and plotting patient body map data integrated from the CHOIR Body Map (CBM) at both individual patient and large-dataset levels. CHOIRBM is built on the popular R graphics package, ggplot2, which facilitates further development and addition of functionality by the open-source development community as future requirements arise. The CHOIRBM package is distributed under the terms of the MIT license and is available on CRAN. The development version of the package with the latest functions may be installed from GitHub. Example analysis using CHOIRBM demonstrates the functionality of the modular R package and highlights both the clinical and research utility of efficiently producing CBM visualizations.

The cerebral cortex is organized in cortical layers that differ in their cellular density, composition, and wiring. Cortical laminar architecture is also readily revealed by staining for cytochrome oxidase—the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has been hypothesized that a high-density band of cytochrome oxidase in cortical layer IV reflects higher oxygen consumption under baseline (unstimulated) conditions. Here, we tested the above hypothesis using direct measurements of the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> (pO<sub>2</sub>) in cortical tissue by means of 2-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM). We revisited our previously developed method for extraction of the cerebral metabolic rate of O<sub>2</sub> (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) based on 2-photon pO<sub>2</sub> measurements around diving arterioles and applied this method to estimate baseline CMRO<sub>2</sub> in awake mice across cortical layers. To our surprise, our results revealed a decrease in baseline CMRO<sub>2</sub> from layer I to layer IV. This decrease of CMRO<sub>2</sub> with cortical depth was paralleled by an increase in tissue oxygenation. Higher baseline oxygenation and cytochrome density in layer IV may serve as an O<sub>2</sub> reserve during surges of neuronal activity or certain metabolically active brain states rather than reflecting baseline energy needs. Our study provides to our knowledge the first quantification of microscopically resolved CMRO<sub>2</sub> across cortical layers as a step towards better understanding of brain energy metabolism.

                Background In addition to the cardiorespiratory, muscular, and neurological manifestations, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) alters patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL), induces a large variety of psychiatric manifestations, and reduces mobility and motor activity. Several studies have raised the impact of a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) on social disadvantage (e.g., HRQoL, anxiety, depression) and physical activity of COVID-19 patients, but very few have been performed in low-income countries. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a PRP on post-COVID-19 HRQoL, hospital anxiety and depression (HAD), and physical activity in Tunisian post-COVID19-patients. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in an outpatient care setting. Patients with post-COVID-19 were included. They completed an interview (including three questionnaires) before and after a PRP (three sessions/week for four weeks, each session was 70 minutes in duration, PRP items: aerobic cycle endurance, strength training, and education). The VQ11 questionnaire assessed functional dimension, psychological dimension, relational dimension, and total score; HAD appraised depression and anxiety; and Voorrips physical activity assessed daily activity, physical activity, leisure activity, and total scores. Data were expressed as mean±standard deviation in PRP change (PRP change=after-PRP values − before-PRP values). Results In total, 14 moderate to severe post-COVID-19 patients (61±4 years) were included. The PRP significantly improved the i) functional, psychological, and relational dimensions, and the VQ11 total score by 1.79±1.58 (p=0.0033), 2.00±2.15 (p=0.0108), 1.57±1.50 (p=0.0077), and 5.36±3.97 (p=0.0015), respectively; ii) HAD anxiety and depression scores by 2.07±2.40 (p=0.0076), and 2.57±3.08 (p=0.0058); and iii) physical activity and total scores by 1.75±2.44 (p=0.0251), and 1.78±2.65 (p=0.0341), respectively. Conclusion The PRP improved HRQoL, HAD, and physical activity of Tunisian post-COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in vulvar cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory immune checkpoint seems to have a significant prognostic impact in the evolution of certain cancers such as bronchopulmonary cancer, breast cancer, lymphomas etc. Indeed, it has been suggested that PD-L1 expression was associated with a worse prognosis due to its immunosuppressive activity within tumor tissue. Currently, the evaluation of the expression of these biomarkers is of increasing interest in gynecological cancers. Hence, we proposed to study the expression of PDL1 in vulvar cancer. Our aims were to study the expression profile of PD-L1 in vulvar cancer by immunohistochemistry and to correlate its expression with overall and relapse-free survival rates. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted at the pathological anatomy and cytology department of the Saleh Azaiez Institute, Tunis, Tunisia involving 55 patients followed for vulvar cancer over a period of 13 years from 2008 to 2021. Clinicopathologic data was collected from medical records and pathology reports. Results: PD-L1 expression in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma was observed in 44% of cases. This expression was noted in 33% of cases in tumor cells and in 11% of cases in lymphocytes. The median follow-up period was 40 months. During this period, 30% of patients relapsed. For all recurrence cases, 77% were during the first two years. The overall survival rate was 68.4% at two years and 50.3% at five years. The recurrence-free survival rate was 63.8% at five years. Overall survival as well as recurrence-free survival were more reduced in the case of PD-L1 expression. However, this difference was not significant (p=0.07). Conclusions: These results, although insufficient, emphasize the prognostic value that PDL1 could play in vulvar cancer as described in the literature. Despite the low numbers and the unavailability of data for some cases, our results encourage carrying out this work on larger populations.

                Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs. sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on glycemic control and blood lipid profile at preoperative (baseline), three and six months after surgery. Methods: In a prospective non-randomized design, 32 participants, SG (n = 11) and RYGB (n = 21) completed the study. Results: Results showed that fasting blood glucose (FBG) and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were significantly reduced from 113.55±30.18 mg/dL at baseline to 93.6±14.81 mg/dL at three months post operation following SG (p = 0.006). In addition, HbA1C decreased significantly in both groups at baseline, three- and six-months post operation (SG 6.41± 0.96, 5.4±0.36 and 5.28±0.57 % (p = 0.022) and RYGB 5.91± 0.94, 5.11± 0.57 and 4.96± 0.55% (p<0.001) respectively). Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were restored significantly in both groups at 6 months compared to three months post-surgery (SG 41.2± 9.99, 38.67±4.85 and 45.36± 6.22 (p = 0.023) and RYGB 42.67± 9.97, 36.58± 6.06 and 43.03± 6.66 (p =0.003) respectively), whereas there is no significant different in low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. Conclusions: Both bariatric surgery (SG and RYGB) improved glycemic control and blood lipid profile. Trial registration: The trial is registered with Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR20210429004) April 29, 2021.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Suicide in the geriatric population of South East Asia - contexts and attributes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Suicide in the geriatric population is a significant problem. Increasing age, living alone, having a psychiatric illness and medical comorbidities have been identified as risk factors for suicide among the elderly population. The elderly population in South East Asia is rapidly growing and the number of elderly people with mental illness and/or medical comorbidities is also increasing. The factors and attributes of suicide may vary from region to region due to socio-cultural and geographic diversities. Understanding these factors may help in planning suicide prevention strategies for the elderly population. There is a dearth of studies assessing the demography, risk factors for, and prevention of suicide among the elderly population in South East Asia. We tried to observe and explain the challenging paradigms to excerpt attributes and the context of geriatric suicide. It is observed in this review that lack of social integration or interaction along with some psychiatric disorders leads to suicidal ideation and completed suicide in the elderly. South East Asia has unique characteristics in several aspects like religious and cultural diversity, poverty, unemployment, demographic structure of the region, migration, natural disasters and calamities, political environment, poor policy implementation, and easy access to suicide means (e.g. pesticides). Primary care physicians, specialized mental health support, gate-keeper training, means restriction, raising awareness, supportive family environment, and dedicated call centers could be potential areas for suicide prevention among the elderly people of the region.  Further studies are warranted to formulate effective suicide prevention strategies.

                Background: Today, people use plants to treat various types of diseases and improve human health. One of the medicinal plants is the Betadine plant (Jatropha multifida L.). Betadine plants have many functions, especially the sap, leaves, fruit and seeds. The compound contents in Betadine stem sap, which is efficacious as an antimicrobial, are saponins, tannins, flavonoids and labaditin. One of the bacteria that cause infection is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These bacteria can cause opportunistic and nosocomial infections. Methods: This study was a true experimental laboratory with a post-test only control group design. This study used Betadine stem sap extract with concentrations of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, gentamicin cream 10% as positive control, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution as negative control. This study used the Kirby-Bauer diffusion method and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown on nutrient agar media, then incubated for 24 hours and calculated using calipers. Research data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA test. Results: The highest inhibition zone was group 50% (12.725 ± 0.2500 mm) while the lowest inhibition zone was group 100% (8.675 ± 0.5620 mm). Conclusions: Betadine stem extract had antibacterial activity in inhibiting the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, with the 50% concentration being the most effective in inhibiting the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria.

We recently reported that staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA-binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with <i>MTOR</i> mRNA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>STAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-<i>C9ORF72</i>, <i>ATXN2</i>
<sup>
   <i>Q127</i>
</sup>, and <i>Thy1</i>-<i>TDP-43</i> transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9ORF72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by <i>STAU1</i> RNA interference (RNAi). Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct <i>MTOR</i> mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in an SCA2 cellular model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity and autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The peritumoral brain zone in glioblastoma: where we are and where we are going</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and invasive primary brain tumor. Current therapies are not curative, and patients' outcomes remain poor with an overall survival of 20.9 months after surgery. The typical growing pattern of GBM develops by infiltrating the surrounding apparent normal brain tissue within which the recurrence is expected to appear in the majority of cases. Thus, in the last decades, an increased interest has developed to investigate the cellular and molecular interactions between GBM and the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) bordering the tumor tissue. The aim of this review is to provide up-to-date knowledge about the oncogenic properties of the PBZ to highlight possible druggable targets for more effective treatment of GBM by limiting the formation of recurrence, which is almost inevitable in the majority of patients. Starting from the description of the cellular components, passing through the illustration of the molecular profiles, we finally focused on more clinical aspects, represented by imaging and radiological details. The complete picture that emerges from this review could provide new input for future investigations aimed at identifying new effective strategies to eradicate this still incurable tumor.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">CircSeqAlignTk: An R package for end-to-end analysis of RNA-seq data for circular genomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has now become one of the standard tools for studying biological mechanisms at the transcriptome level. Advances in RNA-seq technology have led to the emergence of a large number of publicly available tools for RNA-seq data analysis. Most of them target linear genome sequences although it is necessary to study organisms with circular genome sequences. For example, by studying the infection mechanisms of viroids which comprise 246–401 nucleotides circular RNAs and target plants, tremendous economic and agricultural damage may be prevented. Unfortunately, using the available tools to construct workflows for the analysis of circular genome sequences is difficult, especially for non-bioinformaticians. To overcome this limitation, we present CircSeqAlignTk, an easy-to-use and richly documented R package. CircSeqAlignTk performs end-to-end RNA-seq data analysis, from alignment to the visualization of circular genome sequences, through a series of functions. Additionally, it implements a function to generate synthetic sequencing data that mimics real RNA-seq data obtained from biological experiments. CircSeqAlignTk not only provides an easy-to-use analysis interface for novice users but also allows developers to evaluate the performance of alignment tools and new workflows.

By combining bolus dosing, knockdown, and Z-REX-a tool investigating on-target/on-pathway electrophile signaling, we document that electrophile labeling of one zebrafish-Keap1-paralog (zKeap1b) stimulates Nrf2- driven antioxidant response (AR) signaling (like the human-ortholog). Conversely, zKeap1a is a dominant-negative regulator of electrophile-promoted Nrf2-signaling, and itself is nonpermissive for electrophile-induced Nrf2-upregulation. This behavior is recapitulated in human cells, wherein following electrophile treatment: (1) zKeap1b-transfected cells are permissive for augmented AR-signaling through reduced zKeap1b-Nrf2 binding; (2) zKeap1a-transfected cells are non-permissive for AR-upregulation, as zKeap1a-Nrf2 binding capacity remains unaltered; (3) 1:1 ZKeap1a:zKeap1b-transfected cells show no Nrf2-release from the Keap1-complex, rendering these cells unable to upregulate AR. We identified a zKeap1a-specific point-mutation (C273I) responsible for zKeap1a's behavior. Human-Keap1(C273I), of known diminished Nrf2-regulatory capacity, dominantly muted electrophile-induced Nrf2-signaling. These studies highlight divergent and interdependent <i>electrophile signaling</i> behaviors, despite conserved <i>electrophile sensing</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visual and motor signatures of locomotion dynamically shape a population code for feature detection in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Natural vision is dynamic: as an animal moves, its visual input changes dramatically. How can the visual system reliably extract local features from an input dominated by self-generated signals? In Drosophila, diverse local visual features are represented by a group of projection neurons with distinct tuning properties. Here we describe a connectome-based volumetric imaging strategy to measure visually evoked neural activity across this population. We show that local visual features are jointly represented across the population, and that a shared gain factor improves trial-to-trial coding fidelity. A subset of these neurons, tuned to small objects, is modulated by two independent signals associated with self-movement, a motor-related signal and a visual motion signal associated with rotation of the animal. These two inputs adjust the sensitivity of these feature detectors across the locomotor cycle, selectively reducing their gain during saccades and restoring it during intersaccadic intervals. This work reveals a strategy for reliable feature detection during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diversification dynamics in the Neotropics through time, clades and biogeographic regions</a></h4>

              
                The origins and evolution of the outstanding Neotropical biodiversity are a matter of intense debate. A comprehensive understanding is hindered by the lack of deep-time comparative data across wide phylogenetic and ecological contexts. Here, we quantify the prevailing diversification trajectories and drivers of Neotropical diversification in a sample of 150 phylogenies (12,512 species) of seed plants and tetrapods, and assess their variation across Neotropical regions and taxa. Analyses indicate that Neotropical diversity has mostly expanded through time (70% of the clades), while scenarios of saturated and declining diversity account for 21% and 9% of Neotropical diversity, respectively. Five biogeographic areas are identified as distinctive units of long-term Neotropical evolution, including Pan-Amazonia, the Dry Diagonal, and Bahama-Antilles. Diversification dynamics do not differ across these areas, suggesting no geographic structure in long-term Neotropical diversification. In contrast, diversification dynamics differ across taxa: plant diversity mostly expanded through time (88%), while a substantial fraction (43%) of tetrapod diversity accumulated at a slower pace or declined toward the present. These opposite evolutionary patterns may reflect different capacities for plants and tetrapods to cope with past climate changes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Excitatory and inhibitory D-serine binding to the NMDA receptor</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) uniquely require binding of two different neurotransmitter agonists for synaptic transmission. D-serine and glycine bind to one subunit, GluN1, while glutamate binds to the other, GluN2. These agonists bind to the receptor’s bi-lobed ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which close around the agonist during receptor activation. To better understand the unexplored mechanisms by which D-serine contributes to receptor activation, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the GluN1/GluN2A LBD dimer with free D-serine and glutamate agonists. Surprisingly, we observed D-serine binding to both GluN1 and GluN2A LBDs, suggesting that D-serine competes with glutamate for binding to GluN2A. This mechanism is confirmed by our electrophysiology experiments, which show that D-serine is indeed inhibitory at high concentrations. Although free energy calculations indicate that D-serine stabilizes the closed GluN2A LBD, its inhibitory behavior suggests that it either does not remain bound long enough or does not generate sufficient force for ion channel gating. We developed a workflow using pathway similarity analysis to identify groups of residues working together to promote binding. These conformation-dependent pathways were not significantly impacted by the presence of N-linked glycans, which act primarily by interacting with the LBD bottom lobe to stabilize the closed LBD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analyzing the brainstem circuits for respiratory chemosensitivity in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of systemic PCO<sub>2</sub> is a life-preserving homeostatic mechanism. In the medulla oblongata, the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and rostral medullary Raphe are proposed as CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensory nuclei mediating adaptive respiratory changes. Hypercapnia also induces active expiration, an adaptive change thought to be controlled by the lateral parafacial region (pF<sub>L</sub>). Here we use GCaMP6 expression and head-mounted mini-microscopes to image Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in these nuclei in awake adult mice during hypercapnia. Activity in the pF<sub>L</sub> supports its role as a homogenous neuronal population that drives active expiration. Our data show that chemosensory responses in the RTN and Raphe differ in their temporal characteristics and sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>, raising the possibility these nuclei act in a coordinated way to generate adaptive ventilatory responses to hypercapnia. Our analysis revises the understanding of chemosensory control in awake adult mouse and paves the way to understanding how breathing is coordinated with complex non-ventilatory behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Covalent disruptor of YAP-TEAD association suppresses defective hippo signaling</a></h4>

              
                The transcription factor TEAD, together with its coactivator YAP/TAZ, is a key transcriptional modulator of the Hippo pathway. Activation of TEAD transcription by YAP has been implicated in a number of malignancies, and this complex represents a promising target for drug discovery. However, both YAP and its extensive binding interfaces to TEAD have been difficult to address using small molecules, mainly due to a lack of druggable pockets. TEAD is post-translationally modified by palmitoylation that targets a conserved cysteine at a central pocket, which provides an opportunity to develop cysteine-directed covalent small molecules for TEAD inhibition. Here, we employed covalent fragment screening approach followed by structure-based design to develop an irreversible TEAD inhibitor MYF-03-69. Using a range of <i>in vitro</i> and cell-based assays we demonstrated that through a covalent binding with TEAD palmitate pocket, MYF-03-69 disrupts YAP-TEAD association, suppresses TEAD transcriptional activity and inhibits cell growth of Hippo signaling defective malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Further, a cell viability screening with a panel of 903 cancer cell lines indicated a high correlation between TEAD-YAP dependency and the sensitivity to MYF-03-69. Transcription profiling identified the upregulation of proapoptotic <i>BMF</i> gene in cancer cells that are sensitive to TEAD inhibition. Further optimization of MYF-03-69 led to an <i>in vivo</i> compatible compound MYF-03-176, which shows strong antitumor efficacy in MPM mouse xenograft model via oral administration. Taken together, we disclosed a story of the development of covalent TEAD inhibitors and its high therapeutic potential for clinic treatment for the cancers that are driven by TEAD-YAP alteration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Wide-ranging consequences of priority effects governed by an overarching factor</a></h4>

              
                Priority effects, where arrival order and initial relative abundance modulate local species interactions, can exert taxonomic, functional, and evolutionary influences on ecological communities by driving them to alternative states. It remains unclear if these wide-ranging consequences of priority effects can be explained systematically by a common underlying factor. Here, we identify such a factor in an empirical system. In a series of field and laboratory studies, we focus on how pH affects nectar-colonizing microbes and their interactions with plants and pollinators. In a field survey, we found that nectar microbial communities in a hummingbird-pollinated shrub, <i>Diplacus</i> (formerly <i>Mimulus</i>) <i>aurantiacus</i>, exhibited abundance patterns indicative of alternative stable states that emerge through domination by either bacteria or yeasts within individual flowers. In addition, nectar pH varied among <i>D. aurantiacus</i> flowers in a manner that is consistent with the existence of these alternative stable states. In laboratory experiments, <i>Acinetobacter nectaris</i>, the bacterium most commonly found in <i>D. aurantiacus</i> nectar, exerted a strongly negative priority effect against <i>Metschnikowia reukaufii</i>, the most common nectar-specialist yeast, by reducing nectar pH. This priority effect likely explains the mutually exclusive pattern of dominance found in the field survey. Furthermore, experimental evolution simulating hummingbird-assisted dispersal between flowers revealed that <i>M. reukaufii</i> could evolve rapidly to improve resistance against the priority effect if constantly exposed to <i>A. nectaris</i>-induced pH reduction. Finally, in a field experiment, we found that low nectar pH could reduce nectar consumption by hummingbirds, suggesting functional consequences of the pH-driven priority effect for plant reproduction. Taken together, these results show that it is possible to identify an overarching factor that governs the eco-evolutionary dynamics of priority effects across multiple levels of biological organization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autoantibody discovery across monogenic, acquired, and COVID19-associated autoimmunity with scalable PhIP-Seq</a></h4>

              
                Phage Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) allows for unbiased, proteome-wide autoantibody discovery across a variety of disease settings, with identification of disease-specific autoantigens providing new insight into previously poorly understood forms of immune dysregulation. Despite several successful implementations of PhIP-Seq for autoantigen discovery, including our previous work (Vazquez et al. 2020), current protocols are inherently difficult to scale to accommodate large cohorts of cases and importantly, healthy controls. Here, we develop and validate a high throughput extension of PhIP-seq in various etiologies of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including APS1, IPEX, RAG1/2 deficiency, Kawasaki Disease (KD), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), and finally, mild and severe forms of COVID19. We demonstrate that these scaled datasets enable machine-learning approaches that result in robust prediction of disease status, as well as the ability to detect both known and novel autoantigens, such as PDYN in APS1 patients, and intestinally expressed proteins BEST4 and BTNL8 in IPEX patients. Remarkably, BEST4 antibodies were also found in 2 patients with RAG1/2 deficiency, one of whom had very early onset IBD. Scaled PhIP-Seq examination of both MIS-C and KD demonstrated rare, overlapping antigens, including CGNL1, as well as several strongly enriched putative pneumonia-associated antigens in severe COVID19, including the endosomal protein EEA1. Together, scaled PhIP-Seq provides a valuable tool for broadly assessing both rare and common autoantigen overlap between autoimmune diseases of varying origins and etiologies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Kap-β2/Transportin mediates β-catenin nuclear transport in Wnt signaling</a></h4>

              
                Wnt signaling is essential for many aspects of embryonic development including the formation of the primary embryonic axis. In addition, excessive Wnt signaling drives multiple diseases including cancer highlighting its importance for disease pathogenesis. β-catenin is a key effector in this pathway that translocates into the nucleus and activates Wnt responsive genes. However, due to our lack of understanding of β-catenin nuclear transport, therapeutic modulation of Wnt signaling has been challenging. Here, we took an unconventional approach to address this long-standing question by exploiting a heterologous model system, the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, which contains a conserved nuclear transport machinery. In contrast to prior work, we demonstrate that β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus in a Ran dependent manner, suggesting the use of a nuclear transport receptor (NTR). Indeed, a systematic and conditional inhibition of NTRs revealed that only Kap104, the orthologue of Kap-β2/Transportin-1 (TNPO1), was required for β-catenin nuclear import. We further demonstrate direct binding between TNPO1 and β-catenin that is mediated by a conserved PY-NLS. Finally, using <i>Xenopus</i> secondary axis and TCF/LEF reporter assays, we demonstrate that our results in yeast can be directly translated to vertebrates. By elucidating the NLS in β-catenin and its cognate NTR, our study suggests new therapeutic targets for a host of human diseases caused by excessive Wnt signaling. Indeed, we demonstrate that a small chimeric peptide designed to target TNPO1 can reduce Wnt signaling as a first step towards therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational similarity learning reveals a graded multi-dimensional semantic space in the human anterior temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuro-cognitive models of semantic memory have proposed that the ventral anterior temporal lobes (vATLs) encode a graded, distributed, and multidimensional semantic space--yet neuroimaging studies seeking brain regions that encode semantic structure rarely identify these areas. In computer simulations we show that this discrepancy may arise from limitations of a commonly-used multivariate analysis, and introduce a new approach, representational similarity learning (RSL), that resolves these. We then use RSL to decode semantic structure from ECoG data collected from the vATL cortical surface while participants named line drawings of common items. The results reveal a graded, multi-dimensional semantic space encoded in neural activity across the vATL, which evolves over time and simultaneously expresses both broad and finer-grained semantic structure amongst animate and inanimate concepts. The work thus resolves the apparent discrepancy within the semantic cognition literature and suggests a new approach to discovering representational structure in neural data more generally.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 alter microglial responses and prevent a coordinated glial reaction in ALS</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is an important hallmark in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Experimental evidence has highlighted a role of microglia in the modulation of motor neuron degeneration. However, the exact contribution of microglia to both sporadic and genetic forms of ALS is still unclear. We generated single nuclei profiles of spinal cord and motor cortex from sporadic and C9orf72 ALS patients, as well as controls. We particularly focused on the transcriptomic responses of both microglia and astrocytes. We confirmed that C9orf72 is highly expressed in microglia and shows a diminished expression in carriers of the hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE). This resulted in an impaired response to disease, with specific deficits in phagocytic and lysosomal transcriptional pathways. Astrocytes also displayed a dysregulated response in C9orf72 ALS patients, remaining in a homeostatic state. This suggests that C9orf72 HRE alters a coordinated glial response, which ultimately would increase the risk for developing ALS. Our results indicate that C9orf72 HRE results in a selective microglial loss-of-function, likely impairing microglial-astrocyte communication and preventing a global glial response. This is relevant as it indicates that sporadic and familial forms of ALS may present a different cellular substrate, which is of great importance for patient stratification and treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Model For Hierarchical Memory Storage in Piriform Cortex</a></h4>

              
                How the brain stores and retrieves memories is an important unsolved problem in neuroscience. It is commonly believed that memories are represented in the brain by distinct patterns of neural activity. Attractor dynamics has been proposed as one of the theoretical frameworks for learning and memory in neural networks. However, most of the prior theoretical work typically assumes that the neural network consists of fully-connected, binary neurons and that neuronal representations of memories are uncorrelated. In this paper, we propose a model consisting of continuously varying, rate-based, sparse neural network with a local learning rule which stores correlated patterns organized into multiple uncorrelated classes. We perform analytical calculations to compute maximum storage capacity and basin of attraction. It is found that increasing pattern correlation decreases storage capacity, and increasing the memory load decreases basin of attraction. We also study rate-based and spiking based neural network with separate excitatory and inhibitory populations and tight EI balance. Recent experimental work indicates that piriform cortex exhibits attractor dynamics and possibly stores hierarchically correlated patterns. So, we consider this work as a model for olfactory memory storage.

                Slow cortical oscillations play a crucial role in processing the speech envelope, which is perceived atypically by children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and developmental dyslexia. Here we use electroencephalography (EEG) and natural speech listening paradigms to identify neural processing patterns that characterize dyslexic versus DLD children. Using a story listening paradigm, we show that atypical power dynamics and phase-amplitude coupling between delta and theta oscillations characterize dyslexic and DLD children groups, respectively. We further identify EEG common spatial patterns (CSP) during speech listening across delta, theta and beta oscillations describing dyslexic versus DLD children. A linear classifier using four delta-band CSP variables predicted dyslexia status (0.77 AUC). Crucially, these spatial patterns also identified children with dyslexia in a rhythmic syllable task EEG, suggesting a core developmental deficit in neural processing of speech rhythm. These findings suggest that there are distinct atypical neurocognitive mechanisms underlying dyslexia and DLD.

                Neuronal activity during experience is thought to induce plastic changes within the hippocampal network which underlie memory formation, although the extent and details of such changes in vivo remain unclear. Here, we employed a temporally precise marker of neuronal activity, CaMPARI2, to label active CA1 hippocampal neurons in vivo, followed by immediate acute slice preparation and electrophysiological quantification of synaptic properties. Recently active neurons in the superficial sublayer of stratum pyramidale displayed larger post-synaptic responses at excitatory synapses from area CA3, with no change in pre-synaptic release probability. In contrast, in vivo activity weakened both pre- and post-synaptic excitatory weights onto pyramidal cells in the deep sublayer. In vivo activity of deep and superficial neurons within sharp-wave ripples was bidirectionally changed across experience, consistent with the observed changes in synaptic weights. These findings reveal novel, fundamental mechanisms through which the hippocampal network is modified by experience to store information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-state EEG dynamics help explain differences in response control in ADHD: Insight into electrophysiological mechanisms and sex differences</a></h4>

              
                Reductions in response control (greater reaction time variability and commission error rate) are consistently observed in those diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous research suggests these reductions arise from a dysregulation of large-scale cortical networks. Here, we extended our understanding of this cortical-network/response-control pathway important to the neurobiology of ADHD. First, we assessed how dynamic changes in three resting-state EEG network properties thought to be relevant to ADHD (phase-synchronization, modularity, oscillatory power) covaried with response control during a simple perceptual decision-making task in 112 children/adolescents (aged 8-16) with and without formal ADHD diagnoses. Second, we tested whether these associations differed in males and females who were matched in age, ADHD-status and ADHD- subtype. We found that changes in oscillatory power (as opposed to phase-synchrony and modularity) are most related with response control, and that this relationship is stronger in ADHD compared to controls. Specifically, a tendency to dwell in an electrophysiological state characterized by high alpha/beta power (8-12/13-30Hz) and low delta/theta power (1-3/4-7Hz) supported response control, particularly in those with ADHD. Time in this state might reflect an increased initiation of alpha-suppression mechanisms, recruited by those with ADHD to suppress processing unfavourable to response control. We also found marginally significant evidence that this relationship is stronger in males compared to females, suggesting a distinct etiology for response control in the female presentation of ADHD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Convergent escape behavior from distinct visual processing of impending collision in fish and grasshoppers</a></h4>

              
                In animal species ranging from invertebrate to mammals, visually guided escape behaviors have been studied using looming stimuli, the two-dimensional expanding projection on a screen of an object approaching on a collision course at constant speed. The peak firing rate or membrane potential of neurons responding to looming stimuli often tracks a fixed threshold angular size of the approaching stimulus that contributes to the triggering of escape behaviors. To study whether this result holds more generally, we designed stimuli that simulate acceleration or deceleration over the course of object approach on a collision course. Under these conditions, we found that collision detecting neurons in grasshoppers were sensitive to acceleration whereas the triggering of escape behaviors was less so. In contrast, neurons in goldfish identified indirectly through the characteristic features of the escape behaviors they trigger, showed little sensitivity to acceleration. This closely mirrored a broader lack of sensitivity to acceleration of the goldfish escape behavior. Thus, although the sensory coding of simulated colliding stimuli with non-zero acceleration likely differs in grasshoppers and goldfish, the triggering of escape behaviors converges towards similar characteristics. Approaching stimuli with non-zero acceleration may help refine our understanding of neural computations underlying escape behaviors in a broad range of animal species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinguishing sensitivity to direction and velocity of fast frequency chirps from periodicity tuning in the inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the rabbit inferior colliculus (IC) are selective for the direction of fast frequency chirps (frequency sweeps) contained in Schroeder-Harmonic Complexes (SCHR). This selectivity may point to a feature sensitivity to fast chirp direction and velocity in the IC shared by all mammals. Here, we introduce a novel stimulus consisting of Aperiodic Random Chirps (ARC) to distinguish neurons' sensitivity to chirp direction and velocity from the confounding periodicity of SCHR stimuli. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were made in the IC of five Dutch-belted rabbits. SCHR stimuli were presented at a range of velocities and periodicities. Corresponding ARC stimuli and sinsuoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) noise were also presented. The prevalence of direction selectivity and direction bias of selectivity to chirps in SCHR and ARC responses was quantified, revealing that the majority of IC neurons (90.3%) are selective to chirp direction. Additionally, although this selectivity was biased for negative SCHR chirp directions, neurons with both positive and negative biases for every SCHR and ARC condition were observed. Modulation-transfer-function type was not significantly related to chirp selectivity, but characteristic frequency was related to both the prevalence of direction selectivity and direction bias of chirp responses. Responses to ARC and SAM noise stimuli were used as input to a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict SCHR responses rates, based on the premise that ARC and SAM noise responses correspond to neurons' velocity and periodicity response profiles, respectively. The results of the GLM analysis reveal that velocity-terms represented a substantial percentage of the total explainable variance, over 50% for some neurons. We discuss how chirp direction and velocity sensitivity may have implications for midbrain-level encoding of speech.

                The cortical column is one of the fundamental computational circuits in the brain. In order to understand the role neurons in different layers of this circuit play in cortical function it is necessary to identify the boundaries that separate the laminar compartments. While histological approaches can reveal ground truth they are not a practical means of identifying cortical layers in vivo. The gold standard for identifying laminar compartments in electrophysiological recordings is current-source density (CSD) analysis. However, laminar CSD analysis requires averaging across reliably evoked responses that target the input layer in cortex, which may be difficult to generate in less well studied cortical regions. Further the analysis can be susceptible to noise on individual channels resulting in errors in assigning laminar boundaries. Here, we have analyzed linear array recordings in multiple cortical areas in both the common marmoset and the rhesus macaque. We describe a pattern of laminar spike-field phase relationships that reliably identifies the transition between input and deep layers in cortical recordings from multiple cortical areas in two different non-human primate species. This measure corresponds well to estimates of the location of the input layer using CSDs, but does not require averaging or specific evoked activity. Laminar identity can be estimated rapidly with as little as a minute of ongoing data and is invariant to many experimental parameters. This method may serve to validate CSD measurements that might otherwise be unreliable or to estimate laminar boundaries when other methods are not practical.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-inspired methods for achieving robust computation inheterogeneous mixed-signal neuromorphic processing systems</a></h4>

              
                Neuromorphic processing systems implementing spiking neural networks with mixed signal analog/digital electronic circuits and/or memristive devices represent a promising technology for edge computing applications that require low power, low latency, and that cannot connect to the cloud for off-line processing, either due to lack of connectivity or for privacy concerns. However these circuits are typically noisy and imprecise, because they are affected by device to device variability, and operate with extremely small currents. So achieving reliable computation and high accuracy following this approach is still an open challenge that has hampered progress on one hand and limited widespread adoption of this technology on the other. By construction, these hardware processing systems have many constraints that are biologically plausible, such as heterogeneity and non-negativity of parameters. More and more evidence is showing that applying such constraints to artificial neural networks, including those used in artificial intelligence, promotes robustness in learning and improves their reliability. Here we delve even more in neuroscience and present network-level brain-inspired strategies that further improve reliability and robustness in these neuromorphic systems: we quantify, with chip measurements, to what extent population averaging is effective in reducing variability in neural responses, we demonstrate experimentally how the neural coding strategies of cortical models allow silicon neurons to produce reliable signal representations, and show how to robustly implement essential computational primitives, such as selective amplification, signal restoration, working memory, and relational networks, exploiting such strategies. We argue that these strategies can be instrumental for guiding the design of robust and reliable ultra-low power electronic neural processing systems implemented using noisy and imprecise computing substrates such as subthreshold neuromorphic circuits and emerging memory technologies.

                Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been suggested to be associated with impairment of model-based behavioral control. Meanwhile, recent work suggested shorter memory trace for negative than positive prediction errors (PEs) in OCD. Relation between these two suggestions remains unclear. Based on the properties of cortico-basal ganglia pathways, we modeled human as agent having a combination of successor representation (SR)-based system that enables model-based-like control and individual representation (IR)-based system that only hosts model-free control. We show that if the SR- and IR-based systems learn mainly from positive and negative PEs, respectively, agent can develop obsession-compulsion cycle, similarly to the agent with memory trace imbalance in the previous study. Fitting of behavior of such an opponent SR+IR agent in the two-stage decision task resulted in smaller weights for model-based control than the SR-only agent. These results reconcile the previous suggestions about OCD, raising a possibility that opponent learning in model-based/free controls underlies obsession-compulsion. Moreover, together with a recent suggestion that the opponent SR+IR combination actually performs well in certain dynamic environments and its cortico-striatal implementation appears consistent with various findings, this possibility explains why human is prone to OCD and even healthy people tended to show shorter memory trace for negative PEs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms of masking by Schroeder-phase harmonic tone complexes in the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus)</a></h4>

              
                Schroeder-phase harmonic tone complexes have a flat temporal envelope and either rising or falling instantaneous frequency sweeps within F0 periods, depending on the polarity of the phase-scaling parameter C. Human thresholds for detection of a pure-tone target added to a Schroeder HTC can be 10-15 dB lower for the positive Schroeder (downward-sweeping) compared to negative (upward-sweeping), potentially due to the impulse response of the basilar membrane though this hypothesis remains controversial. Specifically, the upward-gliding impulse response observed empirically in several studies is expected to produce a peakier envelope response for positive Schroeder HTCs, thereby reducing masking compared to negative Schroeder HTCs. Birds provide an interesting animal model for studying Schroeder masking because prior studies suggest less behavioral threshold difference between Schroeder maskers of opposite polarity. However, neurophysiological mechanisms have not been explored and previous behavioral studies mostly used Schroeder HTCs with relatively low F0s. To gain further insight into underlying Schroeder masking mechanisms, we performed operant-conditioning experiments in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a parakeet species, using a wide range of F0 and C values. Awake neurophysiological recordings in the avian inferior colliculus, a major envelope processing station in the midbrain, characterized neural encoding of behavioral test stimuli. Behavioral Schroeder masking thresholds increased with increasing F0 and showed minimal difference between opposite Schroeder polarities for all conditions, similar to prior studies in this and other bird species. Neural recordings showed prominent temporal and average-rate-based encoding of Schroeder F0, and in many neurons, marked response asymmetries between opposite Schroeder polarities. While response bias varied considerably across neurons, average bias of the population shifted from negative to positive with increasing characteristic frequency, with a breakpoint at ~2-3 kHz. Response bias was weakly associated with lower Schroeder-masked tone detection of neurons for the 400-Hz F0 only. These results challenge the common assumption that a peakier masker response results in a lower threshold for target tone detection with this paradigm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Importance of Glutamine in Synaptic Vesicles Revealed by Functional Studies of SLC6A17 and Its Mutations Pathogenic for Intellectual Disability</a></h4>

              
                Human mutations in the gene encoding the solute carrier (SLC) 6A17 caused intellectual disability (ID). The physiological role of SLC6A17 and pathogenesis of Slc6a17-based-ID were both unclear. Here we report learning deficits in SLC6A17 knockout and point mutants. Biochemistry, proteomics and electron microscopy (EM) support SLC6A17 protein localization in synaptic vesicles (SVs). Chemical analysis of SVs by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed glutamine (Gln) in SVs containing SLC6A17. Virally mediated overexpression of SLC6A17 increased Gln in SVs. Either genetic or virally mediated targeting of SLC6A17 reduced Gln in SVs. One ID mutation caused SLC6A17 mislocalization while the other caused defective Gln transport. Multidisciplinary approaches with 7 types of genetically modified mice have uncovered Gln as a new molecule in SVs, established the necessary and sufficient roles of SLC6A17 in Gln transport into SVs, and suggested SV Gln decrease as the key pathogenetic mechanism in human ID.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semantic object processing is modulated by prior scene context</a></h4>

              
                We typically encounter objects in a context, for example, a sofa in a living room or a car in the street, and this context influences how we recognize objects. Objects that are congruent with a scene context are recognised faster and more accurately than objects that are incongruent. Furthermore, objects that are incongruent with a scene elicit a stronger negativity of the N300/N400 EEG component compared to objects that are congruent with the scene. However, exactly how context modulates access to semantic object information is unknown. Here, we used a modelling-based approach with EEG to directly test how context influences the processing of semantic object information. Using representational similarity analysis, we first asked whether EEG patterns dissociated objects in congruent or incongruent scenes, finding that representational differences between the conditions emerged towards 300 ms. Next, we tested the relationship between EEG patterns and a semantic model based on property norms, revealing that the processing of semantic information for both conditions started around 150 ms, while after around 275 ms, semantic effects were stronger and lasted longer for objects in incongruent scenes compared to objects in congruent scenes. The timing of these effects overlapped with known N300/N400, suggesting previous congruency effects might be explained by differences in processing semantic object information. This suggests that scene contexts can provide a prior expectation about what kind of objects could appear, which might allow for more efficient semantic processing if the object is congruent with the scene, and extended semantic effects for incongruent objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A non-human primate model with Alzheimer's disease-like pathology induced by hippocampal overexpression of human tau</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most burdening diseases of the century with no disease-modifying treatment yet. Non-human primates (NHPs) share genetic, anatomical and physiological similarities with humans, making them an ideal model for investigating the pathogenesis and therapeutics of AD. However, the applications of NHPs in AD research have been hindered by the paucity of spontaneous or induced monkey models for AD due to their long generation time, ethical considerations and technical challenges in making genetically modified monkeys. Here we developed an AD-like NHP model by overexpressing human tau in bilateral hippocampi of adult rhesus macaque monkeys. We evaluated the pathological features of these monkeys with immunostaining, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and behavioral tests. We demonstrated that after hippocampal overexpression of human tau, the rhesus macaque monkeys displayed multiple pathological features of AD, including neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuronal loss, hippocampal atrophy, neuroinflammation, A{beta} clearance deficit, blood vessel damage and cognitive decline. This work establishes a human tau-induced AD-like NHP model that may facilitate mechanistic studies and therapeutic treatments for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of sensorineural hearing loss on formant-frequency discrimination: Measurements and models</a></h4>

              
                In the response of the healthy ear to a harmonic sound, auditory-nerve rate functions fluctuate at the fundamental frequency, f0. The amplitude of these fluctuations varies along the tonotopic axis. Neural fluctuation (NF) amplitudes encode spectral peaks, including formant frequencies of vowels, because responses of inner-hair-cells (IHCs) tuned near spectral peaks are captured (or dominated) by a single harmonic, resulting in lower fluctuation amplitudes than responses of IHCs tuned between spectral peaks. This NF code is robust across a wide range of sound levels and in background noise. The NF profile is converted into a rate-place representation in the auditory midbrain, wherein neurons are sensitive to low-frequency fluctuations. The NF code is vulnerable to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) because capture depends upon saturation of IHCs, and thus the interaction of cochlear gain with IHC transduction. In this study, formant-frequency discrimination limens (DLFFs) were estimated for listeners with normal hearing or mild to moderate SNHL. The difficulty of the task was modulated by varying formant bandwidth to modulate the contrast in the NF profile. The formants were either aligned with harmonic frequencies or placed between harmonics. Formant frequencies were 600 and 2000 Hz, in the range of first and second formants of several vowels. Results were compared to predictions from model auditory-nerve (AN) and inferior colliculus (IC) neurons, with listeners audiograms used to individualize the AN model. Correlations between DLFFs, audiometric thresholds near the formant frequencies, age, and scores on the Quick speech-in-noise test are reported. SNHL had a strong effect on DLFF for the second formant frequency (F2), but relatively small effect on DLFF for the first formant. The IC model provided good predictions of elevated listener thresholds to F2 as a function of SNHL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Approaching object acceleration differentially affects the predictions of neuronal collision-avoidance models</a></h4>

              
                The processing of visual information for collision avoidance has been investigated at the biophysical level in several model systems. In grasshoppers, the {eta} model captures reasonably well the visual processing performed by an identified neuron called the lobular giant movement detector (LGMD) as it tracks approaching objects. Similar phenomenological models have been used to describe either the firing rate or the membrane potential of neurons responsible for visually-guided collision avoidance in other animals. In goldfish, the {kappa} model has been proposed to describe the Mauthner cell, an identified neuron involved in startle escape responses. In the vinegar fly, a third model was developed for the giant fiber neuron, which trigger last resort escapes immediately before an impending collision. One key property of these models is their prediction that peak neuronal responses occur a fixed delay after the simulated approaching object reaches a threshold angular size on the retina. This prediction is valid for simulated objects approaching at a constant speed. We tested whether it remains valid when approaching objects accelerate. After characterizing and comparing the models' responses to accelerating and constant speed stimuli, we find that the prediction holds true for the {kappa} and the giant fiber model, but not for the {eta} model. These results suggest that acceleration in the approach trajectory of an object may help distinguish and further constrain the neuronal computations required for collision avoidance in grasshoppers, fish, and vinegar flies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different integration of conflicting motion signals in perception and eye movements during object tracking</a></h4>

              
                The processing of visual motion signals is pivotal to accurate sensorimotor control: to successfully intercept an object in motion the brain needs to take into account the object's velocity together with neural and motor delays. Here we test the effect of a target's motion on perception, saccade, and pursuit responses, collecting all three measures together on each trial. Motion information may have different effects on these three processes (Simoncini et al., 2012; Spering et al., 2011). Our comparison across the three different systems make use of a moving target that contains a second motion signal unrelated to its displacement (the double-drift stimulus). We presented peripheral moving apertures filled with noise that either drifted orthogonally to the aperture's direction, dramatically affecting its perceived direction of motion (Tse and Hsieh, 2006; Lisi and Cavanagh, 2015; Shapiro et al., 2010), or that varied dynamically with no net motion. Participants were asked to saccade to and track these targets with their gaze as soon as they appeared (Rashbass, 1961) and then to report their direction. In the trials with internal motion, the target disappeared at saccade onset so that the first 100 ms or so of the post-saccadic pursuit response was driven uniquely by peripheral information gathered before saccade onset. This provided independent measures of perceptual, pursuit and saccadic responses to the double-drift stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis. There was nevertheless a strong dissociation between saccadic responses on one hand and and perceptual and pursuit responses on the other. We conclude that the dissociation between perception and saccadic eye movements in the localization of moving objects (Lisi and Cavanagh, 2015) does not involve different processing of motion signals but rather a difference in how motion signals are combined with target position.
